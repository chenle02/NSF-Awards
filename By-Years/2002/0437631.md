This study will advance current knowledge of the relationship between
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) directors and
university administrators by investigating mutual leadership processes, a
largely ignored area of inquiry in I/UCRC research. The research will also
contribute to the research literature on leadership because of its focus on
research center directors and university administrators, a subject population
often neglected by leadership researchers.
