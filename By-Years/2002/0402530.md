0402530 Suki The main goals of this proposal are a) to develop a coherent
technology that allows the assessment of the detailed physiological functioning
as well as the structure of the mouse lung in a noninvasive manner, and b) to
invoke these technologies to advance fundamental relations between molecular
processes altering tissue composition of the emphysematous lung and degradation
in function. The specific aims are: 1) To develop a method to assess and relate
the structure and function of the mouse lung in a non-invasive manner. 2) To
test the methods in normal, fibrotic and emphysematous lungs following
pharmacological interventions. 3) To track, on an individual basis, the
alterations in structure and function in a genetically modified mouse strain
that develops spontaneous emphysema.
