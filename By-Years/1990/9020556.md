Research necessary to develop a scanning tomographic acoustic microscope (STAM)
will be conducted. The long-range objective of this work is to develop a
practical prototype, fully capable of providing unambiguous cross-sectional
images of the structure beneath the surface of macroscopic three-dimensional
objects. A principal task is to employ parts from an existing microscope, the
scanning laser acoustic microscope (SLAM), in synthesizing STAM. Building on our
previous experience, this research will start by mechanically modifying the
present STAM system. Its geometry would be altered so that it would use a fixed
multi-transducer system which would improve its capability for acquiring precise
data. Once this has been done, we will formulate and test the necessary new
reconstruction algorithms and carry out other phases of the work still needed to
fully complete the long-range objective.
