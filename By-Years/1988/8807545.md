Lasers afford the chemist with a delicate probe for such diverse studies as
obtaining extremely hih-resolution spectra of molecular beams, studying the
dynamics of molecular motions in electronically excited states and studying how
DNA's respond to ultraviolet light. The Department of Chemistry of the
University of Washington will use this award, joint-funded by the Chemistry
Shared Instrumentation Program and the Instrumentation and Instrumentation
Development Program, to help acquire laser instrumentation for a high-resolution
spectroscopy facility. The areas of research that will be enhanced by the
acquisition include: 1) Structures and decay dynamics of van der Waals clusters
2) Vibrations and band-shapes of H-bonded clusters of different size 3)
Photodissociation pathways of small clusters 4) State-selected scattering
studies 5) Spectroscopy of non-stationary states of molecules on bound and
unbound potential surfaces 6) Dynamic light scattering of supercoiled DNAs using
ultraviolet light.
