This project provides equipment needed to create a complete research
environment as a training model within the Genetic Engineering Technology
Program. This strong new program is designed to provide the conceptual and
technical background needed for women to become leaders in professional fields
based on modern biological research. The research environment permits training
in the use of recombinant DNA techniques, DNA sequencing, and monoclonal
antibodies, while teaching central concepts of molecular biology. Student
research projects extend the use of relevant techniques to areas of active
research, while developing self-confidence and independent thinking in women
majoring in biology. The equipment (fluorescence microscope, chromatography
cabinet, ultralow freezer, data acquisition computer and benchtop centrifuge)
extends a successful curriculum and is housed in a new facility. With it,
undergraduates can conduct research in the area of immunodiagnostics that is of
potentially publishable quality, lending greatly increased credibility to the
training. The grantee institution is matching the NSF award with an equal sum
obtained from non-Federal sources.
