This project involves a cultural anthropologist from the University of Arizona
studying how Finnish society, which displays a marked egalitarian style of
gender relations, deals with conflict and aggression. The project hypothesizes
that egalitarian male-female relations have less physical and verbal aggression
and more discussion, negotiation, and problem-solving than more unequal
relationships, while in male-dominant relationships, the women is hypothesized
to engage in more indirect aggression towards to the man than in female-
dominated or egalitarian relationships. The project will use a combination of
qualitative, ethnographic methods including participant-observation and
informal, conversational interviews on conflict, semi-structured interviews or
laypersons and experts about conflict resolution patterns and egalitarianism.
This study should provide practical information as well as advance our
understanding of the role of gender inequality in conflict and aggression.
