The objective of this project is to develop a new form of designer system for
modeling discrete products which is capable of capturing the designer's
intentions and all necessary life-cycle considerations for a product. The
product modeler should also be capable of propagating the intentions as part of
the product information to the manufacturing planning systems using domain
specific life-cycle issues as constraints in evaluating the design and thus
assuring concurrency of evaluation for life-cycle issues of the product during
the design process. This system will have a general framework for all discrete
product domains but will be developed domain by domain in a progression from
sheet metal fabrication, to assembly, to machining etc. Finally, process
planning modules (and other tractable non- company specific planning systems)
will be added for each domain providing for a complete design and planning
system.
