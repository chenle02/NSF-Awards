The Astronomical Society of the Pacific (ASP) will develop and test a new model
of informal science education professional development to help small museums
increase the public's knowledge and interest in astronomy. The lead
collaborators in addition to ASP are the National Optical Astronomy Observatory
(NOAO) and the Association of Science Technology Centers (ASTC). The project
deliverables include 1) workshops for approximately 240 informal science
education (ISE) practitioners in 180 small ISE institutions delivered both on-
site and through distance learning 2) hands-on astronomy activity toolkits and
3) an on-going "community of practice" network. The project development team
includes representatives from small ISE institutions (Randall Museum, CA;
Lakeview Museum of Arts and Science, IL; Stamford Museum &amp; Nature Center,
CT) as well as others. This project has the potential for making a strategic
impact on the ISE field with its research on the use of distance learning
compared to on-site professional development workshops&lt;br/&gt;
