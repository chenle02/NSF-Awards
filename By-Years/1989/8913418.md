Dr. Perry will use this grant to complete an observational study of the dust
component of the interstellar medium in the neighborhood of the Sun. This study
concentrates on stars accessible from the Southern Hemisphere. The results will
complete the coverage of the spatial distribution of the interstellar reddening
in the solar neighborhood, as similar data for stars in the Northern Hemisphere
have already been analyzed. Although cosmic dust may comprise only one percent
of the interstellar medium, its presence has a pronounced effect on astronomical
observations because it is a wavelength dependent absorber of radiation from
stars. It is essential, therefore, in many astronomical studies to correct for
this reddening effect for any direction in space and at various distances from
the Sun. Dr. Perry's aim is to provide reliable information on which astronomers
can make a reddening correction.
