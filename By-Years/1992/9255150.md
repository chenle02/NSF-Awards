The goals of the Research Career for Minority Scholars (RCMS) program are to
attract and retain minority students who have the potential to do above average
work in the fields of chemistry and physics, and to give these students the
motivation, training and opportunity to continue their studies in chemistry and
physics at the advanced degree level. To meet these goals, a recruitment,
training, mentoring and monitoring program will be established. The Program
Director (PD) will have overall responsibility for meeting the goals of the
program with the assistance of the participating faculty.
