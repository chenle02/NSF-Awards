The first three enzymatic steps in the de novo synthesis of pyrimidines
(carbamyl phosphate synthetase II, aspartate transcarbamylase, dihydroorotase)
are the same in all cells, whether prokaryotic or eukaryotic. The structure,
organization, and regulation of these three enzymatic activities and their
respective genes vary among species. In bacteria, each enzyme activity is
associated with a separate protein. In mammals, they are found together in a
single translation product of 240,000 daltons called CAD. By placing portions of
hamster CAD cDNA into expression vectors, one can attempt to complement E. coli
and hamster cell mutants defective in each of the three enzyme activities. This
avenue of experimentation allows one (i) identify the minimum genetic
information encoding each domain, (ii) to learn pyrimidine metabolism is
affected when specific mutations are introduced that eliminate allosteric
regulation of CAD or alter activity of one of its enzymes and (iii) to gain
insight into the roles of the bridging sequences that link the enzymatic
domains. Combining the approaches of molecular biology, genetics, and
biochemistry should provide insight about the structure, function and evolution
of a multifunctional protein that plays a key role in an important biosynthetic
pathway.
