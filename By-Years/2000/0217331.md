This award is to support research that will develop a 400,000 year record of
wet-dry conditions from the northern Andes using a multiproxy analysis of
sediments accumulated in the Caribbean Sea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ocean Drilling
Program (ODP) Site 999 is located over the delta of the Magdalena River and
receives terrestrial sediment from the northern Andes. Analysis of foraminifers,
dynoflagellates, charcoal, and stable isotopes of carbon and oxygen will allow
reconstruction of moisture balance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of
this proposed research are that it will lead to a better understanding of
tropical climate conditions during glacials and provide baseline information on
the movement of the inter-tropical convergence zone during the Quaternary.
Ultimately, data generated by this research will be used to improve model
predictions of changes in the terrestrial carbon reservoir.
