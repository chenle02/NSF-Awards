This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;John Tully of Yale University is
supported by an award from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program
within the Division of Chemistry to engage in research to advance our atomic-
level understanding of dynamical processes in large molecules, at solid surfaces
and in the condensed phase. The program develops new theoretical and
computational methods, and applies them to elucidate chemical behavior in
complex systems of active current interest. Ring polymer path integral theory is
used to introduce quantum mechanics into the next generation of molecular
dynamics simulation techniques, including processes that occurs on multiple
potential energy surfaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research is having a broad
impact on many important areas of science including photochemistry, catalysis,
materials processing and biology. Women, members of under-represented minority
gruops and undergradutes are actively involved in this research program.
