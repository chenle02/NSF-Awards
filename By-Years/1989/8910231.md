This dissertation research project will allow a cultural anthropology student
to study the expression of emotions among women in a Brazilian village. The
student will interview women, particularly healers and their patients, using a
combination of methods including in-depth interviews, participant observation,
and structured tests. The results will include a model of the healers' system
for classifying emotionally-based disorders, and increased understanding of the
theoretical relationship between gender, social structure, and emotions. This
research is important because there are few comparative studies of the
expression of emotion. The student's project will help us understand how
expressions of emotion by individuals in local "face-to-face" communities in
Brazil are influenced by social interaction and norms. Any cross-cultural
interaction involves emotional expressions, and increased understanding of the
cultural rules governing this expression will help facilitate cross-cultural
communication.
