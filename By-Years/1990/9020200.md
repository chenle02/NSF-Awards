Natural populations which have been surveyed exhibit large amounts of genetic
diversity, i.e., differences in the genetic makeup between individuals. This
variability allows the population to respond to a changing environment.
Variability is crucial to a population because it allows a population to evolve.
Differences in the environment through time and space are thought to be two
primary factors maintaining this genetic variability. Spatial heterogeneity is
common in a range of environments and has been shown to support genetic
variability. Particular individuals are often better adapted to their
microenvironment, thus the population as a whole is comprised of many
individuals adapted to slightly different environments. The investigators will
experimentally test if individuals of a population are better adapted to
particular seasons. By determining whether individuals grow and reproduce better
at different times within the year, they can test the notion that temporal as
well as spatial differences in the environment are important in maintaining
genetic diversity. No experiments using plants have explicitly tested the
importance of environmental differences among seasons or years. In addition to
understanding underlying mechanisms supporting genetic diversity, knowledge of
the seasonality of plant populations may be of practical benefit. Efficacy of
herbicide applications, for example, is partially a function of when during the
plant life-cycle an herbicide is applied. Additionally, if a population
represents an array of genotypes adapted to different seasons, particular
individuals or populations may have the ability to persist in or be "preadapted"
to an altered environment. A population's response to a global environmental
change such as warming maybe predicted. Predictions of extinction or genetic
change by populations may then be used to examine potential shifts in species
composition of communities and ecosystems.
