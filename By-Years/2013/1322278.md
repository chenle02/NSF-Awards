This project investigates how activity-trace information can be used to enhance
social transparency in online peer-production communities, in order to support
learning and knowledge sharing. Specifically, we examine whether capturing and
broadcasting the actions that individuals take on electronic artifacts can
support process learning about how to do a task. We conduct a series of design
experiments to explore how peer access to various types of activity-trace data
affects knowledge sharing. Our goal is to identify how transparent environments
can be designed to capture knowledge as a side effect of peer production
activity. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Social technology is radically changing the
nature of work. Organizations now recognize the value of social technology for
increasing access to a broad range of participants but struggle with how to
incorporate this technology into work environments. This project examines how
"social transparency" -- visibility of others' actions on shared artifacts --
can be used to improve coordination and knowledge sharing in virtual
organizations. Results will inform the design of online work environments that
support professional skill development alongside collaborative peer-production
activities. The project will also inform educational technology design and
policy, by analyzing, predicting and explaining learning in an online community.
To enhance the project's broader impact, the research team will foster dialogue
with the technical community entrusted with designing online peer-production
environments, to ensure that these systems support effective learning and
knowledge exchange.
