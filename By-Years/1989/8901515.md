It is proposed to continue joint theoretical and experimental studies of the
cross sections for low energy electron-molecule collisions. Such cross sections
play an important role in our understanding and modeling of both fundamental and
technologically significant processes. Specific objectives of this effort
include: (1) cross sections for excitation of electronic transitions in carbon
monoxide, oxygen and nitrogen, (2) theoretical studies of electron impact
excitation of carbon dioxide and water, (3) theoretical studies of vibrational
excitation of water and carbon dioxide, and (4) cross sections for elastic
scattering of electrons.
