This CAREER proposal seeks funding for a new line of Astroparticle Physics
activities at the Enrico Fermi Institute at the University of Chicago. The
emphasis is on developing detectors to search for dark matter candidates, such
as Weakly Interacting Massive Particles. The proposed R&amp;D studies will
include detectors based on superheated liquids, adaptations of new gas detector
technologies to non-accelerator experiments and a geochemical search for heavily
ionizing particles. The common theme is high background-rejection ability, low-
threshold, versatility and simplicity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The detector
technologies that will result from the work described here have many
applications closer to Earth than the hypothetical particles for which they are
designed: national security, environmental science, radioprotection and medical
imaging, to mention a few.&lt;br/&gt;
