The interaction of high energy femtosecond through picosecond laser pulses with
solid targets provides a bright source of incoherent soft X-rays. In this
Engineering Research Equipment Grant, two experiments are described which employ
the interaction of energetic femtosecond through 100 ps pulses with solid
targets. These experiments require the use of soft X-ray spectrometer (~10-400A
range) to monitor the hot plasma emission. The first experiment has as its aim
the efficient and high average power generation of 0.1-1 KeV X-rays for eventual
application to soft X-ray lithography. By preparing appropriately shaped and
sized short plasma density scalelengths and adjusting the input polarization,
pulse length, and incidence angle of a short laser pulse of ~2-20 mJ energy, the
generation of 0.1-1 KeV X-rays with at least 10% efficiency is expected. This
will provide a proof-of-principle for scaling to very high repetition rate laser
systems. A second use for the spectrometer will be the monitoring of soft X-ray
emission from femtosecond laser-produced plasmas. This has applications in the
production of an ultrashort pulse X- ray source and in the study of the unique,
high-density, non-ideal plasmas produced in the interaction.
