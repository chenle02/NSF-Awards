Research will be carried out aimed at improving usability of the Electronic
Preprint Archive, a web-based, interactive repository of over 250,000 full text
articles in physics and related disciplines used heavily by these communities,
and, increasingly, serving as a model for such systems and libraries in other
fields of science and engineering in the U.S. and abroad. For this purpose, the
structure of the archive will be explored using document content data, citation
tree data, and usage data. Automatic text classification and document clustering
techniques will be developed and used for cleaning, building, and maintaining
the subject classification structure. Usage data logs will be used to mine for
functional improvements to the Archive. Burst analysis of words in document
titles will be used to map trends and, together with citation data, to visualize
and navigate the literature. This work will provide new tools useful for
continued development of open access systems starting to be used as research
libraries in a number of fields, including medicine.
