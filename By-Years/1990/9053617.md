Courseware is being developed for a self-paced course on modern electronic
instrumentation and computerized data acquisition. This course is aimed at lower
division students from all engineering disciplines as a lead-in to their
discipline oriented laboratory courses. All of the course instruction is
computer-based; students work individually with laboratory equipment, guided by
the computer program. A library of modules is supplied allowing faculty to adapt
the courseware to the specific hardware available in their laboratories. The
first phase of the development is already complete and the resulting courseware
has been successful used in two courses at Stanford. This project extends the
coverage of the existing courseware, refines the courseware adding, in
particular, more direct testing of the student by the computer, and develops the
library of modules specific to hardware not presently used in Stanford
laboratories. Finally, a workshop is to be held to introduce the courseware to
engineering faculty at other universities and to develop a team of collaborators
for further refinements.
