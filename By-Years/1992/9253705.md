This research involves computer architecture, compilation, and operating
systems work focused on broad application of massively parallel computing. The
approach is to identify minimal architectural changes and aggressively push
compilation techniques to handle asynchronous communication and scheduling for
parallel languages. Current demonstration of methods include compilation of Id90
for conventional architectures plus active messages.
