This is a cooperative projects with the United Kingdom to perform a controlled
source electromagnetic experiment on the East Pacific Rise at 9.5 N. The U.S.
group will add four 9 m antennas to the four receivers supplied by british. The
U.S. group will participate in the cruise and in the data interpretation. The
U.S. participation will double the data obtained and thus allow better
interpretation. Electromagnetic measurements are a developing technique that has
great potential because it can provide information on porosity and thermal
structure of the crust that is unavailable by other means. This is the first
experiment to be done at a mid-ocean ridge and the possibility of detecting and
defining a mid-ocean ridge magma chamber is exciting. It is a pioneering
experiment, and the results should help determine the future direction of the
field.
