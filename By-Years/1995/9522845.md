9522845 Ziegert A new design concept for coordinate measuring machines uses a
novel parallel kinematic structure that provides five degrees of freedom for
orientating the measurement probe. The structure is a hexahedron formed from two
tetarahedra that share a common base. The six legs of the device are telescoping
tubes that incorporate laser ball bars to measure their extension, held together
by spherical magnetic joints. The redundancy of six measurements for five
degrees of freedom positioning will be used for calibration and compensation for
the thermal environment. The hexahedron design also promises lower mass, which
means improved dynamic performance. The research issues are: assessing the
accuracy and thermal stability of the structure formed by the links and magnetic
joints, the actuation and delivery of laser beams for metrology through
evacuated or helium filled tubes, and control and dynamic performance tests.
Using self-compensation to make it thermally insensitive, this design can be
moved out of temperature controlled rooms to the factory floor. Lower mass
improves the dynamic response, so measurements can be made faster, lowering
inspection cost. Taken together, the impact of this project will be faster
feedback on dimensional attributes of mechanical parts at the process, speeding
up process improvements. ***
