9317395 Janecke This project will test the theory that in Eocene and Oligocene
times there was a fundamental tectonic boundary, between what is how SW Montana
and east-central Idaho, in the form of a narrow, N- trending half-graben.
Structural and stratigraphic analyses of the half-graben and its sedimentary
fill combined 40Ar\39Ar geochronology will ascertain the regional extent of the
structure (s) and whether or not they formed due to fraintational collapse of
previously thickened crust in the Sevier orogenic belt. The results will have
wide application to the evolution of orogenic systems world-wide ***
