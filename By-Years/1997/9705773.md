9705773 McDowell A number of important tectonic features of the southwestern
United States extend into Mexico, however these become buried under the vast
igneous province of the Sierra Madre Occidental. These features include the
southern extent of the North American craton, a late proterozoic rifted margin,
younger juvenile crust and the southeastward continuation of the Mojave-Sonora
megashear. Several recent tectonic syntheses reconstructing plate positions
between south and north America require knowledge of the location of these
features now covered by volcanics to discriminate between models. The project
will utilize isotopic contamination of the younger volcanics as an indicator of
the character of the wall rocks during magma ascent. Results should help to
better locate important tectonic boundaries and other features, now inaccessible
under the thick volcanics pile.
