Students and faculty are using computer equipped classrooms and laboratories to
increase the students' understanding of concepts in calculus and several upper
division mathematics courses. Existing facilities were augmented by the addition
of five Macintosh IIs and three Sun 3/60 workstations, all of which will run
Mathematica and several other software tools. Students are acquiring experience
in using the tools that industry and business expect them to employ. The College
will provide funds matching the award.
