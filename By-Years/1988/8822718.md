The linear polarization of the centimeter-wave length radiation from active
galactic nuclei (AGN) will be studied at the smallest angular scales. This will
be accomplished with the technique of polarization-sensitive Very Long Baseline
Interferometry ("polarization VLBI"), whereby the linear polarization structure
of compact radio sources may be determined on angular scales of milliarcseconds.
At the distance of AGN, this corresponds to physical scales of light years. The
linear polarization tells us about the magnetic field structure, radiation
mechanisms, particle content, kinematics, and geometry of AGNs, which will help
us understand their structure and evolution. The ultimate goal of this work is
to elaborate the mechanism that lies at the heart of AGNs, currently thought to
be accretion of material onto massive black holes.
