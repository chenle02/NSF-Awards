The proposed work will test the ideas about how oceanic lithosphere deforms as
it enters the subduction zone and how its composition affects the magmatism of
the adjacent volcanic arc. The investigators will undertake a magnetic and
multibeam bathymetric survey and dredge rock samples from the outer bulge of
Tonga-Kermadec Trench for geomorphological and geochemical analyses,
respectively. This will allow them to sample young exposures of old oceanic
crust rpoduced by faulting and study the sample young exposures of old oceanic
crust produced by faulting and study the Mesozoic deformation. A 2000-km long
and 80 km wide strip will be mapped by Seabeam 2000 and ca 20-30 dredge samples
will be collected.
