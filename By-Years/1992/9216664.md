This award supports international collaboration between Dr. Bruce Averill, Dr.
Patricia Eldredge of the University of Virginia, and Professor Xu Jiqing of
Jilin University on iron and molybdeum compounds related to the FeMo cofactor of
nitrogenase. Under this award, the principal investigators from China and the US
will work together on developing synthetic analogs of FeMo-co, the structure of
which remains enigmatic. This collaboration will allow Professor Xu to combine
his theoretical and mechanistic approach with Professor Averill's expertise in
synthesis and characterization. The U.S.-China Program supports collaborative
research of mutual benefit to the US and China.
