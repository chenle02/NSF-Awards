This collaborative project integrates key aspects of cytology, physiology, and
biochemistry to resolve a major problem in developmental biology: explaining the
most fundamental growth process in fungi -- apical growth of hyphae. Hyphae
elongate by a complex mechanism involving movement of wall-building vesicles to
the apex. In higher fungi, vesicles assemble in the hyphal tip to form a unique
complex called the Spitzenkorper. The Spitzenkorper is suspected of playing a
central role in apical growth, but its exact function and mechanisms controlling
its action remain unknown. By correlation video-enhanced light microscopy of
growing cells, electron microscopy, cytochemistry, and immunocytochemistry, the
research will characterize Spitzenkorper organization and behavior.
Characterization of apical vesicles will allow determination of their
biochemical roles in cell growth. Developmental mutants will be used to
correlate Spitzenkorper behavior with hyphal growth and provide clues concerning
the control of polarity and apical growth. //
