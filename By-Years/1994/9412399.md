9412399 Payne Brood parasitic birds lay their eggs in the nest of other
species, the fosters, which rear their young; the parasite birds do not rear
their own young. In the African finches, field work suggests that adult
parasites copy the song of the birds that rear them, and females mate with males
with songs like their own foster parents. This style of behavior may have led to
new races and species. The project tests these ideas with behavior experiments,
field work, and molecular genetics to compare the evolutionary history of the
parasites and their foster species. In experiments, the parasites will lay in
aviaries in their normal fosters' nest. The eggs will be moved to a new foster
species, and the young will be reared by this foster. Then the behavior of the
adult parasites will be tested to determine if males sing the song of the bird
that reared them, and females prefer males that sing like their foster father.
The experiment recreates the conditions when the parasite switches to a new
foster species, at the beginning of a cultural speciation event. This is a novel
model of the origin of species in birds. In the field in Africa, young parasites
will be photographed to test how similar they are in appearance as begging young
to their fosters' young, which have bright mouth colors. Morphology and genetics
will be tested for evidence of a past switch of foster species in natural
condition. Molecular genetics of adults and of young finches will be compared
for the gene histories of the species of brood parasites and their foster
species group, to test whether the parasites evolved along with their old foster
species, or switched from old to new foster species.
