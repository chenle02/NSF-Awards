With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) and
support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program (CRIF), Professor
Robert Houser from the University of Northern Colorado and colleagues Robin
Macaluso and Michael Mosher will acquire an X-ray diffractometer. In general, an
X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three-
dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and
provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of a molecule
relative to neighboring molecules. The studies described here will impact a
number of areas, including organic and inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry
and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well
as research and research training of chemistry and physics students as well as
high school teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award is aimed at enhancing
research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) exploring
rare-earth magnetic intermetallic compounds; (b) investigating the redox
chemistry of thioether amide ligands with copper(II); (c) developing
G-quadruplex ligands; (d) synthesizing and characterizing non-traditional
semiconductor thermoelectric and photovoltaic materials; and (e) detecting
fluorescence of biomolecules.
