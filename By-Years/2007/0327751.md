Abstract 0213686, Harry Yeh, U. of Washington "International Travel Grant to
Support U.S. Involvement in HAZARDS-2002"

This action provides support for U.S. participation in the international
symposium HAZARD-2002, to be held in Antalya, Turkey, October 2002. The
symposium is organized biennially by the Natural Hazards Society, and presents a
wide range of state-of-the-art natural hazards mitigation strategies, from
fundamental understanding of the phenomena to evacuation planning. The topics
include meteorological hazards such as hurricanes, typhoons, cyclones,
tornadoes, fires, droughts; geological hazards, including earthquakes,
landslides, and volcanic eruptions; hydrological and marine hazards, for example
tsunamis, storm surges, floods, sea-level rise, and marine biological hazards;
and technological hazards, including air and water pollution. The participants
supported by this award include key persons as well as junior members of the
U.S. natural hazards research community. Their participation at this symposium
is critical for fostering cooperative research efforts. Research in natural
hazards, and in particular tsunami research, has become increasingly
international in its focus. Strong international cooperation is necessary since
tsunamis, for example, can affect not only the region near the source but also
distant regions through propagation across oceans. Findings from this symposium
will be disseminated to U.S. researchers in natural hazards.
