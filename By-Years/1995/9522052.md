The relationships between populations of a species, and between closely related
species, have often been estimated through the analysis of mitochondrial DNA
(mtDNA). This study will test a key assumption on which conclusions from past
mitochondrial DNA based phylogenies have rested. The assumption is that the
amount of mtDNA variation across an entire species is negligible. This
assumption is critical to the reconstruction of phylogenies and the
interpretation of evolutionary histories, especially those of primates. Contrary
to this assumption, within the female philopatric macaques, significant mtDNA
variation exists within the same species. Unlike macaques, leaf monkeys exhibit
female dispersal. Additionally, there are species within each genus that have
similar geographic distributions. Through mtDNA analysis of two such species in
each genus, we propose to: (1) examine the effects of female dispersal on
distributions of mtDNA diversity (geography held constant); (2) assess the
effects of geographic distribution on mitochondrial genetic structure within
each genus (female dispersal held constant); and (3) determine whether the
'macaque' model of mtDNA population structure can be broadly applied to other
higher primates. Hence, a mtDNA analysis of selected macaque and leaf monkey
species pairs provides a naturally controlled situation in which to examine the
effects of female dispersal on population structure based on maternally
inherited mtDNA. This study uniquely examines the relationship between social
organization and the dynamics of mtDNA evolution in higher primates. The
information obtained will be crucial to recognizing limitations of mtDNA
analysis for inferring primate phylogenies and evolutionary histories.
