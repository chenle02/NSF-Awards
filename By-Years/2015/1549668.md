The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to reduce the cost of RF hardware, enabling
wider adoption of new generations of mobile devices and services for Internet of
Things applications. The project has the potential to help transform a number of
sectors, including medicine and healthcare monitoring and diagnostics,
transportation safety and infrastructure, air and water quality monitoring, and
disaster warning and recovery efforts, particularly where wired infrastructure
is inadequate or non-existent. The project will potentially remove design
constraints for hardware developers seeking to directly incorporate RF
tunability within their products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business
Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses a persistent materials
selection and processing challenge. Currently available families of functional
materials typically require high-temperature processing and cannot be
incorporated directly within the manufacturing of electronic devices for mobile
communications, preventing facile and highly efficient tuning of frequencies. In
this project, well-integrated multi-scale materials design, simulation, film
growth, scalable processing and properties measurements will be employed to
produce and optimize the performance of new tunable dielectric materials. The
project will result in high-performance, manufacturing process-compatible
tunable devices incorporating a new dielectric film material obtained through a
much lower-temperature.
