Large-scale data analytics is essential to the National Strategic Computing
Initiative (NSCI) and NSF's scientific discovery mission. Data-intensive
supercomputing applications are increasingly important for handling high-
performance computing workloads. However, current benchmarks and performance
metrics do not provide useful information on suitability of computing systems
for data-intensive applications. This project will develop a new benchmark that
can be used to assess the performance of new system implementations aimed at
this important class of applications.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The research effort
will produce a new Stream500 benchmark, complementary to Graph500, that
replicates streaming analytics workload. The current benchmark capabilities will
be expanded by enabling the exiting web-based infrastructure to accept
submissions for multiple benchmarks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
