The gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor (GABA receptor) is a protein which helps
regulate communications between nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord by
regulating the movement of ions across the nerve cell membranes and controlling
excitability of nerve cells. To understand how this receptor functions it is
essential to know its three-dimensional structure. This can be determined with
the use of the electron microscope. To learn the number of subunits which
combine to form the GABA receptor structure and should give us additional
insights into how the GABA receptor is able to regulate neuronal communication.
Also, identifying the sites on the GABA receptor where benzodiazepines and GABA
bind, using chemical labeling methods, will lead to an understanding of the
function of the receptor in nervous system function and behavior.
