This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will allow the
Department of Chemistry at Pennsylvania State University at University Park to
acquire a mini-super class computer system. The research studies to be performed
include the following: Protein Crystal Structures, Molecular Dynamics
Simulations of Solvation, Quantum Chemistry by Random Walk, Computer Simulation
of Macromolecular Structure and Function, Molecular Dynamics Simulations of
Surface Reactions, Simulations of Molecular Liquids and Physisorbed Layers and
Computer-Assisted Studies of Structure-Property and Structure-Activity
Relationships Using the ADAPT computer software system. The computational
demands of modern chemical research require the proper computing system that
would avoid wasteful bottlenecks by balancing a variety of computational
capabilities with individual workstations, networks, hardware and software
maintenance, support personnel and training in all areas of computational
chemistry. Many new insights into the kinetics of chemical reactions can be
developed through theoretical studies with use of mini-supercomputers when the
experimental data are inaccessible. In addition, the most cost-effective
computers are the mini-supercomputers.
