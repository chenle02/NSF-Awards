DMS-0404651&lt;br/&gt;Douglas C. Ravenel&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal has
two parts: Higher chromatic analogs of elliptic cohomology and finding more
stable homotopy groups of spheres. The first part concerns a recent discovery by
Ravenel that the Jacobians of certain algebraic curves in characteristic P have
interesting 1-dimensional formal groups as formal summands. More precisely, he
has examples where the the height can be any multiple of p-1. This could lead to
analogs of elliptic cohomology, which takes us deeper into the chromatic tower,
meaning beyond v2-periodic phenomena. It is the first example known to
topologists of formal group laws of height greater than two occuring in a
geometric setting. The methods used here come from algebraic geometry and number
theory. The second part concerns the determination of the stable homotopy groups
of spheres and the Adams-Novikov spectral sequence. This problem has been one of
the central and most difficult in algebraic topology since the groups were
defined in 1935. Little progress has been made in this area since the the
publication of Ravenel's 1986 book (republished in 2003) "Complex Cobordism and
the Stable Homotopy Groups of Spheres" which described the state of the art at
the time. In it he determined the stable homotopy groups of spheres through
dimension 108 for p=3 and 999 for p=5. The latter computation was a substantial
improvement over prior knowledge, and neither has been improved upon since. It
is generally agreed among homotopy theorists that it is not worthwhile to try to
improve our knowledge of stable homotopy groups by a few stems, but that the
prospect of increasing the know range by a factor of p would be worth pursuing.
This possibility may be within reach now, due to a better understanding of the
previously used methods of and improved computer
technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will help the general advance of
algebraic topology, a subject which has been central to pure mathematics since
its founding by Poincare a century ago. It has been a continuing source of new
ideas in algebraic geometry as seen in the work of Lefschetz in the '30s, the
efforts leading the proof of the Weil conjectures in the&lt;br/&gt;'60s and
'70s, and most recently in the successful application of motivic cohomology to
the Milnor conjecture by Voevodsky. It has also found numerous applications in
differential geometry and theoretical physics. The University of Rochester is
one of the leading centers of algebraic topology in the world.&lt;br/&gt;
