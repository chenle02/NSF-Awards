The project is developing and testing a model for improving the preparation of
undergraduate pre-service teachers who will go on to teach earth science in
grades K-8. Prior semester-length courses in physical geology and educational
science methods are being combined into a year-long course taught by both
Geology and Education faculty. The course integrates learning of earth-science
content with the methodology of how to teach it, producing a next generation of
K-8 science educators who are knowledgeable and enthusiastic. In conjunction
with revised classes and laboratory experiences, pre-service teachers are
developing shared digital portfolios of teaching resources. An additional effort
is testing the impact of a preparatory, four-day intensive field experience on
learning by pre-service teachers who enroll in the year-long course.

Through explicit integration of content and pedagogy, the project is directly
addressing the lack of preparation in physical science and learning about the
nature of science among many pre-service elementary and middle-school teachers.
Beyond contributing to the future teacher workforce in the region, the project
is also disseminating the model of a collaborative, integrated science/education
course to a national audience through web resources and conference workshops.
