9531995 RADTKE An X-ray mapping, analytical microprobe technique will be tested
to measure Sr/Ca ratios in the otoliths of larval cod fishes. Success with this
procedure will identify the relationships between successive daily growth
increments, vertical distribution/diel migration patterns, and hydrographic
structure in the water column. Specimens collected from Georges Bank during the
spring and early summer period when thermal stratification develops will provide
information that should broaden an understanding of larval transport, survival
and recruitment. ***
