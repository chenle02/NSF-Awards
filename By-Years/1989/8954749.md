In this project, we will extend to the earth sciences the educational advances
of our prior Modeling and Microcomputer Based Lab projects that have generated
primarily in mathematics and the physical sciences. This project will bring
important, current scientific issues into the secondary school classroom.
Initially, we will focus on scientific issues of global change. We will take
advantage of current scientific research and technology, and transfer these
developments where appropriate to tools and activities suitable for kids. We aim
to capture the excitement of current national and international efforts
addressing global change through extensive contact and collaboration with
practicing researchers. We plan to make issues of global change accessible to an
understandable by students by providing opportunities for them to participate in
modeling, data analysis, and experimental measurements. To this end, we plan to
develop numerical simulations, sophisticated data analysis tools, and new
sensors and systems for data acquisition. The project will develop and evaluate
classroom material for incorporating these advances, undertake studies that
increase our understanding of how students can best use these developments, and
will provide realistic mechanisms for wide dissemination of our work. The
project involves close collaboration among a broad range of individuals,
institutions, and businesses. The work will be guided by an outstanding panel of
expert researcher and educators.
