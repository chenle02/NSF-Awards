9203389 Ghandeharizadeh Object-Placement in Parallel Hypermedia Systems This is
the first year funding of a three-year continuing award. Multimedia information
systems have emerged as an essential component of many application domains
ranging from digital libraries to entertainment technology. However, most
implementations of these systems cannot support a continuous display of
multimedia objects and suffer from frequent disruptions termed hiccups . This is
due to the large size of these objects that requires them to be almost always
disk resident, and the disparity between the low I/O bandwidth of the current
disk technology and the high bandwidth requirement of multimedia objects. To
resolve this limitation, a multimedia object is declustered across multiple disk
drives, enabling the system to utilize the aggregate bandwidth of multiple disks
to support its continuous retrieval. Moreover, virtual data replication is being
developed as a mechanism to support simultaneous display of several objects to
different users. This project investigates techniques that: (1) provide on-line
access to vast amount of multimedia data; (2) minimize the response time of the
system by prefetching data; and (3) maximize the processing capability of the
system by optimizing the placement of the objects across the processors. The
results of this research are expected to provide a foundation for the
development of high performance multimedia information systems that can scale to
thousands of processors. ***
