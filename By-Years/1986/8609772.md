This proposal requests funding to replace two ESR spectrometers in a major,
highly productive Chemistry Department. The investigator proposes to purchase a
sensitive, state-of-the-art x-brand spectrometer with high speed, versatile data
handling capabilities that will benefit the research programs supported by this
instrument encompass spin label studies of enzymes and proteins of the
coagulation pathway, in-vivo ESR, the chemistry of photo-induced carbene and
photo-affinity labeling chemistry in enzymes and nucleic acids, structural
characterization of heme protein models and spin label studies of ribosomal
RNA's.
