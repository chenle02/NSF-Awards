The institution has revised the Bachelor of Arts degree in biology to include a
greater emphasis on cellular and molecular biology. This emphasis provides
students with practical experience in the techniques associated with the rapidly
expanding field of biotechnology. The predominantly Hispanic (86 %) and female
(62 %) students depend upon the hands-on experiences provided by the laboratory
portions of their biology courses to improve their chances for success in
employment and acceptance to postgraduate programs. Specific plant biotechnology
laboratories are now designed to introduce junior and senior level biology
students to cell disruption, differential centrifugation, DNA extraction, gel
electrophoresis, genetic fingerprinting by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR),
protoplast fusion, and transformation of plant genome by Ti plasmids. Project
equipment is also shared by students in undergraduate independent study research
courses.
