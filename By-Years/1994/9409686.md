The PI is creating a special-purpose programming language in which optimization
problems can be specified in a natural and direct way. The focus is on
developing associated translation software to convert such a specification into
a particular canonical form for numerical optimization using recently developed,
ultra-efficient, interior-point algorithms. The canonical form is a linear-
matrix- inequality (LMI) program, where each constraint takes the form of a
requirement that a linear (plus a constant) matrix function of the optimization
variables be positive definite. Control theorists have recently demonstrated
that a tremendous variety of common (and uncommon) constraints can be put into
this generic form. Often, however, the required LMI constraints are not related
to the underlying problem in an intuitive way. Software to translate
specifications in a "comfortable language" to sets of LMIs is being developed in
order to make these powerful optimization techniques easy to apply. The language
is being applied to real problems in communication and signal-processing circuit
designs.
