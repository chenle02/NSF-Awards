Migratory connectivity for full-cycle conservation of imperiled songbirds
Connecting geographically distinct areas used by migrant songbirds is a
formidable challenge. However, migratory connectivity is a research frontier
that is essential for understanding population dynamics, informing global
conservation plans, and building a framework within which ecological questions
about speciation, energetics, disease transmission, and much more can be
addressed. It is particularly important to identify population-specific
wintering grounds for species experiencing dramatic declines despite apparently
high productivity on breeding grounds. In collaboration with researchers from
many universities and government agencies, two fast-developing research tools
(stable isotope analysis and light-level geolocation) will be employed to
identify migration routes and wintering grounds for golden-winged warblers
(Vermivora chrysoptera) from ten populations across the species' breeding range.
This research will allow investigation of associations between wintering-ground
anthropogenic land-use patterns and breeding population trends, and to develop a
global conservation plan for this species of high conservation concern. This
study will provide a blueprint for investigating range-wide migratory
connectivity and initiating global conservation efforts for other migrant
songbirds, many of which of are experiencing similar long-term declines. The
Fellow will continue to work with Native American communities in Minnesota by
developing a curriculum for schools and summer academies to nurture ecological
and environmental interest in underserved Native American youth. The Fellow will
also conduct individual educational programs for Native American elementary
schools near the study sites.
