The principal investigator will address mathematical questions in several
different branches of statistical mechanics and condensed matter physics. First,
she will investigate both equilibrium and non-equilibrium properties of some
simple classical systems. Second, she will study collective phenomena in some
rather simple quantum systems, including both quantum spin models and systems of
particles with anomalous statistics. All the questions she will address concern
the behavior of systems with a large number of degrees of freedom, usually
infinite. The mathematical methods to be developed to study these systems are
rooted in probability theory and analysis, but also make use of dynamical
systems, differential equations, group theory and numerical methods.
