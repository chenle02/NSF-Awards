This project is broadly concerned with the development of new techniques to
study geometric and analytic problems on an important class of singular spaces.
Geometry and mathematical physics have traditionally focused on smooth geometric
objects called manifolds, but a slightly more general class of geometric objects
called stratified spaces is equally ubiquitous. Despite this, only recently have
specific techniques been developed appropriate to study detailed analytic
problems on these spaces. One goal of this project is a continuation of the PI's
long-term goal of establishing certain strong analytic techniques to study a
wide variety of problems in geometric analysis which are set on such stratified
spaces. Other goals of this project include applications of these techniques to
problems occurring in gauge theory and in mathematical relativity. This has
significant cross-disciplinary appeal between partial differential equations,
geometric analysis and mathematical physics, and modulates between the parallel
goals of developing general techniques and solving specific problems of interest
in various disciplines.

Geometric microlocal analysis has emerged as a powerful tool to study a range of
problems concerning differential and pseudodifferential operators with
degeneracies. Such operators arise in many applications in geometric analysis
and mathematical physics. The PI's current research interest centers on the
development of a calculus of iterated edge pseudodifferential operators which
can be used as an investigative tool to study elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic
operators on stratified pseudomanifolds. The ultimate goal in this is a theory
paralleling and generalizing the Boutet de Monvel calculus, which provides the
most general and natural setting to study elliptic boundary problems on
manifolds with boundary. The PI intends to use this calculus to study specific
problems, including Kaehler-Einstein metrics with edge singularities along
normal crossing divisors and singular solutions of the Kapustin-Witten
equations. Closely related research projects include a new approach to study the
asymptotic geometry of certain gauge-theoretic moduli spaces, in particular the
moduli space of solutions to the Hitchin equations on a Riemann surface, and the
continuation of a program to understand the blowup profiles of families of
solutions of the vacuum Einstein constraint equations in mathematical
relativity.
