This research deals with an important class of stochastic systems, whose dynamic
character is undergoing random abrupt changes. These systems are called hybrid
systems since they are suitably described in a hybrid space consisting of the
usual continuous-valued system state or base state and a finite valued discrete
jump state or system mode. The switching of the mode indicates a change of the
base state dynamics. For systems with a finite number of modes the optimal
estimation problem has computational requirements that are exponentially
increasing with the time horizon,i.e., infeasible in practice. While a number of
estimation and control algorithms have been developed for this class of problems
based on noisy state observations, they relied on heuristic approximations. In
view of this, no hard results, like stability of the controlled system, could be
proved. Performance evaluation for these algorithms has been done only via Monte
Carlo simulations. The investigation we are proposing will consider the
following three major problems related to hybrid systems: estimation, control
and stability. In the area of estimation there ar several practical algorithms
and we shall focus on developing tools for prediction of their performance
without recourse to expensive simulations and, in particular, the evaluation of
the stability of such algorithms in tracking problems -- a major practical issue
in e.g., Air Traffic Control Systems. For controlling such systems there are
some algorithms, but, since they were developed using heuristic approximations
to the Stochastic Dynamic Programming, one cannot evaluate the stability of the
resulting controlled systems. A real-time implementable control algorithm will
be obtained using an upper bounding technique in the Stochastic Dynamic
Programming. This technique will then be used to show, with a stochastic
Lyapunov function, that the resulting closed-loop system is stable.
