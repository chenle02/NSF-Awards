9629636 Campbell The objectives of this research program will be two fold: 1) to
build on previous work in the avalanche photodiodes (APD) photodetectors to
develop a realistic model that can be used as a tool to facilitate device design
and optimization and to conduct a systematic experimental study of the critical
structural parameters, including the bandedge discontinuities, the widths of the
barrier and well regions, and the composition profile of the barrier layers.
Tight coupling between the simulation and experimental work is a strength of
this program and will provide the feedback necessary for understanding and
developing these technologically important photodetectors. 2) It is also the
objective of this proposed research to realize new photodetectors that utilize
novel resonantcavity structures to achieve enhanced performance relative to
conventional photodetectors. A crucial aspect to achieving these novel
photodetectors is a fundamental understanding of the physical effects that
determine their performance. For example, the resonantcavity approach has been
successfully extended to avalanche photodiodes. However, there are aspects to
the impact ionization process in this type of structure that are not well
understood. The resonant-cavity structure can provide several performance
advantages, one of which is that the tradeoff between responsivity/bandwidth
that is inherent to conventional PIN photodiodes structures can be circumvented.
For the typical normal-incidence photodetector, a wide bandwidth necessitates a
thin absorption layer which, in turn, results in low quantum efficiency. The
resonant-cavity structure, on the other hand, effectively decouples the
responsivity from the transit-time component of the bandwidth because the
optical signal makes multiple passes across the thin absorbing layer inside the
microcavity. For example, it has been demonstrated with Si-based resonant-cavity
photodiodes that a 10x increase in bandwidth can be achieve without sacrificing
quantum efficiency. In addition, the narrow spectral response of these
photodetectors may be used to advantage for applications such as wavelength-
division multiplexing. For example, high Q cavities can provide an integrated
filtering function. ***
