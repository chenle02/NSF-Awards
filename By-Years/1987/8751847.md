Texas Regional Enhancement Program for Underprepared Physics Teachers is a
model regional cooperative program to provide training in physics content and
pedagogy for 24 underprepared high school physics teachers from the State of
Texas. Three two-week summer workshops covering topics in classical, modern, and
contemporary physics will be offered during the three year grant period.
Academic year follow-up meetings and classroom visitations also are included to
provide assistance with implementation and evaluation. Instruction in the
program is carried out by a team consisting of highly experienced high school
physics teachers (Physics Teaching Resource Agents) and a university faculty
member. Participants will receive three units of graduate credit for successful
completion of each year of the program.
