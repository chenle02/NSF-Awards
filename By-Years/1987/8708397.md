The proposed research will examine the biostratigraphy and extinction patterns
of ammonites, inoceramid bivalves, and echinoids at four well preserved
stratigraphic sections of Maastrichtian age located in Spain and France.
Specimens will be collected stratigraphically. Bulk samples to be processed for
microfossils will also be collected, as will oriented cores from most
fossiliferous horizons. THe results of these collections will allow testing of
hypotheses concerning the timing and pattern of macrofossil extinctions in these
sections. A refined biostratigraphy will also be proposed, by integrating
information from new macrofossil occurrences, new information about
magnetostratigraphy derived from the oriented core samples, and previously
published microfossil information.
