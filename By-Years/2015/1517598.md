The objective of this program is to commission a polarization-sensitive radio
receiver and build a digital backend for the CO Mapping Array Pathfinder (COMAP)
experiment, as well as observe for two years using this equipment on a
10m-diameter radio telescope. The COMAP program is part of a much larger effort
by the astronomical community to understand the origin and evolution of the
universe and the formation of stars and galaxies. Broader impacts of the work
include mentoring of undergraduates and research training of graduate students
in instrumentation development. The COMAP team will communicate their results
via public lectures, web pages, and activities at the telescope. Students and
early-career researchers will be trained in a variety of cutting edge techniques
in radio frequency design, technology development and analysis of large data
sets. Personnel funded by this proposal will participate in an education and
outreach program at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory, bringing the excitement
of scientific research to a diverse community that includes a Native American
population. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COMAP aims to measure emission from both the
CO J=1-0 transition at redshifts 2.4 &lt; z &lt; 2.8 and the J=2-1 transition at
5.8 &lt; z &lt; 6.7, probing the 3D power spectrum of CO, which acts as a tracer
for star formation.
