The University of Arkansas is providing an opportunity for 15 high school
chemistry teachers from the state of Arkansas to upgrade their background in
content and methodology. This program is specifically designed to prepare these
experienced chemistry teachers for the teaching of Advanced Placement (AP)
Chemistry. Activities will include lectures on topics appropriate to this level
of chemistry, laboratory experiments which will include those experiments on the
AP list, seminars on current research being conducted on the campus, discussions
with campus researchers, and visits and observations of classroom activities by
the project staff.
