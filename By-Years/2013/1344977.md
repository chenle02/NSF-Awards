The proposed grant will promote the design, development and analysis of mobile
computing and wireless networking technologies, systems, and applications by
encouraging student participation in the ACM Mobicom 2012 conference. Besides
technical paper presentations, MobiCom, through this grant, will be able to
stimulate several intellectual activities by students including potentially
killer apps (through the mobile app competition) and breakthrough research
(through the student research competition, and the S3 workshop). Furthermore,
the conference offers several opportunities for intellectually stimulating
discussions between the students and researchers from around the world.

The participation of students in MobiCom can have an important impact on their
development as a junior researcher. The grant will also promote diversity by
encouraging and enabling women and other underrepresented minorities to
participate.
