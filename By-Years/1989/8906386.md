This study seeks to identify the relative contribution of regional, local and
internal factors in controlling the long-term development of raised bog
ecosystems in central Sweden. The research will focus on three aspects of bog
development: initiation, growth, and landform development. The timing and
trajectory of the three processes will be compared with hydrodynamic models of
raised bog development that assume a constant environment. Extensive
reconstruction of the environmental setting will be derived from paleoecological
analysis of a very small lake basin adjacent to the bog that primarily records
the local vegetation, water table and environment and a larger lake that is more
sensitive to regional changes in vegetation, hydrology and climate.
Paleoecological reconstructions from these sites will involve sediment, pollen
and macrofossil analysis. The local hydrological setting will be described using
a nested piezometer approach. The results will be significant to general studies
of community and ecosystem development, to investigations of climate history and
to research on the sensitivity of wetland systems to environmental and
hydrologic change.
