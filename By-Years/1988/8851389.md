The laboratory curriculum in Physical Chemistry often does not reflect current
research in the field. The Department of Chemistry at Loyola University of
Chicago will address this problem by establishing a sequence of undergraduate
experiments that involve the use of both lasers and computers. This ILI award
from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program will help the Department
acquire laser, optical and computer instrumentation that will be used to enhance
undergraduate laboratory instruction and aid in chemistry curriculum
development.
