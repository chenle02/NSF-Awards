The purpose is to carry out high precision calculations on the Li isoelectronic
series for Z &lt; 10. A number of quantities will be calculated including the
energy levels, mass shift, transition isotope shift, hyperfine coupling
constant, electron density at the nucleus and relativistic contributions. In
particular, a high precision lower bound for the nonrelativistic ground state
energy of the Li atom will be computed. This should resolve an issue in the
literature concerning the precise location of the ground state energy of Li to a
1 microhartree level of accuracy (.00003 eV). The lower bound will also provide
valuable information on the rate of convergence of the variational approach
used. Finally, an indirect determination of the Lamb shifts for particular
states of the Li I series will be carried out. Lamb shifts for selected spectral
transitions will also be evaluated.
