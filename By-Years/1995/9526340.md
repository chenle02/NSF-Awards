9526340 Stepp Recent evaluations of the key needs for earthquake engineering and
earthquake hazard mitigation have recommended the establishment of a committee
to overview and give advice concerning earthquake strong motion activities in
the United States (Higgins, 1993). This action is to support the formation and
management of this committee, which will provide a focal point for over-viewing
the strong motion activities in the United States and in other countries. This
committee is to consist of representatives from the various individual strong
motion recording networks and data users from the academic and practicing
communities in the U.S., with the committee meeting on a regular basis. It will
identify issues affecting strong motion data acquisition and dissemination, set
priorities to address the issues, and form working groups to develop working
papers with specific recommended actions to be taken. Issues to be addressed
include strong motion data needs, data processing, common data formatting,
mechanisms for data dissemination, instrumentation needs, acquisition and
dissemination of foreign strong motion data, and other issues to be identified
by the committee. Issue papers developed by working groups of the committee will
be reviewed in focused workshops. Workshop participants will be selected from
the committee and additional data users. The proceedings of the workshops will
serve as guidelines for effective, coordinated strong motion data acquisition,
dissemination and usage. ***
