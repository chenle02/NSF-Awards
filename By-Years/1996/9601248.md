Brinton 9601248 One of the hallmark characteristics of the cerebral cortex is
its integrative capacity. Information derived from the external environment,
from systems that control bodily function and from internal conscious and
unconscious events all converge onto the cerebral cortex for processing and
storage. A critical, as yet, unanswered question concerns the mechanism(s) by
which integration of information occurs in the cerebral cortex. To address this
question, Dr. Brinton is investigating the role of the vasopressin receptor in
this context. Vasopressin is a small protein molecule which enhances long-term
memory, a function associated with the cerebral cortex. The experiments focus on
the cellular, biochemical and genomic events triggered by activation of cortical
vasopressin receptors essential for the integration of information. These
investigations provide a greater understanding of the basic mechanisms for the
brain to process information, and gives us a greater understanding of how
learning and memory are generated.
