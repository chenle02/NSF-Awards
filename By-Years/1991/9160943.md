The electronics industry has become a major economic force. By 1991, six
percent ($758 million) of the total semiconductor market will be accounted for
by Gallium arsenide (GaAs) components. GaAs wafers will also account for a
steady 6 percent share of total merchant wafer consumption through 1991. GaAas
IC's have now been accepted for mainframe computers, work stations, digital and
microwave communication systems, and test equipment designs. GaAs materials
quality, yield and availability have improved. Failed GaAs materials, however,
whether from undoped, unencapsulated wafers, doped wafers or fully mounted
chips, can account for 73% to 100% of starting materials. The total dollar loss
of GaAs, gold and silver runs into millions of dollars per year. Several
comparies have begun chemical degradation and recovery of gallium but the
process is expensive and often enviromentally unsafe. Technical Research
Associates, Inc. (TRA) has performed preliminary experiments to determine the
feasibility of biodegrading and recoving gallium, silver and gold from chips,
wwafers and sludge. The organism used in these experiments is TRA patent-pending
and listed with ATCC.
