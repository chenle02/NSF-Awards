This research effort includes thrusts in optical communications, switching,
signal processing, and the new area of associative memory devices. The
fundamental material questions which this work addresses are at the basis of the
further development of the field. In addition, the necessary basic understanding
and methods of probing some of the properties of such artificially produced
structures in reliable way need proper addressing.
