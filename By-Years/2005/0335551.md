The Workshop aims to bring together the community of researchers, from all over
the world, directly interested in the subject of partially hyperbolic dynamical
systems, and related topics. It may be considered a follow-up to the
International Conference held at Northwestern University in May 2001, and the
possibility to turn this into a periodic series, with the next edition held in
Dijon, France, in 2005, is under serious consideration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
2003 workshop is organized by three of the best Brazilian mathematical research
centers, IMPA, the Catholic University, and the Federal University of Rio de
Janeiro, and will be attended by some 80 mathematicians, about half of them
graduate students or recent PhDs. NSF support, combined with support from the
organizers, has made possible a very substantial US participation, of more than
20 graduate students and both young and senior
mathematicians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The topic of partial hyperbolicity emerged
in the early seventies as one main direction in which the theory of complicated
("chaotic") dynamical systems has been developing and extending much beyond the
classical setting of hyperbolic dynamics, driven by the realization that many
practical applications of dynamical systems to experimental phenomena do require
a much broader theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The whole subject went through
particularly remarkable progress over the last decade or so, to become one of
the most active research areas in dynamics nowadays, as certified by its strong
presence in scientific meetings around the globe and, in particular, in the
program of the last International Congresses of Mathematicians.
