This Water Cycle Research (WCR) project seeks to determine the flux of water
between various reservoirs, in order to quantify the global water cycle. The
quantification is necessary for understanding the physical processes,
characterization of hydroclimate variability and change, and for evaluation of
climate models. Dai and co-PI Trenberth (both at NCAR) will strive to quantify
the precipitation amounts, intensity and frequency, and evaporation, from
atmospheric water budgets and fresh water discharges from the continents; global
streamflow records from over 8000 stations will be analyzed. The results should
improve understanding of the fundamental components of the water cycle,
especially, runoff, river discharge, net surface water fluxes, and oceanic
freshwater transport. The effort should lead to improved characterization of the
interannual and decadal variabilities of the water fluxes, and of inter-basin
transports. The PIs expect their efforts to advance climate model development
since the major model deficiencies are related to aspects of the water cycle.
The research should lead to improved modeling and prediction of hydroclimate
variability and change, on both regional and continental scales.

This work is of potential benefit to the broad community of climate scientists
studying water cycle science in the context of climate change and variability.
Moreover, the information from this research will improve climate models and
their ability to project future climates, an important contribution to societal
issues concerned with the environment.
