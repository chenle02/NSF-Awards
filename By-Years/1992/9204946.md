Professor Smyth will continue his research on sets of principal curvatures of
hypersurfaces in Euclidean space and to extend some of the techniques previously
developed to spaces of constant curvature. The anticipated results may be
employed to obtain some interesting generalizations of previous classical
results for isoparametric hypersurfaces. Xavier will continue his research on
the study of complete embedded simply-connected minimal surfaces and
relationships with algebraic curve geometry.
