This project continues a research program in logic. The studied areas of
research stem directly from an analysis of the structure of formulas in negation
normal form and from investigations into multiple-valued logics. The former work
led to the development of the deduction rule called path dissolution. The study
of continues, including the study of its properties as an inference mechanism
and the development of a portable C++ implementation. For some time it has
appeared that dissolution would be a useful tool in the design of prime
implicant/implicate algorithms. A new negation normal form (NNF) algorithm, PI,
has been developed that can be combined with dissolution for this purpose, and
formula classes have been discovered that are hard for CNF/DNF-based methods but
that are easy for PI/dissolution. A prototype system has been implemented and is
being further developed. These techniques are being extended to multiple-valued
logics (MVL's). The work in MVL's also includes the study of annotated logic
programming and SLD-style proof procedures, and inference methods for fuzzy
logics.
