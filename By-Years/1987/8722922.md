Benthic resting eggs constitute an important phase in the life history of many
coastal planktonic copepods. The resumption of development and hatching of
resting eggs are of fundamental importance to the perpetuation of many
populations year after year in many areas. The relative contribution of resting
eggs to recruitment however, is poorly understood largely because we do not
clearly understand either the conditions that promote the accumulation of
resting eggs on the sea-bottom or their hatching. It is very likely that
resuspension of the seabed by storms leads to the resuspension of eggs.
Moreover, since continental shelf areas are frequently subject to storms, these
could have a major impact on copecod recruitment. This research seeks to
determine the bottom stresses that are necessary for eggs to be resuspended, and
the conditions (e.g. temperture) that permit the their hatching.
