In this project in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Subprogram of the
Physical Chemistry Program, Gray will study the intramolecular and fragmention
dynamics of van der Waals (vdW) molecules and clusters. The dynamics of vdW
systems have received much attention recently because supersonic jet, molecular
beam and laser technology have permitted the intimate details of these reactions
to be carefully probed. The payoff has often been the observation of fascinating
dynamics including mode specificity. This research is aimed at a theoretical
understanding of vdW dynamics using recently developed ideas and techniques from
nonlinear dynamics, and at developing and extending simpler statistical
theoretical approaches to vdW reaction dynamics. One conjecture of this research
is that nonlinear resonances between vibrational and/or rotational modes, and
phase space bottlenecks to energy flow and chemical reactivity play a
significant and unifying role in understanding lifetimes and product
distributions. A variety of nonlinear dynamics ideas and methods -- including,
for example, simple phase space projections and local estimates of frequencies
and exponential separations -- will be applied to each system of interest to
explore such possibilities. An alternative RRKM theory -- essentially a novel
transition state theory of unimolecular reactions -- will be developed into a
useful tool for estimating vdW reaction rates. This involves constructing
analytical and intuitive approximations to the phase space bottlenecks which
turn out to be the correct transition states required by the theory. The above
program of research will be achieved by studying in detail several
experimentally relevant and rather different vdW systems, all involving three or
more degrees of freedom: NeCl2, ArHD and hydrogen bonded clusters of HF.
