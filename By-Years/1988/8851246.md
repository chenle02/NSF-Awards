This award provides funds to purchase equipment for the Department of
Biochemistry at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln. A set of undergraduate
biochemistry laboratory experiences will be developed, which will be novel in
that all the experiments will be focused on one enzyme or the gene coding for
that enzyme. The enzyme will be Escherichia coli B- galactosidase. A major
student criticism of usual laboratory curriculum is that it is disjointed and
the experiments from one week to the next are unrelated. The goals of this
project are to improve student interest in learning by providing a coordinated
and centrally focused series of experiments, to increase the student's
perception of the relevance of different biochemical techniques and to provide a
sense of the unity of biochemical laboratory techniques. Equipment will be used
for spectrophotometry and kinetics (spectrophotometer and chart recorders),
enzyme chromatography (pumps, column monitors, fraction collectors),
electrophoresis (power supplies and apparatus) and basic molecular biochemistry
(centrifuges, vacuum oven, and transilluminator/camera). The grantee institution
is matching this NSF award with funds from non-Federal sources.
