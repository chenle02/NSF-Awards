The objective of this research is the development of a prototype compact
cryogenic cutting system that employs water jet cutting principles for emergency
rescue missions. The envisioned prototype will use cryogenic fluid with
application temperatures low enough to embrittle and fracture structural
materials through a local build-up of thermal and mechanical stresses. The
embrittlement resulting from the cryogenic fluid will be utilized through water
jet technology to optimize metal cutting process in selective areas. The
significance of this research is the development of a new generation of compact
emergency cutting tools that use cryogenic fluid to replace flame and minimize
(or eliminate) spark-generating impact.
