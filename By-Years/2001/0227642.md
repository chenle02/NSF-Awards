0227642&lt;br/&gt;Harmon&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a three-year project
submitted by Dr. Mark Harmon, Oregon State University, in collaboration with Dr.
Hen-Biau King, Taiwan Forestry Research Institute, to conduct a comparative
study on decomposition of 15N-labeled fine roots and fate of N releases in
Western Oregon, USA and Taiwan LTER sites. Root decomposition is a fundamental
process in forest ecosystems. Understanding of fine root decomposition and its N
dynamics is important in understanding controls over soil strength maintenance,
soil organic matter formation, ecosystem N cycling, and ecosystem responses to
disturbance and climate changes. This cross-site comparison project between the
U.S. and Taiwan can contribute significantly to International Long-Term
Ecological Cooperation, and provide a valuable research experience for U.S.
students. This project is jointly supported by the National Science Council of
Taiwan and NSF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
