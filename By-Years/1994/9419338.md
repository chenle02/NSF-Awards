This project involves the dissertation research of a linguistic anthropology
student from the University of Michigan. The student will study the use of
language in the Ukraine, contrasting how people use and react to others' use of
the Ukrainian and Russian languages. The newly independent country has decreed
that Ukrainian is the official language. In part of the Ukraine, German,
Hungarian, Polish, Czech and Romanian have alternately dominated education and
public life. The project will study how people strategically use language to
effect their social and political goals in three regions: Kiev, the capital
city, Kharkiv, an industrial and cultural center in the north-east, and a small
city in south-western Ukraine. Methods include participant observation, taped
interviews including evaluations of speech samples, and the matched guise test,
a procedure whereby people react to and evaluate along various social and
emotional dimensions the same text read by speakers in several different
languages. This project is important because it will add to our expertise in
this rapidly changing area of the ex-Soviet Union, and will advance our
understanding of the role of language in establishing political and social
identities in newly independent countries.
