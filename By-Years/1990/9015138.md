Partial support is to be provided for a workshop on future needs in equipment
and facilities for hydraulic research. One of the important areas for
consideration is mechanics and transport of sediment, both non-cohesive and
cohesive. Advances in computation and modeling have created a need to define
requirements in instrumentation and facilities in order for physical data to
remain compatible with these advances. Sediment accumulation, dredging, run-off,
and waste disposal are examples of sediment and hydraulics management whose
prediction is at present unreliable, and where modern experimental facilities
would have significant impact.
