This project will develop a series of eight to ten Modular Experience Units
(MEUs) which will replace the more traditional introductory-chemistry laboratory
experiences. The MEUs will be relatively self-contained experimentally based
exercises requiring several laboratory periods each for completion. Each MEU
will be designed around a topic of current, active interest, in which chemistry
plays a key integrative role. High interest topics will be developed to stress
the demonstration of the scientific process and to show the evolving integration
of the sciences.//
