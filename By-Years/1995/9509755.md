9509755 Amasino This award supports the Sixth International Conference on
Arabidopsis Research to be held at the University of Wisconsin, Madison,
Wisconsin, June 7-11, 1995. The aim is to provide an opportunity for researchers
to exchange ideas on all aspects of Arabidopsis research, including genome-
related efforts. The conference will include sessions on embryonic and post
embryonic development, environmental effects on development, response to
environmental stress and pathogens, plant growth regulators, biochemical
genetics, cell biology, biochemistry, and genome-related research. This is the
first international Arabidopsis conference to be held since the August 1993
meeting at Ohio State University and the number of researchers using Arabidopsis
has been growing at a tremendous rate. There were over 600 participants at the
last meeting and a greater number is expected to attend this meeting. The
conference will maximize participation of young scientists by inviting
relatively young PIs, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate students to give the
majority of talks.
