ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;0329715&lt;br/&gt;David Neuhoff&lt;br/&gt;U of Michigan, Ann
Arbor&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Field-Gathering Wireless Sensor
Networks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops the theory and practice of
wireless sensor networks for measuring a two-dimensional field and transporting
it to a collector site, where it can be displayed for interpretation or used to
perform automatic object recognition, object tracking or some other form of
estimation or detection. The significance of this research lies in the
establishment of theory and the development of technology in the emerging area
of sensors and sensor networks, and the applicability of this effort to a wide
range of scientific studies and social issues. This project also contributes to
the training of graduate students, undergraduate students, and the recruitment
of women and underrepresented minority students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
research, which builds on the prior work of the investigators, explores both
fundamental limits and practical methodological issues. The fundamental limits
have principally to do with network efficiency, as measured by the accuracy of
the field reconstruction vs. the required quantity of costly resources such as
energy and bandwidth, and how the efficiency scales with the number and density
of the sensors. The practical issues have to do with the development of concrete
methods that approach or attain the fundamental limits. The typical field to be
measured and transported is highly correlated at neighboring locations. This
project explores two approaches to exploiting this correlation to substantially
increase efficiency. In one approach, the data compression and network routing
are jointly designed to complement one another. In the second approach, Slepian-
Wolf distributed coding is used. This permits the data compression and data
dissemination functions to be independently designed and operated. It also
considers both flat and clustered or hierarchical network
organizations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
