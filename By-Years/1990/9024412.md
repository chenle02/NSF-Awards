The Principal Investigators (PIs) plan to investigate the kinetics of growth and
thiophene production from fast-growing hairy root cultures of the Tagetes
species (marigolds). Thiophenes are sulfur derivatives of polyacetylenes, and
are found mainly in the roots of these plants. Recent findings suggest that they
may play a role in protecting the plant from phytopathogenic fungi, insects, and
nematodes. Thiophenes may, therefore, provide an environmentally safe
alternative to conventional pesticides. The objectives of this project are to: -
Formulate and solve mathematical models of biomass growth and thiophene
accumulation in hairy root clones of the Tagetes species. - Determine kinetic
parameters in these models from growth data of elicited and non-elicited Tagetes
hairy root clones cultured in shake flasks. - Test the validity of various
models by comparison with growth data from bioreactor grown roots and to
optimize the bioreactor performance using the best mathematical models.
