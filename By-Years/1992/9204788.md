This award provides 67% of the funds needed to acquire research-grade
petrographic microscopes for the Department of Geological Sciences at the State
University of New York in Binghamton. The University is committed to providing
the remaining 33% required for this acquisition. The microscopes will be used
initially by faculty and graduate students in the Department of Geological
Sciences who are involved in research on the study of evaporite cores from Death
Valley, Saline Valley, and Bristol Dry Lake, California as indicators of past
climate changes.
