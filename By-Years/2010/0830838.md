This project seeks to understand and analyze the global demography of
cybersecurity threats and solutions. It is structured as a population study, in
three majors parts. First, a real time monitoring infrastructure captures a new
dataset on the population characteristics of malicious software, and of security
tools, as they are actually found across the world. The monitoring
infrastructure can compile frequent statistical estimates of the prevalence of
various identified software programs, both malicious and protective, at an
identified set of online sites, in a manner that does not compromise the privacy
of end users. Second, the data is analyzed for insight to drive enhancements in
cybersecurity. For example, analyses can look for correlations between malware
prevalence and other factors such as site characteristics and the use of
protective software, controlling for various factors. Third, the data set is to
be published online in both raw and processed forms, to allow further research
across computer security and a range of other fields, while at the same time
educating the public at large about cybersecurity threats.&lt;br/&gt;
