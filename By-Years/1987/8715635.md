The objective of the research is to investigate the chemical and physical
properties of radiation-sensitive materials composed of a functionalized polymer
and an inorganic initiator. The polymeric component in these materials contains
a base-sensitive or reduction-oxidation site, while the initiator is a
transition metal complex or semiconductor particle that generates base or
reduction-oxidation equivalents upon excitation by the radiation. The materials
will be characterized using absorption and emission spectroscopies, flash
pyrolysis, electron spin resonance spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and
molecular weight measurements. The most promising materials will be evaluated as
photoresist and/or electron-beam resists for micropatterning for integrated
circuits. The research will be conducted as a collaboration between the
University of Georgia and IBM Almanden Research Laboratory. The materials will
be evaluated for their potential applications in the electronics industry.
