0240385&lt;br/&gt;Girschick&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This three-year award for US-
France cooperative research involves Steven S. Girschick and his graduates
students at the University of Minnesota, Laifa Boufendi of the University of
Orleans, and Pere Roca i Cabarrocas at the Ecole Plytechnique. The objectives of
their research are to share expertise and facilities that relate to: plasma
synthesis of nanoparticles, nanoparticle deposition to make films, and post
deposition film processing. The project takes advantage of French expertise in
clustering and particle formation in plasmas and materials science. It will
advance understanding of plasma material synthesis and resulting applications to
low friction and high wear resistance coatings for tools and in other industrial
processes. In the context of this cooperative research project. NSF will provide
support for annual visits to France by the US investigator and his graduate
students.&lt;br/&gt;
