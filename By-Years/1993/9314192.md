9314192 Stott The author hypothesizes, based on preliminary data, that advection
of thermocline water from the Pacific to the Indian Ocean increased some time
between 13 Ka and 9 Ka. If the older date is correct, the increase may have
contributed to changes in the North Atlantic. He proposes to generate further
data to constrain this hypothesis, including the use of new variables such as
trace metals and 14 C dating of deep and shallow dwelling foraminifera; specific
predictions will be tested for each of these data types. ***
