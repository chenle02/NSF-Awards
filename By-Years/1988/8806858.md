Dispersion and aggregation of fine particles or droplets, especially in the
concentrated suspension form, is of critical significance in ultrapurification
of fine powders, sol-gel derived coatings, advanced ceramic components, and
consolidation of clays. The underlying phenomena in all of the above systems is
surface charge behavior. Availability of an acoustophoretic analyzer which can
yield simultaneous surface charge density and zeta potential measurements would
enhance current and future research capabilities at the University of Florida.
Funds are provided for the University of Florida to install an acoustophoretic
analyzer through this grant for accurate measurement of surface charge behavior.
