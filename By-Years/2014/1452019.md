Some form of uncertainty is embedded in almost all robotics applications. For
example, the dynamics governing the robot or its environment cannot be modeled
perfectly, or the sensors on board the robot provide noisy measurements. Hence,
in many realistic scenarios, planning algorithms are faced with substantial
uncertainty. Unfortunately, planning under uncertainty problems are known to be
computationally challenging. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to solve
planning under uncertainty problems with a new algorithmic approach utilizing
compact roadmaps, which aim to strike the best balance between computational
effort and performance objectives. The approach is based on new techniques and
advances in understanding probability measures in high-dimensional spaces.
Expected results include: (i) a thorough theoretical analysis of compact data
structures in the context of planning under uncertainty problems, which may lead
to tight bounds on computational effort and performance; (ii) the development of
algorithms with provable performance guarantees, and desirable computational
properties. These results will advance our understanding of the computational
impact of uncertainty in planning problems. Furthermore, they will lead to
practical algorithms with potential for immediate impact in robotics and beyond.
The experimental evaluation includes demonstration on self-driving cars. The
results will be disseminated through publications in archival international
robotics journals and international robotics conferences. The broader impacts
also include the involvement of graduate- and undergraduate-level students in
research activities and their training.
