9415706 Leu The travel grant will be used to partially defray the travel
expenses of selective university participants of the 1994 Japan-USA Symposium on
Flexible Automation, which will be held in Kobe, Japan, July 11-13, 1994. The
Symposium will consist of three days of technical presentations, panel
discussions, and keynote speeches, followed by tours to major university
research laboratories and industry production facilities in Japan. The financial
assistance will make it possible for U.S. researchers to attend the conference
and learn about research, development, and implementation of flexible automation
technologies in Japan. It will also enhance the ability of the symposium
organizers to attract top university researchers in the U.S. to contribute to
the Symposium.
