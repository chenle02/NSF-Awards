A symposium titled "Materials Engineering: How it is Useful for All Engineering"
is being organized at the 30th Anniversary meeting of the Society for the
Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS) to be held in
Albuquerque, New Mexico, in October 2003. The symposium features invited
speakers who seek to introduce students attending the SACNAS meeting to the
field of materials engineering and related sciences, including graduate
education and professional opportunities in the field. The proposed symposium
serves to enhance the presence of the engineering and physical sciences within
SACNAS and to encourage minority undergraduates to pursue further studies in
these fields.
