Theoretical interest and experimental efforts concerning Lagrangian particle
analysis have been increasing in the last years. The proposed research is to
develop an Eulerian-Lagrangian approach initiated very recently. A main object
of study in this approach is a diffusive Lagrangian path inverse that allows a
natural formulation, including a viscous analogue of the inviscid Cauchy
formula. The solution is built using a product expansion near the identity
transformation. It is proposed to study this construction and apply it to
randomly forced flows. In addition, the study of quenching of flames by strong
random flows in turbulent combustion is proposed.

Fluids and plasmas exhibit many active scales of motion, and are notoriously
difficult to compute and predict accurately. The reason is that the equations
describing them are not well understood. It is proposed to study mathematically
the processes of transport of momentum and heat under extreme conditions
