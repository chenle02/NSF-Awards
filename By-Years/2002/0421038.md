0421038&lt;br/&gt;Agrawal&lt;br/&gt;The PI proposes a study in the area of bone
biomechanics to explore the relationship between collagen damage and bone
fracture as a function of aging. The microCT will be used to non-invasively
investigate the microstructural properties of bone at high resolution as a
function of remodeling.
