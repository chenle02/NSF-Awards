Centralia College will initiate a six-week, commuter, multidisciplinary Young
Scholars project in the Physical and Life Sciences which will offer science
enrichment activities for 25 students entering grade 11. The goal is to provide
an experiential learning program for participants through a water quality
research project. Project activities will center on a study of Salzer Creek, a
tributary of the Chehalis River in Southwest Washington state. Students will
calculate water quality, analyze soil samples, test samples of plants and
benthic macroinvertebrates, and conduct stream flow analysis. Student research
will yield data to be used in local water quality assessments for the Chehalis
River Basin Council and to be entered in an international ecology data base.
