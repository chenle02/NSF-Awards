This award supports the convening of a preconference meeting in advance of the
International Congress of Infant Studies in New Orleans, LA on May 25, 2016. The
goal of the preconference meeting is to consider unique concerns and challenges
associated with preserving best practices in infancy research to enhance
replication and reproducibility. Results from a survey of infancy researchers on
their research and training practices will be disseminated, and leaders in the
field will make presentations about important considerations on topics such as
training, inclusion criteria, and cross-lab replications. The meeting will
culminate with a discussion among members of the Executive Committee of the
International Congress of Infant Studies and the editors of the Congress'
flagship journal, Infancy, regarding standards for the conduct and publication
of research. The outcomes of this meeting will have important implications for
the support and preservation of robust and reliable infancy research.
