Today's enterprise computing environments resemble the mythological chimaera:
they are comprised of heterogeneous devices, ranging from PDAs to servers, which
individually presents distinct, fragmented views of available data and services.
To exacerbate the problem, devices are often managed by individuals with
different interests and expertise. Thus, the parts are not even coordinated by a
single brain! Unsurprisingly, these monsters are hard to use and
maintain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is exploring two ingredients for the
taming of these monsters: a peer-to-peer (P2P) file system and a decentralized
coordination mechanism. The file system serves to unify the fragmented data
views of devices into a global namespace, providing device-independent name and
content addressing. Underneath the global view, the file system continually
monitors device characteristics and user behaviors, and automatically adapts the
replication and placement of data to achieve specified availability and
durability targets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The coordination mechanism serves to
govern the interactions between components within a decentralized system
according to explicitly specified policies. Critically, this mechanism is based
on an intrinsically decentralized system called Law Governed Interactions (LGI).
This work explores the applicability of LGI to the above P2P file system and the
experimental use of the resulting integrated system in the computing
infrastructure of the Rutgers Computer Science
Department.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expected outcome of the project is a
demonstration of how P2P technologies can be used to build powerful and
flexible, yet low-futz enterprise computing systems. The project will also
produce two prototype building blocks that can be used for future investigations
of decentralized systems.&lt;br/&gt;
