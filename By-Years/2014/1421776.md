On-line sharing of images has become a key enabler of users' connectivity.
Various types of images are shared through social media to represent users'
interests and experiences. While extremely convenient and socially valuable,
this level of pervasiveness introduces acute privacy concerns. First, once
shared images may go anywhere, as copying / resharing images is straightforward.
Second, the information disclosed through an image reveals aspects of users'
private lives, affecting both the owner and other subjects in the image.
Malicious attackers can take advantage of these unnecessary leaks to launch
context-aware attacks (e.g., spearfishing) or even impersonation attacks. This
project is developing methods to help users appropriately control access to
their shared images.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators are developing new
techniques to tackle image privacy based on the image content as well as images
and users' meta-data, by (a) inferring the sensitivity of a given image based on
the visual properties of the images and the users' image sharing patterns, and
then automatically applying the appropriate privacy settings for that image, and
(b) by using discovered users' sharing patters to define access policies
according to the locally enforceable controls on the domain of interest. Beyond
the technical results, this project is developing a framework for understanding
the common classes and categories of images with respect to the users'
understanding of privacy. This framework will enable an understanding of the
images that need protection and help improve user awareness of classes of images
that are often unintentionally or accidentally under-protected.
