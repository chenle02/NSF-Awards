This project will examine the dynamics of energy excitation, migration and
trapping reactions in the Photosystem I core and peripheral antenna complexes of
algae and higher plants. The spectral and temporal properties of excitation
decay will be measured using several picosecond-resolved spectroscopic
techniques. Biochemical and genetic manipulations of the photosystem apparatus
will be used to simplify and dissect the Photosystem I antennae. The
photosynthetic conversion of light energy into biologically useful compounds in
bacteria, algae and higher plants provides the ultimate energy source for much
of life on earth. The initial steps of photosynthesis are in the photophysical
and photochemical domains and are localized in several types of pigment-protein
complexes that function either as reaction center or light-harvesting antenna
complexes. The complex antenna system efficiently absorbs and transfers light
energy to the reaction centers. The reaction centers are the site of the
photochemical energy transduction. The reaction center and its energetically
coupled antenna pigments are the functional definition of the photosynthetic
unit.
