Detailed plasma and surface modelling are combined with experiments to
understand the fundamental and practical relationships between synthesis and
material properties. Experiments involving 5-15 keV pulsed and/or continuous
plasma sheets passing over a substrate at well controlled heights will be
conducted to investigate the deposition of Si from silane for improved silicon
film formation. By varying the pulse shape, beam height and process gas, the
energy and type of species arriving at the substrate can be controlled, and
hence resultant material properties as well. These studies are combined with
modelling of plasma chemistry and surface kinetics to enable the structure and
properties of the deposited materials to be predicted from arrival flux
characteristics. %%% A new approach called pulsed electron beam generated plasma
atomic layer deposition(PEGPAD) is proposed as a method to deposit improved
semiconductor films. This innovative processing technique allows independent
control of plasma generated species, their energy, and the substrate
temaperature, yet is potentially scalable to industrial production levels.
