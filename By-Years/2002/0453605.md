The Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) at California State University
San Bernardino will invite eight nationally selected students to participate in
an eight-week summer research experience in combinatorics and knot theory.
Students from underrepresented groups or from colleges and universities without
doctoral programs have had a significant involvement in this program, and are
especially encouraged to apply. Two faculty mentors will provide background and
introduce potential research problems in both areas, and will then each
collaborate with a group of four students. At the conclusion of the program,
each student gives both oral and poster presentations of their work, and submits
a written paper suitable for publication.

REU students are housed in the university apartments. Weekly outings, both
recreational and educational, build group cohesion and provide breaks from the
rigors of research. Weekly teas, open to the campus community, provide
opportunities to meet faculty and students not involved with the REU program,
and provide a forum for participants to discuss their projects in an informal
setting.
