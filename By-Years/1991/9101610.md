This applicant proposes to study the influence of a known somatic gene mutation
on gonad development is the nematode C. elegans. Specifically, the work will
focus on a molecular and genetic analysis of the gon-1 (gonad abnormality) gene,
including better mapping of the gene and cloning it. Examination of the
developmental processes requiring the gene product will be pursued as well. This
work is planned to take place in the laboratory of Dr. Jonathan Hodgkin at the
Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Medical Research Council, Cambridge, England.
