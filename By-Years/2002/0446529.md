The objective of this work is to establish the mechanisms of combustion of
complex metal particles consisting of two different metals, typically an
aluminum core covered by another metal such as nickel, titanium or zirconium, in
inert or oxidizing atmospheres. The study includes the fundamental processes
that control ignition and combustion of single particles and propagation of
reaction waves in clouds of particles. Influences on combustion of chemistry,
morphology (size and shape), and concentration of particles, as well as
composition of the gas phase, are clarified on both the microscopic (single
particle) and macroscopic (particle cloud) scales. To do this, advanced
experimental techniques are developed based on electrodynamic levitation and
electrodynamic fluidization. Also, computer-assisted electrothermography of
complex metal wires is used to obtain kinetic data on metal-metal and metal-gas
reactions. These data provide a basis for modeling combustion of complex metal
particles, accounting for such characteristics as intermetallic reactions and
cracking of solid shells.

The results of this work are directly relevant for applications in both
materials synthesis and propulsion. Combustion of particle suspensions in gas is
an attractive method for continuous production of intermetallic compounds.
Complex metal particles in rocket propellants offer reduced agglomeration and
lower ignition temperature than pure aluminum.
