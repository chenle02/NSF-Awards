It is proposed to analyze early neural development in embryos of the flatworm
species Macrostomum sp. And Neochildia fusca that can be raised in the lab so
that embryos of all stages can be obtained in sufficient numbers year round.
Flatworms are generally believed to have retained several primitive features of
the common bilaterian ancestor and therefore represent a highly relevant system
to study basic developmental processes, such as establishment of the body axes
and early neurogenesis. Given the basal phylogenetic position of flatworms the
proposed experiments will contribute to our understanding of neural development
and the evolution of molecular networks controlling this process.

Our first aim is to reconstruct normal neurogenesis. Questions are the origin
and pattern of neural progenitors, their proliferation and migration, and the
pattern of axon tracts that emerges as neurons differentiate. These studies will
provide a framework of data in which to interpret the expression pattern of
genes that will be identified as part of the following aims. Aim 2 is the
generation of a cDNA library for both species, which will greatly facilitate the
screen for genes involved in neurogenesis. Aim 3 proposes to use a combined PCI
and library screen approach to identify cognates of the following highly
conserved genes that play fundamental roles in neural development in vertebrates
and invertebrate systems: the regionalization genes vnd, ind, msh, Otx/otd,
Tailless, lab and cad; the proneural genes ato and ASC, and the neural fate
specifying genes of the POU/Homeodomain and LIM/Homeodomain family. Obtaining
probes for these genes will serve two purposes. It will furnish early markers
for neural precursors used to analyze normal neurogenesis at a satisfactory
level of detail. Secondly, the expression pattern of these conserved genes is
expected to provide valuable insight into how they function during neural
patterning in flatworms. This in turn will aid in reconstructing how the
relationship between specific molecular networks and morphogenetic events in
neurogenesis arose during evolution.
