This is an award to support preliminary phases of a project, the objective of
which is to determine the optimal process for removal of mercury from wastewater
treatment plant effluents. The project involves evaluation of alternative
processes for removal of mercury following a preliminary step to characterize
the metal-form of mercury remaining in the wastewater after conventional
treatment. Subsequent steps will include modeling of the potential systems and
consideration of their effect on the base treatment concept. The objective of
this project is to facilitate preliminary studies to address the problem of the
undesirable environmental impact on receiving waters of mercury- concentrations
in wastewater treatment plant effluents. The proposal leading to this award was
submitted for consideration as a Research Planning Grant under conditions
outlined in NSF 87-56, Research Opportunities for Women.
