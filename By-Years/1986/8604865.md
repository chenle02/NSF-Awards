Laser diagnostics are used for the direct detection of atoms and small free
radicals in gas phase reaction system. Highly vibrationally excited polyatomic
molecules are difficult to investigate because their spectra may lack enough
structure to permit unambiguous identification. This direct detection technique
will be used to obtain kinetic data for these species. Such information would be
very useful in modeling gas phase reactions in, for example, thin film prduction
in microelectronics processing by chemical vapor deposition.
