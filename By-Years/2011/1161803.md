The research objective of this award is to develop a quantitative and
mechanistic understanding of how the genomic material of viruses enters the
cells they are infecting. Cells across all domains of life are subjected to
infection by viruses. These viruses have a multitude of different lifestyles
which often involve different ways of introducing their genes into the infected
host. For some of these viruses, it has been hypothesized that mechanical forces
resulting from the tightly-packaged DNA within the virus creates a pressure
which injects the DNA into the host?s interior. Studies conducted under this
award will test this hypothesis by using fluorescence microscopy to watch
individual viruses inject their DNA into individual bacteria and to measure the
rate of ejection. By using different drug treatments, the mechanics of the
ejection process will be perturbed providing a picture of the molecular
processes that drive DNA translocation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful,
these studies will serve as a powerful example of the interplay between the
physical processes that govern the lifestyles of viruses and their biological
functions. Further, since the approach merges single-molecule experiments with
mechanical models, it will help settle a long standing controversy about how
viral infections occur. The research is tightly integrated with an educational
plan that focuses on summer time courses in which undergraduates, graduate
students and postdocs come to the awardee?s institution for an intensive
fortnight of experiments using the study of viral ejection as a paradigm for
single-molecule studies of biological processes which represent one of the
biological frontiers of mechanics.
