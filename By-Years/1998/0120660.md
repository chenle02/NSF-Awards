This award supports the planning and meeting of groups of researchers working on
Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites ranging from the Alaskan tundra to
the Florida Everglades to compare data and develop a cross biome study comparing
carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorous dynamics to test the central scientific
hypothesis that in systems characterized by low nutrient availability, there
exists a pattern of differential nutrient limitation among the primary producers
and the heterotrophs.
