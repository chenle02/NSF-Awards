This grant provides support to broaden participation in the Twenty-first
International Conference on Parallel Architecture and Compilation Techniques
(PACT12), to be held in Minneapolis, Minnesota on September 19-23, 2012. PACT is
the premiere forum to bring together researchers from architecture, compilers,
applications and languages to present and discuss innovative research of common
interests. The grant will primarily fund US citizens/residents, and the highest
priority will be given to under-represented groups. Attending the conference is
an important educational/training experience for the participants and helps
create the next generation of researchers in this area.
