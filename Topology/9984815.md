Farb will continue his joint work with L. Mosher on understanding the asymptotic
geometry of groups. Every finitely-generated group can be viewed as a metric
space in a way which is unique up to maps of bounded distortion. It was recently
discovered that many finitely-generated groups are actually determined uniquely
by their asymptotic geometry. Farb plans to continue his work on this phenomenon
and how it relates to the Mostow Rigidity Theorem, Gromov's Polynomial Growth
Theorem, and the theory of dynamical systems. Farb will also develop and teach a
geometry component in Chicago's SESAME program. This program teaches mathematics
and science to elementary teachers from the Chicago public school system, and
provides them with curriculum tools they can take back to their schools for use
in their classrooms.

Groups are the formal mathematical way to describe symmetry. What symmetries
can a space exhibit? How do the symmetries of a space relate to its geometry,
and to the way that geodesics (light-rays) travel in that space? These are
fundamental issues that occur throughout nature. The mathematical underpinnings
of the theory of symmetry are important not only in understanding known
phenomena, but in discovering new ones. One example is the recently discovered
phenomenon that the coarse, large-scale geometric structure of a space can often
determine the symmetries it can have.
