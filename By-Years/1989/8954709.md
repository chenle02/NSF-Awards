The Scientists Institute for Public Information (SIPI), a non profit
organization of scientists and media professional that works to strengthen
reporting of science, will organize annual briefings for television news
directors and producers by leading scientists during the next three years. Each
year 35- 50 local news directors from across the country will meet face- to-face
with nationally prominent scientists for two days of discussions of leading
stories in science, health and the environment. Science is underreported on
commercial television, and this targeted intervention has a substantial
opportunity to directly improve the quality and quantity of science reporting by
America's television industry. SIPI's Media Resource Service has developed an
international reputation for its provision of scientific and technical sources
for journalists. The prototype TV News Director's Briefing, held March 10-12
1989, demonstrated in a practical way the potential of the project, reaching 35
key journalists from 17 states. The briefings will be attended by a
geographically distributed group of professional scientists and journalists who
are well supported in their discussions by extensive pre-meeting work by SIPI
staff. Extensive news coverage of the topics discussed will take place and be
documented by SIPI staff. A continuing evaluation study by an independent
contractor will analyze the impact of the briefings on the participants. NSF
support will amount to 28% of the $660,000 project total.
