The rates of primary production and new production will be studied at the GOFS
Pacific Ocean time-series sites site, Station Aloha (23oN 158oW) using mixed
layer measurements of oxygen, argon, nitrogen, radon-222 and the stable isotope
ratio of 02. The primary goal is to constrain the rates of biological processes
by comparing results from the geochemical gas method with independent in vitro
incubation experiments and sediment trap fluxes. Proposed sampling frequency is
monthly. Preliminary results demonstrate that highly accurate and precise
measurements of dissolved gas concentrations and isotopic composition can be
made using mass spectrometry. Calculation of oxygen loss to the atmosphere using
data from four cruises at Station P in 1987 and 1988 yield new production rate
estimates within a factor of two of values determined independently by in vitro
incubations and sediment trap measurements. Geochemical and biological
production estimates appear to be consistent in this part of the ocean which is
a dramatic contrast with recent findings in subtropics.
