Analytical an numerical studies will be undertaken in the general area of the
dynamics of classical and quantum spin systems. Specific attention will be
focussed on quantum manifestations of Hamiltonian chaos; one- and two-
dimensional quantum antiferromagnetism at zero and nonzero temperatures as it
relates to high temperature superconductors; and, anomalous spin diffusion in
classical Heisenberg ferromagnets as it relates to the transport of spin
fluctuations in quantum and classical spin models at high temperatures.
