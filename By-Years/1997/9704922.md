ABSTRACT CTS-9704922 An Engineering Foundation Conference is to be held to
explore the technical opportunities and challenges afforded by organized
molecular assemblies in solution and on surfaces. This will be the first
conference of its kind, as other conferences on colloidal systems have been
focused on the fundamental issues with scant attention being paid to the
applications of these structured fluids and interfaces. Funds are requested to
offset partially the registration fees and travel costs of speakers and selected
academic and graduate student attendees at the Conference, titled "Structured
Fluids and Interfaces: Technical Applications and Opportunities for Organized
Molecular Assemblies", which is to be held in Lucca, Italy, during the week of
12-17 January, 1997. ***
