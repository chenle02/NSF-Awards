Funding is provided for exploratory research into the feasibility of combining
Video Plankton Recorder (VPR) technology with Laser Induced Breakdown
Spectroscopy (LIBS) and Raman spectroscopy to remotely identify plankton to the
species level. The PI's will conduct laboratory experiments using known species
of plankton collected from coastal waters and cultures. The resulting data will
be analyzed by combining morphological features from the VPR images with
features obtained from the LIBS and Raman spectral profiles. Using these
combined features, they anticipate being able to improve the detection of
taxonomic resolution down to species level.
