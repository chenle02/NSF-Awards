This award supports the research in Algebraic Combinatorics of Professor Eiichi
Bannai of Ohio State University. He will study P- and Q-polynomial association
schemes, distance-regular graphs and digraphs, and general commutative
association schemes of large class number. His research emphasizes the interplay
of algebraic combinatorics with the theory of finite groups, with the theory of
orthogonal polynomials, and with various representation theories, including the
representation theory of classical and Chevalley groups. This research falls in
the broad category of Combinatorics, which is one of the most active fields in
today's mathematics. Fundamentally, Combinatorics represents a systematization
of the very first of all mathematical activities, counting. In its modern
development, however, Combinatorics has gone beyond just counting to make use of
a wide variety of advanced mathematical techniques, and although its roots go
back several centuries, the field has had an explosive development in the past
few decades because of its importance in communications and information
technology.
