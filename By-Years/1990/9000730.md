GTE Laboratories will select 10 undergraduate students from a nationwide pool
and team them with researchers at GTE to work on pre- selected research projects
during the summer of 1990. This is a continuation of a long-running and
successful program at GTE - Waltham, MA to provide meaningful research
experiences in an industrial setting. Students may select from a long list of
research and development projects currently underway at GTE including
communications theory, networks performance, signal processing, software
engineering and databases. Both oral and written reports are required of all
student participants. GTE provides a unique opportunity for undergraduate
students to learn about real world problems.
