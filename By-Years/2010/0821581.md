The Department of Chemistry at Hamilton College will acquire a computer and disk
space system with this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI)
program. It will serve the computational needs of a consortium of users. The
consortium known as the Molecular Education and Research Consortium in
Undergraduate computational chemistRY (MERCURY) consists of George Shields
(Hamilton College), Maria Gomez (Mount Holyoke College), Carol Parish
(University of Richmond), Marc Zimmer (Connecticut College), Maria Nagan (Truman
State University), Tricia Shepherd (Westminster College), GlÃªnisson de Oliveira
(Rhode Island College), Micah Abrams (University of Central Arkansas), Mauricio
Cafiero (Rhodes College), Kelling Donald (University of Richmond), Becky
Eggimann (Wheaton College), Karl Kirschner (Hamilton College), Daqing Gao
(Queensborough Community College of CUNY), and Eric Patterson (Truman State
University). The requested instrumentation will be shared among the MERCURY
Consortium to investigate problems using techniques common to the theoretical
and computational chemistry community.

This computer will provide enabling computational technology to understand the
properties of matter. The research projects undertaken will utilize
computational tools to solve significant problems in atmospheric, biological,
inorganic, materials, organic, and physical chemistry. The research will be
largely conducted by a diverse body of undergraduates who will receive valuable
training using up-to-date computer hardware and computational techniques.
