Abstract OPP-0120174

The international survey of living conditions among indigenous peoples across
the Arctic involves a partnership of researchers and indigenous organizations in
Greenland, Canada, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Russia, and the United
States. This portion of the project focuses on indigenous households in Alaska's
North Slope, Northwest Arctic, and Bering Straits regions. The goal of the
international study is to develop an integrated set of individual, household,
community, and regional databases for use in comparative analyses of living
conditions among Arctic populations.
