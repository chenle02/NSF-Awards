In this project, the classical problem of laminar-turbulent transition in fluid
dynamics is addressed from the perspective of stability theory. Recently D.J.
Benney and the principal investigator developed a nonlinear stability theory
which emphasizes mean flow/first harmonic interaction and the importance of the
evolution of three-dimensional disturbances in shear flows. The principal
investigator plans to develop this theory further for a number of applications.
These include (1) the classical plane Couette flow which is linearly stable; (2)
free stream disturbances and the problem of boundary layer receptivity; (3)
compressible boundary layers; and (4) unbounded flows with inflectional profiles
such as wakes and shear layers.
