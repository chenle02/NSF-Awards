The lectures are named in honor of Professor Emeritus A. H. Clifford of Tulane
University. The Clifford Lectures bring together mathematicians and students in
what has become a vital part of mathematics at Tulane University and other
universities of the South. In the past the Lectures have concentrated on a
particular area of mathematics which changed from year to year. In 1993 the
Lectures will involve many areas of mathematics. Professor Diaconis will present
a series of talks entitled "Geometry and Randomness" which will develop and use
mathematics in the fields of geometry, probability, and algebra. The Clifford
Lectures 1993 will be held March 29 - April 2, at Tulane University.
