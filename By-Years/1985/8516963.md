Fretting is classified as the type of wear which occurs as a result of low
amplitude vibrations found in mechanical joints, supports, flanges, wires, steel
ropes, flexible cables, and the like. The problem associated with fretting wear
is generation of surface cracks at contacts by fretting and eventual fatigue
fracture of the structure by propagation of such cracks. This research is
directedf toward a fundamental study of fretting wear and the effect of
controlling variables such as the contact stress, displacement amplitude,
frequency, and materials parameters. The munerical result of this investigation
will be presented in "Fretting Maps", to provide design guidelines for other
tribologists and designers.
