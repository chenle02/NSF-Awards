9610269 Montgomery Shallow landslides repeatedly cause loss of life, injury,
and economic and environmental damage in the mountainous regions of the country
and the world. Assessment of slope instability and debris flow initiation is the
topic of this project in which four main issues will be addressed: (1)
determining the input parameters for use in physically based slope stability
models: (2) testing of predictions of the rainfall required to trigger
landsliding and mobilization of a debris flow; (3) identifying the deformation
mechanisms that produce debris flows: and (4) modeling long-term erosion rates
by shallow landsliding. The data generated in the initial field work will be
used in developing a deterministic slope stability model. The resulting
predictions will be tested in a field experiment designed to trigger slope
failure. The results will then be used to guide stochastic modeling and
empirical studies for establishing long- term models of sediment transport by
landsliding, and hence for identifying risk. The results of this project will
demonstrate the utility and limits of models representing field conditions which
in turn can be sued to assess and mitigate this hazard. ***
