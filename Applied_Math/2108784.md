This project will focus on fundamental mathematical research to provide a better
understanding of the behavior of materials that compose batteries, and materials
for use in the next-generation of robots. This fundamental understanding will be
translated into new computer methods for accurately predicting the behavior of
such materials. Together, the fundamental understanding and predictive methods
will enable the systematic design of new materials with much better properties
than currently available, as well as being faster and less expensive than
current trial-and-error laboratory experiments. The new materials can enable new
technologies, with significant societal and economic benefits to the US.
Training of students and outreach activities will be integrated with the
research program.

The scientific goal of this project is to use variational techniques to
characterize the response of materials and structures due to microstructure in
models of batteries and robotics materials. While the scope is broad in terms of
application to engineering and science, the research is mathematically unified
through the framework of the calculus of variations. In analyzing fracture
within batteries, the project will integrate disparate bodies of knowledge on
fluid-fluid and solid-solid phase transitions, and electrochemistry with
fracture mechanics. With regards to soft robotics, the project will consider a
phase-field model for micromagnetics which incorporates microstructure and long-
range electric/magnetic interactions, as arising from Maxwell's equations.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
