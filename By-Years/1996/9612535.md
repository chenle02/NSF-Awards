Binaut The objective of this award is to support all components of the review
process of the Terrestrial Ecology and Global Change Program. This is a special
interagency competition involving NSF, DOE, NASA, and USDA. The work to support
all aspects of the review is needed as this special competition is in addition
to the normal programs normally run in the Division of Environmental Biology.
The announcement is expected to generate about 150 proposals, and the
interagency review and decision making requires communication and coordination
between representatives of the four primary agencies and additional agencies
interested in global change research. Friday Services Systems is experienced in
supporting such review efforts, and their cost-estimate for the work was deemed
cost-effective and responsive to the statement of work provide by NSF. Their
services will help insure a careful, thorough, and effective evaluation of the
submitted proposals.
