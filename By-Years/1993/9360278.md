9360278 Ebert Under law, all 50 U.S. states maintain an historical preservation
office which records information on significant archaeological and historical
sites within the state. The data themselves and their method of recording vary
and no standard system exists. Most states now wish to utilize geographic
information systems (GIS) both for storage and data analysis but almost none
have actually begun such work. Ebert and Associates will conduct a multistate
survey. They will determine the nature of data bases and perceived user needs.
They will then design a system which will be useable nationwide. The result will
both allow individual states to save a great deal of effort, provide users easy
access and ensure compatibility across states. The potential benefits are great.
