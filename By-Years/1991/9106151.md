The School of Mathematics of the Institute for Advanced Study will purchase six
Sparc-2 work-stations, one with graphics capacity, and one Sun server to support
research in three projects. The major project is in computational fluid dynamics
and will entail numerical work in, at least, the following domains: high
resolution methods for compressible and incompressible flow; vortex methods;
combustion; fast summation methods; wavelets; real-space renormalization in the
context of vortex methods; turbulence theory; the dynamics of superfluids. In
addition there are smaller projects in computational number theory and in
percolation theory.
