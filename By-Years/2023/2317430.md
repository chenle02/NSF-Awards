Addressing pressing public health challenges, such as controlling outbreaks of
infectious diseases and managing chronic conditions, is critical for societal
well-being. However, uptake of crucial healthcare resources, such as vaccines
and preventive health screenings, is often suboptimal. As such, finding ways to
develop evidence-based interventions to promote positive health behaviors is of
the utmost importance. For scientific research to truly guide public health
efforts, it is essential to a) understand why interventions capitalizing on
knowledge of human behavior work in some settings but fail to reproduce similar
effects in others; and b) examine when deploying a given intervention will be
most successful at changing actual behavior in the field.

This interdisciplinary proposal combines insights from psychology and behavioral
economics, to understand when and among whom behavioral interventions can
effectively change individualsâ€™ health behaviors in natural settings as well as
how to optimally combine different types of interventions. The proposed research
will leverage large-scale randomized controlled trials (RCTs), lab experiments,
archival data, and machine learning to examine a wide range of consequential
health behaviors (COVID-19 and flu vaccinations, cancer screening uptake,
chronic condition management). The resulting knowledge helps develop nuanced
theories of health decision making and advance the scientific frontier of
building demand for vaccines and preventive screenings. Additionally, it
provides valuable insights into the sources of heterogeneity that may explain
why promising scientific findings fail to replicate in certain settings.
Ultimately, this research has the potential to enhance the impact and reach of
public health initiatives by offering actionable insights for customizing
interventions to specific sub-populations and temporal contexts.
