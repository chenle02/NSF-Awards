This project will examine the intersection of expertise, technology, and
standards through a study of how surgeons and patients are using surgery to
conform to and to redefine social norms. With advances in medical technologies
and changing conceptions of the body, this study will document mechanisms of
individual bodily modifications through elective medical procedures within a
social-cultural context. This study will yield practical strategies for
improving communication between patients and doctors and to explore the effects
of markets and healthcare systems in multi-cultural contexts.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project proposes an ethnographic comparison
of surgery in two multicultural communities. Through systematic observations of
clinical encounters in cosmetic surgery clinics and interviews with surgeons and
patients, the study will investigate how surgeons and patients are relating
specific physical features to group identities and what the implications are for
communities, healthcare systems and medical practices. This study will extend
theorization on classification and re-classification in (bio)medicine; and
medical technologies and changing conceptions of the body in society.
