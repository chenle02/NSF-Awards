Marine life in the upper layers of the sea may be endangered by increased UV
radiation resulting from reduction in the thickness of the ozone layer. The
potential hazard to marine phytoplankton is based upon the knowledge that middle
ultraviolet radiation (MUV, 280-340 nm) can penetrate to ecologically
significant depths in natural waters and the possibility that MUV may have
adverse effects on phytoplankton populations. The direct effects of increased UV
on in-situ phytoplankton have not been estimated, although this is the only
adequate measure of the potential impact. This research will make a sensitivity
analysis of factors influencing the penetration of UV into natural waters based
upon existing UV models for the atmosphere and ocean and using TOMS ozone data
as input. In addition, this project will focus on equipment development, with a
modification or redesign of the existing (and outmoded) ultraviolet submersible
spectroradiometer for use in the Antarctic. The model and equipment development
are a major step necessary prior to the testing of the hypothesis that
phytoplankton, and other subsequently impacted components of the aquatic food
web, are endangered by ozone diminution.
