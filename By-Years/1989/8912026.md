The principal investigators recently produced the first high-molecular-weight
polymers by metathesis polymerization of acyclic dienes with a tungsten-derived
catalyst. It is now the goal of this research to broaden this new synthetic
procedure to the preparation of a variety of novel materials with precisely
defined architecture. Materials derived from nonconjugated, acyclic dienes will
be prepared with chiral centers, electrical conductivity, high rigidity or high
flexibility, or with polar groups such as esters, ethers, and heterocycles. An
additional objective is to investigate the creation of better catalysts for
acyclic diene metathesis polymerization. This research is jointly funded by the
Divisions of Materials Research and of Chemistry, under the Materials Chemistry
and Chemical Processing Initiative.//
