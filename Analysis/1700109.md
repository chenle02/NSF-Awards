Many questions in mathematics come with a set of symmetries that has a so-called
group structure. Exploring the dynamics of underlying group actions, namely to
study how points in spaces behave under symmetries, has recently played a
central role in proving important results and resolving longstanding questions
in mathematics. The overall aim of this research project is to advance the
technique of using dynamics of group actions as a powerful tool to study
questions that arise in algebra, geometry, and number theory, and to gain a
deeper understanding of the connections between these mathematical fields.

In this project special attention will be given to the following three
directions: (1) Develop reduction theory of indefinite integral quadratic forms
and consider its generalization to number fields using methods of dynamical
systems. (2) Investigate random walks on Lie groups and equidistribution
problems in homogenous spaces in light of recent developments in spectral theory
and the theory of automorphic forms. (3) Study the height bounds of generators
of arithmetic groups incorporating dynamical methods into classical algebraic
and geometric theory of arithmetic groups. The project also aims to seek new
interactions and develop the techniques in the study of groups, dynamics, and
number theory.
