The focus of the research is five-fold. Studies will be conducted on the
synthesis and chemistry of novel single-atom peri-bridged arenes and their
derivatives; the products, stereochemistry and mechanisms of pentacoordinate
addition-rearrangement-reactions of alpha-haloalkylsilanes with nucleophiles
will be probed; new reagents and methods will be developed for generating diazo
compounds, their carbenes and subsequent products; studies will be carried out
to better understand steric and electrical effects in carbenic reaarangement
processes and the chemistry of metallodiazo compounds and metallocarbenes. With
this renewal award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of
Dr. Harold Shechter of the Department of Chemistry at Ohio State University.
Professor Shechter will probe a variety of novel structure types and chemical
reactions. These include pentacoordinate silicon compounds, strained-bridged
aromatics, and unusual carbenoid compounds and precursors.
