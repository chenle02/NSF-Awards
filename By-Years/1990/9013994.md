The question of how processor scheduling should be done in a parallel
timesharing environment will be investigated. Scheduling must be balanced
between giving parallel applications access to CPUs they require, and
maintaining interactivity and throughput. An understanding of this conflict
requires the development of a parallel workload characterization. Since the
workload changes nonlinearly, an iterative solution to resolve this dynamical
system problem will be implemented on the Cray Y- MP/864 at SDSC.
