9550538 Meyers This materials development project is the result of a joint
effort by Miami University and the National Science Teachers Association (NSTA).
The project will combine the resources of the Univeristy and the publication
department of NSTA, to work with schools to produce an innovative science
journal for children in grades 3-6, a teacher support manual, a parent support
manual, and a supporting computer network that will connect children with
scientists and university science students in scientific inquiry. The journal
will be the first national journal devoted to research scientists and children
with an outlet for publication of scientific investigations conducted by
children. Given the strong record of accomplishment of the PI and the
publications division of the National Science Teachers Association, the panel
feel it is likely that the Dragonfly, Dragonfly Companions. the Dragonfly Net
will be a quality product and recommends funding this project at a high priority
level. The Program Officer agrees with the panel and recommends funding this
proposal.
