The Philadelphia Zoo proposes a design and evaluate a series of carry-along
kits for families to use during Zoo visits and at home afterwards. The materials
and devices in the kits will help all members of the family strengthen their
science process skills and upgrade their knowledge. Evaluation will be a key
part of the design process as materials are mocked up and tested, with results
feeding directly back into the design process. A design team will integrate
scientists, educators, cognitive development researchers and designers who will
work collaboratively to develop the kits, drawing on the resources of a diverse
advisory committee.
