Tamar Seideman of Northwestern University is supported by the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry and Materials Theory Programs to develop and apply
quantum mechanical methods in understanding current-triggered dynamics in
molecular-scale devices. This research will address effects due to both the
electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom, and employs scattering methods to
describe electron transport. Applications include modeling currents across
electrodes and across tips in scanning tunneling microscopy
experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many new technologies are possible if
molecular-scale electronic transport could be understood and controlled. The
outcomes of this research will enhance fundamental understanding of conductance
at the molecular level, explore new ways of manipulating matter at the nanometer
scale, and potentially contribute to discoveries of new phenomena in the
nanotechnology.
