Wolbachia are maternally inherited bacteria that are found in a wide range of
arthropods and filarial nematodes. The proposed research will use Neotropical
fig wasps as a model system to study the dynamics and fitness effects of
Wolbachia in their insect hosts. Specifically, the proposed research will
investigate: 1) the population dynamics of Wolbachia, 2) the effects of
Wolbachia on their hosts' reproduction, 3) the molecular evolution of Wolbachia
and the effects of Wolbachia on mitochondrial and nuclear DNA variation in host
populations, and 4) the ecological and evolutionary transmission of Wolbachia.
Ultimately, combination of these data will provide the clearest picture yet of
how transmission patterns, host population structure, and Wolbachia effects on
host reproduction interact to influence Wolbachia dynamics in natural host
populations.

BECAUSE OF THEIR WIDESPREAD DISTRIBUTION AND THEIR VARIED PHENOTYPIC EFFECTS AND
ABILITY TO MANIPULATE THEIR HOSTS IN NUMEROUS WAYS, WOLBACHIA CURRENTLY ARE OF
INTEREST TO A BROAD SPECTRUM OF BIOLOGISTS INCLUDING THOSE STUDYING HOST-
PARASITE EVOLUTION, EVOLUTION OF VIRULENCE, INTRAGENOMIC CONFLICT, SELFISH
GENETIC ELEMENTS, POPULATION GENETICS, AND EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY IN GENERAL.
IMPORTANTLY, BECAUSE WOLBACHIA OCCUR IN A NUMBER OF HOST SPECIES THAT ARE
ASSOCIATED WITH SERIOUS HUMAN DISEASES, INCLUDING MOSQUITOES, TSETSE FLIES, AND
FILARIAL NEMATODES, THESE MICROBES MAY PROVE TO BE USEFUL AGENTS FOR BIOLOGICAL
MANIPULATION OF THESE SPECIES, FOR INSTANCE BY DRIVING THE SPREAD OF GENES
CONFERRING RESISTANCE TO PARASITES OR SUSCEPTIBILITY TO PESTICIDES. THE PROPOSED
EXPERIMENTS WILL ADDRESS BOTH THE SHORT- AND LONG-TERM DYNAMICS OF WOLBACHIA AND
MITOCHONDRIAL EVOLUTION WITHIN FIG WASPS AND WILL BE RELEVANT TO DETERMINING
WHETHER WOLBACHIA CAN DRIVE SLIGHTLY DELETERIOUS, MATERNALLY INHERITED GENES
INTO A POPULATION.
