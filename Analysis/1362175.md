Complex analysis in one and several variables occupies a central place in
mathematics and mathematical physics. The use of complex numbers is essential in
the development of mathematics. The concept of phase in complex analysis, for
example, is commonly used in control theory, image analysis and dynamical
systems. Certain important structures in physics arise from an integration of
complex analysis with partial differential equations. Partial differential
equations and several complex variables are also used in String and Twister
mathematical physical theories that try to unify different physical force
fields. For all these applications, foundational questions concerning the
solution of such partial differential equations under certain geometric
constraints are still not fully understood and they form some of the most
challenging problems in mathematics. The current study is not only important for
the development in mathematics, but it may lead to new understanding of physical
phenomena with potential applications in other sciences and technology.

This research will focus on some of the most important equations in several
complex variables, including the Cauchy-Riemann equations and the induced
tangential Cauchy- Riemann equations. The problems discussed in this proposal
include function theory on complex manifolds, Hausdorff property of Dolbeault
cohomology groups, Levi-flat hypersur- faces and complex foliation, the Cauchy-
Riemann operators on complex pro jective spaces and negatively curved manifolds.
Understanding the geometric aspects of these equations under the curvature
conditions and their relations with function theory in complex manifolds is one
of the most challenging and important problems in complex analysis and geometry.
New approaches have been introduced to study these problems which connect the
topology of domains in complex manifolds with the topology of Dolbeault
cohomology groups. Regularity of the solutions to the Cauchy-Riemann equations
are related to the foliation theory on the boundary. The study of several
complex variables in a geometric setting has provided interesting new questions
with fresh insight to problems in topology, foliation theory, complex dynamics,
algebraic and complex geometry. The solution of these questions will advance our
knowledge in all the aforementioned areas. Complex geometric theory has only
just begun to develop and more efforts will be directed in this direction.
Geometric measure theory and harmonic analysis will also be applied to study
several com- plex variables on non-smooth domains. These problems are at the
intersection of analysis, geometry and topology with applications in applied
mathematics and physics.
