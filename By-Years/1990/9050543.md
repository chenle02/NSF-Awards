The aim of this project is to enhance the laboratory experience of undergraduate
Electrical Engineering students in the area of Digital Signal Processing (DSP).
This is accomplished through the acquisition of six laboratory workstations and
the establishment of a Digital Signal Processing Laboratory. Each station
consists of a second generation TMS320 Signal Processor based algorithm
development system, an Analog Interface Board (AIB), a Spectrum Analyzer and a
Personal Computer. The DSP course and the Senior Design Project course are the
primary targets of this laboratory enhancement. Students are able to develop and
implement a wide variety of projects in the area of Digital Filtering, Spectrum
Analysis, Speech Processing and Digital Control Systems. This project offers the
students hands-on experience and a more comprehensive understanding of the
concepts than can be obtained through lecture alone. The award is being matched
by an equal amount from the principal investigator's institution.
