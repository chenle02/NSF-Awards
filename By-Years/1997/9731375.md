9731375 Schoen The PRIME-TEAM project is a two-year high school mathematics
professional development and curricular implementation project for 65 lead
teachers in nineteen Iowa schools/districts. As a Teacher Leadership project, it
builds the teacher infrastructure needed for a future, planned scale-up and
school-wide implementation of the Core-Plus instructional materials in
participating schools/districts. Each participant is involved in 168 hours of
comprehensive professional development through summer workshops, academic year
activities, and reflective teaching of the Core Plus materials. Project
evaluation utilizes protocols and instruments from the Local Systemic Change
Core Evaluation, together with student achievement data from standardized,
national instruments administered in each school/district. Cost sharing, derived
primarily from participating districts/schools, is approximately 90% of the NSF
request.
