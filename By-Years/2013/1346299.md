This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will develop
world?s first commercial diode pumped mode-locked titanium sapphire fiber laser
based on visible laser diodes pumping a titanium sapphire fiber. By using direct
semiconductor laser diode pumps as the engine, and fiber as the gain medium,
this two stage fiber laser design approach represents a paradigm shift away from
conventional fragile, expensive bulky four stage solid state crystal laser
cavities, which utilize diode pumped second harmonic green lasers for pumping
titanium sapphire. Therefore, this project has substantial technical merit
because it aims to pioneer and commercialize a new class of visible laser diode
pumped fiber laser technology and provide substantial learning into laser and
fiber optic materials technology.

The broader impact/commercial potential of this project for the biomedical
imaging community would be transformative, expanding the adoption of advanced
nonlinear imaging techniques beyond the elite research institutions, and making
them available to the broader biomedical imaging community in hospitals and
commercial companies conducting bio-research. The laser enables a multi-photon
absorption and single photon emission process for deep, high resolution live
tissue imaging that provides insights into study stem cell biology, the cellular
effects of human disease, physiology, neurobiology, embryology and tissue
engineering. Additionally, the laser?s high peak powers has ablative that can be
leveraged to address ophthalmic and ablative surgery, precision materials
processing, and tattoo removal. This system is designed to address the needs of
the large and growing multi-photon imaging and biomedical systems market
segment, and replace the excessively expensive and complex modelocked titanium
sapphire lasers systems.
