In this project funded by the Advanced Materials Chemistry Program in the
Special Projects Office of the Chemistry Division, Gordon will conduct
fundamental research on a low-temperature chemical vapor deposition (CVD)
process for early transition metals such as titanium, zirconium, or hafnium. The
approach will be to synthesize novel precursor compounds containing hydrogenated
aromatic ligands which should decompose cleanly into metal hydride films and
very stable aromatic byproduct vapors. The metal hydride films would then be
dissociated into the metal and hydrogen by heating to higher temperatures. The
deposited metals will be fully characterized for composition and structure as
well as for thickness, electrical resistance, surface morphology, and step
coverage using various spectroscopic and microscopic tools. Since no low-
temperature CVD processes are currently known for any of the early transition
metals, successful discovery and development of a low-temperature CVD process
for deposition of these metals should have an important impact on CVD of
semiconductors and non-metals. Various electronic and optical applications, such
as solar cells, smart windows, flat-panel displays, corrosion-resistant
coatings, and other thin-film applications will be affected.
