Bodega Marine Laboratory (associated with the University of California, Davis)
is located on the north coast of California, and facilitates study of the marine
shelf, rocky and sandy shallow-subtidal and intertidal zones, and diverse land-
margin habitats. The lab hosts resident and visiting researchers as well as
graduate and undergraduate training. Resident staff at the lab has recently
expanded to include staff researchers and a data manager for their environmental
database. A plan for expanding the lab's physical plant has been approved by the
University of California system. Research emphasis will expand in population
biology, cellular and organismic biology, and aquaculture and fisheries. Lab
Director James Clegg proposes construction of a housing duplex for visiting
faculty families to increase the lab's use by investigators at other
institutions. Research at the Bodega Marine Lab is diverse and of high quality.
Expanding the housing facilities at the Lab will attract more and better
scholars and students to this unique setting. The proposed construction will
benefit research and education across the spectrum of marine biological
disciplines.
