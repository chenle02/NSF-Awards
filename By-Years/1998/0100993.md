0100993&lt;br/&gt;Foecke&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sixth International Conference
on the Fundamentals of Fracture is the latest in a series of meetings, held
every four years, that assembles researchers to discuss the latest in
theoretical and experimental research in the field of fracture. The wide-ranging
discussions are held in locations that rotate around the globe from Asia to
Europe and the United States. Its purpose is to foster collaborations and
information exchanges among the best and brightest in the field of fracture. It
has been especially successful in introducing a host of graduate students and
post-docs to senior researchers and has led to the development of a significant
number of new, long-standing relationships. This series of meetings is
specifically dedicated to the science of fracture. The list of topics shows the
organizing committee's desire to cover a broad range of materials systems and
physical aspects of fracture. The preliminary list of topics include: atomistics
of fracture, mesoscopic scale modelling, multiscale phenomena &amp; modelling,
crack dynamics, steels &amp; other engineering materials, environmental effects,
fundamentals of fatigue, and interfacial fracture.Support in the amount of $5K
is provided to fund graduate student and post-doctoral attendee fellowships to
maximize attendance from these groups that are traditionally under-represented
at international meetings. &lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;With the exception of
isolated symposia within national meetings, such as the MRS, there are no
meetings specifically dedicated to the science of fracture. The closest one is
the International Congress on Fracture held every 3 years (the last one held in
Australia in 1997). That series of meetings has an engineering-oriented flavor
and does not deal with fundamental scientific issues. &lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
