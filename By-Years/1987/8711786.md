This research will evaluate the role of micro-organisms in the scavenging and
removal of Mn in the vicinity of extended hydrothermal vent plumes. Field
experiments in the northeast Pacific are planned to detect mechanisms for
packaging Mn into particles and mechanisms for transporting these particles to
the sediments. The sampling will be based on the conceptual model that capsuled
marine bacteria package the Mn into parti- cles and that zooplankton graze the
particles and repackage them in large fecal pellets that sediment rapidly to the
sea floor. The biotic and abiotic Mn-removal mechanisms will be differentiated
by the use of metabolic inhibitors. This work will enhance our understanding of
the removal of transition- metals from seawater, our understanding of the role
of biolo- gical processes in chemical transformations in seawater, and our
understanding of the role of hydrothermal vents in geochemical metal cycling.
