9317097 Kambysellis Craddock This award supports collaboration between Michael
Kambysellis, New York University, and Peng Tongxu, Guangdong Entomological
Institute, on the evolution of Chinese Drosophila and the comparison of the
biology of island endemic species (Hawaii) with species endemic to continents.
This will be a multiyear collaboration with part of the work being carried out
in Guangzhou and part in New York. The collaborative arrangements will provide
the opportunity to examine the speciose Chinese Drosophila fauna and make
comparisons to the extraordinary drosophila fauna of the Hawaiian Island. This
work contributes to the current worldwide efforts to understand and catalogue
global biodiversity. The project will involve participation of graduate students
in both China and the United States.
