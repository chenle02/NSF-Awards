The objective of this proposed research is to study the mechanical properties
of lightweight, very highly porous ceramics. Specific objectives of this
research include analysis of the tensile and compressive strengths and the crack
growth mechanism during failure. These results will be used to model this
important class of materials and to test and modify theories for the behavior of
open cell ceramic structures and sandwich structures with open cell ceramic
cores. This research will concentrate on studies of cellular carbon materials,
including coated materials that form sandwich structures.
