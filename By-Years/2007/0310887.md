Undergraduate labs in developmental biology are usually limited to experiments
in classical embryology, and the experimental offerings do not include advances
made using modern molecular and genetic tools. This project is adapting and
implementing methods from the research literature into the undergraduate
classroom in two modules. The first module is adapting electroporation
technology for chicken embryos, so students can introduce DNA constructs
containing molecules that can specify limb type or induce ectopic wing
formation. The second module involves introducing morpholinos into zebrafish
embryos to reduce translation of specific molecules that affect heart
development. The proposed changes update traditional laboratories offered in the
Duke course, Experiments in Development and Molecular Genetics, by introducing
molecular technology. Because the chickens and zebrafish are widely available
and easy to culture, these exercises may have broad appeal for instructors
interested in adding molecular technology to developmental biology laboratories.
Therefore, descriptions of the exercises are being submitted to educational
journals for publication, made available on the web and publicized at meetings.
The broader impacts of the project include: the enhancement of faculty
development and the integration of research and technology in undergraduate
education.&lt;br/&gt;
