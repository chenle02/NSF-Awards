With support from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Division of Chemistry,
Dr. Liming Zhang of the University of California at Santa Barbara is developing
new catalysts derived from gold. These catalysts are used to speed up chemical
reactions on organic molecules with very precise control of the products formed.
These catalysis reactions convert simple molecules to those of greater
complexity that can then be used as building blocks in drug discovery,
biomedical research, and materials science. The building these target molecules
is often the most difficult part of the entire synthetic process. The research
described is conducted by undergraduate and graduate students and prepares them
as the next generation of the STEM workforce. Dr. Zhang is also involved in
outreach efforts targeting underrepresented minorities and high school students.
In addition, Dr. Zhang is incorporating gold catalysis into undergraduate
laboratory courses, so that his students know of the industrial benefits of
their research. This work advances the prosperity of the US by promoting
innovation in industry and training of a highly technical workforce.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The functionalization of C(sp3)-H bonds, especially those
that are unactivated, is of great synthetic utility as it enables the
streamlined synthesis of molecules of medicinal- or materials-relevance without
substrate pre-functionalization. This strategy, however, is challenging to
implement due to issues of reactivity and selectivity, and remains
underdeveloped. Dr. Zhang is studying the chemistry of gold vinylidenes
generated from the reaction of terminal ynones with gold catalysts in the
presence of an electrophilic bromination reagent. These vinylidene complexes
then insert into a C-H bond to form a 5- or 6-membered bromocyclopentenone or
bromocyclohexenone. The use of other electrophilic reagents, the tuning of the
vinylidene reactivity, and the insertion into more remote C-H bonds are also
studied as these alterations provide synthetic flexibility and access to a range
of valuable structures. Dr. Zhang is also studying the activation of alkynes or
allenes towards electrophilic attack by gold catalysts. These are either
intermolecular reactions with challenging nucleophiles, or in intramolecular
reactions with heteroatom nucleophiles that produce valuable heterocycles.
Enantioselective catalysis with catalysts that bear chiral phosphine or
N-heterocyclic carbene ligands specifically tailored to the linear structures of
gold(I) complexes are also of interest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
