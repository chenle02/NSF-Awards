The recent acquisition of an Atomic Absorption (AA) Spectrometer by the
Chemistry Department at Chestnut Hill College is significantly broadening the
laboratory experience and improving the instruction of undergraduate students
majoring in chemistry and biochemistry. The experience of working with an AA
Spectrometer is of increasing importance to chemistry and biochemistry majors,
whether they seek employment in analytical laboratories or plan to pursue
further research in graduate school or industry. The introduction of this
technique into advanced organic, biochemical, and instrumental courses ensures
that the college's graduates receive the training necessary for careers as
chemists and biochemists.
