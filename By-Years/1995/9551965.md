The university is developing a vertically integrated hands-on component for the
mechanical engineering curriculum, which provides timely exposure to state-of-
the-art equipment and experimental techniques. The new approach provides for
dovetailing of the experiments with the theory leading to better comprehension
and retention of engineering fundamentals for the students. It also builds on
the previous experiments and theory, enhancing and reinforcing those topics. As
such it will be an application of vertical integration of just-in-time
experimentation. This new program fits well into the overall curriculum revision
the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Engineering Science has undertaken.
The faculty of the department are strongly committed to this curriculum
revision. This hands-on component of the curriculum is being utilized starting
freshman year and continuilg throughout the rest of the curriculum. To
accomplish their goals, the faculty have identified specific areas and
equipment. These areas are instrumentation, data acquisition, fluid mechanics,
heat transfer, kinematics, controls, and manufacturing. The faculty believe such
a curriculum can benefit the students and can be used as a national model that
integrates the various curriculum revision trends.
