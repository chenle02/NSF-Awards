The principal investigator intends primarily to pursue the goal of attacking
some of the fundamental problems of the Langlands program by means of analytic
methods. He is most interested in the case of base change for holomorphic forms
on GL(2) where a non-soluble base change is involved, but the proposed methods
should work much more generally. At present the intention is to permit the use
of the Riemann Hypothesis (in an appropriate setting) to achieve this goal. A
second goal of the proposal is to study some of the fundamental analytic
questions on L-functions.

This proposal is ultimately concerned with finding methods to solve equations.
Since the nineteenth century it has been known that certain equations have
formulas (like the quadratic equation and the cubic equation) but that most do
not. The cases that interest me are the equations with ordinary integer
coefficients. It has become apparent in the last fifty years that there should
be a completely different way of studying these general equations by using
methods from analysis (i.e. derived from calculus) rather than by using methods
from algebra. The idea is to describe and prove many properties of the solutions
(which still exist even though there may be no formulas for them).
