This research employs Kelvin probes to study the corrosion behavior of metallic
surfaces. The investigators are constructing a potentiostat/galvanostat system
using the Kelvin vibrator as a contactless reference electrode. The Kelvin probe
is a sensor for determining the corrosion potential of materials exposed to thin
film electrolytes. This system is used for the measurement of the corrosion
potential and corrosion current versus time of homogeneous and of galvanically
coupled metals under very thin electrolyte layers and humidity films. The devise
is also used to determine effects of substrate-induced heterogeneities and
defects on the semiconducting properties of anodically grown titanium dioxide.
%%% This research is making significant strides in new understanding of
atmospheric corrosion. The Kelvin probe permits electrochemical measurements
through precisely controlled electrolyte films within specific pollutant
atmospheres.
