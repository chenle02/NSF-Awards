A physics-based hillslope rainfall-runoff model developed in 1983 by Smith &amp;
Hubbert (S-H) will be used to create hydrographs for specified climatic input
time series, soil type, and hillslope geometry. A conceptual rainfall-runoff
will be calibrated and then tested with inputs not contained within the range
used for the calibration. Comparisons between the two models for extreme
conditions will be made considering: elemental hillslope slices, first order
catchments comprised of many hillslope elements, and combinations of N first-
order catchments, with N typically equal to three. Experiments will be also
conducted to examine the probability distributions of flood hydrographs
generated from elemental hillslopes.
