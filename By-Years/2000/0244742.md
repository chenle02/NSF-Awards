Professor Thomas Wenzel of Bates College is supported by the Analytical and
Surface Chemistry program to continue work on combining macrocyclic hosts with
lanthanide shift reagents to obtain chiral information about analytes using
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy (NMR).
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Determination of the unique absolute configurations of
certain chemical compounds is extremely important for pharmaceutical and other
biochemical industries. While NMR is not inherently sensitive to the handedness
of molecules, it can be used in this analytical application in combination with
macrocycles that provide environments enabling the exact three dimensional
structures to be determined. In this project, undergraduate students receive
training in synthesis and NMR methods on an industrially relevant topic.
