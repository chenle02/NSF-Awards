Cole 9507285 The goal of this research is to initiate a cellular and genetic
analysis of development during Tetrahymena conjugation. To that end, we will,
1.) Determine developmental dependencies during conjugation. by a combination of
isolating mutants or/and physically manipulating the mating conditions, 2.)
Search for developmental checkpoints by searching for mutations that relieve the
developmental dependency, and 3.) Identify and characterize the functions of
gene products that participate in specific conjugal events. %%% The objective of
this research is to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which
Tetrahymena thermophila, a species of ciliated protozoan, controls its passage
through the complex cytoplasmic and nuclear events associated with mating.
Mutants relevant to this process will be isolated and characterized. Also the
mating conditions will be physically manipulated. ***
