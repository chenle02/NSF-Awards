This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project seeks to develop a
compact, lightweight, and low cost Microlith Water Gas Shift (WGS) reactor
capable of rapid start-up, excellent transient response and high CO conversion
efficiency with very low levels of methane formation. This technology offers a
key low cost contribution to meeting objectives for efficiency and clean
emissions. The Microlith based WGS reactor will be optimized by developing
prototype reactor designs for fuel processor applications, and demonstrating
predicted durability of up to 5000 hours.&lt;br/&gt; Target customers and
markets are fuel processor/fuel cell manufacturers developing and seeking to
sell Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cell products for stationary
residential and distributed power, and for heavy duty vehicles in the short
term, fuel processor/fuel cell manufacturers developing products for automotive
markets in the long term and opportunistically, specialty chemical reactor
applications (e.g. for hydrogen and syngas production and in ammonia synthesis)
where the technology's size and performance.&lt;br/&gt;
