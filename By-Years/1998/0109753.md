This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses an
automated vendor-managed inventory (VMI) system for distributors of small parts.
Small parts inventories introduce several difficulties because of the large
quantities that are maintained and the multitude of different part types that
have similar physical appearances. For such systems, where inventory is stored
in many racks of bins, it is labor intensive to provide continuous
accountability for each part. Distributors are often left with two choices:
maintain high inventory levels to avoid short-term surges in demand; or monitor
levels closely by hand to ensure an adequate supply without unnecessary
overhead. Phase I will develop an economical means of providing real-time usage
statistics for small parts through the use of intelligent electronic sensing
bins. Each bin reports the quantity of parts enclosed to a central
communications module, which in turn compiles a report listing the replenishment
requirements for each part. This information is then provided to vendors so that
they may create a timely order for the customer.

VMI technology will find use by suppliers that wish to provide VMI services to a
large number of small clients. By avoiding continuous human monitoring and
intervention, VMI will be applied to small contracts, resulting in savings for
both parties. This technology is expected to be used in the industrial fastener
market, which is growing at a rate of 3.7% annually.
