With this Research Planning Grant for Women, the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and
Organometallic Chemistry Program supports preliminary research on the effect of
protein environment on the catalytic and redox activity of ferredoxins by
Kristene K. Surerus of the Chemistry Department, University of Wisconsin -
Milwaukee. The long-term goals of the project are to investigate the role of
hydrogen bonding in regulating oxidation-reduction potential of ferredoxins, and
to explore the relationship of ligand environment to catalytic behavior.
Mossbauer spectroscopy will be used to observe changes in ferredoxin behavior.
The research planning period will enable Surerus to test the feasibility of the
experimental design. The findings have implications for development of solid
state catalysts or electronic materials.
