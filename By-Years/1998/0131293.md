&lt;br/&gt;This project will investigate the fluid dynamics of crossflow
filtration in suspension-feeding fishes such as menhaden, anchovy, and carp.
These fishes filter massive volumes of water to extract suspended food particles
that are as small as 5 micrometer to 1 mm in diameter. Although they comprise
approximately 25% of the world fish catch and have filtration efficiencies
approaching those of industrial filters, the mechanisms that they use to trap
their tiny prey remain largely unknown. A miniature fiberoptic endoscope has
been used recently to observe particle movement inside the oral cavities of live
suspension-feeding fishes. These data, combined with computational fluid
dynamics simulations in fish oral cavities, have led to the development of a new
model involving crossflow filtration in suspension-feeding fishes. Although
crossflow filtration is a multi-billion dollar industry for the manufacture of
products that we use every day (e.g., dairy products, beer and wine,
pharmaceuticals), this filtration mechanism had not been recognized previously
in any vertebrate. During crossflow filtration in fishes, particles are
concentrated inside the oral cavity as filtrate exits between the gill rakers,
but particles are not retained on the rakers. Instead, the high-velocity
crossflow along the rakers carries particles away from the raker surfaces and
transports the particles towards the esophagus. Equations from the industrial
filtration engineering literature could be used to calculate the hydrodynamic
forces on particles and the resulting particle velocities and trajectories
during crossflow filtration in fishes. However, values that are appropriate for
suspension-feeding fishes must be used in place of the variables in the
equations. The empirical data needed for the first quantitative analysis of
biological crossflow filtration will be provided by laboratory experiments
involving sonomicrometry, pressure transduction, fiberoptic endoscopy, high-
speed video, and flow velocity measurement with micro-thermistor probes. This
analysis will provide insight into the process of crossflow filtration as it
determines the sizes and densities of particles that suspension-feeding fishes
retain. The study will engage undergraduate and Masters students in
interdisciplinary research that has important ecological, evolutionary, and
engineering implications.
