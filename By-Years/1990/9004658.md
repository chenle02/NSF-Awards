The research project involves statistical resampling methods, analysis of
directional data, survival analysis and semiparametric models. The development
of a unified theory of resampling procedures that covers both the bootstrap and
the jackknife methods will be supported. The resulting elements from k sampled
blocks from a sequence of stationary m-dependent random variables will be used
to provide bootstrap estimators of parameters and the properties of the
estimators will be examined. Questions of robustness of these resampling
procedures will be investigated. Notions of data depth for directional data will
be developed along with nonparametric tests for them and corresponding
classifications of data. Semiparametric models for survival analysis will be be
studied for both censored and non- censored data.
