This Accomplishment-Based Renewal will enable Professor Rogers to continue his
development of methods for refining population estimates for states and other
subnational regions of the United States. During the renewal period, Dr. Rogers
will seek to incorporate factors such as population heterogeneity, net
immigration, inter-metropolitan redistribution, indirect methods for inferring
migration flows from inadequate data, and time series aspects of forecasting
models into standard multiregional population projection models. The research
Dr. Rogers will conduct will result in a deeper understanding of interregional
migration processes generally, and in improved abilities to forecast regional
population change.
