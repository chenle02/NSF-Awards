Circumstellar disks surrounding nearly all newly formed stars are the
birthplaces of planets, and the physical conditions within the disks govern the
formation of planets. This project will use high quality polarization
observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) to
study nearby circumstellar disks in detail. Because polarization mechanisms
depend strongly on wavelength, polarization observations are a sensitive means
to probe the substructures and magnetic fields within circumstellar disks. Using
polarization models, the investigators will explore how disk polarization and
the properties inferred from it evolve over time. Results from this project will
advance astronomersâ€™ understanding of star and planet formation. The project
will train a graduate student in advanced astronomical techniques and
applications, provide research experience to an undergraduate student, and
conduct science outreach to a Native American tribe.

The research team will undertake polarization observations using ALMA to measure
the properties of circumstellar disks, placing them within the context of
exoplanet detections. The research program seeks to: (1) address the discrepancy
between maximum dust grain sizes measured by polarization scattering (~75
micron) and ones inferred from spectral indices (~millimeter); (2) characterize
the differences in observed polarization morphology and intensity with
wavelength for a large sample of sources; (3) measure polarization in an
enlarged sample of young disks to compare their properties to the older T Tauri
disks; and (4) detect disk magnetic fields or place stringent observational
constraints on them.
