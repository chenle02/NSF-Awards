RUI: A Study of the Effects of Magnetic Activity on the Variation of Solar
Luminosity This proposal deals with observations related to contrast features on
the disk of the Sun. These are important since we have found that the solar
irradiance varies in accordance with these contrast features on the solar disk.
The PI's research aims to associate these changes with the various components of
solar activity. This should help to understand energy transport in the sun and
thus the effects of solar activity on the Earth. Past work has shown that
faculae are an important source for irradiance enhancement. The authors will
continue to obtain accurate, daily, full-disk, photometric observations of the
sun at various wavelengths. These allow modelling of irradiance variations in
terms of sunspot, facular, plage, and network areas and intensities. These data
will probe the physics of the interaction of solar magnetic fields with
convective energy outflow. Their work will mostly be undertaken by students,
making this project ideal from NSF's point of view for the future of society.
