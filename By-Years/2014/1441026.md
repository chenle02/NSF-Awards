This grant funds a one-day workshop for researchers who aspire to participate in
NSF's Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program. The workshop is open to
people with research interests in secure and trustworthy computing who are not
currently funded by SaTC or any of its predecessor programs (Trustworthy
Computing and/or Cyber Trust). The goal of this workshop is to help aspiring
SaTC PIs understand what NSF (and NSF review panels) are looking for in
reviewing SaTC proposals, with the goal of increasing the quality of submitted
proposals and, in turn, the percentage of proposals funded. The workshop will be
held in the same location as the USENIX Security conference, on the day before
the conference workshops. Co-locating this event with one of the major research
conferences for the field will reduce overall costs for researchers, since many
of them will be attending the conference for other professional reasons.
