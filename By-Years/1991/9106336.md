The emergence of the Central American isthmus (approximately 3.5 Ma) presents
an ideal natural experiment for testing the causal basis of the rates and
mechanisms of evolutionary change of marine organisms. This event isolated
previously contiguous populations in the eastern Pacific and Caribbean, and
initiated the development of different selective regimes on opposing sides of
the barrier. Molluscan stable isotopic profiles can provide an excellent record
of ambient environmental conditions. In particular, molluscan isotopic profiles
record the contrasting patterns of seasonal change in temperature, salinity, and
upwelling that characterize the eastern Pacific and southwestern Caribbean
today. Stable isotopic analyses will be conducted for selected mollusc shells
from extensive and well-dated Plio-Pleistocene sections on either side of the
Central American isthmus. The purpose of these analyses is to: 1) track the
development of the differences between eastern Pacific and Caribbean
environments, and 2) provide a paleoenvironmental context for future
evolutionary studies of marine invertebrate taxa.
