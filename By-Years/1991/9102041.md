Data in diverse fields such as hydrology,geophysics and economics often display
long range dependence. Efficient adaptive estimators for the model parameters of
such processes will be developed. Bilinear time series models arise in
economics, meteorology, oceanography, and seismology along with several other
areas. Optimal inferential procedures for these important classes of models will
also be developed. **
