This project is a conference to provide professional development for faculty
members in psychology departments in teaching institutions. The conference is
called "Teaching of Psychology: Ideas and Innovations (TOP)." The field of
psychology has grown rapidly, creating a need for teaching faculty to keep pace
with new innovations in teaching and alternative career paths for undergraduate
psychology majors. Changes in recent years have been substantial, resulting in
very different post-undergraduate environment. The knowledge and skills that
bachelors-level graduates need for success in finding work related to their
psychology education or entry to graduate school are substantially different
that a they were a few years ago. &lt;br/&gt;In order to bring teaching faculty
up to date with modern practice and issues, a series of TOP conferences are
being planned to provide a means for regular updating of faculty knowledge and
skills. The first TOP conference (supported by this grant) is intended to
educate teaching faculty about the new APA guidelines for undergraduate
psychology programs and to instruct faculty in methods for assessing student
learning outcomes. It will also support attendance by historically
underrepresented groups by providing assistance to faculty and students based on
need. &lt;br/&gt;The eventual goal of the TOP conferences is to also provide a
setting for undergraduate students to present research papers. The TOP
administrators are pursuing the goal of producing graduates who have a deep
understanding of and appreciation for scholarship.
