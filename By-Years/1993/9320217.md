9320217 Andrews This award is for support for graduate students to attend the
annual Arctic Workshop and supports registration, housing and meals for
approximately 25 students. These workshops have been held since 1972 and
alternate their location between Boulder, Colorado and another location, every
other year. The workshops will be held in Boulder in 1994 and 1996 and in Laval,
Quebec, Canada in 1995. These workshops provide a vital forum for the exchange
of ideas and data within the Arctic research community, at both the national and
international level. ***
