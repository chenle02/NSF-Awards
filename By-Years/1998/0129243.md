0129243&lt;br/&gt;Nochetto&lt;br/&gt;This award supports Ricardo H. Nochetto and
students from the University of Maryland-College Park in a collaboration with
Gerhard Dziuk of the Department of Applied Mathematics at the University of
Freiburg, Germany. The award is a one-year renewal of a project begun in January
2000. The project focuses on error control for nonlinear partial differential
equations via a posteriori error estimation. The techniques will have
applications for physical problems involving diffusion, advection, phase
changes, and interface dynamics. Such problems arise frequently in industrial
applications, and raise fundamental and challenging questions that need to be
addressed in order for the field to advance. The collaboration combines
complementary expertise and facilities on both sides. In particular the
innovative software toolbox ALBERT, developed by the German group, is central to
the proposed work, which will gain added value from the powerful theoretical
capabilities of the U.S. group. The work plan provides for extensive
participation by graduate students in the international travel and
research.&lt;br/&gt;
