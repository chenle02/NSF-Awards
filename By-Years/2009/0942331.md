Engineering - Other (59)&lt;br/&gt;This project is transforming a course to
capitalize on the diversity of the students enrolled in the course and to
incorporate course content of immediate interest to students. This is being done
by developing a new classroom pedagogy, called diversity harnessing, in which
the direct interests of the student population are folded back into course
materials through lecture topics, homework exercises and exam problems.
Diversity harnessing is making extensive use of active and collaborating
learning. The course, ECE 101: Exploring Digital Information Technology, is an
engineering course for non-engineering majors that strives to prepare students
for a meaningful role in an increasingly technological society. The goals of
this project are to 1) better engage the students in the course topics, 2)
quickly integrate diverse student-driven subject matter back into the course,
and 3) empower the students to more effectively apply new skills to their lives
and careers. The project includes rigorous formative and summative evaluation
plans with both qualitative and quantitative components coordinated by an
independent evaluator.
