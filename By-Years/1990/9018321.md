This research is to use modern techniques of waveform inversion to determine
both source parameters and travel times for all large to moderate-sized
earthquakes that occurred deeper than 200 km in the Kuril-Kamchatka subduction
zone in the past 25 years. The resultant data will be used to invert for 3-D
structure in the upper mantle and to investigate the stress directions in the
subducting slab. The goal is to address the question of whether the slab stops
at the 670 km boundary or passes through into the lower mantle, a significant
question affecting models of earth dynamics and the chemical layering of the
mantle.
