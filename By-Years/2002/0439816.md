AST-0439816&lt;br/&gt;Petrosian&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 22nd Texas Symposium on
Relativistic Astrophysics and Cosmology will be held at Stanford University in
Palo Alto, California on December 13-17, 2004. The Texas Symposia have gained a
reputation as the major international meeting on topics in relativistic
astrophysics, and attract a large international and domestic audience of
theorists and experimenters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since the National Science
Foundation, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the U.S.
Department of Energy sponsor research in the relevant fields, some funding
generally comes from all three agencies. NSF funds are used to support
participation by junior researchers (students and postdoctoral fellows).
