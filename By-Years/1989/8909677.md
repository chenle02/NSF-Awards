This research is on automation of the system level partitioning problem. In
particular it addresses the task of partitioning a design so as to minimize the
number of VLSI chips, while still satisfying constraints on system performance
and chip parameters. The P.I. is generalizing a model for area estimation for
standard cell chips to handle other layout design styles. This model plays a
central role in developing system level partitioning tools by providing accurate
estimates of the design layout areas. Complimentary tools which evaluate other
aspects and merits of the design, such as power consumption, performance and pin
count are being developed. The tools are being integrated into a spreadsheet-
like design aid which will allow the designer to interact with the system. This
research investigates system level partitioning of a design so as to optimize
system design with respect to many parameters. The P.I. has novel ideas, which
show promise in solving this complex problem. The principal investigator is a
promising and competent young professor who should make significant
contributions to the field.
