With this award the principal investigator will study models of nonlinear
elasticity that describe the behavior of elastic materials at moderate to large
deformations. In contrast to linear models nonlinear models usually require for
their solution more sophisticated types of mathematical analysis. On the
theoretical side the principal investigator will study the weak continuity of
the Jacobian determinant and the choice of a space of admissible deformations.
On the applied side he will study the stability of elastic composite materials
such as foam rubber, and he will analyze solid-solid phase transitions in
elastic crystals. A goodly number of everyday phenomena involving elastic
materials can be explained using what is called linear elasticity theory. This
linear theory concerns the behavior of elastic materials in response to small
deformations. However when the deformations are moderate to large in size the
linear theory must be replaced with a more complicated nonlinear theory. A
nonlinear theory is also required if the material is a composite, such as foam
rubber or fibre-reinforced rubber. With this award the principal investigator
will use mathematical analysis to study models of nonlinear elastic materials.
