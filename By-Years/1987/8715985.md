This project will map the southern sky in the Cosmic Microwave Background
Radiation (CMBR) at a wavelength of 3mm and with angular resolution from 0.5 -
10 degrees. The purpose is to look for deviations from isotropy and therefore
fluctuations in the distribution of mass in the early universe. The instrument
to be used is a modified balloon payload that will take advantage of the low
atmospheric temperature and humidity at the South Pole, the quiet radio
environment, and the circumpolar motion of features in the sky. The experiment
addresses one of the outstanding questions of cosmology.
