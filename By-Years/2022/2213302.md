This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of
2021 (Public Law 117-2). Skyler Mendoza is awarded a NSF Mathematical and
Physical Sciences Ascending Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (NSF MPS-Ascend) to
conduct a program of research and activities related to broaden participation by
groups underrepresented in STEM. This fellowship to Dr. Mendoza supports the
research project entitled " MPS-Ascend: Development of a Dual Catalytic Fragment
Insertion Reaction", under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The host
institution for the fellowship is the Scripps Research Institute, and the
sponsoring scientist is Dr. Keary Engle. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work
intends to explore the concept of fragment insertion/deletion, also referred to
as “molecular editing”. This reaction would take simple, easy-to-access
1,3-dienes and convert them into otherwise difficult to access value-added
1,4-diene products. Successful implementation of the work will result in the
establishment of a conceptually distinct method for accessing skipped diene
products. The PI will prioritize community outreach for young scientists
historically excluded from the field of organic chemistry through a
collaboration with the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE) at the
University of California San Diego. Successful implementation of this
collaboration will result in the creation of a “MentorSHPE” program at the
Scripps Research Institute.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
