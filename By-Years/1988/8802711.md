Alec Norton will work on problems related to the dynamical behaviour of
differentiable mappings in two dimensions. These in turn are closely related to
questions about the nature of the critical sets of differentiable functions. For
example, information about the size of the image of a critical set can be
obtained from the degree of differentiability of the function concerned. Results
such as these are closely related to the Morse-Sard theorem. These
investigations are in many ways complementary to the more established works on
conformal dynamics. Although the Morse-Sard has been used extensively as an
analytic tool, Norton will be investigating its geometric ramifications. In
particular he will use it to study the loxodromic mapping problem. This asks for
diffeomorphisms of the two dimensional sphere for which the poles satisfy
certain properties. Previous work has shown that the degree of differentiability
of the function plays an important role in these questions. In a slightly
different direction he will try to extend known results about Denjoy dynamics on
the circle to the torus.
