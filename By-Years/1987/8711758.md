This project will document the social structure of Mexico City's post-mural art
world within the context of Mexican politics and economy. The student will study
the relationship of artistic expression to its social and political context by
examining individual life histories. This project has relevance to many areas of
modern knowledge in that it will document the effect of a decrease in government
support for the arts. It will also look at how painting can be a cultural symbol
of national identity and how individuals, both government personnel and artists,
manipulate these symbols.
