&lt;br/&gt;The problem of heat removal becomes crucial for continuing CMOS
downscaling, beyond CMOS nanoscale concepts, ULSI, and 3D architecture
proposals. Conventional heat removal methods and post device-design / packaging
level cooling solutions fail to work at nanoscale and in 3D architectures. This
proposal introduces a drastic philosophy change in heat removal, e.g. thermal
management features incorporated at the materials / device level, as well as two
new radical concepts of heat removal via phonon engineering such as (i) thermal
conductivity enhancement of the material along chosen directions via proper
engineering of device heterostructures and (ii) smart arrangement of the
nanoscale devices in ULSI circuits or in 3D architectures to achieve acoustic
phonon interference and phonon annihilation, e.g. local cooling, in pre-
determined locations.&lt;br/&gt;
