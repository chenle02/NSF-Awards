This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address
large scale production of fullerene materials in an ecologically benign manner.
Presently, fullerene manufacturing is based on a synthesis of soot from an
evaporated graphite rod and a dissolution of the soot in an organic chemical
solvent to extract the fullerene. Synthesis of soot is energy intensive and
impractical for large scale production, while the organic chemical process is
environmentally toxic and hazardous. This project will extract fullerene from
fullerene-containg coal. The process will involve (i) demineralization and
elimination of impurities in the coal and (ii) extraction of fullerenes by
sublimation. If proven feasible as an economical and ecologically benign
process, it could be commercialized to meet the presently growing demand for
fullerene materials.
