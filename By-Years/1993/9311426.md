Under the direction of Drs. Stephen Plog and Malcolm Bell III, Mr. Stephen
Thompson will collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will conduct two
seasons of survey work and analysis in a 150 square kilometer area around the
site of Morgantina, a large hilltop settlement in east-central Sicily initially
inhabited by non-Greek peoples during the Late Bronze/Early Iron Age (ca. 1000 -
550 B.C.) and subsequently transformed during the second half of the first
millennium B.C. into a prominent Greek city state. Although extensive work has
been done at the site itself, no formal archaeological investigation has been
conducted beyond the city walls. Consequently, only a rudimentary knowledge
exists of the site's local and regional setting and of its immediate rural
territory. Through his survey, Mr. Thompson will explore basic parameters of
environment, settlement, demography and land use. Through his work, Mr. Thompson
wishes to address two basic issues. First he wishes to reconstruct the social
and economic organization of this early Mediterranean state. It is extremely
unclear how entities of this type integrate rural areas with urban centers and
how political and economic systems function. Secondly, he will address questions
of assimilation and change. During the early part of its history Morgantina
appears to be an independent, indigenous Sicilian development. Later however it
seems to either come under Greek influence or be dominated completely by Greece.
How, over this interval, did relations between the center and the hinterland
change? How was a new set of circumstances adapted to a traditional system? This
research is important for several reasons. It will set an major archaeological
site into a broader context. It will shed new light on development and change
within state level societies and finally will assist in the training of a
promising young scientist.
