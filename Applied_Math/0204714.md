Methods and Geometric Integrators for Nonlinear Wave Equations

Abstract

This project consists of three interrelated topics in the theory and
application of nonlinear dispersive waves: chaotic dynamics in perturbed
nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equations, the role of homoclinic chaos in the
generation of high amplitude (rogue) ocean waves, and the development and
analysis of structure-preserving integrators for nonlinear wave equations.
Combined experimental and theoretical studies of water waves recently yielded a
characterization of the chaotic evolution in perturbed NLS equations that is
generic, observable, and physically significant. Preliminary analysis indicates
that similar results hold in fiber optics. In this project, further
experimental, numerical, and theoretical analysis will be carried out. The
latter includes extending the geometric interpretation of the Floquet
discriminant and the associated Melnikov integrals for solutions in the full
phase space and obtaining criteria for the existence of homoclinic structures
for symmetry-breaking perturbations of the NLS equation. The implication of
these results in the context of homoclinic chaos and the likelihood of rogue
wave formation will be examined. The research also involves the development of
efficient, stable multi-symplectic integrators for equations of interest in the
water wave and optics problems. A comparison of the multi-symplectic, energy,
and momentum errors to the overall performance of the integrators (including
accurate capture of qualitative features of the system) will be carried out.
Error bounds on the approximate preservation of the local conservation laws will
be sought.

The proposed research focuses on mathematical and computational issues central
to water wave dynamics and nonlinear optics. Rogue wave events can have a
devastating effect on offshore structures and ships. The results of this project
will address fundamental properties of rogue wave generation and potentially
have impact on the design and analysis of structures such as offshore oil rigs.
Soliton solutions of the NLS equation are used to model light pulses in high-
speed optical telecommunication systems. The research on multi-symplectic
integrators will yield fast, efficient codes that can be used in numerical
simulation of high data rate communication systems and rogue wave events.
