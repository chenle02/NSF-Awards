The purpose of this project is to provide the equipment necessary to upgrade the
undergraduate Surface Physics Laboratory. A pilot surface physics program,
concentrating on sputtering, has been successful. One of the accomplishments of
the current program has been the development of collaborations (research and
student internships) with local semiconductor companies. The new equipment
enables the department to build on current successes and develop new courses
covering a broader area of surface physics. This program is providing unique
opportunities for students to acquire summer internships and permanent
employment in positions requiring knowledge and laboratory experience in vacuum
technology, sputtering, and thin films. A UHV chamber and magnetron sputtering
system are being used to deposit films. A quartz crystal microbalance is being
used to control film thickness. Four-point probe resistivity measurements,
optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive
spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy are being used to
characterize the films.
