Professor Dudley Herschbach is supported by a Small Grant for Exploratory
Research from the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to study molecular
orientation in cold molecular beams by the application of strong electric
fields. These measurements provide a new method to address questions concerning
the importance of relative orientation between reacting molecules and the
influence which molecular orientation has on chemical reactivity. Polar
molecules with a three-fold or higher axis of symmetry in certain rotational
states will precess in an electric field rather than tumble. The dipole moment
therefore does not average out for such states, so an electric field can exert a
torque which produces substantial orientation. Orientation by an electric field
has been considered quite impractical for less symmetrical molecules. The
rotational motion of diatomic, linear, or asymmetric top molecules averages out
the dipole moment in first-order, so the interaction with an electric field is
much weaker. Dr. Herschbach has performed feasibility calculations which show,
however, that even in these cases only relatively modest Stark fields of 60,000
volts/cm are required to orient the lowest rotational states of linear molecules
such as ICN when they are cooled to 2 degrees Kelvin in a molecular beam. This
prediction, which Herschbach hopes to verify experimentally, would have an
enormous impact on the whole field of reaction dynamics. It would provide an
important new capability to study orientation effects in colliding molecular
beams which would be achievable at easily attainable experimental conditions.
