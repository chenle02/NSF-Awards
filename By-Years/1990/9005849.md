This is a collaborative research effort on fundamental problems involved in the
collection, communication and processing of distributed information and the
coordination of distributed decision making. The issues studied apply to social
organizations such as economies, government agencies, and firms, as well as to
machine systems such as large scale control systems, distributed communications
networks, and asynchronous parallel processing systems. Engineers and economists
both analyze these issues, although with different goals. However, insights
developed in each field are likely to be productive in the other. This is a
program of research in areas of information economics, parallel processing and
machine learning, team theory, control and estimation with distributed
information, and the emergence of equilibrium behavior and allocations in large
systems of interacting agents. To increase the impact of this work, the
researchers run an interdisciplinary workshop series on coordination,
information, and decisions.
