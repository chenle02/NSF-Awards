In this collaborative research project, supported by the Analytical and Surface
Chemistry Program, Professors Scherson and Chottiner propose a systematic study
of the effects of platinum particle size on the electrocatalytic properties of
platinum supported on various carbon substrates. A series of carbon substrates
of varying morphology will be examined, and a battery of modern surface
analytical methods will be used to characterize the structure and properties of
the supported metal system. This work should provide information important to
the understanding of electrocatalytic processes, and draws on the complementary
expertise in electrochemistry, surface analysis, and materials research of the
co-principal investigators. %%% Studies of platinum particle size effects for
platinum catalysts supported on various carbon substrates will be carried out
using a range of surface analytical methods. The understanding to be gained from
these studies will be very useful in the design of fuel cell electrodes and
other electrocatalytic devices.
