This engineering education award to San Diego State University will develop
innovative articulation and credit transfer methods among community colleges,
military training and four year colleges. This will assist in streamlining the
transition of veteran students from the military to completion of undergraduate
degrees in engineering. The engineering degree pathways will be customized to
the needs and strengths of veterans. The results will be disseminated widely and
also will be presented on the web, at technical conferences and published in
professional journals. The project is expected to assist veterans' transition to
civilian life and to enhance the number of students who complete engineering
degrees and are ready to fill engineering jobs or start new high tech
businesses.
