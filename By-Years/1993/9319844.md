9319844 Schatz This award will support the distribution and continued
development of the Worm Community System (WCS). This is an electronic community
system, or digital library, containing the knowledge of a scientific community
and a software environment to enable interaction with this knowledge across
wide-area networks. In particular, WCS contains the formal and informal data and
literature of the community of molecular biologists who study the nematode work
C. elegans. The library collection of WCS enables researchers to search for
desired items, navigate links between related items, and make personal
annotations. This proposal is being jointly supported by the Information
Technology and Organizations program of the Directorate for Computer and
Information Science and Engineering and by the Database Activities in the
Biological Sciences program. ***
