This research examines the problem of detecting and estimating a change in a
statistical regression model that is composed of two different linear phases.
The nonstandard behavior of the likelihood ratio statistic will be exhibited and
analytic approximations to the sampling distribution of various test statistics
will be given for the multiple linear regression model. Power functions and
confidence regions will be derived. The methods developed to solve boundary
crossing problems in sequential analysis will be applied to these problems.
