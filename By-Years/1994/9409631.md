The purpose of this project is analyze the behavior of asset prices, the nature
of economic fluctuations, and the links between asset markets and the
macroeconomy. The project consists of three major components. The first relates
the pattern of unconditional mean asset returns to the covariances of asset
returns with news about current and future stock returns and labor income. The
second part of the project focuses on the behavior of conditional mean asset
returns. It is well known that stock prices tend to fall when the economy enters
a recession. This part of the project will investigate habit formation and risk
aversion behavior on part of investors over the business cycle. The third
component of the project explores new directions in macroeconomics including the
role of home production technology in real business cycle models, the nature of
exogenous shocks to monetary policy, and the use of growth theory to in
estimating trend components of output. This research is important because it
will provide a deeper understanding of the interaction between the stock market
and the business cycle.
