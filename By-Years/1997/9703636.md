9703636 Anne M. Kelly This award will support undergraduate and graduate student
volunteers to work on the network, SciNet'96, at the Supercomputing '96
conference. Computer networking is still a relatively young field, and there are
very few opportunities for the practical applications that enrich and inform the
classroom experience. This is especially true in EPSCoR state where the academic
research enterprise, including its Internet infrastructure, deserves special
attention and support. A special effort has been made to recruit students for
EPSCoR institutions to work on SciNet'96. Showfloor networks such as SciNet'96
are complete networks that offer a full spectrum of learning experiences in
every aspect of internet technology, albeit in a pressure cooker environment.
Student volunteers will be under the tutelage of experienced professionals who
have also volunteered to work on SciNet'96. The student volunteers will be
involved in the full gamut of showfloor networking, for example: * physical
infrastructure * logical infrastructure, and * network operations including
crisis management
