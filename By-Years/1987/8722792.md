Modern high-function computer systems are difficult to master and use. This
problem is attacked in an interdisciplinary project that combines the
development of innovative systems with a theor- etical investigation of the
cognitive processes involved in com- puter use. The goal is to develop design
principles for systems that are radically easier to understand, and hence to
use, than any now in existence. Rooted in a comprehension-centered theory of
human-computer interaction, the principles are to be embodied in concrete
applications, which will serve as testbeds for both principles and the theory
they reflect. This project promises a fundamental contribution to the art and
science of augmenting human intellectual productivity. The degree to which it
integrates exploratory system design with fundamental research on user-system
interaction is unique. If successful, it could yield theoretical results of
unprecedented explanatory power and design principles of wide applicabilty to
interactive systems.
