Dempsey 9634846 The proposed articulates a research program to characterize the
fundamentals of plastic rheology and the brittle-to- ductile transition
temperature in fresh-water ice single crystals and bi-and tri-crystals. The
proposed work is exciting and interesting, and the proposed collaborations are a
positive aspect of the proposal. Other strengths are the battery of experimental
approaches to be applied to the problem and the battery of experimental
approaches to be applied to the problem and attempt to correlate dislocation
structures and density with their impact on birefringence. The research aim of
understanding the constitutive behavior of large polycrystalline ice bodies and
their mechanical interaction with engineering structures by understanding
fundamental rheology at the single-crystal level appears justified. ***
