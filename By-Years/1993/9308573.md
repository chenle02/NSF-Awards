While researchers in artificial intelligence planning have been concerned with
failure recovery and debugging for some time, there has been no concerted effort
to evaluate failure recovery and planning or support the design and debugging of
plan knowledge bases for new environments. The proposed research fills this gap
with new tools for analyzing planning systems and a methodology for determining
why these systems fail and what can be done about it. The PI's thesis described
a procedure, Failure Recovery Analysis (FRA), for analyzing the performance of a
planner (the Phoenix planner) in its environment to determine whether and how it
might be causing its own failure. The PI proposes to extend her thesis research
by applying it to another planner and environment, and automating and
integrating FRA in a tool to assist designers in evaluating and debugging
planner knowledge bases.//
