The research focuses on the role of labor in quality management, examining in
particular whether co-management and a labor-management partnership work
organization add value to first-time-quality performance at General Motors(
Saturn Corporation. The researchers will examine the relationship between the
specific characteristics of the quality partnership and quality performance by
analyzing the variation in this relationship across three plants and 50
departments at Saturn. An in-depth empirical study of the system of quality and
operations co-management will focus on the behavior patterns and management
methods of union members as supervisors when compared to their non- represented
counterparts, and the impact of these supervisors on first-time-quality
improvement. In addition, this project will examine the process by which General
Motors (GM) and the United Auto Workers have attempted to transform their
organizational cultures and to develop an innovative alternative to past
practice. The process of organizational learning and diffusion of Saturn(s
quality systems back to GM also will be studied.
