Confidence Intervals for the Duration of a Mass Extinction

Steve Wang, Swarthmore College

This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). The Signor-Lipps effect holds that a truly sudden
(simultaneous) extinction of a group of taxa may appear gradual in the fossil
record due to incomplete fossil preservation. Therefore, much work in the last
two decades has been devoted to devising statistical tests for a simultaneous
extinction of all taxa in a stratigraphic section. Rather than being limited to
rejecting or failing to reject this single scenario, however, the PI will
develop methods to estimate the range of extinction scenarios that is consistent
with the fossil record. In other words, rather than testing the oversimplified
distinction of simultaneous or gradual, the PI will ask the question how
gradual? The PI will develop a mathematical confidence interval for the duration
of a mass extinction, either in terms of the time or stratigraphic thickness
between the first and last taxon to go extinct. The project proposes to
implement a statistical test that will provide 95% confidence that the
extinction took place over a duration of 12 to 18 meters of stratigraphic
thickness. This does not deny the possibility of a truly simultaneous
extinction; rather, within this framework, a simultaneous extinction is one in
which the confidence interval contains a possible duration of zero meters. The
proposed project is broadly interdisciplinary and will specifically apply this
mathematical model to estimate the duration of the end-Permian mass extinction,
arguably the most severe biotic crisis of the Phanerozoic.
