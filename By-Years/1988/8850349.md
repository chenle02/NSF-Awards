This project will test the feasibility of recruiting, training, an deploying a
cadre of volunteers who are competent scientists and/or engineers and who will
work in the schools as teacher aides. Five sites, all locations of existing
Triangle Coalition collaboratives, will serve as the recruiting and training
centers. Science teachers from cooperating schools will specify tasks for the
volunteers and will assist in conducting the training workshops. For one
academic year, the volunteers will work in the schools. During that year, data
will be collected on the effectiveness of the service provided by the
volunteers. The goal is to recruit a total of 25 volunteers (5 per site) who
will contribute a total of 9000 hours of service (360 hours per volunteer). The
project will be conducted under the general supervision of John Fowler of the
National Science Teachers Association. Significant assistance in the recruiting
and training procedures will be provided by the National School Volunteer
Program.
