Research is proposed in high energy theory in the areas of supergravity and
superstring theory. Studies planned include investigation of phenomenological
consequences of these theories as well as their theoretical structure. In the
former area, analyses are planned of new physics signals that might be detected
at accelerators which will shortly be on line (Tevatron, SLC, LEP) and at future
proton decay experiments. In the latter area, analyses of superstring theories
are proposed involving questions of the role of heavy particles, supersymmetry
breaking and orbifolds, unitarity of the Polyakov formalism, and properties of
high loop amplitudes. The work to be carried out by a very highly-regarded
theoretical elementary particle physicist, is important to the furthering of our
understanding of the elementary particles and of the basic forces.
