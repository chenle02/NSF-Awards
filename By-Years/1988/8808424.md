This research is concerned with the cognitive processes involved in developing
computer programs. The specific phenomenon studied is the role of "beacons" -
stereotyped program fragments - in producing and understanding computer
programs. Beacons from a variety of program types and in a variety of
programming situations will be studied. This award is a planning grant, funded
under the Research Opportunities for Women (ROW) Initiative. The support will
enable the Principal Investigator to develop a detailed methodology and
experimental plan.
