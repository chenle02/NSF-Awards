Fischer&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0208284&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators propose to
better image seismic velocity discontinuities in the mid-upper mantle using
broadband Ps and other scattered teleseismic phases. They will focus on
structure in the 150-400 km depth range, where a rich variety of discontinuity
structures have been observed. Testable hypotheses for the origin of these
features include: the transition from dislocation creep to diffusion creep,
layers of rheological weakness due to volatile enrichment, layers of partial
melt, mechanical boundaries within the continental lithosphere, and
mineralogical phase transformations. The various mechanisms imply differences in
discontinuity depth, polarity, strength and anisotropic properties, and some of
these predictions vary between tectonic environments due to changes in mantle
temperature. These predictions will be compared to observed discontinuity
structure globally (using IRIS/Global Seismic Network stations), and with
focused regional studies in continental cratons, actively deforming continental
regions, subduction zones, and beneath a mid-ocean ridge (using data from
PASSCAL experiments and other arrays). Two types of migration will be employed:
determination of receiver functions by simultaneous deconvolution of data from
different geographic or back-azimuth bins, and formal 2D migration. Receiver
function binning as a function of back-azimuth is particularly effective at
resolving anisotropy, and the proposed 2D migration has great potential to
constrain both P-wave and S-wave velocity contrasts at discontinuities. This
work will help to characterize mid-upper mantle rheology, deformation mechanism,
anisotropic fabric, and volatile and melt distributions.&lt;br/&gt;
