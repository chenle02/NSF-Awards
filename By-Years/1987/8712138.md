A new approach to radiation hardening of thermally grown Si02 is proposed which
will change the way we think about the oxidation of silicon, and could lead to a
radiation hardening process, which simultaneously produces minimum densities of
electrically active defects, based on fundamental understanding rather than
empirical recipes. This new approach is based on the premise that the oxidation
kinetics of silicon, and the electrically active defect densities that determine
radiation sensitivity and device performance are determined by the intrinsic
strain resulting from the volume expansion that occurs when silicon oxidizes.
The basic idea is to control the electrically active defect densities by
changing the intrinsic strain by processing. Changes in intrinsic strain are
related to processing by viscous flow of the oxide relieving strain. To
quantitatively evaluate the relation between intrinsic strain and processing,
intrinsic strain will be varied by preparing samples in a matrix of oxidation
conditions (temperature, oxygen pressure, thickness, time, partial pressure of
water vapor). To determine the effect of each of these conditions, only one will
be varied while all the others are kept fixed in each set of the matrix, and
electrically active defect densities measured as functions of changes in
intrinsic strain on the same samples in each set. It is expected that an optimum
set can be found in which the electrically active defect densities are
minimized. Samples prepared by the optimum set then will be tested for radiation
hardness.
