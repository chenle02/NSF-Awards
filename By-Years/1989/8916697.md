In this project, the P.I.'s will describe the seasonal and interannual
variability in the Greenland Sea, using a very high-quality set of temperature,
salinity, and owxygen data collected in 1988-89 in support of the Greenland Sea
Tomography study. Other data from the last three decades will be used to
investigate intereannual variability in this region, which is of critical
importance to understanding the role of the ocean in climate variability.
