Based on field observations coupled with trends in mineralogy and major element
composition, Dr. M. Obata and Japanese colleagues have interpreted the layered
Horoman peridotite as a "frozen" example of melt segregation in the upper
mantle. In a collaborative effort with Obata and colleagues, F. Frey (MIT) and
N. Shimizu (WHOI) plan to determine the trace element and isotopic (Sr, Nd, Pb)
systematics of contiguous layers in this peridotite. The processes of melt
formation and segregation are major, but poorly understood, mechanisms that have
been in controlling the evolution of the earth's mantle and crust. The
comprehensive data generated by this collaborative effort should help to define
the proceses that created layering in the Horoman peridotite, and significantly
improve the understanding of melt formation, migration and segregation in the
upper mantle. This is a joint project with Dr. N. Shimizu of the Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution. and Dr. Fred Frey of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.
