This project will provide the genome sequence of a Bacillus anthracis strain
isolated from the recent anthrax outbreak in Florida. This sequence can then be
compared to that of other strains of Bacillus anthracis. Such comparisons will
help investigators in their quest to understand the phylogenetic diversity of
Bacillus anthracis and may point to genomic factors that affect virulence.
