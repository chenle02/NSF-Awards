Temperature stress poses a unique and escalating problem to plants since they
are immobile captives of the environment. Plants, like all other organisms,
respond to increasing temperature by the specific expression of heat shock
proteins. These proteins are essential for the plant to mount a tolerance
response to many stresses including higher temperatures. However the specific
functions of these proteins in stress tolerance is largely unknown. Preliminary
experiments have demonstrated a role for one specific and prominent heat shock
protein, Hsp17.7, in thermotolerance, by using antisense technology to decrease
the expression of this protein. The proposed experiments will investigate why
the plants expressing an antisense version of Hspl7.7 mRNA are less
thermotolerant and should provide insight into the overall process of plant
thermotolerance. Antisense Hspl7.7 plants show dramatic decreases in the levels
of Hspl7.7 as well as other non-related Hsps. The underlying molecular
mechanisms by which this occurs will be addressed by quantitative analysis of
mRNA and protein levels using gene specific probes and specific antibodies. The
analysis will focus on the processes of transcription, translation and protein
processing and turnover in transgenic and control cells. In addition, the
potential chaperone function of Hsp17.7 will be assessed using standard assays.
