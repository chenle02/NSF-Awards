The Austin children's Museum will develop a colorful, interactive exhibit on
energy entitled GO POWER. Go Power is being created as part of a U.S. Department
of Energy exhibition initiative with in-kind support from the Lower Colorado
River Authority, a non-profit public power agency, and design and fabrication
assistance by the Robot Group, an Austin-based consortium of engineers and
artists. The partnership, advised by a panel of science, energy, and education
experts, will build a 1,200 square-foot exhibit geared towards young children
(pre- school and elementary-age), and their families. An Exhibit Developer with
a strong scientific background will be responsible for the design and
implementation of exhibit components which will highlight energy-related science
and technology as a focus for developing and utilizing skills of scientific
inquiry and invention. Through kinetic sculpture, computer games, participatory
exhibits, and adjunct programming, visitors will learn about potential and
kinetic energy and its forms: mechanical, electrical, chemical, thermal, solar.
Following its test edition, designed with input from advisors, front-end
evaluations, and prototypes, Go Power will become the sixth exhibit to join the
Museum's popular national touring program.
