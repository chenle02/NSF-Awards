This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). Intellectual Merit: This proposal addresses a compelling
contemporary question in human biology: How do development and energetics
determine the pace and trajectory of reproductive maturation? This project takes
advantage of a unique opportunity in The Gambia to directly address questions of
early life factors in a human population where differences in maternal energetic
status are known. Between 1989 and 1994, the Medical Research Council of the
United Kingdom conducted a nutritional supplementation trial of pregnant women
in the West Kiang District. Supplements were standardized for energy content,
and supplementation status was cluster-randomized by village. The children born
to participating mothers are now in their mid to late teenage years.

Subjects in this study will include 30 women born to mothers receiving
supplements and 30 women born to controls. Measurements will include height,
weight, body composition (measured by dual x-ray absorptiometry) ovarian hormone
levels (measured in saliva), metabolic hormone levels (measured in blood and
urine), and energy expenditure monitored by heart-rate telemetry and
accelerometry. Measurements will be collected on three occasions at six month
intervals. The central hypothesis is that women born to supplemented mothers
will be less insulin sensitive to fluctuating energy availability as
adolescents, will mature earlier, and will show less ovarian sensitivity to
fluctuating energy availability.

Broader Impact: Most populations in the world show evidence of a shift over time
toward earlier reproductive maturation with economic development. The mechanisms
driving this change, however, are not yet clear, and suggestions that the trend
may be continuing in the contemporary US have caused some alarm. Early
maturation is linked to the risk of many chronic diseases such as diabetes and
reproductive cancers. This project will illuminate how prenatal conditions
influence the pace and trajectory of pubertal maturation. This project will
provide research training for one female graduate student.
