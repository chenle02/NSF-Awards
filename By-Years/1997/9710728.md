Roman rule in Ancient Egypt has been characterized as a period of great
cultural and economic revival. Historic documents reveal a strong centralized
government that prospered, as measured in exports, revenues collected and
territorial expansion. However, Roman rule in Egypt also has been described as
unjust, adversely affecting the lives of the populace through anarchy and
religious persecution. Indeed, analyses of Roman census data indicate that
Egyptian females were subject to high mortality, with life expectancy at birth
of only 22.5 years. Similarly, life expectancy for Egyptian males was 25 years.
The specific objective of this research project is to understand the
relationships between quality of life and centralized authority during the Roman
period of Egypt. This objective will be realized by examining relationships
between economic status as revealed by archaeological and historic records, and
quality of life, as scored by skeletal indicators of poor dietary intake, high
disease loads, and trauma. Excavation of two tombs from Baharia Oasis, Egypt
will be conducted. Skeletal analysis of excavated remains will be performed in
Cairo using standard methods. The methodology designed for this research project
examines the relationship between how well an individual grows in conjunction
with other stress indicators within a historical context. This makes it possible
to determine if mortality increased and life expectancy decreased under Roman
rule, as suggested by the demographic data compiled from Roman census records.
In addition, we can test the accuracy of utilizing skeletal data to inform about
quality of life of past populations while improving our understanding of the
Egyptian population under centralized Roman Egypt.
