Dr. Elliott L. Blinn and other members of the Chemistry Department and Center
for Photochemical Sciences at Bowling Green State University are being supported
to continue a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in chemistry.
For the period 1995-97, twelve undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each
summer actively engaged in basic research projects focusing on photochemical
sciences with applications ranging from biomedicine to industrial chemistry. A
unique feature of the program is activities at the academic/industrial interface
including a visit to a pharmaceutical industry, seminars featuring industrial
chemists, and discussions of careers in industry.
