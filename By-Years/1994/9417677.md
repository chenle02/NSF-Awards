9417677 Pasteris This award provides partial funding for the support of a
technician in charge of operations and maintenance of the laser Raman microprobe
laboratories in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at Washington
University, St. Louis. Raman microprobe spectroscopy is a non-destructive
technique in which a laser beam is introduced into a sample via a microscope.
Solid, liquid, and gaseous phases can be identified rapidly and structurally
characterized. The Principal Investigator and her colleagues at Washington
University use Raman spectroscopy in a variety of research projects aimed at
understanding the role of elements such as carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and
nitrogen in the formation of metamorphic and volcanic rocks. ***
