The investigator and his colleagues will continue the study on diffeomorphic
deformation of shapes. This framework supplies a rigorous mathematical metric on
the shape space, a valuable quantitative measurement of the similarities between
shapes. In the proposed project, the investigator and his colleagues will
investigate diffeomorphic deformations of textured shapes. This study is to
address the problems caused by boundary conditions in the current setup and
response to the need of matching regions of interest directly in medical
applications. Two problems will be studied: one is to build a rigorous
mathematical framework for diffeomorphic deformations of textured shapes,
another is to develop computational efficient algorithms for finding the
shortest path connecting the textured shapes through the space of
diffeomorphisms.

Changes in the anatomical structures occur during the development and aging
process, as well as during many disease and injury process. Detecting and
monitoring the anatomy changes are crucial in disease diagnosis, treatment and
prevention. The results of this research will provide new image analysis tools
for quantitative studies of variations of biological shapes, detecting and
tracking changes of individual anatomy structures. They can also be applied to
computer vision in object tracking, recognition and classification.
