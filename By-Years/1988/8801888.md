This award will support collaborative research between Prof. Ismael Castelazo
of Arizona State University (ASU) and Prof. Rafael Kelly of the Universidad
Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM) in Mexico City, Mexico. ASU and UNAM have
groups of researchers currently investigating position and force control
techniques for robot manipulators. The objective of this project is to compare
and evaluate the relative advantages of nonlinear control techniques studied at
ASU with the adaptive control techniques pursued at UNAM, in an effort to
develop a unified control strategy that takes into account the best
characteristics of each method in particular operating conditions and for
different manipulator designs. Special attention will be paid to the following
specific areas of robot manipulator controls: a) force control; b) position and
velocity control; and c) compensation of nonlinear and coupling effects.
Analytical studies will be followed by real-time implementation in complementary
facilities at ASU and UNAM. Control of robotic manipulators is a very active and
important research field, not only because of the immediate benefits in
industrial productivity obtained from the use of robots, but also because these
sophisticated devices are an ideal test bed to investigate modeling and control
techniques for servomechanisms in general. The potential for significant
advances is enhanced by bringing together groups of researchers with
complementary skills, approaches, and facilities to work on an important problem
of much current interest.
