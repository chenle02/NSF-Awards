The morphology of the mouth parts of cyclopoid and calanoid copepods suggests
great differences in feeding behavior between and among adults of these two
orders. Differences should also be expected in their early stages because of
basic differences in musculature in their respective nauplii, and they begin to
feed at different stages. However, information as to how representatives of both
groups obtain their food is limited, especially for marine cyclopoids. Feeding
rate studies on two genera of cyclopoids (Oithonidae and Oncaeidae) emphasize
that they are omnivorous/carnivorous. Feeding behavior of nauplii, juveniles and
adult females of these two genera will be determined. Basic observations will
include describing modes of particle gathering, capture and ingestion, distances
from which food particles are perceived and swimming/moving behavior between
captures. For comparison purposes, the same observations will be made on two
species of calanoids (Centropages and Temora). The former creates weak feeding
currents and is more carnivorous than herbivorous as adults. The latter creates
stronger feeding currents and is more of a herbivore than a carnivore.
