AST-0200876&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI Taam&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The observed
masses and orbital periods for many classes of close binary star systems are
difficult to reproduce in evolutionary scenarios without significant angular
momentum and mass loss. A mechanism which facilitates these losses involves the
transfer of orbital angular momentum and energy to a common envelope which is
subsequently ejected as a result of the gravitational interactions between the
two components. This common envelope phase of evolution will be investigated in
this project for massive stars (as applied to low mass X-ray binaries containing
neutron stars and black holes)as well as low to intermediate mass stars (as
applied to cataclysmic variables containing white dwarf stars). The primary goal
of the research will be to determine the parameters for which the progenitor
binary systems at long orbital periods are transformed and survive as short
period systems, and the parameters for which mergers takes place. These
investigations include the treatment of multi-dimensional hydrodynamical
processes, and in this proposal the investigators will undertake high resolution
three dimensional studies of the common envelope phase using an adaptive,
parallel simulation code. This research provides a foundation upon which the
formation and evolution of close binary systems containing compact objects can
be understood.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
