Funds are provided for the continuation of the work on the valencia Trough - an
extensional basin formed during oligo-Miocene. The focus is on the pre-rift
lithospheric structure and rheological layering. A one-year wrap-up study using
seismic, heat-flow, modeling and sediment data will be accomplished to decipher
the structural evolution of the Trough.
