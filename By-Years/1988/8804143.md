An REU Site will be established in Tidewater Virginia under a cooperative
arrangement between Old Dominion University (ODU) and Norfolk State University
(NSU) with ODU as host institution. Eight undergraduate students from ODU, NSU
and other institutions will participate in the program under the supervision of
eight faculty members who have on-going research programs into which the
undergraduate students can be interfaced in a natural, direct and meaningful
manner. Research projects will be in the areas of atomic and molecular physics,
condensed matter physics, nuclear physics, optics, and plasma physics. Students
will participate in three seminar series and will be encouraged to prepare
articles for publication. This project is supported under the Program of
Research Experiences for Undergraduates to help ensure an adequate supply of
scientists for the future.
