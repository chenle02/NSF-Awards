Funds are requested to support the travel of speakers invited to the 50th
annual symposium of the Society for Developmental Biology. This year's symposium
is organized by Allan Spradling, current President of the Society, on the
subject of "Evolutionary Conservation of Developmental Mechanisms". Each session
will focus on a particular developmental process as studied in a
phylogenetically diverse group of organisms. Sessions will focus on changes in
genome structure, stem cell maintenance, sex determination, signal transduction
and pattern formation. It is hoped that underlying mechanisms that have been
widely utilized throughout the course of evolution will be revealed. The meeting
is usually of medium-size (300-400 registrants) with a single platform session
held at a time (25-30 speakers total), and with 60-80 posters. It is attended by
graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and senior researchers. All speakers
have been requested to prepare summaries of their presentations of publication
in the annual symposium volume.
