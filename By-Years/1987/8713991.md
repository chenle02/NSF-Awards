Description: This project is for research on the molecular mechanisms of
cellular repair of alkylated DNA in M. Iuteus after its exposure to alkylating
agents. The experiments will involve purification and characterization of
enzymes which are seemingly specific to certain alkylating agents. Their
structural chemistry will be studied in order to investigate the physiochemical
interaction between repair proteins and DNA base adducts. These experiments will
be carried out by Dr. A. Athar at the Center for Advanced Molecular Biology
(CAMB) in Lahere, Pakistan. The laboratory of Dr. Lawrence Grossman at Johns
Hopkins University will assist Pakistani collaborators in conducting those
experiments that could not be done in Pakistan. Scope: The collaboration is
beneficial to both institutions and is expected to yield information leading to
better understanding of molecular mechanisms of cellular repair of alkylation
damage to genetic material. The past work by the two laboratories has resulted
in several joint publications.
