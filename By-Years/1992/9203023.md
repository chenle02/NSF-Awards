The goal of this effort is to develop a stable electrocatalyst and gas-diffusion
electrode for use in an on-site electrochemical generator for hydrogen peroxide.
It is projected that the catalyst/support/gas-diffusion electrode system under
investigation will lead to a hydrogen peroxide generator capable of operating at
1 volt and 100 milliamperes per square centimeter; capital costs would be a
third and operating costs a half of those associated with present state- of-the-
art systems. Optimal performance is determined for carbon, gold-catalyzed
carbon, and gold-catalyzed Ebonex electrodes. Units employing these are then
scaled up to electrode areas of 50-100 square centimeters and long-term behavior
studied including cell current efficiency, long-term electrode stability, and
potential chemical interferences. On-site hydrogen peroxide generators have
applications in a large number of situations, including pulp and paper
production, textile manufacture, chemical processing, water treatment, and
sanitation.
