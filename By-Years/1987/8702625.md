This ongoing research program on nonlinear waves will focus on the following
three topics: 1. Functional path integrals. 2. Exact modulation. 3. Three wave
resonant interactions. The first two topics are concerned with the study of some
relationships among equations with the Painleve property, equations solvable by
the Inverse Scattering Transform method, the theory of wave modulation and
representation of solution of partial differential equations by path integrals.
The last topic is concerned with the study of weakly nonlinear interactions of
waves in strictly hyperbolic systems. The mathematical theory of nonlinear waves
is a mathema- tical model of physical wave propagation. The conclusions deduced
from the theory are generally useful to our under- standing of many natural and
technological phenomena. The present research program on nonlinear waves is
aimed toward a better understanding of resonance and instability which are
causes for failures in structural and fluid systems. The research results are
expected to contribute to better designs for many such engineereing systems.
