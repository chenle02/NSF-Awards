&lt;br/&gt;This award to the Quality Education for Minorities QEM Network will
support technical assistance workshops to broaden participation in NSF?s Major
Research Instrumentation Program. In order to offer competitive research and
research training programs in science and engineering, it is imperative that all
US faculty, including faculty at minority-serving institutions (MSIs), and
students conducting research have access to state-of-the-art instrumentation
enabling them to perform high quality research. MSIs have an essential role in
the production of baccalaureate degree recipients of under-represented groups in
STEM disciplines as well as in the disproportionate production of under-
represented college graduates who pursue graduate degrees. Ensuring the
competitiveness of faculty and students enhances diversity in STEM and helps the
science and engineering enterprise achieve the objectives outlined in the
America Competes Act. &lt;br/&gt;
