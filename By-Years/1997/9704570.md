Re: NSF DMS-9704570 Saddlepoint Approximations for Survival Analysis Snehalata
V. Huzurbazar University of Wyoming The primary goal of this research is to
develop saddlepoint approximations to survival and hazard functions used for
bio-medical data or alternatively, approximations to reliability functions used
for engineering data. Modelling of survival data results in complicated waiting
times whose exact distributions are intractable but they can be approximated
using saddlepoint methods. The latter are based on `higher-order' asymptotic
methods and yield extremely accurate approximations for density and distribution
functions which can then be combined to give approximate survival and hazard
functions. The methodology is extremely computer-intensive due to the nature of
the calculations. Survival analysis is primarily concerned with the modelling of
waiting time distributions arising from various scenarios. The investigator
studies models for linear as well as acyclic progression of diseases, models for
competing risks, models with feedback for cyclic behaviour as well as frailty
models for populations which are heterogeneous. Due to the complexity of the
distributions that describe waiting time behaviour in these situations,
conventional methods are restricted to models which mainly use the exponential
distribution. Use of saddlepoint methods removes this restriction, yielding much
more flexibility in modelling. The above models are tremendously useful in
studying the progression of various diseases. For example, progression of the
HIV virus is mainly from one stage to the next; but in some cases, patients can
skip stages and also get better before getting worse. Progression of diseases is
also studied using frailty models, that is, situations in which the whole
population does not have the same risk for a disease. For example, certain
subgroups are more susceptible to diabetes than other subgroups, or
subpopulations may have different ri sks due to exposure to different
environmental factors. Again, modelling the progression of a disease in the
different subgroups can lead to fairly complicated models which tax currently
used methodology but can be handled using saddlepoint methods. Finally, the
methods obtained from this research are easily transferred into reliability
models used in engineering and manufacturing.
