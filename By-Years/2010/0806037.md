Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0806037&lt;br/&gt;Principal
Investigator: Michael L. Hutchings&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main part of the
project is to develop "embedded contact&lt;br/&gt;homology" (ECH), a new
invariant of a contact three-manifold,&lt;br/&gt;which is defined in terms of
periodic orbits of the Reeb flow and&lt;br/&gt;embedded pseudoholomorphic curves
in the symplectization. ECH is&lt;br/&gt;conjecturally isomorphic to versions of
the Seiberg-Witten and&lt;br/&gt;Ozsvath-Szabo Floer homologies. Some specific
goals of the&lt;br/&gt;project are to further develop the analytical foundations
of ECH;&lt;br/&gt;to create tools for computing ECH, particularly in terms of
open&lt;br/&gt;book decompositions; to use ECH to obtain lower bounds on
numbers&lt;br/&gt;of Reeb orbits; and to work towards extending ECH to a
more&lt;br/&gt;general theory which would unify it with the Ozsvath-Szabo
Floer&lt;br/&gt;homology. Some broader goals are to use ECH machinery to
help&lt;br/&gt;compute symplectic field theory in three dimensions, and
to&lt;br/&gt;explore Floer-theoretic invariants of
families.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The embedded contact homology developed in this
project lies on&lt;br/&gt;the interface between dynamics and low-dimensional
topology.&lt;br/&gt;Dynamics is concerned with the behavior of physical systems
over&lt;br/&gt;time, while low-dimensional topology studies the possible
shapes&lt;br/&gt;of curved spaces in three and four dimensions. Embedded
contact&lt;br/&gt;homology allows one to obtain deep topological information
from&lt;br/&gt;an understanding of dynamics; and conversely to obtain
important&lt;br/&gt;dynamical information, such as the existence of
stable&lt;br/&gt;configurations, from topological conditions.
