EAR-0236564&lt;br/&gt;Hammer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This experimental facility
will allow exploration of magmatic processes at high temperature and pressure to
5 kbar. Traditional methods of phase equilibria research developed by igneous
and metamorphic petrologists will be enhanced and adapted using technical
advances such as rapid quenching and automated control of pressure to solve
volcanological problems. Experimental studies will explore eruption parameters
and test hypotheses about volcanic plumbing systems and magmatic processes on
Earth and other planets. Dynamic experiments, particularly those in which
pressure is varied, are vital to understanding how magmas respond chemically to
changes in intensive parameters and volatile concentrations prior to and during
volcanic eruptions. The long-term objective is to contribute to the growing
database of all the relevant parameters necessary to quantitatively model the
timing, style, and intensity of volcanic eruptions. One broader impact of the
scientific results will be an improved understanding of hazards associated with
volcanic eruptions. The laboratory is expected to serve a regional community of
volcanologists in Hawaii and Pacific region, through collaborations with USGS
scientists and university researchers. The University of Hawaii is a magnet for
graduate students in volcanology, many of whom will be exposed to laboratory
research through courses and work toward advanced degrees in the MS/PhD
program.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
