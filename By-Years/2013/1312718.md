The technology developed through this project is a specific way of using speech
recognition to "trigger" required and necessary action from a computing system,
using only speech instead of push-to-talk buttons. Although speech recognition
software is widely available, this technology has the potential to advance the
industry. The project team has worked on this technology for over a decade. The
proposed system will be used as a software tool-kit for software developers
developing applications that fall into one of two categories: 1) the access to
the system is restricted or; 2) access to the system is
prohibited.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This software tool-kit has the potential to
make an impact in helping directly or indirectly impaired users such as
quadriplegics, surgeons, operators wearing HAZMAT suits, remotely operated
vehicles, etc., where the same operation would be very difficult and/or very
expensive to perform or not possible at all.
