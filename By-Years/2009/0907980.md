This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under this award, Drs. Jinyoung Kim
(University of Arizona) and William Sherry (National Solar Observatory) will
carry out a comprehensive observational study of two star forming regions (the
W3 and W4 H II regions) that are representative of an environment where solar
system analogs may commonly form. This study will seek to address two
fundamental questions: What is the most common environment for the formation of
Sun-like stars? and Does star forming environment affect the lifetime of
circumstellar disks where planets form, and affect the final masses of young
stars? As a part of this work they will conduct: 1) a deep multi-color optical
imaging survey of star forming regions in H II region environments to select
candidate young stars; 2) optical spectroscopic follow-up to confirm youth and
derive masses and ages by placing stars in the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram; and
3) analyze archival near- and mid-infrared data to identify circumstellar disks
and characterize their physical properties. The research team will test the idea
that planetary systems like our own could preferentially originate in triggered
star forming regions in an H II region environment by studying two major
physical properties of such regions: a) circumstellar disk frequency as a
function of age and mass; and b) whether or not the initial mass function of
such regions favors the formation of solar mass stars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project will provide support for a graduate student research project as well as
short-term projects for undergraduate students. Dr. Kim will also participate in
existing outreach programs, such as the Women in Science and Engineering (WISE)
program, as well as Project ASTRO and the Great Explorations in Math and Science
(GEMS) Project, where a connection can be made with local school science
teachers and students.
