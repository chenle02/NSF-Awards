Light is detected by photoreceptor cells in the retina of the eye.
Phototransduction is the process of converting the light energy into a neural
signal for relay to the brain, and generally depends on activation of a
phosphate-containing compound as an agent to trigger release of intracellular
calcium; the free calcium in turn triggers changes in the membrane to initiate
the neural signal. Biochemical mechanisms in the photoreceptors initiate and
control light adaptation, which is necessary to keep the eye sensitive over a
huge range of light intensities, from darkest night to brightest day. Recently
some invertebrate eyes have been found to utilize phosphate compounds
incorporating the inositol molecule, rather than the guanine molecule as in the
vertebrate eye, and these inositol phosphates have been implicated in light
adaptation. This project will use squid for a model invertebrate eye providing
abundant material for biochemistry. The aims are to measure the spectral
sensitivity and determine the rate and formation ratios of the inositol
phosphates; to identify the subcellular location of the precursor molecules; and
to study enzymes related to activity of these inositol compounds and calcium
release, particularly protein kinase C that is important in many cellular
activities. Results will be very important for visual physiology, other sensory
transduction systems, and for other aspects of cell biology related to
intracellular signalling.
