The proposal seeks funding to support graduate and undergraduate participation
in the 24th meeting of the North American Catalysis Society (NACS) to be held in
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania June 16-20, 2015. Specifically, the funds will provide
assistance to 30 students from U.S. universities for registration fees and
travel related expenses as administered through the Kokes Travel Award program
sponsored by the NACS. The students will present their research at the
conference, attend lectures by leaders in the field of catalysis, and provide
assistance to the organizers in running the meeting.

The biennial NACS meetings are the largest North American meetings dedicated to
catalysis. Student participation helps train young researchers in this vital
aspect of science and enginering that supports advances in environmental
pollution control, energy utilization, sustainability and greenhouse gas
reduction, and competitiveness of the U.S. chemical and petroleum industries.
