The overall goal of the project is to develop an ecosystem level understanding
of the rates and pathways of carbon, nitrogen, sulfur and water cycling within
an Antarctic dry valley lake, Lake Fryxell, and to develop a quantitative
conceptual model for the system for comparison to similar ecosystems.
Understanding the processes controlling elemental cycling in this physically
relatively simple amictic system will enhance an understanding not just of
Antarctic lakes but of other aquatic systems, especially marine and estuarine
sediment systems and stratified water columns. The specific objectives are to
determine the relative importance of physical versus biological processes in
controlling the composition and distribution of bio-active versus non-bioactive
gases in Antarctic dry valley lakes. A determination will be made of the
relative importance for system organic matter production of rates of water
column versus algal mat photosynthesis and their relative contribution to the
ecosystem carbon cycle. The overall annual rate of organic matter decomposition
within the lake ecosystem will be estimated. The final synthesis of data
collected in this project will be a model of carbon balance for Lake Fryxell.
