9315085 Lyle This award will support a marine geological and geophysical study
of the California Current system and is a cooperative project between scientists
at Boise State University and the University of Southern California. The main
objectives of the project are to acquire an extensive base of seismic reflection
data and a suite of large diameter piston cores and to use this new data to
examine changes in the current system over the last glacial cycle. the results
of the study will be correlated with similar work on land. Additionally, the
data to be acquired will be used in planning drilling as part of the Ocean
Drilling Program which will examine the long-term evolution of the California
Current in response to changing Neogene climate conditions. The investigators on
this study are highly qualified and the project will take advantage of close
cooperation with a number of other groups engaged in studies of the California
Current. ***
