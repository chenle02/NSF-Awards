Significant global scale decreases in total ozone, an atmospheric gas
surrounding the earth, have occurred during the past decades. With the depletion
of the ozone layer, the atmosphere becomes more transparent to solar ultraviolet
radiation. It is well established from laboratory experiments that ultraviolet
radiation can have a deleterious effect on living organisms. Ultraviolet
radiation can affect the genetic material of cells and can affect various
cellular components which regulate biological reactions controlling cell growth
and reproduction. What is less known is the impact of increased ultraviolet
radiation on whole organisms and on organisms in the natural environment. The
focus of this workshop is to bring together scientific experts to assess the
effects of ultraviolet radiation on aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. A
workshop report will summarize the current status of knowledge and will develop
a prioritized research plan of objectives and scientific tasks. This will
provide the international scientific community with a focus to address the issue
of ozone depletion effects on the global system.
