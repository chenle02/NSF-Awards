This award provides 60% of the funds required to modernize the X- ray
fluorescence (XRF) spectrometer operated in the Department of Geological
Sciences at the University of South Carolina. The University is committed to
providing the remaining funds. The XRF laboratory is used to obtain chemical
analyses (major and trace elements) of rock and mineral samples in support of
research projects and teaching in earth sciences at the University of South
Carolina. It is presently using a twelve year old instrument which has been kept
in a good state of repair. The modest upgrade supported by this award will bring
its capabilities to a level comparable with modern equipment.
