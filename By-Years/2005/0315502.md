In this project, funded jointly by the Molecular Biophysics Program in the
Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division, the PI will continue
his study of models representing biological membranes. While in the previous
work the research effort was mostly concentrated on the study of properties of
lipids in the bilayer, this research will emphasize the study of properties of
aqueous solutions next to lipids and inside the pores of membrane channels. A
series of molecular dynamics computer simulations will be performed that will
provide data needed for quantitative and qualitative analysis of issues
connected to the following fundamental problems: a) The nature of hydration
forces acting between phospholipid bilayers. b) The behavior of aqueous ionic
solution enclosed in the space between the bilayers. c) The structural and
dynamical properties of aqueous solutions inside membrane
channels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is known that aqueous solutions play an
important role in regulating interactions between membranes, membranes and
peptides, and membranes and DNA. Clear understanding of the nature of these
interactions is still missing. This research, geared towards the understanding
of properties of water and aqueous solutions between membrane surfaces and in
pores of ion channels, will be very helpful for understanding of common motifs
related to properties of biological water and water in confined spaces. This
understanding is absolutely necessary in order to rationally design assemblies
of macromolecules that will perform specifically desired
functions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
