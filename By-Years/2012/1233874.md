This project has the following goals: (i) to undertake the analysis the
Variability of the American Monsoon Systems (VAMOS) Ocean-Coupled-Atmosphere-
Land-System (VOCALS) datasets; and (ii)to assess aerosol-cloud interactions for
the southeast Atlantic and the dynamics that affect them. Precipitation impacts
on aerosol indirect effects will be examined using remotely-sensed airborne
VOCALS datasets and satellite-derived values. Aerosol transport pathways, their
influence on and interactions with the southeast Atlantic stratocumulus deck at
synoptic and diurnal time scales will also be examined, using a suite of
observational datasets and reanalyses encompassing multiple years. A combination
of approaches (empirical orthogonal functions, compositing, and backtrajectories
and Lagrangian particle dispersion modeling) will be utilized.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will improve understanding the dynamical
influences on aerosol-cloud interactions in the Southern Hemisphere. This has
the potential to improve the capability of future climate predictions; thus this
activity has substantial broader impacts.
