9400310 Schuller This Americas Program award will support Dr. Ivan Schuller of
the University of California, San Diego, in a theoretical-experimental
collaboration in the field of magnetic thin films, with Prof. Ricardo Ramirez of
the Universidad Catolica, Santiago, Chile. The studies proposed are geared
towards understanding thin film growth in a quantitative fashion. From the
experimental point of view thin films and interfaces will be characterized using
several growth techniques and a large variety of structural and chemical
characterization techniques. Prof.Ramirez has been conducting theoretical
studies of thin film growth in Chile, while Dr. Schuller has an experimental
program in the same field underway in the U.S. This award will allow coupling of
both programs. The area is of importance to researchers working in technologies
requiring thin films and multilayer film metallic growth and characterization.
These include the magnetic recording industry, sensor technology, and new
technologies growing out of giant magneto- resistance phenomena. ***
