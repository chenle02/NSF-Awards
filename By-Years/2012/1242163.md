The primary goal of this NUE in Engineering program entitled, "NUE: Unifying
Nanotechnology Education at CUNY Community Colleges", at CUNY City College,
under the direction of Dr. Ilona Kretzschmar, is to unify nanotechnology
education at 2-year Community Colleges (CC) in the City University of New York
(CUNY) system and to create a pipeline of better prepared students from these
CCs to Senior Colleges such as the City College of New York (CCNY). This goal
will be achieved using a successfully tested process for implementation of
Nanomaterials curricula developed over the past two years in collaboration
between Hostos and Bronx Community College faculty and CCNY faculty for the
implementation of Nanotechnology Education at Borough of Manhattan (BMCC),
LaGuardia (LGCC), Kingsborough (KBCC), and Queensborough (QBCC) Community
Colleges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the direct educational impact on
CC curriculum and students, this project also creates a pipeline for a diverse
group of research-trained students from the CCs to Senior Colleges and provides
support to enhance retention. The student populations are 74 (BMCC), 53 (LGCC),
48 (KCC), and 51% (QBCC) from Hispanic or African American ethnic groups. Thus,
the transfer of CC students to Senior Colleges in the CUNY system via the
Introduction to Nanomaterials Course will increase the overall diversity in STEM
disciplines at CUNY. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed unification of
Nanotechnology education at the CUNY community colleges provides an
unprecedented opportunity to create a critical cluster of nanotechnology
expertise at the community colleges, which has the potential to affect the
entire CUNY system.
