9401018 Lunts Professor Lunts will work on problems in the foundations of
representation theory and algebraic geometry. In particular he will continue his
study of the equivariant derived category of sheaves with a view to applications
in equivariant geometry and representation theory. This is research in the field
of algebraic geometry. Algebraic geometry itself is one of the oldest parts of
modern mathematics, but one which has had a revolutionary flowering in the past
quarter-century. In its origin, it treated figures that could be defined in the
plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays the field makes
use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis and topology, and
conversely is finding application in those fields as well as in physics,
theoretical computer science, and robotics.
