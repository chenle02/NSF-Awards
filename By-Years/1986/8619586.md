The goal of this proposal is to explore the feasibility and technical merits of
a process for making intricate thin wall castings by using permanent molds
preheated to the metal melting temperature of the cast metal. The molds would be
in the form of a punch and a die. The molten metal would be introduce into the
preheated die and then the preheated punch would be lowered into the die. The
preheat of the molds to the temperature of the molten metal would ensure
complete filling of the intricate thin walled cavity between the punch and die.
Solidification of the cast metal is achieved by introduction of a predetermined
quantity of water or cold air into the cooling channel of the punch in such
quantity that no extensive reheating of the punch and die is needed for the next
casting. The punch and die material would be alloy steel as used in the die
casting industry. A suitable coating would be employed on the cavity surfaces to
facilitate extraction of the casting from the die. Aluminum alloy will be
employed as the cast metal in this proposal; however, application of this
techniques should also be possible to alloys of tin, lead, zinc, magnesium and
copper. This work will explore the minimum casting thickness, the
microstructure, strength and ductility properties, and the cycle time. With the
proposed process it may be possible to attain wall thicknesses smaller than with
the die casting process, i.e. 0.040" or less, without the need for pressure as
is employed in the die casting process. Properties of the cast metal may also be
enhanced.
