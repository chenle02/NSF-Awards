This proposal describes the repair of critical infrastructure at Arecibo
Observatory (AO) damaged by Hurricane Maria in September 2017. The repairs
conducted in this supplement include the most urgent: site backup power
(including repairing and rewinding three out of the four site generators and
installation of a solar backup array), building repairs, inspections of critical
infrastructure, and preparations for more complicated repairs (e.g. engineering
studies for the replacement of the line feed that was completely destroyed
during Hurricane Maria). The proposal outlines the planned activities in detail,
all of which are in support of returning the site to a world-class working
science observatory. Observations obtained by AO contribute to the fulfillment
of scientific goals set out by the astronomy, planetary science, ionospheric
physics, and the space weather communities. The radar system at AO is a unique
asset, but currently cannot be used due to the needed generator repairs. Until
these repairs are conducted, radar-imaging of near-earth asteroids, for example,
is not possible. The observation and categorization of near-earth objects (NEOs)
is a Congressional mandate. AO is one of the leading education and public
outreach centers worldwide, and a top attraction for students in Puerto
Rico.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
