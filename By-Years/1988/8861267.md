Metalorganic chemical vapor deposition of metallic oxides is an established
technology in the electronics industry for production of thin film insulators
and transparent conductors with tailored properties. Applied to the new
superconducting ceramic materials this process could produce films in oxygen
which do not require sintering, films which may grow epitaxially on single
crystal substrates and films of exceptionally high purity with uniform
composition and crystal phases. The objective of Phase I is to demonstrate that
metalorganic chemical vapor deposition of yttrium-barium-copper-oxide on
zirconia, alumina, coated alumina or strontium titanate yields a uniform
superconducting film with a smooth surface.
