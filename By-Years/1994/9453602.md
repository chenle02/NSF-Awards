Lincoln, NE 68588 CETP Development Grant Title: PLATTE: Partnerships Leading to
Active Transformation of Teacher Education Practicing K-12 teachers are in
residence in mathematics and science departments at the collegiate level working
in partnership with and as a resource for collegiate faculty developing and
teaching introductory courses in mathematics and the sciences designed for
prospective teachers, K-12, of mathematics and the sciences. The teacher's
residence provides a year long professional development experience for teachers
who will be an integral component of successful field experiences for preservice
teachers. The program also encourages participating teachers to become lifelong
learners. The postsecondary faculty members benefit by having a rich resource
from which to develop new content and pedagogy. The project brings solid content
knowledge as well as classroom experiences and insights into the way young
people do and learn mathematics and the sciences.
