****Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;This project studies how metallic
properties develop as a function of size in clusters of atoms from a single atom
to a few hundred atoms. A laser produced metal vapor cloud condenses into
clusters in cryogenically cooled helium, producing a molecular beam of ultra
cold clusters that are deflected in static and oscillating electric and magnetic
fields. From their response the electronic properties of these clusters, in the
ground state and in excited states, will be determined, revealing the evolution
of superconductivity, the Kondo effect, metal conductivity and ferromagnetism is
as a function of atomically precise size and composition. The understanding of
these metallic properties on the nanoscale is vital for nanoscience and
nanotechnologhy. The research provides undergraduate and graduate students with
an exquisite opportunity to be active in frontier science while learning a wide
variety of experimental techniques. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****Non-Technical
Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;Many properties of metals, why and how some are magnetic,
how they conduct electricity, and what makes some become superconductors at low
temperatures are reasonably well understood in bulk samples. But single atoms of
these metal have none of these properties. This project will reveal how these
bulk metal properties evolve from atomic properties in clusters of metal atoms.
A unique apparatus has been developed that can produce these metal clusters in
high vacuum and measure them one at a time to determine how they respond to
magnetic and electric fields. By measuring the forces that these fields exert on
the clusters with precise knowledge of their size and composition, the evolution
of metal properties can be determined. This knowledge is vital for fundamental
science as well as for nanotechnology. The research also provides undergraduate
and graduate students with an excellent opportunity to be active in frontier
science while learning a wide variety of experimental techniques.
