The goal of the ComputerScienceForGeorgia (CS4GA) workshop will apply research
and a variety of intervention experiences to a specific community in order to
make computer science (CS) education available and accessible to all students
within that community context. While there is industry and parental support for
CS in K12, the process of adding a new discipline has both systemic and
community context specific nuisances. In order to effectively add a new
discipline to an already packed school day without marginalizing large groups of
students and whole communities, it is important to not only address the systemic
processes and stimulate awareness among the various stakeholder groups but also
to understand the barriers endemic to particular context, including but not
limited to the location and population density of a community. This project
builds on a current INCLUDES pilot initiative and can offer insights to a
diversity of community stakeholders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
