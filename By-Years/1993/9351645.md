This project is expanding a pilot program developed by two of the co-principal
investigators to enhance the mathematics curriculum at Palomar College with
computer technology. Preliminary laboratory materials were developed for
teaching one section of College Algebra and one section of Calculus I with a
computer laboratory component during the spring 1992 semester. This project is
providing the resources to continue that curriculum development and expand to
other College Algebra, Precalculus, and Calculus I sections. Macintosh computers
and associated peripherals are being used to provide a laboratory component for
College Algebra, Precalculus, and Calculus I courses offered by the college. The
computers are empowering students to simultaneously represent functions in
numeric, symbolic and graphic form. Students can visualize mathematical concepts
without the need for excessive preliminary concentration on rote manipulation.
Students concentrate on learning concepts through guided discovery, using
problem solving strategies, and becoming familiar with how mathematics is done
outside the classroom. The laboratory environment is requiring students to work
collaboratively and write about the mathematics they are learning.
