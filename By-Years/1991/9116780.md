This award supports a study designed to evaluate the occurrence of deglacial
Younger Dryas-style climatic events and high frequency oceanographic variability
throughout the late Pleistocene in the Sulu Sea of the Indonesian tropics. The
Younger Dryas is an abrupt and rapid climatic event which occurred between
11,000 and 10,000 14C years ago and had been primarily identified in
paleoclimatic data from Europe and the North Atlantic high latitudes. This study
will test the hypothesis that other Younger Dryas-style events and millennial-
scale climatic variability occurred during other deglaciations in the late
Pleistocene. To accomplish this a new detailed sampling scheme covering the last
750,000 years will be used in combination with the oxygen isotope stratigraphic
framework already developed. The high-resolution paleoclimatic records resulting
from this study will provide valuable insight into millennial-scale variability
and the origin and regularity of abrupt climatic events in this strongly
monsoonal region of the western tropical Pacific.
