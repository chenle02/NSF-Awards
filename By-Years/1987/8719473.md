This project in the physical chemistry program focuses on the theoretical
determination of transient, interaction-induced changes in molecular dipoles and
polarizabilities on the time scale of molecular collisions. Where overlap
between the interacting molecules is slight, calculations will be based on the
PI's nonlocal polarizability density model, which accounts for the distribution
of polarizable matter throughout each molecule. The model will be extended to
include a practical means of computing nonlocal, nonlinear response. The
polarizability densities will be analyzed for physical content, and collision-
induced properties of spectroscopic interest will be computed. The PI will also
apply reaction field theory to find dispersion contributions to the
polarizabilities of anisotropic molecules for the first time, and extend the
theory to frequency-dependent response. To incorporate nonadditive exchange-
polarization where overlap is moderate, the PI plans to perform density
functional and exchange-perturbation calculations; the latter also include
charge transfer. Required single-molecule moments, susceptibilities, and short-
range pair properties will be determined by ab initio calculations.
Representative species to be studied include H2...H2, N2...N2, Ar...Ar, and
Ar...HCl. This research is important for its spectroscopic applications, since
significant information on intermolecular dynamics can be extracted from
collision-induced absorption and scattering spectra, if the two collision-
induced dipoles and polarizabilities have been determined as functions of
intermolecular distances, relative orientations, and vibrational frequency.
