This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to develop a novel
intraocular lens implant (IOL) with the goal to restore full visual function in
patients undergoing cataract surgery. Currently, during cataract surgery, an IOL
is implanted in the capsular bag that used to contain the cataract. This lens
provides focused vision at only one distance. All attempts to develop an
effective variable focus (accommodating) IOL have failed, and this project
concept overcomes the current limitations with a zonular capture haptic (ZCH)
that has individual components. The company has established proof of concept in
animal models and shown that a ZCH parallels the movement of the ciliary body
that controls focus within the eye. The technical goals of this project are to
measure the actual forces exerted by the eye during accommodation using a ZCH
dynamometer, and then use these measurements to engineer and perfect our ZCH
prototypes.

The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is addressing the
degradation of sight affecting almost every person. By 2020 it is estimated that
30 million Americans will suffer from cataracts and 9.5 million people would
have undergone cataract surgery. All human beings are affected by presbyopia
(inability to focus up close) if their life span extends past the fourth decade
of life. ?Premium? IOLs such as Bausch and Lomb?s Crystalens, Abbott Medical
Optics? ReZoom, and Alcon?s ReSTOR only achieve one diopter of accommodation
equivalent which is inadequate. Yet about 7% of cataract patients pay about
$2,000 out of pocket per eye above their Medicare coverage to receive a Premium
IOL. The worldwide market size for Premium IOLs is approximately $500MM. In
addition 700,000 patients undergo refractive surgery via Lasik-type procedures
each year and pay $2,000-$6,000 per eye with the possibility of later requiring
cataract surgery and the certainty of needing reading glasses. If successful,
the proposed ZCH would be the sole technology that restores movement to an IOL
and as such has the potential of being a successful surgery that corrects
cataracts, refractive errors and presbyopia.
