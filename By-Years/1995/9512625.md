This award provides funds to evaluate, purchase and test a Coastal Circulation
Radar System (CCRS), a portable land-based radar system for measuring surface
currents in the coastal ocean. This is a system is capable of providing near
real-time maps of surface current over the coastal ocean as frequently as once
every 20 minutes. Depending on its mode of operation, the radar has a maximum
range of 45 km with 1 km resolution or 12 km range with 250 m resolution. This
system will support various projects including studies in the GLOBEC and CoOP
programs. Funding is provided by the ARI program with cost sharing by OSU.
