Some of the most critical interactions facilitating mammalian life occur between
mammals and the diverse communities of microbes that reside within their guts.
Plant-eating mammals harbor the most diverse microbial communities. Many of
these microbes are important in the degradation of fiber; however, gut microbes
may also play an essential role in detoxifying the natural toxins common in
plants. This project will investigate how host evolutionary history and dietary
toxins shape the diversity of the gut microbiome of herbivorous mammals by
focusing on a group of rodents that specialize in eating plants that are toxic
to other animals. Woodrats have an unusually toxic diet spanning a broader array
of plants than most species. This makes them a potential model system for
insight into this poorly understood but clearly important role of biodiversity
in allowing animals to cope with plant defenses. The objectives of this project
are to 1) identify and compare the microbial communities across chambers of the
rodent gut to understand their function 2) investigate the influences of
evolutionary history and dietary toxins in sculpting microbial diversity and
function; 3) determine how diversity interacts with the liver of the host to
facilitate detoxification. This project will provide some of the first insights
into the microbial diversity of wild herbivores and the role that plant toxins
play in shaping diversity.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This work will advance our
understanding of microbial diversity and may reveal new microbes useful for
human probiotics. The discovery of novel microbes and genes associated with
detoxification is anticipated; such biological material is of great interest to
agricultural scientists wishing to improve husbandry practices in livestock. A
one-week summer workshop will be offered annually to middle school students to
teach concepts of microbial diversity through the development of interactive
computer simulations and games.
