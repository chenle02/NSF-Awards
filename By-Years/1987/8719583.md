This proposal intends to take two fairly diverse areas, combustion and
nonlinear dynamics of shells, and apply a similar numerical method (domain
decomposition) to both areas. Each area is represented by a well known
researcher, Belytschko- shells &amp; Bayliss-combustion, and in the application
of the method an expert in numerical optimization, Nocedal, will contribute to
the effort. This proposal is a nice example of interdisciplinary research within
a university. Using domain decomposition as a connection the three researchers
will cooperate to make advances not only in their individual areas, but also in
parallel processing. The original proposal was for a three year effort. Due to
the uncertain program funding, and the heavy future commitment, this proposal is
recommended for only two years as a standard grant. As discussed with the PI's,
a number of other cost reductions have been included: the visiting professor has
not been approved; the disc upgrade has not been included; the networking
request has been denied; most important, the number of graduate students has
been reduced from three to two. It is felt that by this last action that the
three faculty members will have to coordinate their research in order to best
occupy these two students.
