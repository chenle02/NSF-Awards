This study involves the use of computational methods to investigate a
potentially important pathway for association reactions, being those chemical
reactions in which two species combine to form a metastable intermediate species
before dissociating to the final products. The potential pathways involve the
ways in which excess energy is transferred to the bath gas. The standard Energy
Transfer Mechanism (ETM) has been employed successfully to explain a number of
atmospherically important association reactions. The alternative process is the
Chaperone Mechanism (CM) that could explain why some association reactions have
multiple channels or unusual dependence on concentrations of non-reacting
species (for example, water vapor). A detailed framework for dealing with the CM
component of association reactions will be developed, and an investigation of
the utility of using the rate of quenching of vibrationally excited species as
an alternative to using the high pressure limiting association rate coefficient
will also be undertaken. Finally, a computer program will be developed that
incorporates the key findings of this study and will be freely distributed to
all interested parties. The results of this research, while relevant to
atmospheric chemistry, will also benefit researchers studying combustion,
planetary atmospheres, and other chemically reacting systems.
