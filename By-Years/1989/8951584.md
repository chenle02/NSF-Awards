The Environmental/Water Resources Engineering (EWRE) curriculum is being
upgraded through the acquisition of an atomic absorption spectrophotometer and a
gas chromatograph for trace contaminant analysis. The equipment is being
integrated into a laboratory and required EWRE lecture courses. Trace metal and
organic priority pollutants have become fairly ubiquitous in the environment and
a basic understanding of their detection, behavior and control is increasingly
important in undergraduate civil engineering. This project is being matched by
an amount equal to the award.
