Curriculum changes to emphasize modern experimental biology will be supported
by the purchase of an ultracentrifuge, high- speed centrifuge, liquid
scintillation counter, horizontal gel apparatus and other equipment to support
instruction in recombinant DNA technology. This will facilitate the addition of
a laboratory course in advanced molecular biology that will emphasize recent
experimental advances in the understanding of the structure, function, and
regulation of genes and their products. Many modern techniques, such as
radiolabelling, density gradient centrifugation, ultracentrifugation,
electrophoresis, and recombinant DNA methodology will be applied in the
laboratory. In addition, improvements will be made in the introductory
cell/molecular laboratory, which is part of the "core curriculum," and
capabilities for student research will be expanded. The college will provide 50%
matching funds.
