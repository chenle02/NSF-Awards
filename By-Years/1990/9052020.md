This project was designed to upgrade the undergraduate chemistry curriculum at
the institution. The objectives were to expand the laboratory program in
chemistry in the upper level courses and to provide more equipment with which to
carry out student oriented research projects. The project forms an integral part
of the University plan to emphasize the sciences on the campus. The specific
activities of the project involved two specific areas, namely (1) the
acquisition of new equipment to expand the range of laboratory experiments
available and (2) the expansion of the research program. The main outcomes of
the project are an improvement in the basic undergraduate curriculum in
chemistry through an improvement in the resources that are available to the
student. The improvement results in a better prepared graduate of the University
who in turn is be better able to compete at the professional level after
graduation. The institution contributed to the project in an amount slightly in
excess of the NSF funds.
