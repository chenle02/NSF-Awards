As a result of the massive technological reform which has taken place during the
past ten years, virtually every academic and industrial research institution now
obtains infrared spectra through the use of Fourier Transform instrumentation.
To adequately prepare students who hope to pursue research-oriented careers, the
Department of Chemistry at La Salle University has recently acquired a Fourier
Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectrophotometer which is being used by junior and
senior chemistry majors as an integral part of four courses in the undergraduate
curriculum: Advanced Quantitative (Instrumental) Analysis, Qualitative Organic
Analysis, Advanced Inorganic Chemistry, and Senior Research. Through this
experience, undergraduates are better able to understand the Fourier Transform
method, learn how to perform peak searches in existing FTIR spectra libraries,
and utilize IR spectroscopy as a quantitative technique.
