The American Society for Cell Biology summer meeting on cytokinesis will focus
on the most recent studies that challenge some of the long-standing views on
cytokinesis. The meeting will be organized around functional aspects of
cytokinesis and will include sessions on cortical assembly, membrane dynamics,
interactions with mitosis, and findings of new genomic and non-genomic
approaches.
