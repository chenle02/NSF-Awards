This project will use multi.dimensional X.ray diffraction techniques to obtain
high resolution molecular structures of polymerizable lipids in hydrated
bilayers. It will determine the relationship between molecular structure of
lipid monomers and the ultrastructures they form. The focus will be on
diacetylenic phosphatidylcholines, which form tubular ultrastructures which do
appear by some criteria to have a nearly crystalline lattice structure, but do
not polymerize as well as other diacetylenic molecules. The investigator will
also attempt to develop a rational theory for the formation of chiral tubules
and identify the structural parameters which promote optimal diacetylenic
polymerization of amphiphilic diacetylenes. Polymerizable lipids are surfactants
with a reactive group that allows surfactant monomers to be cross.linked by
chemical or photochemical catalysis. The liposomes or films formed by these
lipids are thereby more robust than those made of conventional lipids and may be
more effective in a variety of applications such as synthetic membranes for
separations and chemical sensors, thin films for new electronic devices, and
biomedical applications. In addition, they are good model systems for the study
of the physics of biological membranes. >____________________________>
