9450228 DeRose The preparation that students receive in kindergarten through
twelfth grade and college is no longer adequate to sustain our nation's
superiority in mathematics, science and technology. A major educational reform
is essential. The NCTM Curriculum and Evaluation Standards provide excellent
direction for changes in mathematics education, and inspired the development of
this real- world problem-solving high school mathematics courseware. With this
courseware, teachers can base their instruction on real world problems to be
solved using mathematics, and provide their students with the power of computing
technology to do so. The courseware consists of 1) a set of 60 simulated real-
world problems that require practical solutions; 2) a set of 15 mathematical,
measurement, and data collection computing utilities; and 3) a teacher guide.
Students are invited to explore problems, implement problem-solving strategies,
apply the appropriate mathematical concepts, select and apply the computer
utilities they think are appropriate, and determine whether or not the problems
have been adequately solved. This courseware is available in CD-ROM based
multimedia, as well as video tape and stand-alone computer software. ***
