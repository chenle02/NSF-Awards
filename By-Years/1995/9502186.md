Chai 95-02186 Professor Chai will continue his work on moduli spaces of Abelian
varieties. In particular, he wishes to study the density of Hecke orbits in
certain Shimura varieties. He also wishes to study the canonical lifting of
Abelian varieties and certain classes of motives. He hopes to apply his results
to prove the existence of certain canonical integral models. This project falls
into the general area of arithmetic geometry - a subject that blends two of the
oldest areas of mathematics: number theory and geometry. This combination has
proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems that withstood
generations. Among its many consequences are new error correcting codes. Such
codes are essential for both modern computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
