This award provides one-half the funding for the acquisition of an automated
electron probe microanalyzer to be installed and operated in the Materials
Characterization Laboratory of the College of Earth and Mineral Sciences at the
Pennsylvania State University. Penn State University is committed to providing
the remaining half of the funding required. Major users of the microanalyzer
will include staff and students of the departments of Geosiences, Metallurgy,
Minerals Processing and Fuel Sciences. The need to accurately characterize
chemical composition of both natural and synthetic solids with a spatial
resolution of micrometers is a requirement that runs common to many of the
sponsored research projects at the College of Earth and Mineral Sciences.
