The equipment purchased herewith will be used in a series of undergraduate
physics laboratories for data acquisition and analysis. In the first year,
several experiments in classical mechanics, mechanical waves, and optics, for
the introductory laboratories, will be enhanced. The project will then be
extended to include a variety of upper level experiments in optics, electronics,
modern physics, and possibly classical electricity and magnetism, for physics
and physics/engineering majors. Some of these experiments will also be used in
an introductory computer interfacing course for non-science majors.
