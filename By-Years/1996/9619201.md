9619201 Bock This award supports research aimed at an integration of two
technologies which have proven useful for monitoring motion of the Earth's
crust. The Global Positioning System (GPS) is currently capable of measuring
baselines (the distance between two GPS receiver location points on Earth) with
a precision in the millimeter range at distances of hundreds of kilometers.
Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (INSAR) cannot offer a comparable level
of precision, but has the advantage of being able to measure relative motion of
the crust over a continuous area (as opposed to a limited number of discrete
points on the surface). Combining the two approaches will provide greatly
enhanced capabilities for understanding such phenomena as earthquake related
motion (pre-, syn-, and post-seismic), volcanic activity, plate tectonic
motions, groundwater movement, and other local and regional crustal strain
processes. The research is a collaboration among geoscientists at the University
of California, San Diego, Stanford University and the University of Hawaii. The
approach by the collaborators will be: (1) to reduce the so-called orbital or
baseline error of INSAR by deploying radar reflectors or transponders at
selected GPS receiver sites and thereby pin down the precise locations of those
points to serve as anchors for the INSAR interferometry, and (2) use
meteorogical models and satellite data to reduce the error in GPS locations due
to the effect of water vapor in the atmosphere. ***
