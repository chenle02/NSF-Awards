Improving the publics" understanding of the scientific enterprise and improving
scientific literacy have been identified as critical goals in the United States.
Science learning occurs in formal (i.e. classroom) as well as in informal (i.e.
backyards) settings and there are likely to be, at least, qualitative
differences in outcomes between these learning environments. It is critical that
scientists collaborate with professional science educators not only to identify
the components of scientific literacy, but also to understand how learning
occurs in these different settings and to help provide this information to other
scientists and educators who will be ultimately responsible for the education of
the population in both formal and informal settings. This proposal seeks funding
to continue and complete the important research that I began as a National
Science Foundation PFSMETE Fellow and to support the preliminary research and
development of two other projects that have resulted directly from my post-
doctoral position. For the former, I am proposing to analyze, present and
publish my ongoing work on understanding the factors that most affect student
attitudes and motivation in an established Student/Scientist Partnership, Forest
Watch. The new projects include a study of the effects of a community data
collection program called Neighborhood Nestwatch on scientific literacy in
participants, and the development and implementation of two environmental
education courses at Paul Smith's College that will be the cornerstones for the
creation of an environmental science education emphasis within the Natural
Resource Bachelor of Science degree.
