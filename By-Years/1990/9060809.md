The objective of this Phase I SBIR project is to develop new detection
techniques for rare noble gas isotopes. Two different detector concepts which
combine elements of mass spectroscopy, charge neutralization, photon burst and
resonance ionization spectroscopy will be evaluated. The research offers the
possibility of a breakthrough in detection capabilities of minute quantities of
rare noble gas isotopes such as Argon-39. Argon-39 is ideally suited for
studying the penetration of greenhouse gases across the thermocline and for the
study of deep-ocean circulation.
