Abstract EEC-9634341 Shortell The escalating costs of medical care are having a
significant impact on the economy of the United States. An Industry/University
Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) on Health Management has been formed to
conduct research on how effective management of hospitals and hospital systems
could result in more effective operations and lower costs. This I/UCRC involves
a consortium of universities headquartered at Arizona State University. This
planning meeting will conduct a study to determine if Northwestern University
can develop sufficient industry or hospital support for a study of
integrated/organized health care delivery systems. If sufficient support can be
developed, the Northwestern University Program will become a research site of
the I/UCRC for Health Management Research.
