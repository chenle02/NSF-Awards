The State University of New York College at Fredonia prepares to host the
"Pathways of Mathematics and Science Summer Program." The need for the project
in the target area (northern Chautauqua and Cattaraugus Counties, Western New
York State) is strong due to the large number of minority students. The target
ares, considered part of Appalachia by the federal government, is a region of
hard- working people, rich in multiethnic culture and heritage, but a region
whose population is primarily educationally and economically deprived. The
project will serve 50 students annually from three target schools. This four-
week commuter project will provide unique learning experiences in mathematics
and science to encourage the students to continue the study of math and science,
to realize the importance of these subjects in their everyday lives and
appreciate that both are interesting and enjoyable. The summer project has three
modules: I) Knowing the course-work; II) Knowing yourself; and III) Knowing the
school system. The content for mathematics will be geometry, measurement,
statistics, probability, ratio, proportion, and algebra. The content for science
will be ecology, environmental geology and mineralogy. Instructional activities
are hands-on, independent study, intensive lab use, work stations, and field
trips. Problem-solving, communication, reasoning, and connection will provide
students with the conditions for learning mathematics and science. An evaluation
plan with measurable outcomes will allow the project to make necessary changes.
Community and institutional support are strong. ***
