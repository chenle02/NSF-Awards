This workshop will bring together a group of technical, policy and user experts
to develop a strategy and action plan for increasing the public interest in
digital rights management (DRM). The objectives are to 1) examine the current
state of development of DRM systems, 2) assess the potential impact of these
developments on public sector institutions, particularly research and
educational institutions and libraries, and their users, and 3) explore options
for increasing public sector involvement in the design of technical standards
and specifications for DRM. A report will be produced that will be the basis for
further discussion and action on the part of public interest organizations.
