The subject of this mathematical research project is the theory of Banach
algebras, which may be thought of as linear algebra in infinitely many
dimensions. One can do arithmetic (add and multiply) in this setting, and one
can also take limits. A fundamental theme of research in this area is to
understand how the arithmetic and the limit-taking influence one another. For
instance, does a map between Banach algebras satisfying prescribed arithmetic
identities automatically preserve limits? The principal investigators will work
on questions of this nature. More specifically, they will continue their
investi- gation of the continuity and algebraic structure of derivations from
Banach algebras to modules. Necessary and sufficient conditions on the algebra
and/or the module will be sought which will insure that each derivation is
continuous, each continuous derivation into a dual bimodule is inner and each
continuous derivation into the dual space of the algebra is inner. Particular
atention will be paid to Banach algebras of integrable functions and other
Banach algebras arising naturally in analysis and applications.
