9708558 Haimes The 8th Conference on "Risk-Based Decision Making in Water
Resources" organized by the Engineering Foundation will take place in Santa
Barbara, California, on October 12-17, 1997. The main objectives of the
conference is to examine the state-of-the- art in risk/benefit analysis, to
explore the use of risk/benefit analysis in water resources planning and
management including hydrologic extremes, to exchange information among various
stake- holders, and to identify future research activities. Some of the issues
that will be discussed are: water-works safety and risk of catastrophic and
extreme events; how to deal with uncertainties in data, models and forecasts and
how they influence the management of water resources; advances in risk analysis.
This is a research area of great importance for the mitigation of natural and
man-made hazards and for the sound economic development of regions and the
Nation. ***
