An ADC is a device which is used to sample an analog signal and converts it
into a digital code proportional to its amplitude. Nyquist theory states that
the sampling frequency must be at least twice the maximum frequency of the
analog signal. Thus the speed of existing ADCs limit the application of digital
electronics in systems that have wide bandwidth signals. There are applications
which demand bandwidths that exceed several hundred megahertz. Exploratory
developments of electrooptic analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) capable of
operating at 1 GHz with 6-bit resolution have been reported. This bit and
frequency range is of interest because existing silicon and gallium arsenide
technology have not been demonstrated above this range. %%% The purpose of the
proposed research is to develop a wide bandwidth electrooptic ADC which operates
at 10 GHz with 6-bit resolution.
