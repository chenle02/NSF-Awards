The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) proposes to support student
attendance at and development of the Richard Tapia Celebration of Diversity in
Computing. The Tapia Conference series highlights the technical achievements of
diverse researchers in computing. It provides a unique forum to support diverse
students (undergraduates and graduate students) and professionals. The
conference programs include invited speakers, workshops, birds-of-a-feather
sessions, panels, a student poster competition and a doctoral consortium. The
programs allow leadership development activities for the students as well as
young professionals. Moreover, they include significant time for networking
about research collaborations and professional development. This proposal will
support student scholarships for the conference and the doctoral consortium in
2015.
