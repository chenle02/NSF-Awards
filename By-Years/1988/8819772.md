A fundamental issue of taste physiology is whether there are specific types of
responses in specific nerve fibers, or whether there is a continuum of
sensitivities across the population of fibers. This project exploits the
remarkable taste system of the catfish, which has taste buds all over the skin
of the body, to investigate the physiology of taste responses to particular
compounds and to particular mixtures. Electrophysiological recording will be
used to determine how amino acid taste "quality" and quantity (intensity) are
represented in neurons of the facial nerve, which innervates the taste buds.
Since in real life taste receptors rarely encounter sequentially spaced delivery
of single chemicals, stimuli will include single compounds and mixtures, to see
whether, as in invertebrates, responses to taste mixtures are not simply
predictable from responses to the individual components. Recordings also will be
made in the cells of central pathways that process the taste information through
the brainstem and higher gustatory nuclei. This unusual preparation has provided
a wealth of fundamental information on taste sensitivity already, and this
project will provide results that are likely to have high impact on gustatory
research. This physiology also will complement current exciting work on taste
biochemistry, and the analyses of complex stimuli are likely to be important to
sensory science in general.
