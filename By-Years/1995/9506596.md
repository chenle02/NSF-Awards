9506596 Bilham The PIs will monitor the vertical motion of four tide gauge sites
along the East Coast of the United States and Canada. They will also make
absolute gravity surveys at the four tide gauge sites. Vertical tectonic motions
observed with GPS and absolute gravity when combined with relative sea level
measurements from the tide gauge will provide an accurate determination of the
relative roles of crustal motion and absolute sea level rise in the region. The
research will examine whether the vertical systematic errors in GPS and absolute
gravity are sufficiently low at coastal sites to permit better than 3 mm
agreement between the two systems. Long term averages given suitable corrections
for the local effects suggest that they may agree to 1 mm. The proposed research
aims to quantify their true agreement. ****
