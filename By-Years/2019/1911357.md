This proposal targets two important areas of human health through the
development of an innovative technology that will improve the efficacy of
chemotherapy for cancer patients, and also for antibiotic treatments for
patients with septic shock therapy. Biodynamic imaging, a method to detect
intracellular motion developed under a previous NSF grant, has the potential to
fill this need. This project will extend biodynamic imaging to measure cell
signals in response to immunotherapies as well as antibiotics for bacterial
infections. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Biodynamic imaging uses low-coherence digital
holography to detect intracellular Doppler signals from diverse cellular motions
inside in vitro and/or ex vivo living tissue. Cellular motions are endogenous
and provide a functional imaging approach to measure the pharmacodynamic
response of patient tumors or infected tissues to treatment. The long-range goal
of this project is to establish biodynamic imaging as the premier phenotyping
technology for the selection of personalized medical treatment when drug
resistance is the principal barrier to effective
treatment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
