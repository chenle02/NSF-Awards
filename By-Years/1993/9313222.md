9313222 Ulsoy The award is for the design and development of an experimental,
modular, open-architecture machining system controller for prismatic and
rotational parts that enhances part quality by an order of magnitude while
sustaining high machining rates. The approach would enable integration of
underutilized results of the prior work of various researchers as well as
generating new results. The hypothesis of the research is that information
embedded in the control-loop error signals can be effectively used to improve
part quality and machining system performance. A hierarchical controller
structure is proposed consisting of compensators at the machine tool servo,
process, and part inspection levels. Intelligent integration of hardware and
software components of the controller is proposed here by combining expertise in
machine tools, machining processes, sensors, control theory, software
architecture, and real-time computing. The hierarchical, open-architecture
controller is expected to have a major impact on manufacturing practice and
research. Potential benefits for industrial users include reduction of part
manufacturing cycle times, reduction of indirect inspection costs, controller
improvement costs, and the cost of using sensors. Implementation of future
machining research results would also be facilitated by the availability of such
a controller.
