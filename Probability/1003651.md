This project studies several classes of stochastic processes that possess
complicated interactions and in some cases also inhomogeneous or random
environments: interacting particle systems, polymer models, and random motion in
a random medium. The goal is to describe typical large scale behavior and to
quantify deviations from the typical behavior. In polymer models the goal is to
settle long-standing open problems on scaling exponents that describe the order
of magnitude of the fluctuations of the molecule chain and the free energy. For
a class of asymmetric zero range processes this project proposes to prove
scaling properties of space-time correlations and current fluctuations that
confirm KPZ-type behavior. For a single particle moving in a random environment
this project studies large deviations, especially the question of when the rate
functions for quenched and averaged large deviations coincide. For a large
collection of particles moving in a dynamically evolving environment the goal is
to prove distributional limit theorems for the current.

This project investigates mathematical models that describe complex interactions
and motion of particles in an irregular environment. These mathematical systems
incorporate randomness to model irregularity and unpredictability. The goal is
to discover general mathematical principles that govern such systems. A key
point is that these systems appear quite different at microscopic and
macroscopic scales. So it is important to understand how different rules for
small-scale interactions and motions lead to different large-scale systemwide
behavior. Real-world phenomena that such mathematical studies can illuminate
include the motion of vehicles on a freeway, packets making their way through a
communication network, fluid particles in a tube, wetting transitions where
fluid spreads in a porous medium, epidemics advancing among individuals in a
population, or the fluctuations of a polymer chain in a fluid. Over the longer
term understanding these complex interactions has profound implications for
science and engineering and thereby for society. Models of the kind described in
the proposal are intensely and concurrently studied by mathematicians, natural
scientists, social scientists, and engineers.
