This proposal provides a plan for professional development and structured
opportunities in science to 200 middle school teachers in four targeted urban
communities in the San Francisco Bay Area. The teachers will be almost
exclusively from districts whose populations are underserved and multi- ethnic.
Over a period of three years, teachers will receive training in inquiry-based
physical science through summer institutes and special sessions during the
academic year. Training will include an intensive 80-hour summer workshop and
special return sessions, based on successful existing models developed at the
Exploratorium Teacher Institute. The goal of the project is to develop a core
group of teachers in each of the four target communities, who have had
progressively more responsible levels of involvement with hands-on science, and
who, with occasional follow-up attention from the Teacher Institute, will be
capable of carrying on a professional collaboration on their own. Cost sharing
is equivalent to $43% of the NSF award.
