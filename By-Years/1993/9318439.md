The grant requested in this proposal will support the development of a
technology for the fabrication of microelectrode arrays ("probes"). The probes
will be capable of being inserted with minimal tissue trauma into the brain,
where they will record neuronal signals. The arrays will be fabricated using
silicon micromachining methods, and will be tested in anesthetized animals. CMOS
integrated circuits will also be designed, to amplify the signals recorded from
each of the several recording sites on a single probe, and multiplex them onto a
single output line. Interconnect and encapsulation methods will be developed to
combine the probes and electronics into a package suitable for use in animals.
The probes will be designed so that the CMOS electronics can ultimately be
integrated on a common substrate with the probes. The probes will be used to
obtain simultaneous recordings from multiple sites in the mammalian brain. Such
recordings are used to obtain information that is not available through other
means, in order to learn about how the brain works on the single-neuron and
network levels. The instruments to be developed under this grant will greatly
extend our ability to conduct this basic neuroscience research.
