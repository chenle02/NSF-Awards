A comprehensive Finite Element based code will be developed for the simulation
and design of piezoelectric transducers. The code will permit complete, three-
dimensional, time-domain finite element modeling of waves in piezoelectric-
elastic-acoustic media. An existing Weidlinger Associates Finite Element program
provides the basic frame work. During Phase I, piezoelectric and acoustic-
potential finite elements will be added to the base code resulting in a global
two and three-dimensional simulation code to model ultrasound-type transducers.
