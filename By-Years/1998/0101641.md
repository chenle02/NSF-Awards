0101641&lt;br/&gt;Zaworotko &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to use
metal-organic clusters that approximate the shape of simple polygons and which
can be self-assembled using well-known geometric constraints and appropriate
multifunctional ligands, thereby building discrete and infinite structures based
upon faceted polyhedra. The goals are to develop protocols for the rational
design of a new generation of self-assembled discrete and infinite
nanostructures based upon molecular polygons, and to characterize these novel
nanostructures in terms of structure, stability, chemical reactivity, and
porosity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These nanostructured
materials will have broad impact in a numbeer of applications areas that include
sensors, green chemistry and pharmaceuticals. With the University of South
Florida being one of the largest urban universities in the U.S., its exceptional
ethnic diversity will provide broad educational opportuities, especially in
areas of undergraduate education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
