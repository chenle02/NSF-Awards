This award will allow a research group from the University of Virginia to
purchase a 500 MHz Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectrometer for studies of
protein structure and dynamics. Specific examples of research topics to be
pursued include structural studies of glutathione transferases and cardiotoxins,
studies of antibody-antigen interactions, examination of the activation of
phospholipase A2, and structural studies of active-site peptides of Na,K-ATPase.
