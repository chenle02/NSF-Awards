9505677 DAHLEN This research is to study the propagation of fundamental and
higher-mode surface waves in a laterally heterogeneous earth. Previous results
will be extended to focus on higher-frequency surface waves, for which cross-
branch coupling due to variations in crustal thickness and shorter scale-length
variations in the upper mantle such as slabs, become more important. Work will
continue with the development of a spline basis on the surface of a tesselated
sphere to replace the widely-used spherical-harmonic representation of three-
dimensional earth models. Such a local basis has a number of advantages,
including the ability to vary the node spacing depending upon the coverage, and
a dramatic improvement in the speed of surface-wave ray tracing due to the
reduction in the number of evaluations required at each step. This research is a
component of the Cooperative Studies of the Earth's Deep Interior program. ***
