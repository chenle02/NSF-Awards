This award provides support to defray expenses of participants in the week-long
Arizona School of Analysis and Mathematical Physics to be held at the University
of Arizona on March 12-16, 2012. Much of the funding will be directed to young
mathematicians (i.e., postdocs, graduate students, junior faculty) who do not
have their own support.

This year's school will introduce a number of areas of active research at a
level accessible to young mathematicians; the target audience will be
specifically strong graduate students and recent postdocs. The school will be
organized around four mini-courses. Each will be given by an expert in the field
who is known for their pedagogical skills. More precisely, the program will
include the following: 1. Hypothesis testing and non-equilibrium statistical
mechanics by Yoshiko Ogata (University of Tokyo). 2. Derivation of effective
evolution equations from quantum dynamics by Benjamin Schlein (Universitat
Bonn). 3. Random Schrodinger operators by Simone Warzel (Technische Universitat
Munchen). 4. The Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation and its universality class by
Jeremy Quastel (University of Toronto).

The school will afford many junior researchers the opportunity to learn and
interact with established researchers in analysis and mathematical physics. It
will be an event with significant research and training impact.
