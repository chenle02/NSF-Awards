This grant provides support for the EcoCAR Advanced Vehicle Technology
Competition. The NSF will provide support for the ?EcoCAR NSF Outstanding
Faculty Advisor Award?. EcoCAR is a new three-year collegiate advanced vehicle
technology engineering competition jointly sponsored by the NSF, United States
Department of Energy, Natural Resources Canada, the automotive industry (General
Motors and suppliers such as Cisco Systems, Delphi, The MathWorks, National
Instruments, A123 Systems, Freescale Semiconductor, Renewable Fuel Association,
Caterpillar) and is managed by the Argonne National Laboratory. This is a
continuation of the highly successful educational experience for undergraduate
students at US and Canadian universities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This competition
challenges 17 universities across North America to explore solutions to minimize
energy consumption and reduce emissions while designing comfortable, safe, road-
reliable commercially viable vehicles. At the conclusion of each year of EcoCAR,
all seventeen teams will come together for a weeklong competition where they
will compete for the coveted first place trophy. &lt;br/&gt;
