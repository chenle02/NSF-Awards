Stonehill College is providing 36 scholarships to about 18 junior or senior
mathematics majors who commit to teaching at high needs school districts
(including districts in Avon, Brockton, Holbrook, Randolph and Stoughton, MA).
The project addresses the problems of retaining would-be teachers by developing
a community of practice model to prepare and sustain teachers as they
matriculate through their teacher preparation and beyond. The project provides
professional development opportunities including bringing in master teachers for
an on-campus Noyce Speaker Series, school-based enrichment programs where the
scholars interact with K-12 students to develop deep conceptual understanding of
mathematics, paid mathematics internships within local school districts, special
interest housing, and semester-long or summer-long undergraduate research with
mathematics or education faculty. The project also addresses the challenge of
attracting and retaining highly qualified teachers in the difficult-to-recruit
field of mathematics to high need schools while making an effort to attract and
retain a more diverse teacher population. The recruitment of these scholars
involves theme-based events while cultivating current and potential mathematics
majors or students with a declared interest in education to consider joining a
community of practice facilitated by the program's activities. The program's
intentional design of integrating research with educational experiences enables
new mathematics teachers to adopt similar models in their own classrooms,
infusing education with the excitement of discovery and sparking their students'
interest in mathematics.
