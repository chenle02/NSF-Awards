9424639 Murray The objective of this research is to develop, study, and
implement algorithms for solving large-scale, nonlinear optimization problems. A
large-scale optimization problem is characterized by a large number of variables
and constraints. Two solution approaches form the focus of the research. These
approaches are respectively, the interior point (barrier) method and the
sequential quadratic programming (SQP) method. The interest in the interior
point method stems from their success on linear programming problems, and some
interesting properties that may be of value when certain difficult constraints
are encountered. The interior point method can be used to eliminate constraints
on the eigenvalues of a matrix. On the other hand, interest on the use of SQP is
prompted by the success of the approach on small and medium-sized problems, and
the experiences of the investigators on the performance of the technique on two
classes of large, practical problems that differ substantially in character. If
successful with these approaches, the developed algorithms will be coded into a
software to facilitate their applications by practitioners. These are several
engineering, manufacturing, scientific, and business problems that can be
described by large-scale nonlinear optimization models. To date, finding a
general solution algorithm to large scale optimization community. If successful,
the algorithms being investigated in this research could open the window to a
better understanding of this class of optimization problems. Many problems in
various areas of human endeavor stand to benefit from the results of this work.
