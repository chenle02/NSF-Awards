The aim of this project is to provide undergraduates new experiences in
applying state-of-the-art, computer-interfaced instruments to the study of whole
organisms. It permits them to implement mebabolic studies at several levels in
the Biology curriculum through the acquisition and utilization of two Ametek S-
3A/II oxygen analyzers, the upgrade of the Li-Cor CO2 analyzer to the standard
of Li-Cor 6250, and acquisition of appropriate computer and interfacing
equipment. The Ametek oxygen analyzers are being applied to laboratory exercises
on metabolism in freshman Biology and in three upper division courses. Several
of these laboratory exercises examine temperature effects on biological
processes. Both instruments and the computer-interfacing capabilities also
enrich independent study and research participation programs which are viewed as
essential for a strong department. The project is significant because it
enhances quantitative and experimental experiences at the organismic level in
this department, at a time when improvements recently have been made in
instrumentation and methodology for ecological studies and for cellular and
biotechnological studies. Students at several levels of educational development
now have access to quality systems for studies of organismic gas exchange in
highly experimental settings in which instruments are computer controlled and
data are reduced and analyzed on-line. The grantee institution is matching the
NSF award with an equal sum obtained from non-Federal sources.
