The Chemistry of Life Sciences Program funds Professor James Allen of Arizona
State University for research entitled "Bacterial Reaction Centers with New
Photochemical Properties." In all photosynthetic systems, the primary energy
transduction event is the light-induced generation of a charge-separated state
in a pigment-protein complex. Although the specific pathways vary among
organisms, the general pattern is remarkably conserved, and an understanding of
these processes serves as the basis for current designs of artificial systems
that mimic the photosynthetic process. The reaction center from Rhodobacter
sphaeroides can be used as a model system to incorporate features of photosystem
II such as a highly oxidizing primary donor. The recent development of a redox
active mononuclear Mn cofactor provides the opportunity to study novel manganese
cofactors and to introduce new light-driven reactions into this photosystem. The
first objective of the proposed research is to design novel Mn cofactors and
correlate the properties of these cofactors with different experimental
observables. The second objective is to use this model system to probe key
properties of the Mn4Ca cluster of photosystem II that is the site of water
oxidation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overall, the molecular insight gained from
these studies should have a general impact on developing design principles for
metalloenzymes, understanding electron transfer mechanisms in photosynthesis,
and improving energy conversion technologies. Our research promotes progress in
science by providing wider opportunities for participation in undergraduate
research, meeting challenges in undergraduate education by writing textbooks,
creating a curriculum for a new interdisciplinary graduate program, fostering
scientific communication to the general public, and sponsoring outreach efforts
to students who have limited opportunities for scientific research. This project
is receiving co-funding from the Biomolecular Dynamics, Structure and Function
Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences.
