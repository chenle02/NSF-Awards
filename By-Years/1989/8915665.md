Research will develop a formal approach to computer modeling of the semantics of
engineering products. The uses of such a model include: checking for integrity,
sharing of data across engineering applications and organizations, providing a
standard for archiving and support for further automation. The expected results
will be a theory of semantic modeling of engineering products and one or more
kernel data models that will demonstrate the concepts and capabilities. The
approach focuses on the underlying logic of product model information. The
methodological approach is predicate calculus. The semantic model will be
largely declarative. Use of the model will depend upon associated procedural
system architectures. Work on useful system architectures are undertaken, with
one or more examples developed in prototypes.
