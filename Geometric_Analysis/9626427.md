9626427 Harvey This project lies in the interface of differential geometry and
algebraic geometry. The investigator plans to further pursue the theory of
characteristic currents, calibrations and their various applications. Of
particular note is the research on the differentiable version of the Riemann-
Roch theorem. Calibrations on a curved space give infinitesimal versions of
volume-minimizing subspaces. There are certain 'exceptional' calibrations that
are closely related to continuous symmetry groups. The Riemann-Roch theorem is
an important theorem in algebraic geometry, but its applicability is restricted
to the so-called holomorphic category. One of the stated goals of this project
is to extend the Riemann-Roch theorem to a more general setting requiring only
the differentiability assumption.
