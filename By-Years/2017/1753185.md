Numerical algorithms are pervasive in our lives today.  These algorithms are
used, for example, to send data to mobile devices and to simulate fire and water
in movies.  Many of the most classical algorithms, and particularly those with
applications in linear algebra, have been extremely useful for decades, if not
centuries.  Yet, some of these algorithms are poorly understood -- they can fail
catastrophically, but rarely do.  In other words, the worst-case behavior is
poor, but the average-case behavior is good.  This research will advance the
understanding of this phenomenon by employing techniques from the ever-expanding
field of random matrix theory (RMT).  In turn, this research gives rise to new
questions within RMT. A substantial feature of this project is the extensive
educational component that integrates research and education. This integration
is achieved via a three-pronged approach including a summer workshop on random
matrices, high school engagement, and undergraduate/graduate student
mentoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two natural ways to employ RMT within numerical
linear algebra also coincide with the two most common themes in numerical linear
algebra: Algorithm analysis and algorithm development. For example, remarkably
detailed estimates from RMT such as rigidity and edge universality have found
concrete applications within numerical linear algebra giving average-case
performance for the classical power method. Randomized algorithms have found
great utility in the big-data age.  This research will employ both of these
themes with applications to data science, psychology and beyond.  The synergy of
the fields of RMT and numerical linear algebra provides a unique educational
opportunity for graduate, undergraduate and high school
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
