This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project is an analytical
and numerical study of the behavior of solutions to classes of partial
differential equations that arise in optics, fluid dynamics, population
dynamics, molecular dynamics, and thermodynamics. The problem areas under study
include analysis of the validity and limitations of current molecular dynamics
algorithms; blow up for mass-critical and energy-critical nonlinear Schrodinger
equations; investigation of finite-time blow-up in solutions to the three-
dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, with extension to other
hydrodynamics equations, including the quasi-geostrophic equations; and the
continuum limit and well-posedness of aggregation models arising in population
dynamics and swarming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research has important
applications in physics, biology, and engineering. For example, the cubic
nonlinear Schrodinger equation is used to describe Bose-Einstein condensates in
low temperature physics. The three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations and the
surface quasi-geostrophic equations have applications in weather prediction and
modeling the earth's atmospheric circulation. The mathematical analysis of
molecular dynamics algorithms will help to explain many observed phenomena in
computer simulations of real materials, for which experimental methods are often
inaccessible. The analysis of the aggregation equations can give a candid
assessment of models that are used in studying the swarming behavior in
population dynamics and biology. The main objective of this research is to
develop a suitable mathematical framework for these problems.
