This project is a collaborative study between David Fritts at the University of
Colorado and Chiao-Yao She at Colorado State University. The PIs will use the
sodium lidar at Fort Collins and the Rayleigh lidar in place, as well as a
resonance lidar to be developed at ALOMAR. The Fort Collins sodium lidar system
currently has wind and temperature measurement capabilities with vertical and
off-vertical viewing options. Since Fort Collins provides correlative data for
middle atmosphere studies, efforts there will focus on dynamics studies using
new and existing wind and temperature data. ALOMAR (the Arctic Lidar Observatory
for Middle Atmosphere Research), a major optical and radar observatory in
Norway, will provide comprehensive and nearly continuous measurements of
atmospheric dynamics, structure and composition. Development of a resonance
lidar capability at ALOMAR will extend continuous measurements (in altitude) of
atmospheric temperature, constituents, winds and heat and momentum fluxes,
permitting quantitative and correlative studies of mesospheric and lower
thermospheric structure, dynamics, and variability not possible at any other
site.***
