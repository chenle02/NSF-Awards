9550649 Natvig The proposed research would involve undergraduate researchers in
a collaborative effort to obtain fundamental information about genome structure
in the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa. The research aim of the Neurospora
Genome Project is to sequence and map genes that encode expressed proteins. The
mission of the project is to increase the number of students receiving
laboratory experience in molecular genetics. Project goals include: (1) obtain
partial sequences of random cDNA clones and compare sequences with known genes;
(2) Identify cosmid clones corresponding to cDNA clones and (3) map cosmids to
the appropriate chromosomes using RFLP analysis. Five undergraduate and two
graduate students will participate in the proposed work. ***
