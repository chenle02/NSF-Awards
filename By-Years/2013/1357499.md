This award funds research that will develop new statistical methods for
analyzing data about human behavior in network contexts. A group of people can
be described as a social network by explicit description of the links between
individuals. For example, your social network includes your family, your
neighbors, co-workers, etc, as well as more indirect links such as your link
through your children to their friends and teachers, etc. People of course make
decisions about their social networks; you may make new friends or spend less
time with a neighbor. Recent work in economics has focused on modeling those
decisions about network relationships as strategic; each individual in the
network forms, maintains, or severs relationships to meet his/her own goals. The
PI will develop new methods for testing hypotheses about the effects of networks
using statistical methods. He also plans to develop new methods that can be used
to analyze data from joint production situations, where multiple people work
together to achieve a goal. The results will advance the growing field of
network science and will promote the national prosperity because businesses are
increasing viewing customer relationships through the lens of network effects.

The PI will formulate an empirical model of dynamic network formation that will
(i) have a random utility maximization foundation (ii) leave the distribution of
unobserved agent heterogeneity flexible, and (iii) leave the process generating
the initial network structure unspecified. The project on joint production goes
beyond previous work on the econometric methods for the analysis of matchings in
situations where the observed matching satisfies strong, random-assignment type
assumptions. The new research funded here will develop methods for recovering
match output under settings where random assignment does not hold. The project
will contribute to our understanding of efficient estimation of semi-parametric
models. Software and data produced will be made freely available online.
