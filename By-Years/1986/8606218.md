A 3-day workshop will be held in June l986 at the University of Michigan, the
workshop will bring together 35 university researchers and structural engineers
to develop the strategy for the approach to human errors in structural design
and construction. The workshop has three objectives: (l) to update the status of
research on human errors to identify the most effective approach for the near
future; (2) to identify, in particular, the promise and difficulties of the
scenario approach; and (3) to determine the degree of background preparation
necessary for effective improvement of structural reliability in the long range,
i.e., optimal control of the process of structural production.
