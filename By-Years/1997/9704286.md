9704286 Hass This project deals with the geometry of surfaces in three
dimensional Riemannian manifolds. The focus is on isoperimetric problems and the
theory of piecewise-linear minimal surfaces. A basic isoperimetric problem asks
for the smallest area surface enclosing a given pair of volumes. The Double
Bubble Conjecture asserts that the shape assumed by a compound soap bubble
enclosing two regions answers this question. This conjecture was recently solved
by the investigator, in collaboration with R. Schlafly, for two equal volumes,
but the general case remains an open problem. The piecewise-linear theory of
surfaces considers surfaces which are glued together from flat pieces, much like
the surfaces constructed in computer graphics. The problems considered in this
project relate to processes in nature which determine the shape of soap bubbles,
the erosion of boulders, the melting of ice, crystal growth, flame propagation,
image enhancement and the evaporation of puddles. The piecewise-linear theory of
surfaces can be applied to the classification, enumeration and algorithmic
recognition of various surfaces .
