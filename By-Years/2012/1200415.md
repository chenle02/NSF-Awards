The research objective of this grant is to gain a detailed fundamental
understanding of the complex interplay between the thermodynamics and kinetics
governing early-stage surface-oxidation processes in single- and multi-oxidant
environments. The study will use advanced high-resolution techniques to allow in
situ interrogation of reaction-product interfaces for elucidating structural,
chemical, and defect developments. Specifically, Ni, Ni-Cr, and, later, Ni-Cr-Al
alloys in 700-1100¢ªC environments containing O2, H2O, CO2, or some combination
of these as primary oxidants will be systematically examined. While the central
focus is to establish science-based approaches for developing and/or improving
advanced high-temperature alloys and coatings used in the many harsh
environments found in practice, the scientific understanding gained will also
contribute to elucidating the collective and coupled behaviors of surface
reactions in general.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this interdisciplinary
collaborative effort will lead to new paradigms in the important field of gas-
solid surface reactions, such as corrosion, catalysis, sensors, fuel cells, and
synthesis for a variety of electronic, magnetic, medical, and optical devices.
The study will contribute to national economic competitiveness (novel materials
and technologies created), development of a competitive STEM workforce (training
and mentorship of graduate students and post-docs, interdisciplinary courses),
the participation of women and underrepresented minorities; high school
community outreach (Pennsylvania Junior Academy of Science), and national
security (sustainable energy, energy generation, enhanced aircraft design).
Materials-related classes at all levels will be developed or modified in
multiple departments driven by the need to introduce students to the latest
developments in materials-centered research and technology. Examples of classes
include Gas-Metal Reactions, Crystallography, Nanocharacterization, Transmission
Electron Microscopy, and Introduction to Materials Science.
