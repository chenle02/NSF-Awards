This symposium, to be held on the campus of the University of California,
Berkeley, addresses the idea of prematurity in scientific discovery from the
perspective gained by twenty-five years of research on science. The conference
will offer a forum for the presentation, discussion, and critique of the concept
of `prematurity` that will assess the state of knowledge about the proposition
and will stimulate new research. Speakers will be drawn from Africa, Europe and
North America to talk about prematurity in such diverse areas of science as
Darwinian and Mendelian theories, evolutionary biology, genetic exchange in
bacteria, and the work of specific researchers such as McClintock and Fleck.
