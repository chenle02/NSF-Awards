A workshop is to be held to identify research needs and opportunities in
computer networking for manufacturing systems. To be held at the Pennsylvania
State University on November 4-6, 1987, the workshop will bring together
investigators with a variety of views on networking, from industry, university,
and other research institutions. The goal of the workshop is to assess the
research needs in computer networking for manufacturing systems. Topics to be
explored include 1) Computer networking protocols: selection, specification and
analysis; 2) Languages, interoperability, and impact of standardization; 3) Role
of MAP, TOP, and other protocols; 4) Lightwave, radio frequency, and other non-
traditional media; 5) Real-time communications and fault-tolerance; 6) Adaptive
techniques in networking.
