The study of operating system mechanisms and policies for the management of
various levels of shared storage in tightly-coupled MIMD machines is at an early
stage. This is even more true for the case of large-scale machines with hundreds
of processors. This project will continue a multiyear investigation of these
issues in the large-scale case with a focus on the Butterfly multiprocessor.
Specific projects divide into the following classes: workload characterization,
shared data migration across parallel main memories, management of virtual
memory in a setting of multiple secondary memories each associated with a main
memory, and file system design.
