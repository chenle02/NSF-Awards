A scanning electron microscope will be acquired to resolve external
microstructure of dinoflagellates, parasites, mollusks, lobsters, and animal
parts. The instrument will be used principally in descriptive studies to resolve
conservative morphological features and delineate variation within and among
species for the purposes of taxonomic identification, classification, parasite
host specificity and interactions, distribution patterns and ecological
relationships, aging of larval fishes, and characterization of sensory
structures.
