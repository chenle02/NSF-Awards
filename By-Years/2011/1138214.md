This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) in Engineering program
entitled, "NUE: Nano Science And Laboratory Experience (ScALE) at UMaine", at
the University of Maine, under the direction of Dr. Rosemary L. Smith, aims to
introduce the basic concepts, applications, and implications of nanoscale
science and engineering to all first-year engineering students at the University
of Maine (UMaine). The proposed approach is to add nanoscience and nanoscale
engineering content to the required 'introduction to' engineering courses
offered by each engineering department. This content will be designed, developed
and delivered as a 'drop-in' module, in collaboration with the instructors for
each department's course. This project further aims to enhance undergraduate
education and training in nanoscale science and engineering by establishing a
college-wide minor in Nanotechnology, developing an upper level course in
nanoscience, and to broaden participation of 1st and 2nd year students from
underrepresented groups in nanoscale research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader
impacts of this project include improved student recruitment, retention, and
future workforce preparation achieved through the intentional integration of
research and education at the undergraduate level, professional development of
Maine's middle-school science teachers, the facilitation of new research and
education collaborations among UMaine faculty with interests in nanoscale
science and engineering, and the sharing of state-of-the-art instructional tools
such as laboratory facilities and materials. Outreach activities will focus on
increasing the interest of female students in engineering careers by developing
mini-projects for high school students targeting nanotechnology applications to
biomedicine and energy.
