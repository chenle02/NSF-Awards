TECHNICAL AND NON TECHNICAL ABSTRACT The "Controlled/Living Polymerization"
symposium offers a comprehensive coverage of recent developments in the very
active field of polymerization methods resulting in macromolecules with
precisely controlled dimensions, topologies, and functionalities, and the
consequent structure/property characteristics and the diverse applicationsof
these materials. The symposium offers a comprehensive opportunity for the
exchange and cross-fertilization of ideas among both academic and industrial
experts in the field. The symposium also offers an opportunity for participating
young researchers, including the planned participation of underrepresented
minorities, to gain from such career orienting exposure , as well as to present
their work.
