The chemistry discipline has introduced NMR experiments into its undergraduate
curriculum. Although NMR theory is treated in several courses, York students
have had little opportunity for first-hand experimental experience. A Varian
EM-360L spectrometer with spin decoupler and variable temperature accessories is
incorporated into the laboratory program. Students have the opportunity to
conduct challenging experiments illustrating several important NMR methods. The
instrument is utilized for unknown identification, determination of
enantioimeric composition, spin decoupling and NOE, and the determination of
bond rotational frequencies and energy barriers. In addition the students make
extensive use of the instrument in independent research. The institution is
matching the NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.
