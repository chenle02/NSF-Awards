This study will continue geochronological and petrological analyses of
deformational and metamorphic fabrics in the southern New England Appalachians.
A recently developed microtextural/ geochronologic technique will be used to
evaluate ages of deformational fabrics and will permit direct dating of shear
zones. A related study in the Scandinavian Caledonides will be integrated with
the New England study to evaluate and constrain tectonic models of the
Appalachian-Caledonidian orogen. The results will be relevant to a broad range
of tectonic problems in orogenic belts and will also further refine the
techniques of direct dating of deformation.
