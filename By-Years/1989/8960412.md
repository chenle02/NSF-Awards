This award provides funds to develop a new method of separation based on
transient diffusion coupled with cyclic convection which would reduce the cost
of producing biochemicals, especially proteins. Species with diffusivities that
differ less than 10% can be sharply separated in less than an hour. The new
process is potentially attractive for separating delicate chemicals or
biochemicals because molecules are processed in their natural solvent
environment and are only subjected to gentle shear. There are no temperature,
pH, ionic strength or other intensive variable changes except modest pressure
variations which drive the flows. The new method can be batch, continuous,
binary, or multi- component and promises high resolution, flexibility, and
concentrated products. The process features laboratory or production
applicability, minimal development effort for new applications, and minimal
operational labor requirements. A binary, batch separation apparatus will be
constructed and operated to demonstrate the feasibility of the concept and to
obtain quantitative data for separation of pairs and proteins. Through
mathematical modeling, the results will be extended to predict separation
performance of other process variations.
