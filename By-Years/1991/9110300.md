This is a Career Advancement Award to support Dr. Racowsky's preliminary
studies to investigate specific relationships in the mammalian ovarian follicle
among steroidogenic output of granulosa cells, modulation of this output by
growth factors, and the stimulation of meiotic resumption in oocytes. She
hypothesizes that growth factors paly a central role in the stimulation of
meiotic resumption throught their modulation of gonadotropin- regulation of
cumulus cell steroidogenesis. It is anticipated that the proposed research
activities will lay the groundwork for important contributions to the field of
mammalian oocyte maturation, which will significantly enhance Dr. Racowsky's
career.
