The principal investigator will develop thermodynamically constrained numerical
expressions, utilizing computer techniques and experimental data, to develop an
open system model which simulates a wide variety of processes for mafic magmas
at pressures up to 20 kbar. Expressions will be calibrated for both major and
trace element geochemistry, and will enable simulation of mantle melting
processes, high-pressure fractionation, magma mixing and assimilation.
