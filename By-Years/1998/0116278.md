0116278 Zehr This Major Research Instrumentation award to University of
California Santa Cruz will provide support for acquisition of a genetic analyzer
for DNA sequencing, liquid handling robotics, computer workstations and software
for DNA analysis, and technical support for the Molecular Ecology and
Evolutionary Genetics facility. It is expected that the new instrumentation and
the interdepartmental research and training facility will foster
interdisciplinary approaches to a broad range of problems in marine and
terrestrial ecology and evolutionary biology. UCSC will contribute cost-sharing
of more than 30% of the cost of this project from non-federal funds. ***
