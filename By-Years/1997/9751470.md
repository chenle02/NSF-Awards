This project is equipping a basic paleomagnetics laboratory within the
Department of Geology. The new laboratory is addressing the increasing needs of
undergraduate students for exposure to analytical methods, scientific
experimentation, and the interpretation of quantitative data. Inclusive of the
paleomagnetic equipment into the first-year course, Processes and Concepts of
Geology, is introducing a general student audience to laboratory procedure and
data analysis. This laboratory is stressing the contribution of paleomagnetic
results to the development of plate tectonic theory and enabling students to see
the relationship between experimentation, hypothesis formation, and testing.
Paleomagnetic laboratory modules are also being designed for the structural
geology course and for two new courses in geophysics and geoarcheology.
Together, these courses are affecting a wide selection of both majors and non-
science-majors. The new laboratory is also being used to support student
research as part of their independent study research, which is a requirement for
all student. Students and faculty at neighboring institutions are being invited
to use the paleomagnetics laboratory. *
