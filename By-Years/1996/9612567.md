Proposal #: ECS-9612567 PI Name/Institution: Gregory Washington/ Ohio State
University The referenced African American PI in his first year as faculty at
Ohio State University has requested Research Planning Grant funds to initiate a
program to develop a novel class of adaptive aperture antennas based on
piezoelectric film distributed actuators. Piezoelectric films are one example of
"smart materials". This work if successful will truly revolutionize imaging
techniques in aperture antennas, with possible ramifications for medical
imaging. This is an excellent and carefully detailed proposal which focuses on a
proof of concept theoretical and experimental design involving three steps: (1)
Modeling to correlate the surface shape with the radiation pattern. This will
provide strong support for concept viability in future proposals. The proposed
modeling is an extension of original work which the PI has already published.
(2) Active antenna fabrication: The central problem involves bonding of the
piezoelectric film to an acceptable substrate and this will be the focus of this
section. Methods which are scaleable to industry are emphasized. (3) Antenna
surface deflection testing. This will provide strong experimental verification
of concept viability. Successful completion of the above three steps will
provide a very strong foundation for a future proposal. A good knowledge and
selection of crucial topics is evidenced by the PI. Resources provided by Ohio
State University are also excellent. I strongly recommend funding at the
proposed amount of $17,970.00.
