This project aims at transformational approaches for the design and analysis of
efficient and reliable network coding schemes for wireless networks. The network
coding technique has a significant potential for improving the throughput,
reliability, and security of wireless networks by taking advantage of the
broadcast nature of wireless medium. The research focuses on a broad range of
network coding problems that arise in the context of single and multi- hop
wireless networks and develops a new integrative methodology for analyzing
fundamental performance characteristics of wireless network coding schemes. The
goals of this research include design and analysis of efficient algorithms as
well as development of novel routing and scheduling protocols and physical-layer
network coding schemes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project includes two major
thrusts. The first thrust focuses on single-hop connections and considers a
broad range of scenarios in which a several wireless nodes are collaborating to
exchange information and perform a joint computational task. The second thrust
focuses on multi-hop wireless networks and provides methodology for increasing
the number of coding opportunities through efficient routing, scheduling, and
congestion-control protocols. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will
significantly advance the state of the art by developing analytical tools,
algorithms, and design methodology for wireless network coding systems. The
methodology developed for this project will lead to improved performance of
wireless systems and contribute to their overall maturity. The research outcomes
of this project will be broadly disseminated to academic and industrial
communities.
