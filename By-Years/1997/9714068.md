This proposal addresses issues pertaining to low-frequency MHD wave generation
and propagation in the magnetosheath-magnetopause region. This is a theoretical
investigation focused on the conditions in the magnetosheath region during
periods of quasi-perpendicular bow shocks. Four interrelated topics will be
considered: (a) MHD wave activity in the magnetosheath; (b) field-line resonance
and mode conversion (to kinetic Alfven waves (KAWs) at the magnetopause; (c)
comparison of theoretically predicted wave properties and spectra with
observations in the magnetosheath and mangetopause; (d) time-dependent patchy
reconnection and transport driven by KAWs. Analytical work, supported by
numerics where needed, rather than full numerical simulations, is envisaged,
using a kinetic MHD model developed by the PI. In this model, the plasma is
treated in terms of a cold core component and a hot component that is described
kinetically.
