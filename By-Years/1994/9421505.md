9421505 Alfonso Communication between cells of the nervous system (called
neurons) is done via chemicals called neurotransmitters. This chemical
communication (synaptic transmission) involves packaging of the neurotransmitter
into vesicles that are released when the neuron is activated. The goal of this
project is to understand the molecular and genetic bases of release of these
vesicles. Synaptic transmission is being studied in the soil nematode
Caenorhabditis elegans, where the investigator has identified new proteins
involved in the neurotransmitter vesicular release through the isolation of
mutations in the genes that encode these proteins. Animals with mutations in
these gene have defects in synaptic transmission mediated by the chemical
neurotransmitters acetylcholine and gamma-aminobutyric acid. These studies will
give important insights into the regulation of vesicular release from neurons
and also vesicle-mediated exocytosis in other cell types.
