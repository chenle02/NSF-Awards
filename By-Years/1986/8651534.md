The practical and intellectual contributions of genetic technology (g.t.) range
from genetic screening to improved understanding of the immune response. The
ethical and regulatory implications have raised considerable debate, and there
is strong consensus among scientists, educators, industry representatives,
specialists in bioethics, and policymakers that public education is necessary
for effective participation in debates that will confront U.S. citizens about
the use of g.t. Unfortunately, sound information about the subject has made its
way into the high school biology classroom only haphazardly. There is little
attention to the basic biological mechanisms involved or to improved
understanding of biological concepts that result from research in g.t., nor is
there much reasoned analysis of the ethical and legal implications. BSCS, will
design, develop, field test, and prepare for commercial distribution a four-week
module in g.t. for use in the general high school biology curriculum. The module
will be planned and written by experts in medical and agricultural genetics,
bioethics, and high school biology teaching. The module will be field tested
across the U.S. with a minimum of 600 students.
