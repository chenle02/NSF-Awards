This grant supports the activities of the National Academy of Sciences/National
Research Council (NAS/NRC) Board on Atmospheric Sciences and Climate during the
period August 1, 1988 through July 31, 1989. The board, operating through its
standing and ad hoc committees and panels, will: 1. Continue to provide
scientific leadership and guidance to the federal government on important
national and international issues in the atmospheric sciences and climate, and
on the coordination between discipline-orinted activities within the atmospheric
sciences and interdisciplinary programs such as the International Geosphere-
Biosphere Program. 2. Continue the activities of th eClimate Research Committee
(CRC) and the Tropical Ocean-Global Atmosphere (TOGA) and International
Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) Advisory Panels in providing
guidance to the Federal agencies on U.S. participation in the World Climate
Research Program (WCRP) and on related national climate research activities. 3.
Continue the activities of the Committee on Solar-Terrestrial Research,
including participationin the activitis of the International Special Committee
on Solar-Terrestrial Physics (SCOSTEP) and completionof a report on long-term
solar- terrestrial observations. 4. Organize a new standing Committee on
Meteorological Analysis, Prediction, and Research in order to provide a focus
for scientific oversight and assessment of basic and applied research in
meteorology, weather prediction, atmospheric physics, cloud physics, weather
modification, turbulence/diffusion, and allied core areas of the atmospheric
sciences. 5. Continue the activities of the Committee on Atmospheric Chemistry.
The Committee will focus its efforts on the fundamental scientific questions
raised by contemporary atmospheric changes, e.g., increases in greenhouse gases,
stratospheric ozone depletion, and acid deposition. 6. Through its standing
committees and ad hoc panels as required, maintain a capability to respond
rapidly and effectively to requests by the Federal agencies and the Congress for
evaluations, guidance, recommendations, and support in the areas of atmospherid
science and climate. 7. Serve as a focal point for coordination and provision of
scientific expertise for other National Research Council units whose activities
impinge on atmospheric sciences and climate, and for liaison with international
meteorological and atmospheric sciences activities. These activities are
important for the planning, oversight, and assessment of atmospheric sciences in
the United States.
