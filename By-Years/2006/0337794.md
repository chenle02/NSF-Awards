This project is developing a new application of a method for numerical modeling
of viscous fluids based on discrete particles. The application is based on a
method of smoothed particle hydrodynamics in which the continuum equations
representing the fluid dynamics are solved locally in terms of virtual
particles. A large number of these particles are used to represent a fluid
within some domain of interest. As a numerical method, smoothed particle
hydrodynamics provides several important advantages including the ability to
track material properties with the flow, computational efficiency on
multiprocessor computers and easy integration with particle models for brittle
deformation. The model is being applied to several problems of interest in
deformation of the Earth's crust where viscous flow of the deep, hot crust
interacts with a shallow, colder, more brittle upper crust.
