9414715 Bras The focus of this research is to enhance environmentally safe
disposal/recycling by facilitating the inclusion of product take- back
considerations in product design. Demanufacturing and remanufacturing are the
names of processes intended to enable both material recycling and product reuse.
Demanufacturing characterizes the entire process involved in recycling, reuse,
incineration, and/or disposal of a product after it has been taken back by a
company. Remanufacturing deals with the refurbishment of partly worn products
for their subsequent reuse. Due to the complexity of formulating systematic
design approaches that include environmental, economic, and technical
considerations, the objectives of the research are to establish an engineering
science base for: (1) the operational parameters and models of plastic-metal
product de- and remanufacturing processes, and (2) computer-based tools for the
computer-aided design of these products which can be recycled and reused through
de- and remanufacturing processes.
