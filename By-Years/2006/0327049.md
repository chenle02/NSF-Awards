In Drosophila, males transfer a large number of accessory gland proteins (Acps)
to females along with sperm. These proteins have several effects on female
physiology. They also affect patterns of sperm use (female flies store sperm in
specialized organs). Furthermore, these proteins may affect the outcome of sperm
competition, which occurs when a female mates with multiple males. Acps show
highly unusual patterns of evolution and variation, perhaps as a result of
natural selection. The proposed work uses DNA sequence analysis and quantitative
measures of transcription at Acps to measure variation in amino acid sequence
and gene expression within Drosophila melanogaster and between D. melanogaster
and three closely related species. The goal of the work is to reveal the
evolutionary mechanisms leading to the unusually high rates of evolution in
these genes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Males and females interact in each generation
to reproduce. Understanding the cooperation and conflicts that arise as result
of these interactions is an important area of biology. Acps are likely to be
important proteins mediating the mechanistic and evolutionary aspects of male-
female interactions. Therefore, revealing the evolutionary mechanisms underlying
variation in these genes may provide general insights into such interactions in
animals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
