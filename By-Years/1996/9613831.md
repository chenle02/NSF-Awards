This project investigates the ionospheric perturbations impacting radio
communication systems, and the failures of electrical power companies. Both
practical concerns and their associated strategic and economic impacts are
linked by the subtleties of the interplanetary magnetic filed (IMF). Studies
show both of these have a severity that follows a semi-annual pattern, one with
maxima during months spanning the equinoxes. This is a well known effect in
geomagnetic activity linked to IMF interactions with the terrestrial
magnetosphere. This project will extend the concept of such "geo-effectiveness"
to the specification of ionospheric variability, as ordered and predicted by IMF
geometry. The goal is to probe the fundamental nature of IMF linkages to the
inner terrestrial environment in order to understand how such major impacts as
power failures can occur.
