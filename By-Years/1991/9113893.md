This project is part of an integrated scientific investigation to study the
properties of the Arctic ocean, atmosphere, sea-ice and biology in the Northeast
Water (NEW) Polynya, which occurs near northeastern Greenland, in order to gain
an integrated understanding of Arctic shelf-slope processes. This element of the
NEW program will evaluate the magnitude and temporal variability of biologically
produced large particulate organic material, its flux to the benthos, and its
fate using a variety of complimentary experimental techniques.
