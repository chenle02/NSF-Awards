Science Summary: This proposal requests support for a study to test a new
hypothesis on the origin of intermittent transient glaciations of the early and
middle Miocene (the Mi-events) and possibly the late Oligocene. New findings
suggest that the largest of the glaciations (Mi-1) at the Oligocene/Miocene
boundary coincided with a rare congruence of an extended low-amplitude orbital
obliquity node with a period of low orbital eccentricity. The study focus on
developing isotope records that will test the prediction that similar climate
anomalies occur at 18.2 and 27 Ma when orbital calculations indicate extended
low-amplitude obliquity nodes also correspond with intervals of low
eccentricity.
