This research will employ a faculty/student team to develop an epistemological
study using non-occupational, psychosocial, and personal risk factors to predict
occupationally related low back pain. The study will validate the usability and
predictive power of the "Back Index" model to predict a manual materials
handling job's risk for producing low back pain. This work will be an extension
of the work done by the PI at the Texas A&M Ergonomics Industry/University
Cooperative Research Center which will collaborate in this study. Research
results will be incorporated into undergraduate teaching.

Low back and trunk injury was responsible for 30% of the 2.8 million industrial
injuries in 1998. In 1996 the total cost of industrial injuries was $122.6
billion.
