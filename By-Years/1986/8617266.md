Many structures in earthquake prone areas are constructed using reinforced
concrete. In seismically resistant design, proper behavior of the reinforced
concrete structural elements depends a great deal on the ductility of the
structure. Confinement of concrete in critical locations plays a significant
part in achieving ductile behavior of structures. In this research, basic
mechanisms of confinement by rectilinear ties will be investigated using
analytical models and experiments with laboratory specimens. A rational method
will be developed to determine the required amount and configuration of
confining steel which will result in economical and safe design of structures.
Results from this research are expected to provide the basis for modifications
and recommendation in the confinement provisions of various U.S. design codes
such as American Concrete Institute ACI 318 and SEAOC. The Principal
Investigator is highly qualified to conduct the research and the institution
provides excellent support facilities. An award is recommended for the first
year of this two-year complete project.
