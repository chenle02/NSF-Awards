The understanding of basic ligand-metal interactions translates to the
development of new catalysts to promote important and challenging chemical
transformations using relatively simple precursors. Although the 1,2,3-triazole
ring system was introduced to the chemical community via "click-chemistry," with
numerous applications applied to chemical, biological and materials research,
most of the reported efforts focused on the application of this efficient
linking strategy to bring functional groups in close proximity. In contrast,
little is known about the fundamental reactivity of TAs upon interaction with
catalytic metals. This grant will develop an extensive set of catalysts based
upon such interaction. This project is also integrated into an outreach program
to introduce undergraduate students from the state of West Virginia to advanced
organic synthesis and catalysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through this award, funded
by the Chemical Synthesis Program (SYN) of the Division of Chemistry, Prof. X.
Shi from the West Virginia University investigates the coordination ability of
1,2,3-triazoles (TAs) toward transition metal cations. With the ability to
prepare various TA-derivatives, Prof. Shi's lab has studied TA-coordination with
various transition metal cations over the last five years, with novel TA
complexes obtained with excellent stability and striking reactivity. These
discoveries have challenged the assumption that TAs are poor ligands. In this
project, new TA-complexes are being synthesized and investigated, both for
fundamental reasons and for industrial applications (new catalyst design). These
systems include triazole-Au-catalyzed alkyne activation and triazole-directed
C-H activation. &lt;br/&gt;
