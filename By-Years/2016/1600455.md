This project from Sinclair Community College has a focus on providing community
college students, including under represented populations, an opportunity to
master STEM competencies and industry standards in demand by employers, and to
increase graduate employability in a variety of "built environment" jobs. With
architecture technician occupations changing rapidly due to the growing
complexity of today's construction industry, this project will transform
associate degree programs by embedding critical STEM and industry standards from
the Construction Document Technologist (CDT) certificate into two-year education
programs. The CDT credential was chosen because it is recognized by employers as
a respected entry-level credential and addresses significant gaps in
undergraduate education.

With a strong involvement from industry, workforce development will be enabled
by involving forty college faculty nationwide to develop and disseminate new
curricular modules for undergraduate students enrolled in architectural
technician and construction management associate degree programs. The project
will enable professional development of community college faculty and staff. Not
only will over nineteen hundred community college students be impacted by this
project, but project outcomes will also be disseminated to other institutions
with educational programs in the built environment. The targeted focus on
diversifying their student populations is a strength of the project, as is the
direct value to students and graduate job-seekers who will be better able to
certify their knowledge and skills to employers. The long-term outcome will be a
more diversified workforce that better meets the needs of built environment
professions.
