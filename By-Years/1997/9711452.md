9711452 Seim This project will carry out a modeling study of the benthic front
in an upwelling regime. Using numerical modeling and the analysis of existing
observations from Florida Strait, the study will examine how mixing
parametrization, variable forcing and stratification, advection of momentum and
three- dimensional topography influence the development and evolution of a
benthic front, and its interaction with the ocean interior. This study expands
existing one-dimensional theories of arrested boundary layers to areas of
changing slope and closed cross-sections.
