With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at Augustana College will acquire a 400 MHz NMR
Spectrometer. This equipment will enable researchers to carry out research on a)
yeast fatty acid metabolism and the role of mitochondrial transporters; b) novel
chiral spiro-liquid crystals; and c) solvent effects of reactions with
nanocrystalline (NC) MgO and aluminum oxide. The instrument will be integrated
into core lab courses and faculty at area colleges will also have access.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most
powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of
molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific
arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of
interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR
spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research.
The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in biochemistry,
materials chemistry and nanotechnology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
