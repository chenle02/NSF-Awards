Measurement of deep inelastic electron scattering from polarized nucleon
targets will be carried out at the Stanford Linear Accelerator (SLAC). These
data will provide detailed information on the quark spin structure of the
nucleon and test our understanding of the nucleon, as well as our understanding
of the fundamental theory of strong interactions, Quantum Chromodynamics. Also
proposed are future experiments on the electroproduction of charmed mesons to
study the gluon spin structure function. The proposed experiments are of very
high scientific interest, and the American University group plays an essential
role in the experimental effort. The experiments also provide a training ground
at the forefront of basic research for graduate and undergraduate students.
