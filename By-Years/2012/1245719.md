This project upgrades the computer network infrastructure for science at Wayne
State University. It has two major components. The first builds a dedicated high
speed connection from the main generators of science network traffic, physicists
who collaborate on international projects in particle, nuclear, and
astrophysics, computer scientists working on high speed networking, and
biomedical researchers sequencing genes, to the campus computing center where
existing high speed links to national science networks terminate. Second the
local network infrastructure in the Wayne State Physics Building is upgraded to
modern standards as already in place in Computer Science and the Wayne State
School of Medicine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The project eases current and enables
future national and international scientific collaboration that increasingly
require sharing of large amounts of data and secure network communication. For
example, Wayne State plans to build a LHC Tier-3 farm to process and analyze LHC
data at Wayne State, connect Wayne State Computer Science to the National GENI
network using Openflow, and complete a joint venture between the Wayne State
Applied Genomics Technology Center and a European firm to do gene sequencing of
commercial interest in return for research use of the generated data. A
dedicated Wayne State Science Network will also enable more effective use on
campus of modern desktop based videoconferencing and data sharing tools.
