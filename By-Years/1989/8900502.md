The PI will establish a summer program to involve undergraduate students in the
research activities of the radio astronomy group at Cornell University.
Undergraduate students will work directly with members of the Cornell Faculty
and research staff on projects covering a range of disciplines in radio and
radar astronomy. In addition to conducting individual research projects, the
students will also participate in group activities such as seminars. Attempts
will be made to encourage participation by students at small undergraduate
institutions, by women and by minority students.
