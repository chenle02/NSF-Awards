The Department of Chemistry is developing a series of experiments for first year
students based upon the spiral approach to learning. The spectroscopic methods
include both colorimetry and infrared spectroscopy. Initially the students
construct a simple LED based colorimeter, experiment with the color of the LED,
etc., and use it in the determination of the concentration of a copper (II) salt
in an unknown. In parallel fashion, a simple infrared spectrometer (IR LED) is
being used to determine the percentage of ethanol in an unknown. In the second
tier, the colorimeter is used to determine the composition of cupric
carboxylates and their Ksp. In the third tier, the equilibrium constant for the
hydrogen-bonding of alcohols with bases is determined via the use of a
commercial infrared spectrophotometer . Finally, the students interface the
colorimeter to a computer and then determine the rate of bromination of acetone.
