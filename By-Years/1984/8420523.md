Research is conducted on novel digital image processing systems incorporating
crossbar processing architectures and optical interconnection techniques to
implement the crossbar and other busing schemes. The research addresses the
problems of speed and throughput limitations of current digital image processing
and vision systems which arise due to contention on the high speed system data
buses. A new parallel digital image processing system incorporating a
generalized crossbar switch as a parallel interconnection unit will be examined.
The feasibility of implementing the crossbar switch and internal interconnection
bus optically using very high speed fiber optic data lines will be explored.
Such a switch would supply contention-free communications at very high speed and
potentially low cost among various component parts of the system. This novel
image processing system will be useful in real time, online, and high throughput
applications of image processing, e.g., in industrial automation using vision
systems, real-time processing of medical images, remote sensing, and office
automation. The optical crossbar interconnection system has additional
applications in local area networks.
