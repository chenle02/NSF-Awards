This project enhances undergraduate chemical education at all levels by
integration of a GC/MS into the curriculum. The GC/MS provides user-friendly
interfaces, and the presence of network connections in classrooms and
laboratories allow for remote access. Students in an introductory course for
nonscience majors are being introduced to the instrument through analysis of
familiar substances such as spices, coffee and perfumes; within this context,
concepts relevant to chemical literacy are introduced. This course is a required
one for students interested in elementary education, and the approach of giving
such students access to major instrumentation, if successful, will be adapted to
a variety of educational programs concerned with teacher education. In the
courses for majors, the instrument provides increased capabilities for analysis
of organics in air, water and soil samples in environmental chemistry, and is an
important addition to the laboratory program in organic chemistry and
instrumental analysis. The instrument also is providing an important tool for
pursuing the departmental goal of increasing undergraduate research. *
