I plan on working on the following specific problems. First I would like to
prove new Strichartz estimates without using explicit parametrices. This could
potentially greatly widen the scope of their applications. I would also like to
prove almost global existence for quasilinear wave equations and investigate
whether there is global existence for nonlinear wave equations outside of
nontrapping obstacles. I would like to use the techniques developed on these
projects to study problems in relativity theory, including the stability of the
Schwarzschild solution. Finally, I would like to continue my work on problems in
harmonic analysis that arise in geometrical situations.

The above problems arise naturally from interactions between mathematics and
areas in physics that include general relativity, quantum mechanics, and quantum
chaos. The techniques employed include stationary phase and the study of
propagation of singularities. There is a very active group of researchers in
quantum physics groups at major universities studying high-energy eigenstates,
and I am especially interested in making further contributions to this area.
