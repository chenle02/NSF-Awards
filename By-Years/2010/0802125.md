Abstract&lt;br/&gt;ECCS-0802125&lt;br/&gt;D. Jena, University of Notre
Dame&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective: The objective of this research is to
invstigate whether thin strips of graphene of varying widths can be used to
mimic semiconductor heterostructures which form the backbone of many high-
performance electronic devices. The approach is to pattern graphene into
nanoscale ribbons of varying widths and to investigate the charge tranport and
switching properties of such lateral bandgap-engineered devices. Using a
combination of theoretical modeling and carefully designed experiments, it is
proposed that the device potential of lateral bandgap engineering in graphene
nanoribbons will be investigated, leading to the demonstration of the basic
building blocks of complex electronic circuits such as rectifiers and
switches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The research proposed here is
expected to lead to the development of methods to use graphene nanoribbons in a
wide range of applications such as transistors, and long-wavelength optical
emitters and photodetectors. Since carbon nanostructures are not constrained by
lattice-matching requirements, they can be built on any substrates such as glass
or flexible/strechable substrates. Their superior electronic properties and low-
cost is expected to lead to future generations of large-area electronic,
optoelectronic, and sensor technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:
The project supports two undergraduate students and two graduate students. An
outreach program comprises an on-site experimental demonstration of nanoscale
scanning probe techniques for local high-school students with the collaboration
with a high-school teacher. The dissemination of research results by
publications and presentations at conferences, and its inclusion in courses
taught by the investigators will ensure the outreach of the research proposed to
the widest possible audience.&lt;br/&gt;
