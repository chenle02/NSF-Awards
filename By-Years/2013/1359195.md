The Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at Lehigh University
provides fourteen undergraduate students each summer the opportunity to
participate in research on topics in astrophysics, atomic and molecular physics,
biophysics, condensed matter physics, optics, nanotechnology, plasma physics,
and statistical physics. In addition to participating in research with an
experienced mentor, the REU students will engage in weekly activities to ensure
not only that their research stays on track but that they have an engaging
collegial and scholarly experience. By the end of the program, every student
will have prepared a written report or a poster about the summer research and
presented the results of the work in a 15 minute talk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
REU site will have a number of broader impacts with its focus on providing
research opportunities to undergraduates to help prepare them for future
science, technology, engineering, and mathematics careers. The site has a strong
plan to recruit undergraduate students from groups underrepresented in physics.
The project is informed by an on-going evaluation.
