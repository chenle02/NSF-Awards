Dr. Cox will study heavy electron materials and high temperature
superconductors. He will contribute to the field of heavy electron behavior
theories for novel origins of heavy electron behavior in uranium based compounds
and theories of the electrical resistance, neutron scattering, and x-ray
photoemission spectra of heavy electron materials.
