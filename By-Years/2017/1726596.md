This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and the
Chemistry Research Instrumentation (CRIF) Programs. Professor Justin Miller-
Schulze from California State Sacramento (University Enterprises Inc.) and
colleagues Thomas Landerholm and Amelia Vankeuren have acquired a high pressure
liquid chromatograph mass spectrometer (HPLC-MS.) In general, mass spectrometry
(MS) is one of the key analytical methods used to identify and study small
quantities of chemical species embedded in complex samples. In a typical
experiment, the components move into a mass spectrometer where they are ionized
and the ions' masses masses are measured. This highly sensitive technique allows
the determination of the structure of molecules in a complex mixture. An
instrument with a liquid chromatograph separates mixtures of compounds before
they reach the mass spectrometer. This acquisition strengthens the research
infrastructure at the university and regional area. The instrument broadens
participation by involving diverse groups of students in research. It also
provides training opportunities to many undergraduate students through a variety
of programs such as Sacramento State's Sustainable Interdisciplinary Research to
Inspire Undergraduate Success (SIRIUS) program, whose goal is to provide
undergraduates with authentic research experiences. This program involves
students from the Biological Sciences, Chemistry, Geology and Environmental
Studies. It includes a Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs)
centered on the American River ecosystem as a central
theme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mass spectrometer enhances research and
education at all levels. It especially benefits research efforts investigating
sources of adverse surface water quality using chemicals of emerging concern.
The mass spectrometer also aids in the determination of the fate and transport
of groundwater contaminants in mixtures related to oil and gas production.
