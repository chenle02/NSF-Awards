Droughts are widely cited in both contemporary and historical accounts of
African growth. The now massive empirical literature on economic growth has
grappled with the puzzle of low and volatile African growth, but has had very
little to say about the impact of climate shocks. This study develops empirical
bounds on the impact of rainfall fluctuations on African growth and on the main
channels of this impact. The project brings a widely useful rainfall dataset to
the attention of researchers focusing on economic growth in developing
countries, on African development in particular, and on macroeconomic
performance in individual African countries.

The project uses an historical dataset on national African precipitation
patterns constructed for the purposes of the project by the principal
investigators. The underlying data are historical monthly weather-station
observations that have been geographically gridded by climatologists for use in
large-scale climatology models. The data are rich enough to allow the
construction of climate norms predating the period of analysis, which coincides
with the availability of economic growth data beginning in the 1960s. The
investigators use estimated rainfall norms to calculate annual country-level
rainfall shocks, which they then use in country-by-country time-series
regressions that relate economic growth, investment, and agricultural output to
these shocks. Alternative transformations of the rainfall variable allow a
sequence of readily-interpreted specifications to be implemented, including
nonlinear specifications that allow for threshold effects, wet and dry outliers,
and cumulative effects.
