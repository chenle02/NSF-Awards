A classic aim of probability theory is to understand how the random interaction
of small individuals (particles, internet users, investors) translates to novel
behavior of the entire system. The goal of this project is to analyze such
complex systems where the interactions have high-dimensional dependence
structures and where the extremes (network hubs, low energy configurations,
optimal trajectories) play a significant role. As well as being important to
probability theory, the results to be obtained in this project will be relevant
and applied to many branches of science, as most of the questions were
introduced to understand the behavior of various optimization problems in
physics, computer science, theoretical biology, and social networks. The project
includes summer programs in probability aimed at US undergraduate and graduate
students.

The project involves problems on mean field spin glass models and on first-
passage percolation in the d-dimensional integer lattice. The PI plans to
investigate the structure of the Parisi measure in the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick
model at low temperature, the phenomena of full replica symmetry breaking, and
extensions of the Parisi theory to other disordered complex systems. The PI also
plans to develop an intrinsic theory of geodesic rays in first passage
percolation and its relation to fluctuations predictions (in two-dimensions
given by the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang theory), outside the scope of integrable
models. As part of the educational component of the project, the PI will
continue his mentorship and training of students and post-doctoral fellows. The
project includes probability summer programs (schools and boot-camps) aimed at
US undergraduate and graduate students.
