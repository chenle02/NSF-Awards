The proposed investigations will critically analyze the binding characteristics
of several membrane proteins that complex with single or ouble stranded cloned
DNA inserts, derived from the B. subtilis origin of replication. One 65kD
protein that binds strongly to two adjacent origin inserts, but not to flanking
origin regions or non-origin DNA inserts will be examined in detail. The protein
will be purified, its membrane form confirmed, and a determination will be made
of specific sequences involved in the protein-DNA binding. The relationship of
this protein to various dna initiation genes will be assessed by in vitro
complementation analysis using DNA/membrane subcomplexes extracted from mutants
conditionally defective in such dna genes. The dnaB gene will be of particular
interest to study because it has already been shown to encode a membrane protein
with affinity for replication origin DNA sites. Functional analyses will be done
with antibodies against the 65kD protein, to measure their ability to block
replication. Although the function of membrane associated DNA binding proteins
in the process of replication is presently uncertain, their importance in the
process is established. The results of the novel and rigorous experiments
described in this proposal are certain to provide important new information on
the sequence of events that occur during chromosome replication.
