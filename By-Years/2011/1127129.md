The purpose of the conference is to bring together physicists and mathematicians
working in related areas of differential geometry, geometric analysis and
theoretical physics. The main focus will be on special geometric structures and
their applications in differential and algebraic geometry, theoretical physics
and string theory. The conference is structured around invited talks, poster
session and informal discussions. NSF funds will be used to support the
participation of US researchers in the international conference on Geometric
Structures in Mathematical Physics, Golden Sands, Bulgaria, September 19 -
September 26, 2011.

Mathematics has always been a fundamental subject. The conference will provide
an important opportunity for Americans researchers to meet their partners from
around the world. The conference gives a unique opportunity for sharing of ideas
between researchers of many EU and US scientists. Specific topics will be
determined by the invited speakers who are all internationally recognized
experts. These topics are all active and central areas of geometry and
mathematical physics. The conference aims at presenting and developing further
the latest achievements in the subject. About 70% of the requested total funding
will be used for covering the traveling expenses of US participants without
additional NSF support who are from under-represented groups, post-doctoral
associates, and junior faculty.
