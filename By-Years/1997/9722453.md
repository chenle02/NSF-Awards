9722453 Green This Americas Program award will fund a workshop on the
representation theory of algebras. Participants are two groups of
mathematicians, headed by Dr. Edward L. Green, Virginia Polytechnic Institute,
and Dr. Roberto Martinez Villa, Universidad Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM.). The main
objective is to strengthen research efforts of both groups, and broaden and
diversify areas of interaction to bring new ideas, methods and insights to the
study of the representation theory of finite dimensional algebras. A major goal
of the project is the interchange of ideas and techniques of the various areas
of algebra that have not had much interaction in the past. To obtain such
interactions, participants will represent three main areas of research: hopf
algebras, quantum groups representations of algebras, and group representations.
Graduate students and junior researchers will be also be invited to participate
in the workshop. ***
