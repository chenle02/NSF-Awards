Texas A&amp;M University and the University of Texas at Austin will establish
an Engineering Research Center for Offshore Technology, whose goals are: (1) To
identify current and future technology needs of the off-shore industry for
producing from deep water installations; and (2) Conduct cross-disciplinary
research to fulfill these needs with the active participation of the off-shore
industry; Exploiting deep ocean resources will require new structures and
equipment to support engineering operations on and beneath the ocean surface.
Early ocean petroleum exploration and production was concentrated in shallow
water, using structures and facilities designed through engineering techniques
developed for operations on land. Such approaches are not feasible in water
deeper than 1000 feet. The purpose of the Center is to build the basic
engineering capability for technologies to exploit resource recovery in the
difficult and harsh environments of the deep ocean. New ideas for deep-water
production envision floating production/system with three components, a subsea
production unit on the ocean floor, a floating processing platform on the ocean
surface, and flexible, vertical risers connecting the two. Design will require
major advances in basic engineering knowledge. To generate the requisite
knowledge, research will be grouped into three areas: Hydrodynamic loadings in
deep water, Structural integrity of deep water systems, Materials for ocean
applications. The education program will include both undergraduates and
graduates, divided approximately equally. Their education will involve both
research participation and hands-on design experience. The design will provide a
basis for the education of students as working members of a cross-disciplinary
design teams. Industry will look to the Center for basic engineering research
and design. Full-scale evaluation, development and application will be the
specific effort of each company. This will permit the companies to compete on
the development phase, which is the area of their expertise. While with the
universities, they can cooperate on the basic engineering research phase, which
is the proper domain of university expertise.
