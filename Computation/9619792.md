9619792 Cai The investigator studies the numerical solution of partial
differential equations (including convection-diffusion, Helmholtz,
incompressible Stokes and Navier-Stokes, and elasticity equations) by a least-
squares formulation for an equivalent first-order system. First-Order System
Least Squares (FOSLS) formulates the original problem as an equivalent
minimization problem by applying a least-squares principle to an equivalent
first-order system. Hence, it represents a general methodology that can produce
a variety of algorithms, depending on such choices as the first-order system and
the least-squares norm, and that can lead to formulations that have
substantially different numerical properties (accuracy, adaptivity, and
complexity). The project seeks a proper first-order system and a proper least-
squares norm for formulating the original problem so well that the numerical
process (discretization and multigrid solution) becomes straightforward and
optimal. Certain finite element methods for FOSLS minimization problems for
second-order elliptic and incompressible Stokes and Navier-Stokes equations are
of optimal accuracy in each variable (including new variables). Standard
multigrid methods applied to the resulting discrete equations have optimal
complexity (i.e., computational cost for full multigrid solution is proportional
to the number of unknowns.). This project continues efforts on problems with
discontinuous coefficients, high Reynolds number flows, and linear elasticity
with general boundary conditions. This project aims to develop a new
computational method for systems of parial differential equations that model the
physical phenomena of fluid flow. The approach modifies existing mathematical
formulations for these processes, and leads to more efficient and robust
computational techniques than those currently in use. These new algorithms
enable computer simulations of a large class of problems in science and
engineering and mi nimize the need for costly experimental measurements.
