Abstract: Our main effort will go into using the methods of controlled surgery
theory to study of the geometric properties of the exotic homology manifolds
discovered by Bryant, Mio, Weinberger, and the author. The most pressing
questions in this area concern the existence of exotic homology manifolds which
are homogeneous and the existence of exotic homology manifolds which have
contractible universal covers. Construction of an exotic homogeneous homology
manifold would give a counterexample to the well-known Bing-Borsuk conjecture,
while an exotic aspherical homology manifold would give a counterexample to
either the integral Novikov conjecture or the well-known conjecture that every
Poincare duality group is the fundamental group of some aspherical manifold.

We also plan to use methods from controlled topology to study the Gromov-Lawson
conjecture and to study the classification of high-dimensional wild topological
embeddings in codimension two.
