The objective of this research is the relationship between lightning discharges
and cloud micro.physical processes using vertically pointing, co.linear, UHF and
VHF Doppler radars. In thunderstorms, Doppler spectra taken at UHF and VHF
Doppler radars. In thunderstorms, Doppler spectra taken at UHF provide velocity
information about precipitation particles, while Doppler spectra taken at VHF
provide additional velocity information about the clear air. Simultaneous
acquisition of data from these two radars will allow for a complete solution to
the problem of transforming Doppler power spectra into particle size
descriptions and integral parameters derived from these distributions will be
examined for significant changes before and after lightning is detected in the
radar beam. Further, the hypothesis that the lightning channel acts as a perfect
tracer of the air motion will be tested. And, finally if an absolute calibration
of both radars can be obtained, then the wavelength dependence of both the
volume reflectivity of lightning and the turbulent intensity will be determined.
