Analysis of homologous gene sequences among closely related mammalian species
reveals that different genes within a genome evolve at different rates. The rate
of gene variation is related to the nucleotide composition of the gene,
specifically, to the guanine+cytosine content. In mammalian cells dGTP is almost
invariably the least abundant deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) in the
proximal DNA precursor pool. If dGTP levels are subsaturating for replicative
DNA polymerases, replication fidelity can be affected, both by competition with
more abundant nucleotides for insertion opposite template cytosines, and by
increased proofreading upstream from dGMP in newly synthesized DNA. We will
analyze replication fidelity in vitro in a forward mutation assay system
developed by Roberts and Kunkel (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85, 7064 (1988).
This system uses a modified M13 phage template that contains an SV40 viral
replication origin and a portion of the E. coli lacZ gene and control region.
Mutations in the lac sequence target, arising during replication by a HeLa cell
extract, are scored by a plaque assay in the presence of a chromogenic
substrate. First we will ask whether this system, when provided with dNTP
mixtures that approximate the intranuclear environment, yields mutation
frequencies significantly different from those seen with an equimolar dNTP
mixture. The critical test, however, will be to systematically vary the GC
content of the target DNA sequence without changing its coding properties, and
to ask whether mutation frequencies vary as a function of GC content when
replicated in the presence of asymmetric dNTP mixtures. The GC content variation
will involve substitution of chemically synthesized oligonucleotides for
portions of the natural lacZ sequence. %%% It is important to know the
parameters which are associated with mutations in mammalian cells in order to
better control them. The information from this study will advance our ability to
do so.
