Random matrices are ubiquitous throughout mathematics, science, and engineering.
For instance, they can model physical systems in mathematical and statistical
physics, sample covariance matrices in statistics, benchmarks in numerical
analysis, algorithmic tools in signal processing; they also play a role in the
probabilistic method in geometric functional analysis. This project aims to
develop novel methods in random matrix theory with a view towards resolving
fundamental problems in a wide range of areas, including classical and
combinatorial random matrix theory, numerical analysis, Markov chain Monte
Carlo, statistical physics, discrepancy theory, and exact algorithms. The
educational component of this project includes training, research, and mentoring
opportunities for students at all levels. A key element will be
interdisciplinary workshops targeted at graduate students and early-career
mathematicians, with a focus on professional development of participants and
fostering research collaborations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research program is
broadly composed of three components. The first component concerns the non-
asymptotic study of the extreme singular values of random matrices, motivated by
fundamental problems including the singularity problem for discrete random
matrices and the matrix Spencer conjecture. The second component involves the
application of non-asymptotic random matrix theory to the mixing time of several
classical Markov chains in statistics and statistical mechanics. The third
component focuses on the study of the anti-concentration phenomenon and its
applications to combinatorics and computer science. Progress in each of these
components is anticipated to lead to the development of new probabilistic and
combinatorial techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
