The PI has developed a powerful method for analysis of geomagnetic array data,
for estimation of electrical conductivity variation within the mantle. Through
this grant he will apply the method to larger numbers of stations with greater
spatial variations than before. The method has great promise, and this grant
will establish the research program of this young investigator.
