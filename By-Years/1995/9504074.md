9504074 Gandhi This research will compare several methods of parallelizing the
EM FDTD code for large-scale man moll studies. Heterogeneous workstation
clusters will be used to study code portability, efficiency, and scalability.
This will be compared to use of High Performance Fortran (HPF) and also
massively parallel machines. Visualization of the large-scale output data and
subgridding of the FDTD lattice will also be parallelized. With the high-
resolution model made possible by the parallel code, coupling of power lines to
the pineal and pituitary glands, which may be implicated in EM biointeraction,
will be studied. Next-generation cellular telephones at 1900 MHz will be
examined, and a library of impulse responses will be developed, allowing
analysis of coupling of the body to any waveform up to 3 GHz.
