This project is mainly concerned with applications and extensions of the
Inverse Scattering Transform and methods of analyzing perturbed and unperturbed
infinite dimensional Hamiltonian systems. Such systems arise in the study of
many wave propagation problems, for example surface and internal waves in
fluids, optical lasers, and plasma physics.
