The California Academy of Sciences, a major natural history institution located
in San Francisco, will develop Life Through Time, a large permanent exhibition
on evolution that will inform and challenge visitors as they "walk through" a
series of exhibits which encourages them to touch and explore. The exhibition
will cover the history of life on earth, how scientists recognize and evaluate
change through time, the scientific method and process of discovering, and the
impact of evolution. A teacher's educational resource kit with hands-on
materials will be developed for use in the schools along with teacher training
courses. The exhibition will reach a substantial audience, over a million and a
half visitors per year. Additionally, 44% of the San Francisco elementary school
children are visited each year by Academy docents, the mobile classroom reaches
7,000 Bay Area residents, over 5,000 children and adults take classes at the
Academy and 10,000 school children visit the museum each year.
