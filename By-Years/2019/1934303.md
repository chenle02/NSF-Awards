The broader impact/commercial potential of the proposed I-Corps project consists
of significantly increased safety and control for real-world applications of
computer vision and mobile robotics. The first application in the optimal
monitoring and control of smart environments will impact the safety and
productivity of many industries, such as video surveillance, access control, and
smart buildings/cities. Computer-vision software applications will impact
industries such as autonomous automobiles by predicting actions of nearby
pedestrians, animals, or other vehicles. Automated video processing and
recognition software will potentially reduce the impact of catastrophes such as
terrorist attacks or mass shootings via intent prediction and anomaly detection
available through the proposed video analytics software. Additionally, in a
different application the proposed solution may be used to optimize a building's
energy efficiency and reduce building operating costs.

This I-Corps project further develops a platform for autonomous visual scene
perception and feedback control. Autonomous real-time perception and predictive
control will dramatically increase the safety and efficiency across several
potential applications by directing a human operator's attention to a situation
or automatically applying changes to the sensor field of view or controllable
environmental conditions such as lighting or temperature. The unique deep
learning Bayesian optimization framework does not require prior knowledge of the
scene in which it is deployed and instead learns the scene representation over
time. The project ties together machine learning, estimation, and control
systems. Proof of concept testing has been successfully completed in real-time
vehicles equipped with cameras and using deep learning in the loop for
autonomous control of the sensor field of view.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
