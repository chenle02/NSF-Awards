0236304 Stern&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two dimensional doubly diffusive intrusions
will be investigated analytically and numerically in a frontal model. For the
case of finger favorable vertical temperature and salinity gradients (salinity
increasing upward) the small scale fluxes will be parameterized by previously
obtained (numerical) calibrations. Application to the finite lateral width model
will give a minimum critical value of the lateral salinity variation for the
onset of a two-dimensional intrusive instability. For supercritical lateral
salinity variation the eigenfunctions will initialize a numerical integration
which will give the modification of the mean lateral gradients and the condition
for isopycnal overturns. The case of a stable salt gradient heated from below
will also be examined in a laterally bounded frontal model, and the vertical
scale of the intrusive instability will be related to the smallest thermocline
steps observed in the Weddell Sea. The upward heat flux in these steps may help
to maintain the large gaps (polynyas) observed in the Antarctic ice which could
affect the atmospheric climate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will
contribute to our understanding of the horizontal mixing of water masses by
using a very elaborate and precise salt finger parameterization to model the
intrusions occurring on a density-compensated thermohaline front and answer
questions such as preferred intrusion scales and magnitudes. This research will
be made available to the climate modeling community with presentations and
publications so that the results can be incorporated into the general ocean
circulation models. In addition, the post doc and Ph.D. student will gain
invaluable experience in using state-of-the art scientific computational
equipment and techniques to solve fluid dynamical problems of significant
practical interest. The PI will also participate in the Summer Program in
Geophysical Fluid Dynamics (GFD) at Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution..&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
