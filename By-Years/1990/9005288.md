The Florida Institute of Technology will connect their campus network to SURAnet
(Southeastern Universities Research Association network, a regional network
which is part of the NSFNET). Direct connection to SURAnet will provide
researchers with improved access to national networks such as CSNET/Bitnet and
USENET. Improvement is sought in reliability, speed, turn- around, flexibility,
and functions such as file transfer, remote login, and teleconferencing. The
Florida Institute for Technolgy, through this connection to an external network,
will be able to maximize existing local computing resources, facilitate access
to external information and remote computing resources, and provide a connection
for scholarly interaction with faculty and researchers in diverse geographical
locations.
