This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the continuing work of Dr.
R. Marshall Wilson at the University of Cincinnati. This work will provide new
insights into the nature of short-lived intermediates that are produced by
irradiation of organic molecules using high-intensity lasers. The experiments
that will be carried out by Dr. Wilson are designed to elucidate the reactivity
of photochemical intermediates that are produced in multiple photon processes
using a unique laser-jet apparatus that greatly enhances the effective light
intensity of a focused argon laser beam. High concentrations of reactive
intermediates will be generated in the experiments, and Wilson will study their
reactions with each other and with trapping agents. The studies will be extended
from organic molecules to organometallic species and to transient species
adsorbed on silica gel surfaces.
