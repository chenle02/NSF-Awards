EEC-9700775 ABSTRACT The award provides funding to Colorado School of Mines
under the direction of Dr. Rahmat Shoureshi, for the support of a Combined
Research-Curriculum Development project entitled, " Combined Research-Curriculum
Development on Diagnostics, Health Assessment, and Predictive Maintenance of
Engineered Processes and Systems." This project proposes to develop and
incorporate a research-based comprehensive curriculum in the area of
diagnostics, health assessment, and preventive maintenance. The key objective of
the program is to educate a new generation of engineers who would have
analytical background knowledge, and appreciation for the vital area of
diagnostics and health assessment of processes and engineered products.
