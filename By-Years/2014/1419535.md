A complete understanding of animal development and physiology requires examining
many cells of the same type in culture. These cells allow detailed
investigations that are not possible while the cells are within their tissue in
an intact animal. This work is being performed in Drosophila melanogaster, which
has been an important genetic model for over a hundred years and for which it
has not been possible to make cell lines. A novel strategy is being used to
generate Drosophila cell lines, which will benefit many types of investigations.
These lines will be distributed to the scientific community through by the
Drosophila Genomics Resource Center. In addition to enabling many new types of
important research, this project will enhance the development of the scientific
workforce by including students in the project. In particular, undergraduate
interns in a summer research program, drawn from all over the country, will work
on developing and characterizing the cell lines. The summer program is co-
directed by the investigator and is targeted to students from other universities
and colleges who have limited access to research and are from groups
underrepresented in science.

This EAGER project is using an innovative strategy to produce Drosophila cell-
type specific cell lines. This strategy involves manipulating the expression of
tumor suppressor genes via a new drug-inducible system. It is expected that
expressing RasV12 reversibly in a tissue-specific manner will enable the
generation of cell-type specific cell lines. Accordingly, each cell line will be
allowed to propagate with high RasV12 expression, and then allowed to
differentiate by turning off RasV12. These methods will be used on starter cells
derived from different embryonic tissues to produce cell lines of three major
cell types: epithelium, muscle and neuron. The lines will be validated,
characterized, and distributed to investigators. They will enable many novel and
essential experiments, such as genome-wide screens for new genes involved in
epithelial cell polarity, myoblast fusion, and neurite outgrowth.
