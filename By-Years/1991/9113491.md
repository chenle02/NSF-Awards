This award funds the first year of a three year continuing grant. A number of
basic scientific issues remain to be addressed in order to facililtate the wide
use of neural networks in control systems. This research focuses on trainable
state estimation for neural networks in order to deal with effects of plant and
sensor noise and incomplete availability of state measurments. It will also
explore neural network implementation of a self-tuning regulator for adapting a
controller to track changes in a nonlinear plant; techniques for controller
weight initialization that can decrease network training time and also reduce
the probability of convergence of the weights to undersirable local minima; and
adaptation of networks for navigational obstacle avoidance to robotic
manipulator obstacles avoidance.
