This effort by the National Society of Professional Engineers, for $22,500 will
help underwrite the 1992, 1993 and 1994 National Engineers Week/Discover "E"
programs. National Engineers Week is a public program conducted by the
engineering community in America. Over the last forty years, it has evolved into
a popular and highly visible program with a special emphasis on student outreach
activities. The National Engineers Week Committee provides print and audio-
visual materials to engineers participating in Discover "E" teach-ins and other
public outreach activities. By such support for this effort, NSF will join more
than 30 companies, engineering societies and government agencies in underwriting
the costs of the program.
