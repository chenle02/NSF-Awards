With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, Prof. Alfred
Redfield of Brandeis University will develop a sample shuttler for nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation studies using commercial spectrometers. The
sample shuttle probe will provide an approach to obtaining the magnetic field
dependence of spin-lattice relaxation constants. Thus, this new tool will
provide a convenient way to separate dipolar contributions from chemical shift
anisotropic contributions without the necessity of multiple NMR instruments.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most
powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of
molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific
arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of
interactions between molecules in solution. The completed shuttler should be
broadly applicable and could be readily built in a university machine shop. Thus
NMR relaxation measurements, which are key to understanding complex biologically
relevant molecules, will become much more common-place.
