This project uses a synergistic approach that involves use of field data,
numerical simulation, and laboratory simulation to study tornado-induced wind
loads on man-made or built structures. The primary objective of this project is
to quantify tornado-induced wind loads on typical structures such as low-rise
and high-rise buildings, dome-shaped and curved-roof structures, and slender
chimneys and towers that comprise the majority of our built environment. In this
project, a laboratory tornado simulator at Iowa State University (ISU) is used
to realistically produce a variety of tornado-like vortices for testing their
loading effects on geometrically-scaled models of built structures. Field
measurement data from the University of Oklahoma's "Doppler on Wheels" studies
along with the data generated by numerical simulations of tornado vortex winds
at ISU to extrapolate the field data (available for 50 ft and above) to ground
level are used to validate the flow field generated by the laboratory tornado
simulator. This laboratory simulator uses an innovative mechanism that allows it
to produce a translating tornado-like vortex with different Swirl ratios, core
diameters and Reynolds numbers suitable for geometrically-scaled model testing.
