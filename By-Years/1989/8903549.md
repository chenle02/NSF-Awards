The supercontinent Pangaea, which existed from Late Carboniferous through about
Middle Jurassic time had a unique and extreme climate, which is predicted to
have been a strong monsoonal circulation that reached a maximum during the
Triassic. A monsoonal climate would be expected to have had the following
features: (1) dry or seasonally dry continental interiors; (2) evidence of
strong seasonality, especially in low latitudes; (3) equatorial region that is
dry, especially in the east; (4) maximum expression of these features in the
Triassic. For the purpose of testing the monsoon and alternative hypotheses,
data on paleoclimatic indicators will be compiled from the literature and data
maps will be constructed for three times during the Pangaean interval that have
been identified as likely to have been key times in the development of the
monsoonal circulation. Particular attention will be paid to the problems of
quality control on data and on the heretofore intractable problems of
quantitative analysis for terrestrial paleoclimatic data. Preliminary
applications of a numerical climate model to the Pangaean paleogeography will be
carried out. This research will contribute to paleoclimatology and to our
understanding of climate dynamics by (1) establishing a method for quantitative
paleoclimatic data analysis; (2) documenting the effects of a large land mass on
global climate; (3) increasing understanding of the dynamics and structure of an
extreme paleoclimatic state.
