The Hybrid Particle Methods (HPM) are developed for the simulation of high
velocity dynamic events that include fracture and fragmentation. The
intellectual merit of the work includes: (a) meshelss formulation with particle
distributions where individual particles have variable neighbors, (b) convenient
addition and rearrangement of particles facilitating adaptivity to allow
modeling severe deformations, (c) increased accuracy of the MLS interpolations
that form the bases of meshless methods, (d) propagation of cracks using
geometry-based criteria, and (e) parallel implementation to allow the simulation
of realistic problems.

The developments extend readily to other disciplines beyond solid mechanics and
provide a renewed impetus to the development of meshless methods. The project
involves undergraduate students in cutting-edge research, has collaborations
with Naval Surface Warfare Center, and provides opportunities for the
integration of research and education. The research has extensive applications
ranging from military to manufacturing to civilian.
