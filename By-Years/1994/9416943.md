9416943 Levinton The purpose of this project is to understand the adaptations of
complex particle processing mechanisms and limitations of bivalve mollusks by
means of direct manipulative experiments using state of the art observational
techniques. Dr. Levinton and colleagues will focus on bivalve mollusks, owing to
their great impact on benthic-pelagic coupling in coastal ecosystems. They have
a large range of particle feeding modes and they are amenable to tests of models
of particle processing. They will examine the responses and limiting factors of
suspension feeding and deposit feeding bivalves, when exposed to a natural
ranges of particle qualities and total particle loads. Variations in response
have proven to affect various aspects of bivalve feeding, which in turn strongly
affects the suspended matter in a shallow coastal ecosystem and the nature of
the organic matter that is biodeposited on the sediment surface. There is,
therefore, an important link between bivalve feeding adaptations and coastal
oceanography.
