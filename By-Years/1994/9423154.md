9423154 Galbraith This U.S.-Czech research project between Dr. David Galbraith
of the University of Arizona and Dr. Jaroslav Dolezel of the Czech Institute of
Experimental Botany will examine procedures for cell cycle synchronization in
meristem root tip cells, isolation of condensed chromosomes from synchronized
cells arrested in metaphase, and the flow sorting of these chromosomes. The
objective of this collaborative work is to construct chromosome- specific gene
libraries in Zea maize, using flow cytometry. Results should contribute to our
knowledge of chromosome separation techniques which will be widely useful in
future research on plant strains carrying advantageous translocations. This
project in plant biology fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific
knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to
combine complementary talents and pool research resources in areas of strong
mutual interest and competence. ***
