&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Alabama Alliance for Graduate Education and the
Professoriate (AGEP) II is being funded to increase significantly the number of
underrepresented minority students receiving doctoral degrees in the science,
technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields and entering the
professoriate. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Alabama AGEP II is a partnership
between The University of Alabama at Birmingham, the University of Alabama, the
University of Alabama in Huntsville, Auburn University, seven Historically Black
Colleges and Universities (HBCU) in Alabama; Alabama A&amp;M University, Alabama
State University, Miles College, Oakwood College, Stillman College, Talladega
College and Tuskegee University, and one HBCU in Mississippi; Tougaloo College.
The members of the Alliance are members of the Alabama Louis Stokes Alliance for
Minority Participation (LSAMP) and have a track record of working together
successfully to implement minority student programs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
HBCU undergraduate partners will serve as feeder schools for the graduate
university partners. The Alabama AGEP program has developed and will implement
an innovative model for recruiting, mentoring, and retaining minority students
in STEM doctoral programs using the following strategies: 1. Graduate School
Awareness and Preparation Activities, 2. Recruitment and Admission Initiatives,
3. Graduate Bridge Programs, 4. Mentoring and Advising, 5. Creation of a
Supportive Environment / Retention and Support Network, and 6. Degree Completion
and Job Placement. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The implementation
of the proposed activities will advance the knowledge and understanding of
innovative methods to attract underrepresented minority undergraduate students
to graduate school and eventually to careers in the professoriate. A well
qualified and diverse team of experienced mathematicians and scientists serving
as PIs at participating universities and colleges will explore and implement
creative activities designed to increase the number of minority students earning
Ph.D. degrees in STEM disciplines and entering the
professoriate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The proposed activities
will broaden participation of underrepresented minorities and benefit society by
providing an increase in the number of citizens prepared to assume high-level
positions in the nation's scientific and educational workforce. In addition,
project activities will advance discovery and understanding through the
integration of research and education by providing research experiences for
undergraduate students at participating institutions.&lt;br/&gt;
