ABSTRACT DMS - 0203023.&lt;br/&gt;PI: Lei Ni&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principle
investigator proposes to study the interplay between the&lt;br/&gt;geometry and
the analysis on complete Kaehler manifolds. The focus will be&lt;br/&gt;linear
and nonlinear analysis on such manifolds. The main tool is solving&lt;br/&gt;the
linear equation, such as the Poisson equation and Poincare-
Lelong&lt;br/&gt;equation, and the nonlinear equations such as the Kaehle-Ricci
flow. The&lt;br/&gt;goal is to understand the space of holomorphic functions
(plurisubharmonic&lt;br/&gt;functions), the interplay between the geometry and
the function theory and&lt;br/&gt;applying the results to the uniformization of
complete Kaehler manifolds&lt;br/&gt;with nonnegative
curvature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The manifold is the space where every physical
event happens. The&lt;br/&gt;global analysis on manifolds studies the overall
properties of the&lt;br/&gt;manifolds by piecing together the local information.
Kaehler manifolds are&lt;br/&gt;the basic block in the universe model according
to the &lt;br/&gt; string theory. The proposed study&lt;br/&gt;has close
connection with the theory of general relativity and string&lt;br/&gt;theory.
The nonlinear differential equations studied in the proposal
have&lt;br/&gt;applications in the study of the structure of complicated
molecules,&lt;br/&gt;liquid-gas boundary, and even the large scale
networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
