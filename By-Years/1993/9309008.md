9309008 McLaughlin The Principal Investigator is analyzing and designing
quantizers for the compression and transmission of analog signals such as
speech, images, video and music across noisy channels such as satellite links or
telephone lines. The research considers joint source-channel codes, which are
essentially source codes designed so that their outputs can be transmitted
directly across a noisy channel without channel coding. The investigator is
developing an asymptotic theory, giving insight and direction into the design of
locally and possibly globally optimum noisy channel quantizers. Source-channel
codes then will be designed to achieve or exceed the overall system performance
of the traditional approach of tandem source and channel coding. The award
provides support for three years.
