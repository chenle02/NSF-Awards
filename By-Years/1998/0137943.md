EIA 0137943&lt;br/&gt; William Aspray&lt;br/&gt; Computing Research
Association&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WORKSHOP: The Future Grand Challenges of
Computer Science and Engineering&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This effort supports a
conference to ask the question: What is the nature of the future "grand
challenge" problems in computer science and engineering? The conference
organizers believe that many deep and exciting issues remain. The purpose of the
proposed conference is to provoke "out-of-the-box" thinking and thus to hasten
the next "golden age". The conference will serve as an experiment and possible
prototype for a series of conferences on grand research challenges in computer
science and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;
