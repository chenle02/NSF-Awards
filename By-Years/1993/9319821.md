9319821 Georgakakos The project will study the June July 1993 floods in the
Mississippi River basin affecting at least seven Mid Western States. The work
will concentrate on the Iowa floods which are representative of the overall
flooding and have severely affected the regional economy and the management of
water resources. The assessment of the performance of existing flood control
works, the pertinence of their design, the utility of the models used for
designing these works, and the impacts of the flood on the water systems and
resources of the region will be the focus of this project. A better
understanding of causes and effects of this extraordinary flood will benefit
future plans for the management of this type of extreme natural events. ***
