9628374 Varekamp This conference, which is organized as a Chapman conference
under AGU stewardship will bring together scientists that work on volcanic
degassing, crater lakes, economic geochemists, geothermal geologists and
environmental chemists. All share research either in active volcanic terrains or
through their dealings with the chemistry of hyper-acid fluids in the
environment. Exchange of data, methods and factual knowledge between those
different constituencies will be fruitful for future research. Funding will
provide support to graduate students from universities in the USA to attend this
meeting.
