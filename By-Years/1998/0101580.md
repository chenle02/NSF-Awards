This three-year project is developing a curriculum on Distributed Energy
Systems. The five industry-based course curriculums are becoming elective course
options for community college degree and certificate programs, as well as being
integrated into apprenticeship worker training. Accompanying the five industry-
based course curriculums are supporting educational materials. Four, 2-member
teams composed of Brevard Community College (BCC) and Florida Solar Energy
Center (FSEC) faculty are developing the curriculum and other educational
materials. The public and professional community now have opportunities to learn
about the economic, environmental, and workforce benefits of distributed energy
through seminars and printed materials.&lt;br/&gt;
