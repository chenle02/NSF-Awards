This project involves the design and execution of laboratory experiments on
cooperation in finitely repeated games. Particular conditions to be examined
include nonbinding communication ("cheap talk"). Other experiments are designed
to investigate the relationship between cooperation levels and the payoff
properties of outcomes that serve as possible punishments or rewards. Game
theorists have devoted considerable attention to models of equilibrium
cooperation in dynamic, multi-stage games. The conditions thought to be
necessary for such cooperation to occur are affected by market and individual
characteristics that alter the structure of the game. This project examines the
behavioral significance of these characteristics. Such an assessment is
important for future theoretical work. In addition, insights gained from
laboratory data may aid in predicting when cooperative outcomes will arise in
naturally occurring markets. Many policy debates turn on assumptions about the
extent to which economic agents behave cooperatively. The desirability of
challenging a horizontal merger, for example, depends largely on the likelihood
of a post-merger conspiracy. Similarly, when product quality is unobserved prior
to purchase, consumer-protection policies may be unnecessary if consumers and
producers cooperate.
