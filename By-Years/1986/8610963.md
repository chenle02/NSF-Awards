This joint cooperative research will study selected steel and concrete buildings
in Mexico City which had low seismic resistance as determined from seismic
design provisions. Subsequently, these were strengthened through addition of
bracing elements or infill walls, and they experienced damage or no damage
during severe earthquake ground motion. Laboratory experiments of innovative
techniques using concrete-filled steel bracing systems and infill walls will be
performed to provide appropriate analytical modelling data and performance data
for utilization in remedial strengthening recommendations.
