In the study of many fundamental problems in number theory, for example
distribution of prime numbers and rational solutions to some polynomial
equations, a function on the complex plane, called the L-function, has been
associated with the arithmetic object under study. Various properties of the
L-functions are believed and have been proved in many special cases to encode
deep arithmetic information. This research project is mainly concerned with
congruences between special values of L-functions, as well as congruences
between automorphic forms, which are multi-variable functions with many
symmetries. This project also aims at applying these congruences to study the
connection between the special values of L-functions and the sizes of arithmetic
cohomology groups in some special cases. In this project, one aspect is the
study of the congruences modulo powers of p between automorphic forms related to
theta correspondence. This includes studying the p-adic properties of certain
theta lifts by using suitable integral representations of L-functions and
L-values for automorphic representations, constructing certain p-adic
L-functions and constructing Hida families of theta lifts. The Iwasawa--
Greenberg Main Conjecture predicts a connection between the p-adic L-functions
and the Selmer groups attached to p-adic deformations of Galois representations.
Another aspect of this project is to exploit the results on the congruences to
study this conjecture in the special case of the Rankin--Selberg product of a
pair of modular forms whose weights are of the same parity.
