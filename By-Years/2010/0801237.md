Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Yu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this proposal is to
support US graduate students/postdocs and US speakers to participate in the
Noncommutative Geometry Workshop and the Canadian Symposium on Operator Algebras
and Their Applications. The Fields Institute of Mathematical Sciences will host
a Noncommutative Geometry Workshop during May 27-31, 2008, and the Canadian
Symposium on Operator Algebras and Their Applications during May 20-28, 2008.
Noncommutative Geometry is a mathematical theory specifically designed to handle
"geometric objects", whose coordinates do not commute but which do occur
naturally in both mathematics and physics. Noncommutative Geometry has undergone
vigorous growth in the last decade or so. It has been the source of many
exciting new developments in several different fields of both core mathematics
and mathematical physics. The main goal of these meetings is to highlight the
most significant recent advances in Noncommutative Geometry, to identify new
emerging directions, and to help graduate students/postdocs to navigate to the
frontier of Noncommutative Geometry.&lt;br/&gt;
