This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I research project proposes
to investigate the feasibility of designing and developing a low-cost mobile
phone that can also be used as transit token, leveraging the wireless
capabilities of the mobile phone to add token value to a transit card. Transit
System Operators throughout the world are replacing their paper ticket and metal
token transit with contactless smart card technologies. Financial Institutions
and Transit Operators are also utilizing "dual-interface" or "combi-cards" which
are smart cards that have both contact and contactless interfaces and typically
contain a transit application (such as Mifare) and a payment applications (such
as Credit or Debit). A wireless phone that is equipped with transit smart card
and antenna creates a unique personal transaction terminal.

In the US, smart card transit systems are now in process in Washington DC,
Boston, Las Vegas, San Francisco representing millions of commuters, and with
mobile phone penetration in the US currently over 45%, there is a significant
market opportunity for mobile phones that can be used as transit tokes or used
to recharge transit smart cards. If successful this product add more capability
to what could be the communication appliance of choice, the mobile phone.
