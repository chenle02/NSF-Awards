Order matters. In real life it is easy to observe that the order of certain
operations greatly change the final outcome. As an example one may think of
heating water and adding oil. After almost a century mathematicians have finally
embraced the challenge from quantum mechanics and developed a theory which
allows to study noncommuting operations. The work funded in this project will
take this challenge literally and study classical operations from calculus and
introduce an order dependence for space, time and all the operations performed
in space and time. A particular range of applications of the theoretical work
will gain new insights in quantum information theory. Quantum information theory
modifies Shannon's theory of sending reliable information through noisy channels
to quantum devices in the hope of taking advantage of "teleportation" or other
non-traditional "spooky behaviour."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More concretely, the
proposed work aims to study the connection between noncommutative geometry and
noncommutative harmonic analysis. The goal is to adapt some terminology from
noncommutative geometry, for example curvature, and show that it an be used for
estimates involving Laplace and Dirac operators on noncommutative spaces. The
work in quantum information theory will develop inequalities for entropy related
expressions and apply them to notions of capacity, asymmetry and time to
equilibrium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
