High accumulation rates, the lack of bioturbation, an abundance of distinct
laminae (probably varves), and the preservation of both siliceous and calcareous
microfossils, make the anoxic sediments of the Cariaco Basin optimal for use in
constructing high-resolution records of paleoclimatic change. During the field
program, piston, gravity, and box core samples of these laminated sediments will
be collected. AMS radiocarbon time control and multiple paleoenvironmental
proxies will be used to focus on changes in trade wind strength and hydrologic
balance over the western tropical North Atlantic region during the last glacial
termination, the Holocene, and the Little Ice Age. Preliminary analysis of
existing data suggests that this change was large and related to global climatic
change. After testing the annual nature of the sediment laminae, calibration
time series of proxy data from the sediment directly against observed
hydrographic and climatic data will be made. Synoptic analysis and climate model
experiments will be used to understand reconstructed patterns of low latitude
variability in the context of global change and to test hypothesized causes of
this variability.
