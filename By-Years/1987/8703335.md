Ill-conditioned problems arise frequently in computer vision because the image
information contains noise and ambiguities such that the true identity of the
scene is not uniquely specified. It is nonetheless possible for humans to infer
the structure of objects from incomplete data, presumably through the use of
assumptions and computations consistent with natural images. This project
focuses on a method in numerical analysis for solving "inverse problems" when
the degraded scene has undergone a sequence of steps modeled by a known
equation. Reconstruction can then be attempted by finding a solution that
minimizes the deviation from that equation. The method is exemplified by its
application to the deblurring problem. In this problem, deblurring is achieved
by computing a succession of images, each slightly deblurred from the previous,
such that the complete set satisfies the equations specifying the diffusion
process of blurring. Deblurring and more general problems are studied in this
project, using the method of minimization of equation error to inject the
necessary assumptions to uniquely infer information in visual data.
