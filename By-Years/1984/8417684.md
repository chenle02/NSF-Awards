This study focuses on transition and film boiling. The objective is to provide a
fundamental understanding of the phenomena occurring under pool and forced flow
of saturated and subcooled liquids. High-speed photography along with
holographic interferometric technique and gamma densitometry are used to
determine the heat flux into the subcooled liquid and local void fraction
profiles at the wall. Mechanistic models for transition and film boiling are
developed.
