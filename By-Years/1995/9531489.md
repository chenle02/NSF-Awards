This renewal grant will extend research of diffuse aurora, with previously
developed software used to exclude field-aligned electron acceleration events.
Two specific planned studies are (1) the distribution of temperatures and
densities of the precipitation source regions, and (2) models of ionospheric
conductivity more realistic than those developed to date. The PI hopes to more
accurately represent the intensity and localization of the auroral oval on each
given pass. This study should result in a distribution of temperatures and
densities of unperturbed precipitation as a function of MLT, MLAT, and the
radius of the auroral oval, and the creation of ionospheric conductivity maps
specific to each DMSP satellite pass through the auroral oval.
