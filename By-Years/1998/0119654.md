Due to the inherent instability of protein/peptide drugs in aqueous solution,
the successful formulation of these compounds in lyophilized form has become an
important activity within the pharmaceutical industry. However, the extent to
which the stability of a given protein/peptide is improved in the amorphous
solid-state depends on many variables including moisture, temperature, the
viscoelastic properties of the solid, chemical nature of the excipients and
impurities present, and the nature of the degradation
pathways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Molecular dynamics simulations are uniquely
suited to the exploration of various molecular details which are important in
the degradation of proteins/peptides in amorphous solids. The researchers will
investigate how changes in molecular mobility and conformational flexibility in
amorphous matrices influence both the formation of reactive intermediates and
the subsequent partitioning of these reactive intermediates to products, which
depends on the relative translational and rotational mobility of either the
protein itself or smaller molecules which may be participants in the overall
reaction. &lt;br/&gt;
