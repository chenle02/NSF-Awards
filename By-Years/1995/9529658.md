Proposal Number: ECS-9529658 Principal Investigator: Michael Lieber man and
Allan Lichtenberg ABSTRACT Dynamics of R.F. Discharges for Materials Etching
Fundamental research on a novel in situ high-density large-area plasma source
will be carried out. Microwave driven and rf-inductively coupled plasma sources
are widely used in the semiconductor and flat panel display industries for
etching and deposition processes; moreover their use has become critical for
VLSI circuit and thin film transistor (TFT) production. Large area high density
sources will play an increasing role in processing as feature sizes shrink while
wafer and TFT sizes increase. The program involves experiments and analytical
models for a large area plasma source that is inductively excited by an RF
traveling wave launched onto an antenna coil embedded within the plasma volume.
Such a source has favorable properties for scaling to large sizes. Plasma in the
source will be generated in a rectangular box 71.1 cm x 61.0 cm x 20.3 cm
containing a substrate holder large enough to study processing of silicon wafers
as large as 300 mm in diameter and flat panel glass substrate sizes as large as
360 mm x 465 mm. A critical issue to be examined in the experiments is whether
traveling wave excitation of a coil embedded in the plasma can generate uniform
plasma over very large areas.
