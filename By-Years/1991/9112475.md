An ion chromatograph is to be purchased with this Research Equipment Grant to
support three different projects in the Chemistry and Chemical Engineering
Departments. The purpose of the first project is to identify and quantify the
metal species that exist as a result of thermal degradation of hazardous waste.
In the second, high performance ion chromatography will be investigated as an
analytical tool for characterizing cyanide bearing waste. A third application is
to the evaluation of the concentration and speciation of metals and other
substances such as cyanide in the tailings at abandoned mining sites, and to
assess the leachability of hazardous chemicals from the site. Heavy metals such
as leaf, mercury and arsenic pose a serious hazard to human health if they
become concentrated in drinking water or the food chain. An ion chromatograph
has the ability to separate mixtures of cations and anions, free and complexed,
providing a way to characterize the chemical state, and thus the desirability,
of specific heavy metals present in a waste stream.
