This project involves the dissertation research of an anthropology student from
the University of Florida. The hypothesis to be tested is that male labor
emigration from the Caribbean Island of Haiti leads to increased female
fertility in the home communities, because the remittances available from males
are important to poor women in raising their children. Preliminary studies have
shown this relationship in extensive survey data. The student will study in two
villages of Haiti, one in which there are many absent men working elsewhere and
another with relatively few absent men. Extensive surveys of individuals in
households in the villages will provide economic, reproductive, nutritional and
social data to test the hypothesis. This research is important because the
Caribbean has long been a reservoir of migrant labor for the countries of the
Americas. Haiti in particular has been the poorest country of the region, and
has evidenced a pattern of male out migration for some time. The contribution of
this case study will be to provide the fine-grained information about human
behavior in context that ethnography excels in. Improved understanding of the
impact of migrant laborer remittances on the reproductive success of the women
left behind will be valuable for development planners attempting to design
programs to raise the living conditions of the Haitian people.
