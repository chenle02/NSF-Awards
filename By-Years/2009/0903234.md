The issue addressed in this project for Mississippi, and perhaps other states in
the Nation, is that K-12 educational systems have not been able to keep up with
the changing requirements for graduates who wish to go directly into the
industrial workforce. This is particularly acute in the realm of contemporary
technology. This project develops a series of classes for 7th-12th grade
teachers that facilitates the integration of contemporary high technology
knowledge into their regular classes. Through this mechanism, students should be
better prepared to enter industry directly or to proceed into the community
college system. Thus, the industries in the region should find high school and
community college graduates who are better prepared for the modern day workforce
within their geographical region.
