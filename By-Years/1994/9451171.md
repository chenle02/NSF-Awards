9451171 Johnson A laboratory of microcomputers networked to a file server which
is equipped with mathematics and statistics software is used by undergraduate
students in both mathematics courses and courses in other undergraduate areas
through a comprehensive plan called Mathematics Across the Curriculum. The goal
is to make the learning and appreciation of mathematics a shared responsibility
on campus by enhancing the mathematics components of a wide range of courses,
especially in the core (or general education) curriculum. The computer lab
supports this effort as well as undergraduate mathematics courses, including
Calculus, Linear Algebra and Differential Equations. The initial reform of the
mathematics curriculum is the use of the Harvard Calculus Consortium materials
supported by the use of this computer laboratory. The lab is staffed and managed
in a newly created Mathematics Center. The Director builds upon past experience
and expertise in the uses of technology in mathematics education. He works with
faculty outside the Mathematics Department to enhance the role of mathematics
and technology in their courses, assists students in coping with mathematics-
related assignments and helps to revise mathematics courses.
