CISE Postdoctoral Associates in Experimental Computer Science: An
Interconnection Network Architecture for Petaflops Computing

Research in high-performance computer systems is proposed that will expand the
one-dimensional prototype Simultaneous Optical Multiprocessor Exchange Bus
(SOME-Bus) interconnection network into a two-dimensional architecture. Recent
work on the SOME-Bus over the past few years has raised several important issues
(e.g., network interface design, network management, programming, applications
and performance) that remain open and challenging as they relate to the
potential two-dimensional bus. The experimental and theoretical work of the
postdoctoral research associate will contribute to multidisciplinary research in
computer architecture, performance analysis, optoelectronic devices, and VLSI
design. The associate's research training will be enhanced by interactions with
other nearby academic and industry groups working on similar high-performance
architectures, and limited contributions to graduate student projects and
courses in computer architecture.
