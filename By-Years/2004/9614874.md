9614874 Revenaugh This research involves the mapping of crustal scatterers by
means of the application of Kirchhoff migration inversion techniques to local
earthquake data. Current research has successfully emonstrated the effectiveness
of the methodology using three different scattering modes. 1) P scattered into
Rg due to topography and scattered Rg due to shear-wave heterogeneity; 2) P to P
scattering due to a subducting slab; and 3) P to S scattering due to fault zone
heterogeneity, presumably temporal in nature related to the timing of earthquake
occurrence. This work will involve modification of the migration technique to
better model high-frequency wave propagation, include azimuthally varying
scattering intensity and site responses and use the latest tomographic models in
the travel time calculations. Data from seismic arrays in California, Hawaii,
and western Washington will be used. The results are related to earthquake
hazard mapping, volcanic hazard mapping and crustal and upper mantle structure.
This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction
Program. ***
