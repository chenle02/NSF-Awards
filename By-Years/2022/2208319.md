The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development of a software program for people with chronic illnesses that do not
know what to eat to manage their chronic disease. Many patients have limited
access to nutrition professionals for reasons such as time and financial
constraints and availability of a registered dietitian. In the US, 60% of adults
have a chronic disease. People with a chronic disease are more likely to have a
poor quality of life. The proposed software program may improve quality of life
and increase access to nutrition services for patients. It is designed to show
people what to eat and how to prepare foods based on his or her current diet-
related behaviors and readiness to change. This is of great interest to
leadership of insurance companies and employee wellness programs because
research has shown that dietitian-led lifestyle management added to the usual
medical care provided modest health care cost savings. The proposed program may
increase access to nutrition care and disease management adherence while
decreasing health care costs. Ultimately, the proposed technology may empower
people to manage their chronic disease nutritionally so that they feel their
best every day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the
development of a data-driven software program with a collection of culinary
medicine and nutrition education videos for chronic illnesses that also assists
patients with goalsetting, self-monitoring progress, and provides feedback on
behavioral goals. Developed by registered dietitians with over 30 years of
combined clinical experience and a culinary educator with over 10 years of
industry experience, the proposed technology is a program designed to support
people with chronic and acute conditions in improving their diet quality and
overall health. When patients have access to nutrition services their outcomes
(laboratory tests, weight, blood pressure) improve. Thus, having a way to help
patients manage chronic disease nutritionally by showing them what to eat, how
to prepare it, and giving them on-demand access to nutrition information may
benefit those involved with health, fitness, and chronic disease management. The
software may be personalized with an interactive capability to tailor recipes
and meal plans for each personâ€™s level of readiness and confidence to help them
set goals and reach them. The proposed technology may give patients convenient
access to nutrition services, and this could result in positive outcomes in
several types of disease management.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
