The PI will study how combinatorial structure of partially ordered sets (posets)
gives information about associated algebraic and topological structures.
Specifically, she seeks ways to use the combinatorics of a face poset or closure
poset together with limited topological information (e.g. information about
codimension one cell incidences) to determine topological information such as
rational homology or even in some cases homeomorphism type. A main goal is to
prove that various stratified spaces whose closure posets are thin and shellable
are in fact regular CW complexes. She also aims to construct boundary maps on
important classes of posets such as geometric lattices, motivated by potential
applications e.g. in theoretical computer science. She will also study
representations of simple Lie algebras via an analysis of local structure within
the poset that indicates which weight space generators appear with nonzero
coefficient upon application of a raising or lowering operator to other weight
space generators.

In computer science, there is a strong interest both in finding effective
algorithms when this is possible, and also in understanding when this is not
theoretically possible. It is often difficult to know how to even begin to
obtain these impossibility results, but topology combined with combinatorics
does have the potential to yield such results, and there have been some striking
successes in the past. One of the proposed projects is somewhat in this vein --
to prove impossibility results for the question of which graphs (i.e. which
models for networks of computers) admit data sorting algorithms by greedily
swapping pieces of neighboring data that are out of order. In another direction,
geometric structures such as the Schubert varieties of representation
theory/algebraic geometry often have combinatorial data associated to them which
is organized into what is called a partially ordered set. Much is known about
how properties of the geometric structure force properties on the partially
ordered set. The PI seeks a better understanding of how much can be said in the
other direction, perhaps allowing some manageable extra data such as information
about how edges are attached to 2-dimensional faces, how 2-dimensional faces are
attached to 3-dimensional faces, and so on. This could have applications to
finding new ways of figuring out what very complicated, high-dimensional
geometric objects look like. In addition to continuing to mentor students and
run seminars, the PI will also continue organizing conferences designed to
foster fruitful new interactions and collaborations between those working in
topological combinatorics and in related areas such as combinatorial
representation theory and combinatorial commutative algebra.
