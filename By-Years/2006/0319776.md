This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to develop
microbially enhanced plant protein to replace fishmeal in aquaculture feeds.
Environmental issues and commercial constraints make substituting plant protein
for fishmeal a long standing goal of the aquaculture industry. Non-nutritive
carbohydrates in soybeans represent a particularly difficult technical challenge
in using microbial treatment to enhance soy protein. To address this challenge,
this project proposes to combine innovations in rapid, multi-criteria strain
isolation and screening, solid substrate culture technology and salmonid diet
formulation. The principle tasks of this Phase I project are to demonstrate
technical feasibility of selecting microbes to meet multiple criteria, to
develop solid substrate culture processes, and to incorporate enhanced soy into
trout diets.

The commercial application of this project is in the area of aquaculture. A
plant protein meeting requirements of the domestic trout industry and government
hatcheries could find immediate commercial application in displacing
approximately 25,000 tons of fishmeal. Worldwide aquaculture is forecast to
consume about 2.8 million tons of fishmeal in the year 2010 with commercial
value in excess of $1.5 billion. An enhanced plant protein could capture a
significant share of this market.
