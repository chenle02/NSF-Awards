The work will continue to develop the algorithm of the LOQO interior point code
for general continuous mathematical programming problems, and expand the range
of problems to which it can be applied. Areas of research include better
detection of infeasibility and unboundedness, better detection of linear
dependence of the constraints, and better estimates of initial estimates to the
optimum point. Work on higher order methods, which can greatly improve
algorithmic efficiency, will be continued, with particular interest in applying
filter methods. In an attempt to expand the scope of the types of problems that
the algorithm can solve, the research will be concerned with solving discrete
problems using interior point methods. On type of problem considered will be
mixed integer quadratic programming. Problems of this type commonly arise in
finance. Mixed integer linear programming problems will also be studied, with an
initial focus on quickly finding feasible solutions. Further work will be
concerned with general complementarity problems, especially those that arise in
economics and engineering. In all cases, appropriate collections of problems
arising from real applications will be modeled in AMPL. These will be made
available via the internet, as will extensions to the LOQO program.

The LOQO code for solving a variety of types of mathematical programming
problems has been under development for the past four years as a joint research
effort of the principal investigator and Professor Robert Vanderbei of Princeton
University. The code is made freely available via the internet, and to date has
been downloaded several thousand times. It is used to solve problems as diverse
as engineering design, portfolio optimization, airline scheduling problems, and
is currently being adapted for various projects in medical research. The
proposed research is concentrated both on improving the efficiency of the code
and increasing the set of problems for which the code can be used. The new types
of problems for which it is hoped the code can be adapted efficiently are
problems with variables that must be an integer, generally 0 or 1. These
problems are extremely common, and of great practical value. For example, when
assigning aircraft to routes, a whole plane must be assigned to a specific
route, not some fraction of a plane. Including integer variables within the
context an algorithm of this type is very new, and will be approached initially
through important specific applications.
