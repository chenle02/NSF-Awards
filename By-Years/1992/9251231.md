The Deparment of Chemistry is acquiring a Fourier transform infrared
spectrophotometer for use throughout the undergraduate curriculum, including
senior research projects. Students in organic chemistry are using the instrument
to study the kinetics of esterification reactions, hydrogen bonding as a
function of molecular structure and concentration, while those in advanced
laboratories investigate the composition of commercial polymers and bonding
parameters in small, gaseous molecules.
