Using SEEP II water column data and sedimentary trap samples, the PI's will
address specific questions regarding planktonic production, mortality and
downslope transport in the Slope environment. These trap samples were collected
before, during and after major mesoscale hydrographic events such ad outbreaks
of costal water and intrusion of warm-core rings. The working hypothesis is that
much of the material that collects on the slope is advected there from shelf
water.
