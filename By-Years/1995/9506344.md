Dissertation Improvement Research: Paleo-Environmental Change in Mainland
Southeast Asia: Palynological Evidence From Cambodia theoretical questions
involving climatic and human impacts have not had the benefit of data from
southeast Asia. In this study field work consisting of coring and vegetation
surveys will be conducted in Ratanakiri Province, Cambodia. Pollen and charcoal
analysis of sediment cores taken from volcanic lakes in the northeastern
Cambodia will provide the first paleoecological data from the region. The study
sites will furnish long, high-resolution records of vegetation change from a
previously neglected area. The inferences drawn from the research will help to
refine regional- and global-scale circulation models.
