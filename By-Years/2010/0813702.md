This empirical study examines the variety of materials used and the myriad of
teaching strategies employed by U.S. high school mathematics teachers in their
effort to prepare students for later success in college calculus, a requirement
for most STEM majors. Designed as a retrospective cohort study, we use 12,000
college calculus students' histories to predict performance while controlling
for demographic differences. This study has the capability to both reveal the
most promising educational practices in mathematics, including technological
innovations, and to assess the degree of match between high school math and
college calculus courses, both traditional and reform based.
