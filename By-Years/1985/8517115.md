In any design, the information upon which the design is based is uncertain due
to biases, random errors, large variances, missing data, and other factors that
cannot be controlled. In process design, these uncertainties are often ignored
or treated deterministically. Various strategies have been proposed for
estimating and rectifying the data. Among these strategies are statistical
techniques such as least squares and maximum likelihood, optimization techniques
such as linear programming and Lagrange multipliers, and filtering techniques.
All of these techniques focus on the data itself rather than on the use of the
data within the design process. A new approach to data reconciliation is
developed using influence methods and interval analysis to eliminate gross and
systematic errors in the data and to reconcile the remaining data. This new
methodology will enhance the quality of the data available to the designer. The
research will result in algorithms and computer programs that will be applicable
in a number of disciplines.
