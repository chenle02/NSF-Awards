This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will define technologies
to successfully recover painted plastic automobile parts from end-of-life
vehicles. 400 million pounds of plastic is consumed annually to produce
automotive exterior parts. These parts are typically large and readily
identifiable and could be recovered from automobile salvage yards yet they
continue to be disposed of in landfills. This project will evaluate the quality
of plastic from parts recovered from automobile salvage operations from various
regions of the country and develop a process to remove paint and economically
recycle the plastic back into many of the original automotive applications.

The automotive industry uses approximately 425 million pounds of thermoplastic
polyolefins annually on vehicles produced in North America. Success of this work
will allow the U.S. automobile industry to enhance its competitiveness when
faced with mandates for minimum recycle-content materials.
