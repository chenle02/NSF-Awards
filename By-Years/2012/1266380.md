Dmitrii E. Makarov is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and
Computational Methods program in the Chemistry division to develop and employ
computer simulations and theory to study the coupling between mechanical and
chemical phenomena in biological and synthetic molecular systems. The research
focuses on rational design of novel mechano-sensitive molecular systems,
characterization of multidimensional free energy landscapes of mechanically
stressed biomolecules, and theory of dissipative phenomena in proteins. The
award is cofunded by the Condensed Matter and Materials Theory program in the
Division of Materials Research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research
advances our understanding of the interplay between mechanical and chemical
forces in living organisms, which accounts for structural integrity of tissues
and bone, enables organisms' defense against various diseases and lies at the
heart of many vital biological phenomena. It may further impact bottom-up design
of novel polymeric and bio-polymeric materials with unique mechanical
properties.
