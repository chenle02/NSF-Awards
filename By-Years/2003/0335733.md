The goal of this project is to recruit more highly qualified individuals into
careers in mathematics and science teaching. In particular, the program recruits
individuals having undergraduate degrees (or higher) in mathematics or science
and who are planning to change career paths into the field of teaching. The goal
is to triple the number of grades 5-12 mathematics and science teachers prepared
at the University of Missouri-Columbia (MU). The Robert Noyce scholarships
facilitate reaching that target through recruitment of highly qualified
individuals into the post-baccalaureate alternative certification programs.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project rests on the
commitment of partners to advance knowledge concerning recruiting, preparing,
and retaining more highly qualified science and mathematics teachers. The
broader impact of the project is the increase in highly qualified teachers of
mathematics and science teachers for Missouri schools, as well as the potential
of the program to build new models and strategies for meeting the teacher
shortage that will inform other states experiencing similar problems.
