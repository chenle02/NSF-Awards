ABSTRACT The objective of this research program is to study and develop an
improved guided wave phase tuning technique and its practical applications to
nondestructive evaluation (NOE) for inspecting thin and slender members in
civil, mechanical and aerospace structures. An extended study of a novel method
referred to as "synthetic phase tuning" (SPT) is being developed through this
project, which could resolve many critical problems associated with guided waves
by eliminating the complexities due to their multimodal and dispersive nature.
The innovative concept of the SPT is to reinforce a specific wave mode of
interest while suppressing or squelching undesired wave modes by constructing a
phase-tuned wave in a virtual domain. This operational scheme may allow for
extremely flexible guided wave pulse-echo operations with excellent spatial and
temporal resolutions. The program is to understand the phase-tuning mechanisms
and to study the wave-material (structure) interactions using various analytical
and numerical methods. Various influencing factors such as the characteristics
of spatio-temporalloading and transducer parameters, e.g., element width, number
of elements, inter-element spacing, operating frequency, are investigated both
theoretically and experimentally. In addition, the SPT scheme is extended using
the laser- ultrasound techniques in order to relax the current limitations of
narrow signal bandwidth. The concept of SPT may have a substantial and direct
impact not only on scientific and technological advancements in the field of
NOE, condition assessment, and health monitoring, but also on the industrial
sectors in NOE manufacturing and services. Although the focus is specifically on
NOE, the method does not preclude extensions to a broad spectrum of disciplinary
fields such as communication, geophysical explorations, structural control, and
MEMS.
