This project is jointly funded by the Major Research Instrumentation and the
Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) programs. The
project funds construction of DataMountain, a massive database cluster for high
performance computing at the University of Vermont (UVM). The large-memory
machine will enhance the Vermont Advanced Computing Core, a virtual laboratory
supporting the research of over 500 scientists in the state of Vermont. With so
many fields transitioning from data-scarce to data-rich environments, many
important research areas will benefit from this new machine including research
into addiction, mental illness, climate change, drug discovery, food systems,
and the spread of online misinformation. DataMountain will allow for fast access
to enormous datasets, supporting several projects that require computational
power and speed to effectively analyze, describe, and explain rapidly growing
datasets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DataMountain will increase by nearly two orders
of magnitude the largest random access memory machine available for
computational research at UVM, accelerating large-scale data-driven research
requiring rapid reading and writing, and facilitating a broad and diverse set of
important scientific investigations not currently possible given the existing
hardware. It will also enhance the functionality of the high performance
computing clusters BlueMoon and DeepGreen, which are dedicated to parallel
processing and machine learning respectively. For example, the machine will
allow for interactive access to over 50 terabytes of social media data through
http://storywrangling.org and http://hedonometer.org for timely analysis of
changes related to the COVID-19 pandemic in population-scale physical and mental
health data. In addition, DataMountain will allow for massive increases in the
spatial and temporal resolution of computational chemistry simulations being
performed for data-driven design of next-generation antimicrobial peptides to
combat antibiotic resistance. DataMountain will also enable exploration of
petabytes of fMRI, genetic, task performance, and survey data associated with
10,000 adolescents across the United States over the next decade. In addition,
the machine will accelerate research using unmanned aerial surveillance imaging
for tree canopy assessments, facilitate network science modeling of agricultural
diversity of crops and nutritional outcomes globally, and help quantify the
impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on food insecurity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
