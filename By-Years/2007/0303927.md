Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Debonding and fracture of ultra-thin (2
to 20 nm) films deposited on substrates (such as silicon) is an important
problem in the manufacture of micro-electronic components. Internal stresses are
developed in the thin films during their deposition, because there is a
molecular mismatch at the interface between the thin film and its substrate.
These stresses can result in both debonding (separation of the thin film from
the substrate) and fracture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Traditional studies of stress-
deformation behavior involve large material samples. The resulting descriptions
of behavior assume that the material extends to ``infinity'' (perhaps 50 nm) in
all directions. But within the immediate neighborhood of a phase interface, the
material is subjected to long-range intermolecular forces from the adjoining
phase, and the observed material behavior is
different.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposed herein is a novel extension of
continuum mechanics to the near molecular scale to treat nanoscale fracturing
and debonding phenomena. This theory employs known bulk material behavior
outside an interfacial region and corrects this bulk material description within
the interfacial region through the introduction of a body force (mutual force)
that accounts for the difference in intermolecular forces when a portion of the
material is replaced by an adjoinging phase. It is conjectured that this theory
can provide a means to incorporate nanoscale modeling at a crack tip into
macroscale fracture problems in order to predict fracture initiation and
propagation from first priciples without (or with minimal) empirical parameter
fitting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
