The project will focus on investigations into the largely unexplored subset of
coherent echo returns from the polar and auroral E-region plasma waves observed
with the first U.S. Antarctic high-frequency ionospheric radar deployed at
McMurdo in early 2010 in conjunction with other Antarctic and high northern
hemisphere radars within the SuperDARN international program. Recent body of
work on auroral E-region irregularities exploring SuperDARN as a global array
has clearly demonstrated importance of the aspect angle or, equivalently,
magnetic inclination angle conditions for both occurrence and phase velocity of
E-region radar aurora. Initial observations by the McMurdo radar show abundance
of short-range echoes with properties very similar to auroral E-region echoes
but at locations with very high geometric aspect angles. The project's research
will address a fundamental question of why E-region echoes from the polar cap
are observed at all by the McMurdo radar. These investigations will include
further examination of the previously found auroral echoes with unusual
properties, e.g., velocities greatly exceeding nominal ion-acoustic speed and
independent of the plasma flow angle. They will also evaluate the extent of
magnetic conjugacy of the E-region radar aurora and establish the relationship
between E-region irregularities and plasma drift velocities. This research will
be led by a new young PI and will also contribute to the training and education
of a graduate student.
