In this project funded by the Chemical Catalysis program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor Alexander Radosevich of The Pennsylvania State University is
investigating inexpensive nonmetal compounds for hydrogen transfer catalysis.
Geometrically distorted tricoordinate phosphorus compounds are prepared and
evaluated for transfer hydrogenation catalysis via pentacoordinate
dihydridophosphorane intermediates. The research involves an investigation of
the mechanistic factors that permit hydrogen transfer reactivity with
phosphorus-based catalysts and an assessment of the molecular and electronic
design principles required to develop efficient nonmetal catalysts for valuable
synthetic transformations. In conjunction with local partners, outreach efforts
to promote active participation in science by K-12 students are being pursued
including a summer research curriculum for high school students from underserved
populations, and a chemistry-focused, interactive children's museum exhibit for
young learners. The broader impacts of this work include potential benefits from
the discovery of catalysts from less toxic, earth abundant elements as well as
the introduction of students to active learning in science through non-classroom
activities.

Catalysts enable the preparation of medicines, materials and fuels in a
scalable, economical, and environmentally responsible manner. This project
focuses on the discovery of a new class of catalysts based on lightweight,
inexpensive, and abundant nonmetal elements. The potential broader societal
benefits include the production of chemicals and materials free of residual
metals and in a sustainable manner.
