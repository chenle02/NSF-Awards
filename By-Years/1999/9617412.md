Abstract 9617412 Besson Electromagnetic radiation (light, x-rays, gamma rays,
etc.) cannot escape from inside the most active regions of the universe, for
instance from the nuclei of galaxies, nor can the highest energy gamma rays even
propagate through intergalactic space because they will be absorbed by the
cosmic background infrared photons. Neutrinos, however, can traverse a
considerable amount of material unimpeded, and if they can be detected in such a
way that their arrival direction and energy can be determined, they can be used
to study high density regions and highest energy events of the cosmos. When an
electron type neutrino does interact in a dielectric medium (such as the deep
glacial ice beneath South Pole) it will produce a shower of electron and
positrons which will rapidly radiate away the energy of the original neutrino as
electromagnetic radiation. The probability of such interactions increases with
increasing energy, so that a detector's sensitivity increases with energy. Thus,
a modest (by neutrino detector standards) sized instrumented volume of ice, say
a 100 meter cube, could have an effective volume of a cubic kilometer, a size
which is deemed necessary to do astronomy. This is a pilot project to determine
the feasibility of the radio detection of neutrino interactions in ice. ***
