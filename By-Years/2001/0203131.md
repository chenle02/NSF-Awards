Dorothy H. Gibson of the University of Louisville (Kentucky) is supported by the
Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry program for research on
cyclical catalytic systems that reduce carbon dioxide to organic compounds that
contain one or two carbon atoms (together with oxygen and hydrogen atoms). A
long-term benefit of such research would be development of efficient cyclical
catalytic systems that could produce fuels from the ubiquitous 'green-house
gas,' carbon dioxide. One main aim of the research is to identify effective
catalysts and catalytic cycles. A second main goal will be to increase
understanding of how such cyclical catalysts function. A main thrust of the
research is to explore the causes and effects of catalytic reactions in which
there are changes in the number of coordination sites (on metal atoms) spanned
by particular ligands ('variable denticity'). Both electrochemical and
photochemical techniques will be employed.

Target reduction products include formic acid, formaldehyde and methanol, and
also glyoxylic acid and glycolic acid. Catalytic species being investigated
include a number of rhenium, rhodium and ruthenium complexes that contain both
bipyridine molecules (as 'electronic reservoirs') and other ligands that have
the ability to change (reversibly) between bidentate and terdentate
configurations. Preliminary results have identified several promising catalytic
systems. A number of examples of putative reaction intermediates have been
prepared and characterized.
