The physics department at the University of Puget Sound will purchase
temperature-control circulators, chart recorders, and a freezer to enable
students to perform advanced laboratory experiments and projects in several
areas of fluid mechanics. They will carry out experiments in such areas as the
physical properties of fluids, the transition to chaos in convecting systems,
and the unstable convection which is set up as sea water freezes. In addition to
experiments for the upper-division laboratory, the fluids lab will involve two
or three students each year in independent study projects which are required for
the B.S. in Physics.
