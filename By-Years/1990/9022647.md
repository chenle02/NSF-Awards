The spectroscopy of molecular ions is studied (1) to obtain quantum mechanical
information on the fundamental species, in particular on their intramolecular
dynamics, (2) to provide astronomers with laboratory spectra for their searches
in space, and (3) to study chemistry and physics of laboratory plasmas. Current
objectives include: extending spectroscopic measurements on H3+; searching for
H3+ in Saturn and Uranus, and for other ionic spectra in Jupiter; carrying out
spectroscopy and analysis of carbo-ions (CH5+, CH4+, CH3+ etc); studying proton
tunneling in C2 H3+ and CH5; and developing double resonance ion spectroscopy in
molecular systems.
