This research project involves a modeling study of NOx production by intracloud
lighting and its subsequent variability in time and space using the Storm
Electrification Model (SEM) developed at South Dakota School of Mines and
Technology. The SEM is unique in its features as it pertains to studies of cloud
dynamics and microphysics, as well as cloud electrical development, including a
parameterization of the production of lightning. The study will include four
steps. First, NO will be treated as an inert gas and a vertical profile will be
considered. The NO transport within the context of cloud evolution will be
evaluated and used later on to sort out lightning enhancement of NO
concentration. Second, NO production by lightning will be simulated using ideas
of Borucki and Chameides (1984), without any reactive chemistry. Several
parameter studies will be performed in order to find answers to questions such
as: how lightning-produced NO is transported within the cloud, where the maximum
NOx concentration would most probably be located within the cloud, and how
lightning location influences the NOx distribution within the cloud. The third
step will include chemistry that leads to the production of NO2 following the
initial production of NO by lightning. The last step includes reactions of NO
with peroxy radicals. This will be the first study that investigates the
production by lightning and subsequent distribution of NOx using a sophisticated
dynamical electrical model of thunderclouds.
