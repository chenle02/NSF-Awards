The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP)
through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and
study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the
preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue
science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or
careers. The project at Texas Southern University seeks to strengthen the
university's ability to recruit, retain, and graduate underrepresented students
in STEM by adding an Environmental Science (ES) minor to the existing degree
programs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary goal of the project is to create a
new Environmental Science (ES) minor program for STEM undergraduate students to
gain an overview and applied knowledge of environmental issues. Following the
completion of 21 semester credit hours (5 core courses and 2 elective courses),
students will be eligible to earn a minor in ES. With interdisciplinary
collaboration of multiple STEM departments (biology, chemistry, and civil
engineering), the new ES minor program has the potential to improve the
readiness of African American STEM undergraduate students in securing
professional employment and/or pursuing graduate degrees in ES and related
fields. Effects of the ES Minor Program on improvement of self-confidence in
career readiness and self-efficacy in career decision-making will be assessed
using surveys and focus group discussion. Knowledge, results, and outcomes of
this project will be disseminated through a variety of venues, such as
conferences, workshops, Internet, newsletters, handbooks, and journal
publications to share the findings across various stakeholder
groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
