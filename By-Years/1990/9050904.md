The department is creating a fully equipped classroom/laboratory to teach
Demography to relatively large undergraduate classes. To be truly effective,
lectures must be followed by "hands on" laboratory experiences. The state of
computer and software development makes such an experience technically feasible
in the field of demography. Recent developments in the Macintosh environment, to
which the department has committed its computer development, are promising. The
faculty have been actively involved in developing computer applications for
instruction, but have been previously limited by the lack of facilities to
implement that instruction outside of courses, except for a very few students.
This facility is helping the department to broaden the audience. The university
will contribute an amount equal to the award.
