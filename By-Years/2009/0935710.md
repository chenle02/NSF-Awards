Thousands of small mill dams were constructed in the Great Lakes region during
the 1800's. The ecological communities above and below these dams become quite
different. Public safety concerns now require removal of many dams and open a
migration corridor that can change ecological interactions. This project focuses
on a recent dam and reservoir removal in Big Spring Creek near Briggsville,
Wisconsin. The upstream community contains a typical cold water fish assemblage
dominated by brook trout, sticklebacks, sculpins and creek chubs. The reach
below the dam is dominated by a typical warm water assemblage--largemouth bass,
bluegill, yellow perch and white suckers. Monitoring seasonal changes in water
temperature, fish community structure and food web structure will test the
alternative outcomes posed in two questions: 1. Will the colder water displace
the warm water fishes and allow the cold water assemblage to expand downstream?
2. Will the dam removal allow upstream invasion by large predators (bass) and
competitors (suckers) that can reduce and displace the coldwater fish community?

More that 400 small dams are scheduled for removal in Wisconsin during the
current decade. Public interest in outcomes is always high. Results of this
study will offer guidance and expectation of the ecological changes that result
from similar dam removals. This project will provide support to a graduate
student plus four undergraduate hourly employees. It will also serve as a
demonstration site for the Ecology of Fishes class (48 students) at UW-Madison.
