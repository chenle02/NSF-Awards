The aim of this project is to acquaint the engineering student with modern
methods used in the acquisition of experimental data and in the automatic
control of experimental events or industrial processes. The specific goals are:
to introduce modern data acquisition techniques in a undergraduate fluid
mechanics and heat transfer laboratories and to facilitate real-time computer
analysis of experimental data. To accomplish these goals, the following
instrumentation is being sought: an Automatic Data Acquisition System (ADAS),
various sensors and transducers to interface with the ADAS, a printer and
plotter for outputing the data, and equipment to construct a pressure transducer
calibration system. The project is important for the following reasons: by
streamlining the analysis of experimental data, the exposition of the
fundamental physical principles of fluid flow and heat transfer will be enhanced
for engineering students, opportunities for creative undergraduate student
projects/research with subsonic and supersonic windtunnels will be broadened and
the engineering student will be trained in the use of the ADAS by generating
computer software for analyzing and presenting experimental data acquired in
various fluid flow phenomena.
