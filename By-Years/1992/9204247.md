Polynomial splines and their tensor products ar natural building blocks for
constructing finite-dimensional estimates of infinite-dimensional main effects
and low-order interactions; and the resulting analysis of variance
decompositions provide an insightful tool for data analysis. The corresponding
theory, methodology and software will be developed in a variety of settings,
including regressions with application to time series and stochastic processes,
logistic regression, Poisson regres- sion, proportional hazards modeling and
modeling of multivariate and conditional distributions. Theoretical results will
focus on rates of convergence, both locally and in various global norms.
Methodology will be highly adaptive and computationally inten- sive. The overall
goal of this research is to develop, justify, explain and make available a
systematic extension of generalized linear models used by many scientists in
drawing inferences from their data. Expanding the kinds of models to include
multi- variate data that includes both continuous variables and variables with
only a few possible values should make this methodology still more broadly
useful.
