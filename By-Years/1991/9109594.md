This proposal examines the gap between what how well weather forecasters are
expected to use additional information and how well they actually use it. The
proposal specifically examines how that gap widens as a function of the amount
and complexity of new information. The first study examines the effects on
judgemental reliability and validity of automating information acquisition and
information processing. The second study examines the validity and reliability
of informatyion acquisition as a function of amount of information. The third
study focusses on the reliability and validity of information processing. The
fourth study investigates the interaction between information acquisition and
information processing as a function of amount of information. The results of
this research will contribute to our understanding of expert judgement in
weather forecasting and other fields. It should have practical implications for
helping experts make the best use of technology that increases the amount of
information available to them.
