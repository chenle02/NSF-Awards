Research in neutrino oscillations and neutrino scattering and reactions will be
carried out at Los Alamos using LAMPF beam stops as a source of neutrinos.
Louisiana Tech will have responsibility for developing beam line monitoring
equipment so that neutrino events in the LSND detector can be correlated with
the time structure of the primary proton beam. Time-of-flight information will
be used to reduce backgrounds and rule out other competing processes. The group
will participate in all phases of the experiment, from design of hardware, to
data acquisition, to data analysis. //
