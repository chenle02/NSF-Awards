Stochastic Analysis will be utilized in order to further understand questions
such as utility maximization in incomplete markets, equilibrium prices in a
consumption based capital asset pricing model, optimal portfolios, consumption
optimization, and transaction costs. This project should result in technical
formulations leading to a more scientific management of financial decisions.
