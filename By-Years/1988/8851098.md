This project is a National Science Foundation and National Bureau of Standards
outreach program for faculty of minority institutions. The proposed conference
presents an opportunity for NSF to acquaint 40-50 faculty members from minority
institutions with relevant NSF program and NSF in general. It also provides an
opportunity for NSF program officers to identify key people at minority
institutions who can facilitate the identification of potential reviewers and
who can identify researchers and encourage participation in NSF programs. The
strengths of the proposal are that (1) prior conferences have been judged useful
to the National Bureau of Standards, (2) joint sponsorship will significantly
reduce the costs for all sponsoring agencies and programs, (3) this form of
activity moves beyond passive approaches of individual programs and acts as a
catalyst for the whole Foundation.
