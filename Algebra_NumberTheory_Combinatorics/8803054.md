The principal investigator will continue studying the basic global theory of
the fundamental class of a flat morphism of finite type over a fixed finite
dimensional base scheme and its relation to the local theory as expressed via
residues and traces of differential forms and Hochschild homology. An attempt
will be made to organize the results within a bivariant theory. Arapura will
study DuBois singularities. He will study them by considering the problem of
showing that rational singularities are DuBois. This project is in the area of
algebraic geometry. Lipman will work on formulating the Grothendieck theory in a
useful way. Arapura will work on singularities in algebraic varieties, those
places in the varieties that are geometrically cusps, creases and so forth.
