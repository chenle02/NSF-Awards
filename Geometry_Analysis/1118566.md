Dr. Jie Qing proposes to organize a summer program on Mathematical Relativity at
the Beijing International Center for Mathematical Research in Beijing in June
2011. Mathematical research of general relativity is a significant and active
part of mathematics. In fact it becomes increasingly a major source of
inspirations for mathematical researches in the fields of differential geometry
and differential equations.

The proposed summer program will host one week research conference and invite
four experts in the field to teach mini-courses in the rest two weeks. The
proposed program is inviting many graduate students and young people in the
field both from China and US. The proposed program will provide international
travel to the participants, particularly, students or young researchers, from
US.
