ABSTRACT

This award will fund travel and local expenses of ten invited speakers and 12
junior researchers to attend a workshop on "From Global Prediction to Local
Action," at the Joint Math Meetings in San Diego, Jan. 2008. The workshop is
part of a larger initiative to engage the mathematics community in climate
change research and training. The workshop features two minisymposia and
discussions in break-out groups, and is programmed around the SIAM Invited
Address, which will be given by Professor Inez Fung, Professor of Atmospheric
Science and Co-Director Berkeley Institute of the Environment, UC Berkeley. The
Organizing Committee consists of M. L. Zeeman (Bowdoin College and Cornell
University), I. Fung (University of California, Berkeley), and C. Jones
(University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and University of Warwick). A
report summarizing the workshop proceedings will be disseminated via the
Internet.
