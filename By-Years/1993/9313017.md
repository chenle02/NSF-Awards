9313017 Sultan Technical Narrative: This project represents a collaborative
research effort between Washington University and the Egyptian Geological Survey
in Cairo, Egypt. The investigators intend to use field mapping, remote sensing,
and high precision U-Pb dating techniques in order to advance our knowledge of
the geologic history of southern Egypt. This study will have implications for
the understanding of the continental evolution of Africa. Project funding will
allow the researchers to conduct geochronologic and isotopic investigations in
southern Egypt as well as enable an Egyptian geologist to visit the state-of-
the-art laboratory facilities at Washington University in order to receive
advanced training in remote sensing interpretation and modern isotopic dating
techniques. This project in petrology and geochemistry fulfills the program
objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the
United States and Egypt to combine complementary talents and conduct research in
areas of strong mutual interest and competence. ***
