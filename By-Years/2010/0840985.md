Scientists have postulated the existence of a widespread community of
microorganisms living at high temperatures kilometers below the Earth's surface,
supported by geological energy sources. The purpose of this Research
Coordination Network is to foster a growing, dynamic, and predominantly young
community of scientists studying life that exists in the dark, deep marine
biosphere. The ramifications of this subsurface hidden biosphere are numerous
and may lead to paradigm shifts in the biosciences and geosciences. To date,
deep biosphere studies have focused on microbes in relatively shallow marine
sediments or in terrestrial mines, wells, and drill-core samples. However, these
data do not permit a true global census of subsurface life. The largest
potential subsurface biome is also the least accessible: the deep ocean
subsurface. This biome also has importance for global-scale biogeochemical
processes, including the carbon, energy, and nutrient cycles. Depending on
geothermal gradients and physico-chemical limits of life, the subsurface
biosphere may extend to a depth of 5-10 km, or more, and occupy a volume several
orders of magnitude greater than the continental biosphere.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The RCN will develop coordinate science activities in the
community of deep-biosphere researchers. It will also promote education among
several disciplines that contribute to the research through interlaboratory
exchanges for students in this field. The RCN will meet these goals through
meetings, workshops, student exchanges, and a web site. Additional activities
for outreach include newsletters, web sites for information on tools and
techniques, and special sessions at scientific meetings. The RCN will establish
a research institute named DEBI (Dark Energy Biosphere Institute) that will
foster the growth of research into the deep biosphere.&lt;br/&gt;
