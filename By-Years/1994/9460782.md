Physical Optics Corporation proposes a new real-time true 3D (volumetric)
display, based on switchable binary optical elements (SBOEs). Here, a 2D array
of surface printed binary optical elements (BOEs) are coated with a rapidly
switchable liquid crystal layer covering the entire BOE array. A stack of such
arrays form the volume medium of the display. Each BOE, which forms a volume
pixel (voxel) element, can be rapidly switched on and off, while a 3 color (RGB)
low power laser beam is scanned across the display volume. When in an unswitched
state, the medium will be transparent, while in a switched state, the scanning
laser beam will be diffracted into a cone shape from the switched voxel
elements. In order to produce a 3D image, the scanned laser beam is modulated
while scanned over the BOE plane, which is sequentially switched over the whole
stack. Using a fast switching Ferroelectric liquid crystal and acoustic optic
modulators and beam deflectors, a real-time, flicker-free 3D volume display can
be achieved without any moving parts. This research will investigate the
feasibility of the proposed concept and lay the groundwork for the development
of a unique volumetric 3D display for commercial applications.
