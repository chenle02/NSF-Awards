This award provides funding for US participation in the conference that will be
held during the entire month of March 2019, at the Centre de Recherches
Mathematiques(CRM) in Montreal, Canada. The conference focuses on recent
developments in Free Probability Theory, which is deeply related to topics in
several areas of Analysis, including Operator Algebras and Random Matrices, and
also to other areas of mathematics such as Combinatorics. Free Probability was
created in the 1980s by Dan Voiculescu. His fundamental insight was to treat
phenomenon in operator algebras related to free groups in a noncommutative
probabilistic framework, with his notion of freeness taking the place of
independence. Free Probability Theory has developed extensively; the parallels
with usual probability theory are quite far reaching. This has led to
fundamental insights and far reaching developments in diverse areas, including
Operator Algebras and Random Matrices. The program at CRM includes two
workshops, one on theoretical aspects and another on applied aspects of Free
Probability. A number of distinguished mathematicians have agreed to attend and
speak at this conference. This award gives early career researchers, members of
underrepresented groups, researchers not funded by NSF and the like an
opportunity to attend and participate in this conference. The organizing
committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to target groups
through a number of different activities. More information is available at:

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
