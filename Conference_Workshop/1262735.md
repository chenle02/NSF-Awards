This award provides support for US-based Ph.D. student participation in the Gene
Golub SIAM Summer School, which will coincide with the International Summer
School on Numerical Linear Algebra (ISSNLA) on July 22 - August 2, 2013 at Fudan
University in Shanghai, China. The conference encourages and financially
supports participation by members of groups underrepresented in mathematics.

The meeting includes invited lectures on topics of current research interest in
computatonal mathematics. The conference brings together workers in a variety of
different areas of research in numerical linear algebra, with emphasis on
preparing Ph.D. students for useful and engaging research careers. Allocation of
the funds will be based on scientific merit, financial need, and diversity, with
an emphasis on participation by members of underrepresented groups.
