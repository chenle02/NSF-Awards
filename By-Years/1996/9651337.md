This project provides funds to introduce computer-based data acquisition
systems into the physiology-intensive laboratory curricula designed for life and
health science premajors. The project incorporates Power Macintosh computers
connected to MacLab 2- and 4-channel signal interfaces for data collection, data
analysis, and report writing into the structural design of the experimental
methods of six laboratories. Eight student workstations are being developed in
one of the four teaching laboratories. Each station includes a Macintosh
computer connected to a MacLab interface unit that accepts and conditions
signals from compatible physiological sensors and transducers. Computer
acquisition of data permits students to make better use of limited and valuable
laboratory time involved in recording data, conducting appropriate statistical
analysis of results, and writing interpretations as they develop their
laboratory skills in preparation for the analytical and diagnostic applications
they will encounter in their upper-division life science or advanced health
specialties.
