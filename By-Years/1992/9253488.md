Research on this grant will be mainly centered in the areas of computation of
combustion processes, numerical fluid dynamics, and turbulence. A key
distinctive feature of the work involves model-free simulation of turbulent
reactive flows, an approach divergent from traditional "closure" approaches to
turbulence analysis. The major thrust of the research is concerned with
development of a basic understanding of turbulent combustion phenomena, with a
study of the pertinent issues as regards eventual application to practical
industrial applications. The overall planned activities can be divided into four
major areas: (1) study of fundamental issues as regards the physics of
turbulence and turbulent combustion; (2) development of advanced computational
tools for industrial use; (3) study of active and passive control of random and
harmonic forcings for enhancement or suppression of mixing in a research
combustor; and, (4) collaborative efforts in modeling of transport of gametes,
spores, and planktonic of larvae of benthic species in turbulent flows. Among
other outputs, this research should provide further insight into shortcomings
associated with existing turbulence models and identify better approaches to
improved (relative to current turbulent closure approaches) techniques for
utilization in practical turbulent combustion modeling, providing guidance as to
what types of approaches are most suitable for various classes of turbulent flow
problems. In addition, the third study listed above has a long-term goal of
establishment of input-output control devices/algorithms for definition and
control of disturbances in practical combustion devices, while the fourth study
is quite important as regards understanding of the dynamics of settlement and
external fertilization in violent water motion and in modeling the ecology of
wave-swept rocky shores.
