This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP) award from the
Research Facilities Office provides funds to Oregon State University for the
renovation and repair of Burt Hall which houses that institution's oceanographic
research and research training activities. This building was constructed in 1965
and has not been renovated since that time. The ARFMP grant of $125,000 and
$125,000 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used to modernize these
research and research training facilities. This project will address the need to
improve the current research infrastructure both in terms of health and safety
and of the quality and quantity of the research and research training that can
be conducted by replacing fume hoods, substandard sinks, and laboratory benches,
and correcting heating and ventilation problems. This award contributes to the
infrastructure of science by providing an improved environment for the conduct
of biological/chemical oceanographic research and for the training of quality
undergraduate and graduate students under conditions freed from the serious
extant environmental hazards.
