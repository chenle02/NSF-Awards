0221194&lt;br/&gt;Ponce&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Pan-American Advanced Studies
Institutes (PASI) award on physics at the nanometer scale, jointly supported by
the NSF and the Department of Energy (DOE), will engage graduate and post-
doctoral students from the hemisphere in an intensive course of 10 days duration
in an area of nanotechnology of much current interest. Organized by Dr. Fernando
Ponce of the Arizona State University and Dr. Carlos Balseiro of the Centro
Atomico de Bariloche, Argentina, the PASI will be held at the Centro Atomico de
Bariloche, June 1-12, 2003 and will feature tutorials and lectures on
nanomagnetism, nanowires and nanotubes, nanoparticles, nanoelectronics and
transport through nanodevices, nano-optoelectronics, nano-fabrication and nano-
characterization, and bio-nanotechnology. In addition, the PASI will include
poster sessions for the presentation of research studies and results by junior
and other participants, in order to foster content-specific interactions. This
intensive exchange should promote future collaborative research with the next
generation of scientists. Expected outcomes are a book, videotapes of the
proceedings, and a web site with at least summaries of the lectures. &lt;br/&gt;
