The objective of this research is to determine the effect of various physical
and chemical factors, such as temperature, water activity and oxidation
reduction potential, on the rates of nonenzymatic browning in complex chemical
systems. Nonenzymatic browning results in loss of protein nutritional quality in
foods and parentenal drugs, off flavor development in foods, production of
mutaqgens, and carcinogens, and has been implicated in cataract formation in the
eyes of diabetics. Presently the only nonenzymatic browning inhibitor is sodium
sulfite whose use is limited because of toxicity. This research might lead to
understanding of factors governing nonenzymatic browning and therefore lead to
methods able to control it without the use of sodium sulfite.
