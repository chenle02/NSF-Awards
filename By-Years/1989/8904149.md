This award provides funds to the University of Colorado at Boulder for the
purpose of acquiring one dozen field receivers for Global Positioning System
(GPS) geodetic surveying. Earth scientists are now using this new satellite
communication technique to solve problems in geodesy, plate tectonics,
earthquake studies and global change. The GPS technique allows surveying
measurements to be made with heretofore unprecedented speed and accuracy.
UNAVCO, a consortium of universities based at the University of Colorado, will
house and maintain the instruments and will coordinate their deployment in the
field for a growing number of scheduled field experiments in the U.S. and
international locations.
