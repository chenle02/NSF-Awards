This prototype project includes several activities to strengthen minority
education from the early grades through the baccalaureate degree. It was
developed under the leadership of the University of St. Louis-Missouri, with
cooperation from Harris-Stowe State College, St. Louis Community College, and
the St. Louis School System. During the first year of operations a set of
activities, based on science and mathematics experiences, and designed to
nurture, encourage and motivate minority students, are being implemented. These
include a College Transition program in which pre-freshman students are provided
with experiences in academic skills development, remedial mathematics, career
related work activities, and assistance in college planning. Activities targeted
at the precollege level include junior high school science and engineering clubs
which meet for field trips during the academic year and for a four-week workshop
during the summer. A high school Science and Math Academy meets for five weeks
in the summer at which academic courses in science and mathematics, tutoring,
career counseling and college planning are made available.
