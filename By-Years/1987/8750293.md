A real time computing laboratory will be set up under this project. It will
provide the facilities to support a three hour course for undergraduate
engineering students in the fundamentals of real time computing and control. The
laboratory will consist of a DEC Microvax II used as a software development
station tied by Ethernet to another DEC Microvax II running Labstar real time
software and acting as a controller of various equipment. Among the items to be
controlled include a robot and computer numerically controlled machines. The
system will include the capabilities to support up to twenty users developing
software and then running their software individually through the controller.
