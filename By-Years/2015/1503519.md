The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the
learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM)
by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative
resources, models and tools (RMTs). Projects in the DRK-12 program build on
fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development
efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed
projects. This exploratory research project will examine the relationship
between teacher professional development associated with newly developed modules
in urban ecology and the achievement and engagement of long-term English
learners (LTEL). Participants in the project will include students in grades 4-8
in a large urban school district, elementary school teachers, middle school
science teachers, and middle school teachers of English language arts. Existing
Urban Ecology learning modules will be enhanced to accommodate the needs of
LTELs, and teachers will participate in professional development aimed at using
the new materials to effectively integrate academic science discourse and
literacy development for LTELs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will develop
two enhanced urban ecology modules (47 lessons) for English learners in grades
4-8; science language and literacy assessments for English language learners
(ELLs); an ELL STEM career awareness inventory; an urban ecology for ELLs
teacher knowledge scale, and an urban ecology for ELLs pedagogy observation
protocol. The materials will be tested with a stratified random sample of
students identified by achievement level (low, medium, and high) and linguistic
background (mainstream, LTEL, and "at risk" of becoming LTEL). A mixed-methods
research design will be used to test the hypothesis that the quantity and
quality of LTEL science language and literacy achievement will increase as a
result of teacher participation in implementing the newly developed
transdisciplinary framework for Urban Ecology for English Learners.
