This is a planning grant award under the Research Opportunities for Women
program of NSF. This award will support the PI in developing a regular grant
proposal to study contractual relationships, such as the structure and form of a
marketing distribution channels, within the theoretical framework of transaction
cost theories. Structuring contractual relationships in a distribution channel
involves a managerially relevant problem and provides a fruitful context for
testing and validating transaction cost theory. The planning effort will include
empirical pilot work establishing the feasibility of the proposed research.
