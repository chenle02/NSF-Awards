The subject of this proposal is cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), a wide host-range
plant virus for which there is very little natural resistance available. The
goals of this project are: (1) to localize sequences in the viral genome
involved in the regulation of the rate of replication, and the inhibition of
replication by high temperatures; (2) to determine the underlying mechanisms of
differential replication in plant cells (protoplast) affected by various genetic
alterations; and (3) to determine the regulatory effects of various genetic
alterations on the viral replicase in vitro. These goals will be achieved by
using biologically-active DNA clones of strains of CMV, that show differences in
the regulation various aspects of CMV (and satellite) RNA replication in several
cucurbit hosts. The sequences controlling the various replicate-related
phenotypes will be mapped by recombination and site-directed mutagenesis of the
DNA clones. The specific functions altered by these sequence substitutions will
be determined by analyses of the replication products both in in vitro infected
protoplasts, as well as of the purified viral replicase provided with the
appropriate templates and incubated under the experimental conditions. These
analyses will relate differences in viral protein structure to specific
functions.***//
