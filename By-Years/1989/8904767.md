This project will use the growing revolutionary data source from the global
array of broad-band seismometers to derive detailed seismic velocities through
the upper mantle of tectonically active areas. The analysis technique is one
which has been successfully developed and applied in pioneering earlier studies
by the investigators. The tectonically active areas of the western US and Asia
will be the focus of this study. The precision velocity distribution will be
used as a constraint to models of the driving forces of the distortion of the
crust and upper mantle and, thus, the research is a contribution to the National
Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
