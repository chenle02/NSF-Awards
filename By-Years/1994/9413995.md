9413995 Mason This Academic Research Infrastructure (Instrumentation) program
award is made to provide partial support for the acquisition and modification of
Ultra-High-Speed Photographical Equipment that will enhance existing facilities.
Research in the dynamic deformation and fracture of materials, combustion of
solids and manufacturing lubrication will utilize this equipment. It is
anticipated that the basic understanding developed may eventually lead to
increased rates of productivity in manufacturing problems. ***
