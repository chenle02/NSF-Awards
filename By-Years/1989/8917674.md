This is a special workshop for program development purposes in an important
subject area concerning the structural vulnerability of construction in regions
of low and moderate seismicity. Despite progress in seismic risk and structural
analysis, the mitigation of seismic damage to construction in low and moderate
seismic regions presents a different and difficult problem because of underlying
social/economic and other technological considerations. The workshop will bring
together a group of building professionals and researchers to map out a
technological development strategy for identification of structural
vulnerability and damage mitigation. The workshop is expected to develop a class
list for construction, a list of properties for identification, methods of
measurement, evaluation procedures, and priorities for future R&D efforts
needed. The project will lay out a solid framework to address the urgent
problems of seismic hazard mitigation of construction in low and moderate
seismic regions.
