The physical and chemical behavior of transition metals in hydrothermal and
magma systems depends in a significant way on their speciation (structure and
composition). In hydrothermal systems, the study of metal speciation is
necessary for a thorough understanding of the transport and deposition processes
responsible for hydrothermal ore deposits. In melt systems, metal speciation is
intimately related to melt structure and, therefore, to the physical and
chemical properties of magmas which control processes such as transport and
crystallization. To improve our understanding of such processes in hydrothermal
and magma systems, spectroscopic studies will be carried out of selected
transition metals in aqueous solutions as a function of pH, ionic strength, and
temperature and in silicate melts as a function of temperature and bulk
composition.
