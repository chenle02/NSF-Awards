A four year program is under way to revitalize the calculus course taken by
science, engineering, and mathematics students. The revised curriculum stresses
the modeling and problem solving aspects of calculus and teaches students to use
commercially available symbolic and numerical software to handle the technical
aspects of the subject. The planning, testing, and implementation of the new
curriculum is being done under the guidance of a liaison committee made up of
faculty from the physical sciences, engineering, and mathematics.
