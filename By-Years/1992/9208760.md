Electron-transfer reactions of organic compounds in highly concentrated (1-10 M)
redox solutions are investigated. Extensive use is made of microelectrode
techniques to obtain quantitative transport and kinetics data in solutions
containing molar-level concentrations of electroactive species. Initial studies
focus on several recently identified mass-transport phenomena, including
accelerated transport rates resulting from homogeneous electron-transfer
reactions. In addition to microelectrode techniques, phase-measurement
interference microscopy and quartz-crystal microbalance methods are used to
measure physical parameters of the electrochemical depletion layer. Other
emphases include developing a detailed description of the dependence of
heterogeneous electron-transfer rate constants on concentration and the
investigation of the dependence of coupled chemical reactions (including
catalytic reactions) on local electric fields; electrochemical reduction of
ketones is studied in detail to determine the effects of high electric fields on
reaction selectivity. Commercial electrosynthetic processes are usually run in
highly concentrated solutions since these give a better energy efficiency and
higher throughput than do dilute solutions, but almost all laboratory
electrochemistry is done in dilute solutions where variables are more easily
isolated and interpreted. By creating a fundamental framework for the properties
of concentrated solutions, this work will make feasible a rational scale-up
paradigm for electrochemical processes. This is an award under the joint
