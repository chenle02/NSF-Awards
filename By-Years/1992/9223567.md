Researchers agree that new firm creation is a process, not an event. However,
little is known about the formation stage when individuals first assemble
properties needed to form viable economic entities. By not attending to this
formation stage, researchers risk overlooking characteristics of sub-populations
especially susceptible to early extinction. Women-owned businesses may represent
one such group. The objective of this Research Planning Grant is to determine
how organizations come into existence, and ascertain ways the gestation process
may vary by factors such as gender of the founding entrepreneur. Besides
contributing to theory development, findings from the proposed research have the
potential for impacting public policy regarding the development of women-owned
businesses. Business starts among women far outpace those of men, yet women
seemingly still face significant economic and social barriers. Activities
proposed for the planning grant period will: (a) provide insight into the causal
processes underlying new firm gestation; (b) develop ways to assess those
processes; and (c) resolve methodological issues that currently impede
researchers in studying the formation stage. Principal among the activities is
the analysis of data on entrepreneurs collected during a statewise survey. The
investigator was co-principal investigator on this project. The planning grant
would support further development of this research stream and the investigator's
career development.
