A computer model will be developed under a Phase I SBIR award to predict the
degradation of polymers in service. The model will be based on a successful
model developed for the combustion of coal and will take into account the
chemical reactions occurring as well as rates of heat and mass transport,
temperature dependence of properties, etc. The model will be validated with
literature data.
