This research focuses on the high-level design of a high-speed Prolog computer
architecture. This Prolog machine makes use of potential unification, AND, and
OR parallelism in executing a Prolog program. It also employs hardware parallel
units such as associative memory, multiport registers and stacks, and pipeline
organization to enhance execution speed. The significance of this machine is in
its very high-logic inference speed and its uniqueness in employing large-
capacity associative memory as the data base. This hierarchical design is
employing a software level and RTL-level design using simulation at each level.
