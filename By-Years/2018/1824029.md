This workshop brings together different approaches to studying political
information and the way it is used by partisans on all sides of the political
divide. This will be done by bringing together experts from various fields such
as Communications, Political Science, Social Psychology, etc. These experts have
addressed a number of different aspects of this topic from a variety of
methodological and theoretical points of view. Specifically, they will address
what factors drive politically motivated perceptions? How effective are
correctives to misinformation? The workshop would address these questions by
bringing together experts from different disciplines/sub-disciplines who have
addressed these questions in different ways.

The objectives of the workshop are to structure intellectual change, clarify the
state of the field, prioritize remaining questions, and chart a collaborative
and efficient research agenda going forward. The focus will be on distinguishing
causal paths that impact the interpretations of political information, document
its consequences, and evaluative ways to deal more efficiently with
misinformation.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
