This is a proposal to study the relationship between the intermediate range
order and physical properties of new chalcogenide glasses. Neutron scattering,
nuclear quadrapole resonance spectroscopy, molecular dynamics simulation, and
Raman spectroscopy will be used to map the intermediate as well as the short
range order to the physical properties of these novel materials. The research
will also include the study of the frequency dependence of ionic conductivities
and NMR spin-lattice relaxation times in thioborate glasses. This portion of the
study is aimed to resolve the discrepancy between the activation energies for
conductivity and relaxation. It is envisioned that the information gained
through this research will enable the engineering of properties of new high
technology glasses and amorphous materials.
