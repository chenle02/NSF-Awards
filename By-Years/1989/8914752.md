Dr. Robinson proposes to study the development and expression of polarity in
two systems: the zygotes of the fucoid alga, Pelvetia, and the early somatic
embryos of carrot. He will focus on the ionic and electrical aspects of
polarity, and the interactions of ions with the cytoskeleton. In the case of
Pelvetia, he will use the fluorescent calcium indicator fura 2 to determine the
spatial distribution of calcium ions in the zygote in order to resolve the
controversy over the role of calcium gradients in polar axis development.
Quantitative fluorescence studies, utilizing a video image processing system,
will be carried out to determine the temporal relationships between calcium ion
gradients, actin microfilament asymmetries, microtubule asymmetries and rhizoid
formation. The causal relationships of these will also be explored. Dr.
Robinson's results indicate that polarity in carrot somatic embryos is also
associated with ionic currents and that protons are one component of the
current. He will continue his studies to identify the current-carrying ions and
the relationship of the ionic current to embryonic development and polar auxin
transport. He will use antibodies to the plasma membrane H-ATPase to localize
this protein at both the cellular and tissue level. He will also apply
electrical fields to carrot protoplasts and determine the effects on the timing
and plane of first cell division and the stimulation of embryogenesis. He will
determine the distribution of the H-ATPase of protoplast plasma membranes in
response to applied electrical fields. %%% There is evidence on both sides of
the issue of whether endogenous electrical currents are important for the
establishment of polarity in developing plant embryos. This establishment of
polarity is the first event in formation of an asymmetric pattern in a
previously symmetrical fertilized egg resulting ultimately in the asymmetric
adult organism. This study it to attempt to clarify the involvement of these
currents in this early patterning event.
