A marine reflection survey was conducted over the submarine flanks of Kilauea
and Moana Loa volcanoes, Hawaii, in 1998. Shot data from this survey were
recorded by the permanent on-land seismic array maintained by the Hawaii
Volcanoes Observatory. Raypaths for arrivals over the survey region sample a
large volume of the volcanic edifice and subjacent ocean crust, with densest
coverage at the offshore-onshore transition. These data will be processed and
inverted to obtain a 3D tomographic image of the velocity structure of the
volcano.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
