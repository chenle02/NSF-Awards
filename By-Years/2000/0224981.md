0224981&lt;br/&gt;Hispanic Association of Colleges and
Univesities&lt;br/&gt;Kennedy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hispanic Association of
Colleges and Universities (HACU) is the recipient of an award for summer
internship support. HACU, a national, non-profit organization, has a long and
distinguished record of providing summer internship opportunities through the
organization's National Internship Program (NIP). Through the NIP academically
prepared students throughout the US and Puerto Rico have received quality
internship assignments through various federal government agencies. Students who
participate in the NIP are exposed to various career options in the Federal
sector that serve as a basis in helping them make informed career choices and
solidify career objectives. By partnering with the Federal government, HACU has
been able to successfully place over 3,400 students, representing 30 states and
PR, in summer positions since NIP commenced in 1992. In an effort to continue
its collaboration with HACU, the National Science Foundation, a participating
government agency for the last six years, will offer challenging assignments
that will broaden the exposure of 16 students pursuing careers in science,
technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). Internship opportunities create
an unique opportunity to assist in the fulfillment of two core strategies
related the goals of NSF's mission: developing intellectual capital, and
integrating research and education. As a result the Foundation actively
participates in strengthening the infrastructure to achieve excellence in STEM
education.&lt;br/&gt;
