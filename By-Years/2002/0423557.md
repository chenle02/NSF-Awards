0423557 Xie In this project, a new MEMS-based OCM (u-OCM) imaging system is
proposed. The proposed imaging probe will be only 5 mm in diameter. The fast
scanning (< 1 millisecond) and large z-axis tunable range (~2 mm) of the
employed microlens is enabled by a novel large-vertical-displacement (LVD)
microactuator technique. The following tasks will be pursued: 1) to develop LVD
microactuators with at least 2-mm z-axis travel range; 2) to design and
fabricate LVD micromirrors and microlenses; 3) to package and assemble LVD
micromirrors and microlenses into a fiberoptic imaging probe; and 4) to test the
imaging probe in physical phantoms.
