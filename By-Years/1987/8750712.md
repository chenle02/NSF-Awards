A Fourier Transform infrared (FTIR) spectrophotometer system, with moderately
high resolution and sufficient computer power to allow sophisticated data
analysis, has recently been acquired by the Chemistry Department of Grinnell
College. A spectral data base and an attenuated total reflectance sampling
accessory are integral parts of the system. A major impact of this acquisition
is in the Instrumental Analysis course where extensive data manipulation, data
base searching, quantitative analysis and low light techniques will be a major
emphasis. In addition, the system is used in other upper division courses,
particularly in the ongoing active student research program, and in the Physical
Chemistry laboratory for obtaining and analyzing high resolution spectra of
gases.
