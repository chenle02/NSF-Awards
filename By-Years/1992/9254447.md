This project proposes to provide leadership institutes for 148 middle school
teachers on global environmental change issues through a network of sea grant
institutions in Oregon, Washington, Alaska and Hawaii. The institutes will
concentrate on the transfer of results of research to middle school teachers
concerning global issues (global climatic change, ozone depletion, marine and
etuarine pollution, decline in biodiversity, and over population). The project
is strongly supported by each of the 4 states' departments of education
identified above.
