Gutob is a seriously endangered and poorly described language of Odisha State in
eastern-central India. There are many unusual constructions found in Gutob, some
traceable to archaic South Munda. Noun incorporation, for example, allows a
range of semantic roles to be incorporated into the verb. For example, 'I wash
my hand' is expressed in Gutob as 'I wash-hand' where 'hand' is incorporated
into the verb to create a new verb 'wash-hand'. Moreover, the same noun may
occur within the verb and also occur as an independent noun; for example, 'I my
hand wash-hand'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gregory Anderson of the Living Tongues
Institute for Endangered Languages and K. David Harrison of Swarthmore College
will work with Indian scholars over the course of this two-year grant to create
a comprehensive scientific description (a reference grammar, corpus of analyzed
oral language samples, and analytic dictionary) of Gutob. They will analyze in
depth noun incorporation and other typologically unique Gutob constructions.
Since Gutob has through its history been in contact with genetically unrelated
languages, Anderson and Harrison will also investigate the extent and nature of
Gutob language change through contact. Through their interaction with and
mentoring of local scholars, the researchers will build infrastructure for
further language documentation in Odisha State.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All Gutob
audio and video data, along with transcriptions and translations, collected
during the project will be freely accessible from the Pacific and Regional
Archive for Digital Sources in Endangered Cultures. An online Gutob Talking
Dictionary will be freely available at the talkingdictionary.org
website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported by co-funds from the
National Science Foundation's International Science and Engineering Office.
