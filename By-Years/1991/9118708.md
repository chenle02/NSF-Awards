The principal investigator will study the geochemical consequences of various
rate-determining physical and chemical processes such as advection by a fluid,
diffusion in fluids and solids, finite exchange kinetics between fluids and
solids, and chemical diffusion in silicate melts. Results of the work will have
important implications for interpreting data from igneous, metamorphic, and
sedimentary materials.
