Software engineering becomes more economically crucial every day, cutting across
virtually all industries and scientific disciplines. Indeed, it has become so
crucial that there are more tasks in software design, development, testing,
maintenance, and analysis than our existing software engineering workforce can
hope to accomplish. Various solutions have been proposed: for example, making
programmers more productive, making programmers less error prone, training
programmers more effectively, training programmers from a younger age, and so
on. All innovations in this space can be characterized as either tools that
assist skilled professionals or innovations that help train novices to be
skilled professionals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A novel hybrid approach is proposed:
Tools that assist skilled professionals while simultaneously training novices to
be skilled professionals. In short, it is proposed to build interfaces that make
it possible to crowdsource software engineering tasks. Such interfaces would
assist skilled software engineers by allowing them to discharge some of their
professional workload; and it would assist the unskilled crowd by paying them to
become more skillful at solving software engineering problems. A principle
technique proposed in crowdsourcing is gamification. Crowdsourcing will consist
of two mutually dependent parts: 1) a gaming interface that allows human beings
to leverage their natural problem-solving abilities on the engineering task at
hand, and 2) automated pre-processing and post-processing algorithms for tasks
such as decomposing the problem into smaller pieces, combining solutions, or
helping with automated code generation.
