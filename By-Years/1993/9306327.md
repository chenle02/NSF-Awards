The principal investigator will work on modular representation of finite groups
of Lie type, and on the Macdonald symmetric functions and related functions. In
modular representation theory she will investigate the Deligne-Lusztig operator
and will try to obtain a combinatorial description in the case of the classical
groups. She will also investigate the two-variable Green functions that appear
in the context of the Macdonald symmetric functions in two variables. Finally
she will investigate character values at a special class of orthogonal groups in
odd dimension relating to random walks on classical groups. The research
supported concerns the representation theory of finite groups. A group is an
algebraic object used to study transformations. Because of this, groups are a
fundamental tool in physics, chemistry and computer science as well as
mathematics. Representation theory is an important method for determining the
structure of groups.
