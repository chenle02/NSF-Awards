This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). The goal of this project is to develop practical catalysts
for the selective synthesis of heterocyclic molecules by transition metal-
catalyzed activation of alkynes. The emphasis is placed on the synthesis of the
five-membered azole heterocycles. The studies will involve design of the
catalysts, investigation of their activity, and examination of the mechanism of
the reactions, representing all aspects of reaction discovery and practical
process development. Heat flow calorimetry, parallel synthesis and reaction
monitoring, and design of experiments algorithms will be used to study and
optimize the initial discoveries of novel reactivity.

With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting
the research of Professor Valery V. Fokin of the Department of Chemistry at The
Scripps Research Institute. Professor Fokin's research program revolves around
the development of practical catalytic methods for the synthesis of heterocyclic
molecules from readily available alkynes via formation of C-N bonds. Successful
development of the methodology will have an impact on synthesis in the
pharmaceutical, materials, and agricultural industries.
