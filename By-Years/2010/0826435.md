This study investigates the role of cell mechanics on enforcement of cell shape
and cell fate (cell lineage commitment) during de novo formation of tissues.
Shape and fate are intrinsic manifestations of form and function at the cellular
level. At the length scale of the tissue, mechanical stress influences structure
and function during prenatal development and postnatal healing. At the length
scale of the embryonic mesenchymal stem cell, recent data demonstrate a high
degree of mechanosensitivity, which modulates their assembly to form tissues and
organs. Furthermore, recent developmental biology and cell mechanics studies
implicate cell shape as a powerful modulator of cell fate after homing of stem
cells to target tissues in adult organisms. One aim of this research program is
to study shape as a measure of a cell's adaptation to prevailing mechanical
stimuli during de novo tissue formation. A further aim is to correlate the
spatiotemporal enforcement of shape, via mechanical signals, to the
specification of cell lineage (fate). Finally, a third goal is to test the
feasibility of exploiting mechanical cues to engineer templates of bone and
blood vessels for tissue replacements.

The research program will help to decipher how mechanical signals, intrinsic to
life on Earth, modulate the adaptation and specialization of cells to their
environment during prenatal development as well as engineering and manufacture
of tissues. Through elucidation of Nature's mechanobiological engineering
paradigms, mechanical cues can be exploited to prevent defects during
development as well as to generate tissues in the laboratory and in the surgical
operating room. The impact of the research program on education will be
amplified through tight integration of the research approach and insights with a
newly developed college level course Cell and Tissue Engineering: Learning from
Nature's Mechanobiological Paradigms? and a Science, Technology, Engineering and
Math (STEM) high school class which will be taught to student groups from
Cleveland Municipal School District and inner ring schools.
