9505429 Austin This award is under the International Junior Investigator and
Postdoctoral Fellows Program, which enables U.S. scientists and engineers to
conduct three to twenty-four months of research abroad at research centers of
proven excellence. The program's awards provide opportunities for joint
research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and
experimental conditions abroad. Financial support for this award is from the
East Asia Pacific Program. This award will support a twenty-four-month
postdoctoral research visit by Dr. Christopher C. Austin to work with Dr.
Stephen Donnellan at the South Australian Museum in Adelaide, South Australia.
Dr. Austin will collect genetic data to examine patterns of colonization and
genetic differentiation across the entire geographic range of the skink Lipinia
noctua. This species occurs from the Papuan region throughout Oceania to the
Hawaiian Islands in the north and the Pitcairn Islands to the south. These data
will be used to address questions about the association of molecular and
morphological evolutionary rates and the controlling factors in rates of
speciation. ***
