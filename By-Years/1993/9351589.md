9351589 Keefe The main goal of this project is to improve the learning,
retention and application of physics principles and concepts by students
studying physics at Clatsop Community College (CCC). This is being accomplished
by incorporating a series of new investigations using contemporary computer
technology into the curriculum. Microcomputers are used to perform data
collection and graphing in the areas of force, motion, temperature, and
radiation. The microcomputers are used to provide immediate feedback for student
analysis of data, which stimulates them to experiment on their own with a larger
number and variety of trials, to discover relations in the physical world. Six
networked Microcomputer Based Labs (MBLs) have been obtained, all of which are
equipped with a Universal Lab Interface (ULl), appropriate sensors and software.
A master MBL station equipped with a high resolution Monitor, SuperDrive, modem
and power source has also been obtained. This equipment is revitalizing the
physics and Integrated Technologies programs at CCC, and is providing the
necessary technology to further the college's stated mission to prepare physics
students to meet the challenges of science in the next century. This project is
encouraging students to continue to study and support science by improving their
experiences with physics. ***y
