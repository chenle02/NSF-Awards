Technical abstract: The problems to be investigated include a study of dc
Josephson junctions in superfluid helium 3 and their use in the development of
the superfluid macroscopic quantum gyroscope, and a study of two dimensional
superfluid helium three, including a search for third sound. A millikelvin
scanning tunneling probe microscope will be built for study of quantization in
nanostructures, atomic manipulation, and wavefunction characterization. Low
temperature helium four atomic beam technology will be developed for atomic
interference experiments. Non-technical abstract: Ultra-low temperature
phenomena provide a variety of unusual opportunities for the development of
extremely sensitive detectors of various physical phenomena. It is planned to
study several such phenomena using very cold liquids such a helium three and
helium four. One device called the "superfluid macroscopic quantum gyroscope"
has the potential sensitivity to measure with extremely high precision the
Earth's rotation pertaining to geophysics. and climate change. In another study
a scanning tunneling microscope will be developed which can operate at ultra-low
temperatures close to absolute zero. Such an apparatus would find use in the
investigation of many novel phenomena in very small semiconductor structures.
