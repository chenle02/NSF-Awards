Topics pertinent to parallel system development are examined. Strategies for
optimizing interprocessor communication (such as grouping computations which use
common data to improve data locality or reduce remote access by the allocation
of data to local processor memory) are investigated. Also, tools for simplifying
the programming of applications for distributed memory machines are developed.
