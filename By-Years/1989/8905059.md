The PI will continue his research on Mg2Ge04, director attention to: (i)
Growing coarser spinel polycrystals by a simple procedure recently discovered;
(ii) investigating volume-transfer creep; (iii) determining the rheology of both
phases utilizing unique high-resolution molten salt cell; (iv) mapping out the
boundaries of the field in which the martensitic mechanism operates; (v)
pursuing the effect of grain size on the kinetics of transformation; (vi)
testing Kirby's deep-focus earthquake hypothesis; (vii) looking for a
martensitic transformation; and (viii) investigating the effect of synchrotron
radiation on grain-growth kinetics. He also will conduct a survey of similar
problems in Ni2Si04 with new 4.5GPA deformation apparatus nearing completion.
