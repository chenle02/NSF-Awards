This project concerns types of symmetry in algebraic structures which arise in a
wide range of areas of application, including biology, chemistry, geometry,
optimization, and physics. The research involves the development of a host of
new tools to express geometric properties algebraically. The education and
broader impacts portion of the project integrates with the research through work
with graduate students. The PI will also continue involvement in several
mentoring initiatives, including the Enhancing Diversity in Graduate Education
(EDGE) Program, Math Alliance, and a professional development seminar for
mathematics graduate students in conjunction with advising Minnesota's Women in
Math program; organization of regional and international conferences
organization; and software development and distribution for the open source
computer algebra system Macaulay2.

The research components of this project seek to establish a foundational
framework for each of the following: (1) complexes corresponding to line bundle
resolutions of sheaves on smooth toric varieties, (2) free resolutions of
equivariant ideals in an infinite setting, for instance, the case of a symmetric
group action on a countably infinite-dimensional space, and (3) a D-module
variant of Koszul homology over spherical varieties. The specific parts include
(respectively): (1) developing and applying analogues for smooth toric varieties
of foundational homological results for projective space, (2) determining how to
track and compute invariant syzygies in infinite settings with a suitable monoid
or group action, and (3) generalizing a homological framework for hypergeometric
systems of PDEs from the setting of a torus action to that of a reductive group.
The project will yield new sets of tools for shedding light on the underlying
geometry and group actions present, by aiding in the computation of important
algebro-geometric and PDE invariants.
