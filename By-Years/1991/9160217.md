Many substrates are not amenable to diamond coating because the correct
processing technologies require operation at elevated pressures and temperatures
which can be deleterious to the substrate. This project will utilize a unique
pulsed fast atom source to develop diamond coatings on substrates held at low
temperatures. The fast beam can provide high concentrations of C and H atoms in
the same ratio as utilized in PCVD processes but at very high velocities. Upon
impact the high velocity, short duration (> 30 >s) beam will transfer energy to
the surface, heating a microlayer to elevated temperatures and/or enabling
chemical barriers to diamond film growth to be surmounted. This approach avoids
the requirements of bulk substrate heating. The Phase I effort will be directed
towards a laboratory demonstration for the potential of using our fast beam
technology for diamond coating of low temperature substrates. The successful
completion of the Phase I effort will allow the utilization of diamond films on
advanced substrates which would be affected adversely by the environmental
conditions required in extant diamond coating processes.
