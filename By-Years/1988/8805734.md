Term rewriting systems have gained considerable attention in recent years for
being a convenient tool in programming languages, automated deduction, data type
specification and verification, computer algebra, and as a bridge between logic
and programming. The theory of term rewriting has developed rapidly and new
areas of applications are being explored. However, not much seems to be known
about the computational aspects of rewrite operations. This proposal addresses
the basic operations that are pertinent to rewriting and the means to design and
analyze the associated algorithms. Both practical algorithms and lower bound
complexities, on sequential and parallel machines, will be studied. Research in
the design of good algorithms for rewrite operations will be useful in improving
the efficienty of rewrite-based systems as well as in providing an understanding
into the inherent complexities and limitations of rewrite methods.
