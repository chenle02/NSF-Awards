Many physical problems have multiple time and space scales that impose
tremendous mathematical challenges and numerical difficulties. It is proposed to
develop several classes of numerical methods for efficiently computing some
important physical problems that admit multiple scales. The problems under study
are of a fundamental nature, ranging from quantum mechanics, classical
mechanics, kinetic theory to hydrodynamics. In particular, there will be
efficient numerical methods developed for: 1. the Schroedinger equations that
can be extended efficiently into the (semi)classical regime; 2. multiphase
computation in classical mechanics and related problems, and its application in
modulated electron beams in a Klystron; 3. kinetic equations that are also
efficient in the transition and fluid regimes. The numerical methods rely on the
deep mathematical understanding of the transition from one physical scale to the
other. It will provide several essential ingredients to many numerical methods
for multiscale physical problems.

The study of these problems is central to many areas of mathematical physics and
to the mathematical foundation of modern technology (e.g., MEMS, nanoscale
science and technology, plasmas, fluid mechanics, continuum mechanics, ...).
These projects, if successfully carried out, will provide novel and state-of-
the-art numerical methods to efficiently simulate important physical problems of
multiple scales. These will significantly enhance our understanding of a variety
of important physical problems arising in modern industrial applications.
