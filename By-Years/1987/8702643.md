This grant will support a theoretical study of tangential and rotational
discontinuities in collisionless plasma by means of computer simulations. Such
discontinuities are common and important structures in the solar terrestrial
environment. A key example is the earth's magnetopause, the boundary between the
terrestrial and solar magnetic fields. The simulations will be performed using
one and two dimensional hybrid codes which incorporate ion kinetic effects such
as viscosity. The simulation results will be used to obtain one and two
dimensional models of the equilibrium structure of these discontinuities. The
stability of the models, which will include the possibility of plasma velocity
shear, will be examined. The results will have implications for plasma
diffusion, heating, and acceleration at the magnetopause and discontinuities in
the solar wind. Throughout this study in situ observations will be used to
constrain the models. The importance of this work in S/T relations concerns the
energy flow form the solar wind to the magnetosphere. the magnetopause
transition is clearly important to this process which in effect powers much of
the magnetosphere's activity e.g. substorms and aurora.
