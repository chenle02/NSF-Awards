Huneke will continue investigating several open questions concerning the theory
of Noetherian rings, especially local Noetherian rings or polynomial rings.
There are several main thrusts to this work, including investigating
singularities via reduction to prime characteristic. Other problems deal with
the uniform behavior of symbolic powers on multiple levels, from points in
projective space, to primes in local rings, to square-free monomial ideals. A
major effort is proposed to understand non-commutative crepant resolutions in
broader classes of rings, and to answer several questions concerning the concept
of height.

The proposed research concerns the theory of commutative rings, which are higher
abstract systems where one can add and multiply. The rings arising in this
proposal usually comes from a system of polynomial equations. The ring is a type
of abstract model where solutions to the equations exist. By studying the
properties of this model, one can then better understand the original system of
equations. There are two main methods.One is to understand the theory of modules
over such rings. Modules are a type of special representation of spaces where
the equations hold. Studying these models has been an extremely effective way to
study equations. The other main technical method is to study the same basic
equations in rings which are reduced modulo a prime number. In such a system,
arithmetic becomes easier. For instance modulo 2 means that every even number is
thought of as 0, and all odd numbers as 1. This has a number of profound
advantages which are used in this proposal.
