The project is a combinatorial study of structures arising from affine algebras
and Weyl groups.

The first object of study is the crystal graph of a module over a quantized
universal enveloping algebra of an affine Lie algebra. Lusztig and Kashiwara
have developed the deep and intricate theory of canonical bases for suitable
modules over quantized enveloping algebras of Kac-Moody algebras. When the
quantum parameter is set to zero (the \low temperature limit"), one obtains a
colored directed graph called the crystal graph of the module. This remarkable
graph encodes nearly all the important algebraic data of the module. Using the
crystal graph, many algebraic problems are reduced to combinatorial ones. In the
case of a+ne Kac-Moody algebras the combinatorics is particularly favorable; it
was shown by Kang, Kashiwara, Misra, Miwa, Nakayashima, and Nakayashiki, that
the elements of the crystal graph can be expressed as certain eventually
periodic finite sequences of elements of very special finite crystal graphs
called perfect crystals. In turn, the perfect crystals can be studied using
techniques of classical combinatorics such as the theory of Young tableaux.

One goal is to determine explicitly the colored graph structure of crystals in a
family whose existence was conjectured by Hatayama, Kuniba, Okado, Takagi, and
Y. Yamada and which arose from the study of the Bethe Ansatz in integrable
systems. Another goal is to give explicit formulae for certain multiplicities
that arise in conformal field theory and statistical mechanics, such as fusion
coefficients and branching functions. It is of particular interest to express
such quantities in a certain form (\fermionic"), one which admits a quasi
particle interpretation for the states of the underlying model. Such formulae
have combinatorial descriptions in terms of the rigged configurations of A. N.
Kirillov and N.-Y. Reshetikhin. The second object of study is the family of
Kazhdan-Lusztig (KL) polynomials for a+ne Weyl groups. For simple Lie algebras
these polynomials are prominent in the geometry of Schubert varieties and in the
representation theory of both the Weyl group and the simple algebraic group;
these phenomena generalize for the a+ne algebras. One goal is to give explicit
combinatorial (no alternating sums allowed) formulae for certain of these
polynomials, which appear as graded multiplicities of irreducible modules for
the associated simple Lie algebra, in the modules of twisted functions on the
nullcone, the closure of the principal nilpotent adjoint orbit of the simple Lie
algebra. A second goal is to give such formulae for certain parabolic KL
polynomials for the a+ne Weyl group of type A, which can be expressed in terms
of the ribbon tableaux of Lascoux, Leclerc, and Thibon.
