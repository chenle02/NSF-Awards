9401756 McNeal This award supports mathematical research on problems arising in
the study of the relationship between the geometry of domains in complex
n-dimensional space and analytic quantities associated with these domains - such
as the Bergman and Szego kernels and peak functions. Three particular problems
will be addressed in this project. The first concerns the boundary behavior of
the Bergman kernel function and its derivatives on smoothly bounded,
pseudoconvex domains. The second involves estimates of the Holder norm of
solutions to the Cauchy-Riemann equations on smoothly bounded convex domains and
the third relates to the mapping properties of the Szego projection operator on
various Banach spaces. The methods employed will center on the relationship
between regularity for solutions to certain systems of partial differential
equations and the geometry of the boundary of the domain in question. Several
complex variables arose at the beginning of the century as a natural outgrowth
of studies of functions of one complex variable. It became clear early on that
the theory differed widely from it predecessor. The underlying geometry was far
more difficult to grasp and the function theory had far more affinity with
partial differential operators of first order. It thus grew as a hybrid subject
combining deep characteristics of differential geometry and differential
equations. Many of the fundamental structures were defined in the last three
decades. Current studies still concentrate on understanding these basic
mathematical forms. ***
