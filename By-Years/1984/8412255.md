Research in semiconductor-based optoelectronics will be conducted, with emphasis
on applications to optical communication. Semiconducted laser noise will be
analyzed to determine the basic physical limits to the spectral purity of
semiconductor lasers. This work will extend the previous results on a self-
consistent semiclassical theory of noise behavior to a full quantumtreatment,
particularly quantum-well lasers. Detuned loading in coupledsemiconductor lasers
will be pursued both theoretically and experimentally. High output power laser
arrays which could have considerable impact on the development of optoelectronic
processing and devices will be addressed. Several new ideas including
fabrication techniques could overcome some of the current lack of success in
this area.
