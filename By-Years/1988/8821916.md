As part of the Greenland Ice Sheet Project, this investigation will carbon-14
date atmospheric gases trapped in relatively small (a few kg) samples of polar
ice cores. The technique would be to place the ice in a vacuum system and the
sublime the ice onto the surface of a -80C degrees cold trap. The gas released
by this procedure would be passed through a multipass trap held at liquid-
nitrogen temperature, which would enable all the carbon dioxide to be recovered.
The CO2 sample so obtained would be accurately diluted and converted into a
graphite target for 14C determination by accelerator mass spectrometry. The
atmospheric gases other than CO2 (and N2O) would be trapped on a molecular sieve
and be available for other studies related to the paleoclimatology of the
northern hemisphere.
