The goal of this project is to create a new unified upper level synthesis and
processing laboratory that will integrate the synthesis and processing of all of
the various materials classes. The experience provided by this new laboratory
will complement and enhance the core curriculum, which was established at MIT a
decade ago with the specific goal of exposing students to the fundamental
unifying concepts of materials science and engineering. With the introduction of
this new synthesis and processing laboratory, students for the first time will
have the opportunity to experimentally explore porcessing-structure property
relationships in a wide variety of different materials, including composites.
Emphasis will be placed on design-oriented projects in which students will work
in teams with well-defined goals and project missions. Laboratories will be
designed to expose students to the importance of computers in modern processing,
in process design and simulation, in data acquisition, and in process control.
The program will be evaluated through student entrance and exit evaluations,
recommendations of a Visiting Committee, and an ad hoc industrial panel. In
addition to the development and implementation of the new laboratory,
comprehensive student workbooks and instructor's guides will be generated for
use by other institutions, and educational symposia will be held at professional
society meetings.
