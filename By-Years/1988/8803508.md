Funding is requested for the purchase of a capillary gas chromatograph.mass
spectrometer system to support research projects in the Departments of
Entomology and Plant Pathology. The Hewlett Packard system requested is a bench
top dedicated GC/MS system that is user friendly and can fulfill the routine
mass spectral needs of the research projects. Specifically, the research
projects include the following: a) Biosynthetic pathways of moth sex pheromone
components; b) genetic and hormonal control of chemical communication systems:
c) semiochemical identification with various types of insects, such as maggots,
blackflies, scales, and aphids; d) mode of action of neurotoxic insecticides;
and e) biochemistry of sterol biosynthesis of action of neurotoxic insecticides;
e) biochemistry of sterol biosynthesis inhibitors.
