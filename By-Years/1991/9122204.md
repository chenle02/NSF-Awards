The objective of this SBIR Phase II project is to design and build a dynamic
camera control system and processing hardware to exercise high performance real
time vision algorithms. High performance is based on reformulating algorithms in
log-polar image plane coordinates, which significantly reduces pixel count and
computations per pixel. Capabilities of this system will include depth
perception based on binocular stereo and optic flow in dynamic environments.
This system can be duplicated as a testbed for vision researchers. The binocular
camera motion head will be available as a self-contained module which can be
attached to any processing architecture. Phase I has demonstrated a complete
spectrum of image processing algorithms formulated in log-polar coordinates,
proving the feasibility and efficiency of such a system. Orders-of magnitude
reduction in computational requirements suggest dramatic benefits for robot
vision in general and mobile robots in particular. The proposed technology could
improve the cost/performance ration for robot vision systems by several order of
magnitude. This opens commercial niches unattainable by conventional Cartesian
coordinate based computer vision. Markets include autonomous floor cleaners,
transporters, security robots, and service robots.
