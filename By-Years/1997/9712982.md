PROPOSAL: Amphiphilic Particles Because of the reduced budget, I will not be
able to prepare amphiphilic particles from a large number of pairs of
hydrophobic and hydrophilic monomers. The emphasis will be on the pair
acrylamidestyrene, but other pairs will be also considered. We will investigate
in details the stability of these particles in hydrophilic and hydrophobic media
and, in particular, the effect of the thickness and porosity of the outer shell
on their stability. The particle will be further used to determine their
adsorption capacity for various dyes and various homogeneous catalysts. Our fmal
hope is that such particles could be employed for protein separation and for
homogeneous catalysis. ~ ~: . Eli Ruckenstein :Distinguished Professor , Bradley
