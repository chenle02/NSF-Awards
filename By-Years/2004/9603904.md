9603904 Amzel The 1997 Johns Hopkins Protein Folding Meeting will be held March
15-18, 1997 at the Coolfont Conference Center in Berkeley Springs, West Virginia
. The meeting has an excellent choice of topics and session leaders. It includes
four three-hour sessions of presented talks. The first such meeting was
generally judged as excellent. Key features include the involvement of graduate
students and postdocs, and the low-key atmosphere of the meeting. Protein
folding is an area of active research that includes modeling, prediction of
stability and prediction of structure. This meeting presents a balanced
discussion of theory, prediction methods, computational methods and experiments.
