The pursuit of realism in image synthesis has typically meant the abandonment of
efficiency. The two most popular shading techniques, ray tracing and radiosity,
become quite inefficient when generalized to simulate both diffuse and specular
reflection. This project develops a new, unified shading algorithm that will
simulate the full range of reflectance phenomena without sacrificing efficiency.
The approach employs a combination of radiosity and ray tracing ideas we called
bidirectional ray tracing. The algorithms and data structure developed should be
useful for architectural design, computer-aided product design, scientific
visualization, motion picture special effects, and improved models of image
formation for computer vision.
