Clouds play a crucial role in the Earthâ€™s atmosphere by regulating the radiative
balance, influencing precipitation patterns and intensity, and generating
vertical air movements that redistribute heat, moisture, and momentum. Some
aspects of cloud processes remain poorly understood, partly because the
scientific community has lacked high spatial and temporal resolution
measurements of clouds. Phased-array radar can help in this area, as these
radars are able to rapidly scan using electronic beam steering. Phased-array
radar has been used for decades in the defense sector and is expanding in use in
the weather sector for precipitation observations. However, the technology has
not yet been adopted for use as a ground-based cloud radar at millimeter
wavelengths. This award will allow the research team to build a millimeter
wavelength phased array demonstrator unit, which will examine the feasibility of
a future ground-based, mobile phased array cloud radar. The downstream impact of
this project will be to provide data for studies of cumulus evolution, cloud and
precipitation processes, and tornado formation and wind structure. Students and
early-career scientists will be involved in the design and testing of the unit,
thereby providing hands-on training for the next generation of scientists and
engineers. A community workshop will also be held to foster collaboration
between scientists that are, or could be, using cloud radars for their research.

This award is for the development of a technology demonstrator unit cell for a
millimeter-wavelength rapid scan radar. Millimeter-wavelength radars are
generally designed for the measurement of smaller particles, such as cloud
droplets, versus traditional weather radars which measure precipitation-sized
particles. While precipitation radars have employed phased-array technology with
dual-polarization to rapidly scan and retrieve particle shapes, these
enhancements have not been demonstrated for shorter wavelengths. This EAGER
award will result in an 8x8 element array unit with a novel antenna architecture
that would demonstrate the feasibility of a millimeter wavelength rapid scan
imaging phased array radar. The proposed array unit-cell will be designed to
have excellent co-polar match beam pattern (< 0.1 dB), high polarization
isolation (< 40 dB), and large scanning performance. An over-the-air testing
technique will be used to characterize and calibrate each active element in the
phased array antenna in reception mode.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
