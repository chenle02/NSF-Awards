The theme of the proposed research is to advance the state of the art in the
design of feedback controllers. This basic research will integrate concepts from
deterministic and stochastic optimal control theory and intelligent control
methodologies to arrive at superior intelligent feedback designs. More
specifically it is proposed to utilize neural network technology to implement
the design of optimal, robust, and adaptive nonlinear controllers in the
presence of significant un certainty. The emphasis will be on basic theoretical
and algorithmic results. Specific research directions include the use of optimal
control theory as a means for training artificial neural network implementations
of linear, nonlinear, and adaptive controllers. One approach will involve the
use of numerical data from the solution of the Two-Point- Boundary-Value (TPBV)
problem arising from the application of the Pontryagin Maximum Principle to firs
train artificial neural network feedback controllers and then evaluate their
performance. In particular, we shall examine whether Cerebellar Motion
Articulated Controller (CMAC) structures can be viewed from this perspective. In
the beginning phase we plan to use bang-bang time- optimal nonlinear controllers
for low order systems and investigate the degree that a trained multi-layer
neural network approximates the switching curves and surfaces associated with
these bang-bang controllers.
