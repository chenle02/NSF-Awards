Dielectric fluids containing fine hydrophillic particles can rapidly undergo
large reversible changes in their rheological properties upon application of an
electric field. To better understand the electrorheological (ER) effect, it is
proposed to carry out the following research activities: (a) detailed optical
microscopy observations on the nature of the fibrated structure which develops
upon application of an electric field and its rupture and reformation during
shear, (b) concurrent measurements of the rheological and electrical properties
of the ER fluid, (c) selected measurements of he physical, chemical, and
geometric nature of the surface of the suspended particles employing advanced
analytical instruments, and (d) an analysis of the results to identify the
operative mechanisms.
