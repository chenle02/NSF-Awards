This SGER will explore the possibility of identifying, locating, and then
creating an open, easily accessible digital archive of important materials that
document the activities, policies, and processes that contributed to the
evolution of the Internet. Records of the R&amp;D carried out between 1968 (the
initiation of networking R&amp;D at DARPA) and 1985 (the decommissioning of the
NSFNet) are fragile. As time passes, records are lost or dispersed, making it
impossible or very costly to recover. Many of the records of that period are
informal (e.g., email) and may never be recovered unless steps are taken now to
locate and acquire them. In addition, the former government officials and
academic partners who participated in this early R&amp;D are getting older.
Steps need to be taken now to insure that all important participants from that
period have been interviewed and that their personal records of that period be
made available where possible. Partnerships are being established with the
Computer History Museum, and other archives, which have already begun to collect
some of these materials, as well as with the George Washington University's ECHO
Program, which is devoted to exploring and collecting history online. The
approach taken here is to be bring all these disparate resources together and to
become systematic about what needs to be collected to make this Internet archive
a definitive, exhaustive collection. The information generated during this
research and then made available in the archive to future researchers will
contribute to more accurate understandings of the synergy of university-
government-industry collaboration and the linkages of science and technology
policy, R &amp;D and education to advances in technology, the economy and
society.
