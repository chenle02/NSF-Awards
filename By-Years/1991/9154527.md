This three-year project uses science performance test data collected under the
auspices of the California Assessment Program (CAP) to refine and apply new
methods for scoring performance tests and for modeling cognitive abilities.
After working with data and for modeling cognitive abilities. After working with
data already collected, the PI will collaborate with CAP personnel to
incorporate features into future performance tests that will facilitate the
forms of analysis proposed. The analytical methods to be developed involved
modeling underlying abilities in terms of discrete states, rather than continue.
Task performance is likewise represented in terms of discrete states, and
mappings are derived from ability states to task performance states.
Representations and mappings are in terms of partially ordered sets,
distributive lattices, and related mathematical structures. Restricted latent
class models are used to make inferences about true task performance state and
true ability state in the presence of random classification errors.
