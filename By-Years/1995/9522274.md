9522274 Hjortso This project is on research to study autonomous oscillations of
S. cerevisiae growing in a chemostat under glucose limitation. The casual nature
of such oscillations is unclear although biological and mathematical models able
to simulate the observed behavior have been proposed. A previously developed age
structured model will be used in this research. This model can use division age
to explain the onset of oscillations. A simultaneous program of experimentation
and model refinement will be used to increase understanding with the ultimate
goal of bioprocess improvement. ***
