Technical Narrative: This U.S.-Jordan collaborative research project involving
Iowa State University and Applied Science University, Amman, Jordan will explore
the nuclear equation of state. Project funding will enable Dr. Mahmoud Hasan of
Applied Science University to spend a total of six months in the laboratory of
Dr. James Vary at Iowa State University. Their collaborative research will
investigate atomic nuclei under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature.
This work has applications in both heavy-ion physics and astrophysics. This
project in theoretical physics fulfills the program objective of advancing
scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States and Jordan
to combine complementary talents and pool research resources in areas of strong
mutual interest and competence.
