The proposed research has three parts. (a) The first part concerns complex
tangent points of real submanifolds in complex Euclidean space. Gong wants to
investigate real submanifolds whose set of complex tangents has a large
dimension. The sets of complex tangents are real analytic varieties. The problem
will be studied by methods in the singularity theory. Hopefully this approach
will lead to some new invariants for the complex tangent points. (b) The second
part concerns optimal arithmetic conditions for a small divisor problem arising
from real surfaces with a complex tangent point. The problem can be studied with
a holomorphic mapping and the goal is to find the optimal condition to linearize
the map arising from the real surfaces. (c) The third part of proposed research
is about the analyticity of the common zero set of finitely many continuous
functions that satisfy a Cauchy-Riemann inequality. Also, Gong (jointly with S.
M. Webster) is trying to obtain minimum regularity of embedding Cauchy-Riemann
manifolds and other related problems. One of goals is to simplify the existing
proofs.

The proposed research is in areas of several complex variables and local
holomorphic dynamics. The last part of the proposed research involves partial
differential equations and the regularities of their solutions. It also involves
the Nash-Moser rapid iteration method which is fundamental to many problems in
analysis and geometry. Gong seeks results that have connections with the
singularity theory. This might also lead to some applications of topology
invariants. The study of invariants and singularities is important to understand
objects in many research areas. When the small divisors or resonance are
presence, the classification problems have strong connections with research in
Hamiltonian systems which have applications in celestial mechanics.
