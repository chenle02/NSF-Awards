Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INGEOS Indians into Geological
Sciences&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program establishes, develops, and
enhances INGEOS (Indians into Geological Sciences). INGEOS is designed to build
collaboration between a tribal college (White Earth Tribal and Community
College, Mahnomen, Minnesota) and a major geoscience research institution (the
University of North Dakota, Grand Forks, North Dakota). INGEOS inititates a
three-year pilot, dual-institution (major research university and tribal
college), co-principal investigator-managed program specifically designed to
bring Indian students up to and above the baccalaureate and masters level in the
geosciences and to prepare them competitively for successful geoscience careers.
INGEOS initiates an eight-point approach to academic success in a comprehensive
retention-oriented program. These eight points include: mental health and
challenge, physical health, social integration, financial management, technical
exposure and experience, research exposure and experience, teaching experience
(graduate students), and conference attendance.
