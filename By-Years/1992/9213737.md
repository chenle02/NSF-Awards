Scientific advances in identifying, predicting and mitigating hazards are likely
to produce significant changes in how the public assesses moral and ethical
responsibility for disaster losses. It should also affect the way in which those
involved in disaster mitigation, including design professionals, businesses, and
government officials, judge their own responsibility. This project begins an
examination of the factors that influence judgments of responsibility for losses
from both technological and natural disasters. This initial period of the
research will be devoted to two tasks: the development of concept papers
addressing the major intellectual traditions that have contributed to
understanding of judgments of responsibility; and the identification of the
principal dimensions (and the variables that reflect components of those
dimensions) of the attribution of responsibility for disasters. With the
guidance of an interdisciplinary advisory group, in the first six months of the
project, the investigators will develop a series of concept papers reviewing
major intellectual traditions that have been used to understand how people judge
responsibility, and review case study materials in the archives of the
University of Delaware's Disaster Research Center to identify potentially useful
examples of disasters that can form the basis for initial scenario development
work. Drawing on the papers and the hazards literature, key dimensions that
influence potentially different attributions of responsibility will be
identified. The second half of the project will generate a set of relevant
dimensions and a large number of scenarios. The dimensions will then be varied
experimentally to examine how they influence lay judgments. Premiminary work
will be conducted with convenience samples . However, to produce generalizable
data from this phase of the research, the investigators also plan to conduct
some of the secnario development work with paid subjects from the community and
with representatives of one "stakeholder" group, most likely engineers. The
first year of the project will procude a set of scenarios to be used in
experimental and survey phases of the research. The scenarios will be based on
an analysis of the subjects' responses. The concept papers will be published in
various outlets, and the early experimental analysis should also result in
publishable papers addressing the methodological issues involved in scenario-
based research as well as conceptual development of attribution processes for
disaster consequences.
