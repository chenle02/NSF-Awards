Following a collision, the freighter PAC BARONESS sank in 600 meters of water
off Point Conception, California on September 21, 1987. The ship was carrying a
cargo of 21000 metric tons of finely powdered copper ore. Preliminary evidence
indicates that the ship ruptured on sinking and that some of the ore was
released. It is possible that the presence of the copper ore on the seafloor
could produce a "spike" that could serve as a tracer of the biogeochemical flux
of copper and of the physical transport of fine particulate matter. The PI's
propose to conduct an underwater survey to determine the status of the wreck and
its cargo, and to determine the concentrations of copper in the water column and
resident biota. The information is needed before the feasibility of a true
"tracer" study can be evaluated. Other Federal agencies (NOAA, MMS) are
providing support for the effort as well.
