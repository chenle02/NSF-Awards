The study proposed herein will explore the evolution of the symbiotic
association between endosymbiotic algae (zooxanthellae) and Mesozoic
scleractinian corals. The aragonitic corals which will form the basis of this
study include the oldest known sleractinians still composed of aragonite. The
presence of the symbiotic association can be documented in diagenetically
unalltered fossil corals by examining the statistical relationships between
stable carbon and oxygen isotopes. We will systematically establish the
geochemical, mineralogical, and petrographic integrity of our samples by (i)
staining, (ii) x-ray, (iii) electron microscope analysis, (iv) catholuminescent
studies, (v) scanning electron microscopy, and (vi) optical petrographic
methods. Stable isotopic analysis will be performed only on diagenetically
unaltered samples. The results will be compared to other, often controversial
methods of establishing the presence of zooxanthellae and is expected to provide
insight into the early evolution of Mesozoic corals.
