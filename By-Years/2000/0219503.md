RCS structures consisting of reinforced concrete columns and steel beams are a
cost-effective type of construction in seismic zones. Models for RCS joints have
been restricted to either strength models or monotonic force-deformation models
based on experimental results. The behavior of joints typically encountered in
frame structures, such as connections with strong outer panels and
T-configurations, is not well known. Inelastic behavior of connections with
strong outer panels could significantly differ from that of joints with strong
inner panel. Bearing failures might represent a threat in T-joints because of
the lack of a column section above the connection. Macro models that simulate
the behavior of RCS connections in shear and bearing for performance-based
design will be developed based on new and existing experimental and analytical
results. These models will include the effect of confinement, concrete
softening, and relative strength contribution from shear resistance mechanisms
on hysteretic response of RCS joints.
