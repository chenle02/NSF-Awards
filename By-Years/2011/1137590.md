The Grambling State University HBCU-UP project, Center for Mathematical
Achievement in Science & Technology II (CMAST II), is designed to improve
student performance and increase the success rate of STEM undergraduates by
infusing problem based and inquiry learning pedagogies in introductory sciences
and technology courses, expanding a Scholars' program with academic coaching,
restructuring a summer science program for high school students, and
implementing a science and mathematics teacher certification program.

A primary focus of this project is student retention in STEM majors with an
approach to increase student retention in STEM introductory courses. These
courses will be redesigned to include problem based learning which has been
found to improve student learning outcomes and success. Problem based pedagogies
have been piloted with promising results in selected sections of introductory
courses in Engineering Technology, Computer Science, and Chemistry (using POGIL-
Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning), and this project will infuse these
pedagogies in the first and second sequence of courses in these subject areas
and Physics. Faculty development workshops will be provided to faculty to assist
them in implementing these teaching strategies in problem based learning and
inquiry. The project will use the STEM First Year Learning Community as an
intervention also to support academic success and increase student retention in
STEM. A Rising Sophomore Summer Academy will be a three week research training
experience to prepare and increase skills and participation of students in
research experiences for undergraduates.A STEM Teacher Education Certification
program will be developed for biology, physics, and mathematics majors to get
teacher certified along with attaining their STEM degree and the project expects
to increase the institution's production of STEM teachers.
