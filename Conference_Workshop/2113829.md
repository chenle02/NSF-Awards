The Math For All in New Orleans Conference will be held virtually on March 5-7,
2021. The overall goal of the Math For All in New Orleans conference is to
increase diversity in mathematics and expose mathematicians in the Greater New
Orleans area to the wide variety of research available at nearby institutions.
Due to this year?s virtual format, many participants will be also attending from
different parts of the United States. The conference will include four broadly
accessible plenary talks, six contributed research sessions, a diverse career
panel, two workshops and a poster session. Through these avenues, the conference
is designed to engage undergraduate and graduate students into a community of
mathematics and prepare them for future careers in the field. The plenary
speakers and panelists come from around the United States, representing multiple
ethnic and mathematical backgrounds, giving students visible role models in
industry and academia with whom they can identify. Participants will have the
opportunity to present research and attend professional development workshops in
a welcoming and inclusive environment. The conference will strive to make
mathematics more accessible to underrepresented groups, ultimately increasing
diversity in the field. The conference will have participants representing HBCUs
and smaller universities in the New Orleans area, with the goal of exposing them
to a broad mathematical research community. These aspects of the conference help
students be better prepared to transition to research-focused environments,
which will increase retention of underrepresented groups in the mathematical
fields. The conference will also stimulate discussions amongst faculty on
inclusive pedagogy aimed at advancing students from underrepresented groups. The
organizing committee is dedicated to amplifying the voices of underrepresented
minorities in mathematics by highlighting the importance of representation,
allyship, and individual actions towards changing systemic forms of oppression
in mathematics. Conference Website: http://www.math.tulane.edu/mathforallnola
