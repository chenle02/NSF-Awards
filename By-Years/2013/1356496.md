A team of faculty and administrators at St. Edwards University is increasing the
number of academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who
earn baccalaureate degrees in the bioinformatics, environmental and forensic
chemistry, computer science, and mathematics. The Rewarding Achievement in
Mathematics and Science (RAMS) project is providing 14 scholarships to students
who are being retained as STEM majors through participating in a close-knit
community of learners. This student cohort is developing academically and
socially through an array of support mechanisms, including: (a) a first year
seminar, (b) supplemental instruction and peer-led team learning, (c) a science
living and learning community, (d) the Science Speakers Series, (e) summer
research, and (f) internships with local industrial partners. The PI team is
recruiting from a diverse pool of students in which 35% of their STEM majors are
Hispanic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is generating a broad impact in two
ways. First, data generated through assessment and evaluation is supporting the
rationale that high retention of students in STEM fields can be achieved through
a comprehensive program of student development that emphasizes community-
building. Formative and summative evaluation is focusing on assessment of the
project's ability to recruit, retain, and graduate students. Secondly,
dissemination of the project results is providing a model for retaining students
in the STEM fields by integrating them into a close-knit community of learners.
The project team is presenting their work throughout their many regional and
national consortia including the New American Colleges and Universities, the
Texas Hispanic-Serving Institutions, and the Catholic Colleges and Universities
of Texas.
