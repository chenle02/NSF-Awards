9713337 Pallrand The Waksman Institute of Rutgers The State University provides
a Research Experiences for Teachers and Students project. The project consists
of a 4-week summer institute for teams of 1 teacher and 2 students from each of
15 high schools and an academic year program. The participants are introduced to
a research project in the field of molecular biology and bioinformatics. During
the academic year participants are part of research courses established by their
high schools, take part in the Waksman Challenge, an Internet-based research
problem solving activity, and a series of research workshops with other students
from their high schools. The project encourages a more research-rich climate in
high schools by establishing, supporting, and sustaining on-going relationships
among research scientists and the participating teachers and students.
