As the source of the solar wind, the solar corona is a crucial component of
solar-terrestrial relations. The study is the first attempt to derive both the
magnetic field and density distribution over 3-dimensions in the solar corona
from measurements. It will test the underlying assumptions of the most recent
model, that the global structure of the corona can be described with a simple
magnetostatic model that includes only horizontal currents in the corona.
Furthermore, application of this model to the extensive synoptic data sets will
give a quantitative description of the variations in the corona over timescales
comparable to the solar cycle. This will be an important step towards
understanding the structure and stability of the solar corona. The aim of study
is to derive large-scale, fully 3 dimensional descriptions of both the magnetic
field and the distribution of plasma in the lower corona. The model is to be
constrained by (a) measurements of white light that has ben scattered by coronal
electrons (obtained at the High Altitude Observatory coronameter stationed at
Mauna Loa, Hawaii) and (b) measurements of the magnetic field in the photosphere
(obtained at the Stanford Solar Observatory). Each coronameter measurement is an
integral of scattered light along a line-of-sight through the 3-d density
structure. Thus inverting the coronal tomography, with the added constraint that
the model must also match the observed photospheric magnetic field. To model the
large-scale structure, which does not change substantially over a solar
rotation, it is possible to take a magnetostatic model and data from a full
rotation. Studies will consider data from solar minimum when the corona is most
steady, but the ultimate goal is to find a quantitative means of describing
changes in the solar corona over timescales such as the solar cycle.//
