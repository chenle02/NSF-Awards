This project which deals with the chemistry of unusual heterogeneous organo-
iron reactions is being supported by the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry
Program. The novelty of this chemistry lies in the unprecedented relative
reactivities of the various types of carbon-hydrogen bonds toward hydrogen atom
abstraction by iron metal under special conditions. The hypothesis that these
reactions involve the intermediacy of organoiron reagents is being tested.
Results from this study will give important insights into the chemical nature of
species (e.g. certain enzymes) which contain the carbon-iron bond. This research
program is studying the methods so far established in the Gif and Gif-Orsay
systems for selective oxidation of saturated hydrocarbons. Recently a new
development of the Gif system has uncovered a remarkable new reaction, which
under very mild conditions permits the selective phenylselenation of saturated
hydrocarbons. This and the preceding reaction, deserve further application and,
in particular, mechanistic investigation. The iron species which appear to be
responsible for the Gif substitution are being synthesized. Competitive trapping
procedures are proposed using intramolecular traps to demonstrate the role of
the iron-carbon sigma-bond and of the iron-carbene double bond. Further new
reactions of saturated hydrocarbons will be invented.
