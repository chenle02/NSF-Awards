The research entails studies of analytic and topological properties of classes
of minimal surfaces in Riemannian manifolds of dimension greater than or equal
to 3. The methods are primarily those of geometric measure theory and are
expected to achieve further insight to the analytic and topological structures
of hypersurfaces lying in these manifolds. Particular attention will be paid to
dimension 3 where new techniques are applied to show that certain Riemann
surfaces can be realized as minimal types.
