Prolonged residence in Antarctica is associated with profound changes in thyroid
hormone economy. Results from previous research by Dr. Reed have shown that
human pituitary thyrotropin (TSH) responsiveness to hypothalamic releasing
hormone (TRH) is increased by 50%, and triiodothyronine (T3) production rate
(PR), metabolic clearance rate (MCR), and volume of distribution (TVD), are
increased 150%, 160%, and 230% respectively over paired control values after 42
weeks residence in McMurdo, Antarctica. The mechanisms for these changes, and
the physiologic and psychological significance of them are at present unknown.
In this proposal, the investigator will continue studies in this area by
investigating the human circulating blood lymphocyte as a model for the human
tissue response to alterations in thyroid hormones found with prolonged
Antarctic residence. Circulating lymphocytes (which accurately reflect systemic
thyroid activity at the tissue level) will be isolated before, during, and after
42 weeks of Antarctic residence. These lymphocytes will then be analyzed for
changes in nuclear T3 receptor number and/or affinity, and the T3 receptor
precursor messenger RNA, in order to determine concomitant cellular and sub-
cellular alterations associated with the changes in peripheral T3 TVD, PR and
MCR as previously described.
