The Board on Physics and Astronomy (BPA) serves as the focal point in the
National Academies of Sciences and the National Research Council (NRC) for
activities related to physics and astronomy and their interactions with
engineering, medicine, chemistry, biology, and other sciences. The BPA's
principal objectives are to maintain an awareness of the status of research in
physics and astronomy, to identify emerging needs, and to initiate studies that
address problems and that foster continued progress. The BPA fulfills these
objectives by working closely with the physics and astronomy communities in
academia, federal agencies and their advisory committees, government
laboratories, industry, relevant scientific and technical societies, and other
boards and committees of the NRC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Among the important
mechanisms used by the BPA to achieve impact are periodic decadal assessments of
the fields. The surveys of astronomy and astrophysics and subfields in physics,
which the BPA initiates and oversees, have been very effective in establishing a
consensus on priorities for major facilities and for addressing broader issues
in these fields. By facilitating progress in physics and astronomy, the BPA
helps to enrich the nation's intellectual enterprise in academe, industry, and
government laboratories.
