Thomas, John 95-28398 Dr. Thomas plans a concerted program of research on dynamo
theory, concentrating in three areas -- dynamo generation of magnetic fields in
white dwarfs, dynamo generation of magnetic fields in the giant planets, and the
aperiodicity and chaos in nonlinear stellar dynamos. In addition, he will
investigate the solar dynamo as a benchmark for all three of the aforementioned
studies. ***
