The research is concerned with methods and tools for generating real- time
operating systems. The work covers topics in software engineering, programming-
in-the-large, and real-time processing. Specifically, the following topics will
be addressed. 1. a module structuring and interface methodology, based on an
acyclic graph model where the nodes represent modules (restricted to processes
and abstract data types) and the edges denote procedure import and export
relations. 2. a prototype for real-time operating systems design, involving
libraries of reusable components. This involves the identification, design, and
building of a variety of useful components and structures, such as interrupt
handlers, critical section locking mechanisms, message passing, timers,
schedulers, input- output systems, cyclic executives, and producer-consumer
applications. 3. a graphics front end for interacting with designs. This would
permit the construction, modification, and annotation of our module structures,
including the association of modules with their code files.
