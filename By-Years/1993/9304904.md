This award will provide essential computational resources, to several on-going
research projects in number theory, algebra, and algebraic geometry. These
projects cover the related areas of representation theory; modular forms and
elliptic curves; the topology of algebraic varieties and Picard-Fuchs,
differential equations; and Arakelov theory, K-theory, and arithmetic geometry.
The investigators plan variously to apply symbolic algebra programs, such as
REDUCE, Maple, Macaulay, to these problems; to develop packages of procedures in
these languages; and to develop programs in lower level languages such as
FORTRAN and C. In addition, the equipment will be used to support graduate
students working in these areas.
