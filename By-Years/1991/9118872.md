Neural plasticity occurs in the auditory neocortex, and is thought to underlie
some forms of learning. The goal of Dr. Metherate's research is to understand
the cellular bases of neural plasticity. Neural plasticity is proposed to depend
on the interactions between auditory and neuromodulatory inputs to cortical
nerve cells. Auditory information is delivered via projections from the auditory
thalamus. This information is then modified by inputs from neuromodulatory
systems to produce neural plasticity. Dr. Metherate proposes the following
mechanism: primary auditory inputs, which contact close to the cell bodies of
cortical neurons, exert a strong influence over neuronal activity. While
secondary auditory inputs relay plasticity information to distant parts of
cortical neurons, and exert less influence over neuronal activity at the cell
body. Modulation of cortical neurons makes them electrically more "compact".
This allows the secondary inputs to "reach" the cell body, facilitating the
integration of primary and secondary inputs, and lowering the threshold for
plasticity to occur. In this study, Dr. Metherate will record the activity
elicited by primary inputs to determine the threshold for one form of plasticity
called long-term potentiation (LTP). He will examine modulation of neural
activity, responses to secondary inputs, and LTP threshold by stimulating two
kinds of neuromodulatory inputs: those from the nucleus basalis and locus
coeruleus. This exciting project will advance the study of cortical plasticity
by determining how parallel auditory pathways converge and interact at the
cortex, and how neuromodulatory systems regulate auditory information
processing. Dr. Metherate's research is an important model which has intuitive
appeal in terms of cortical circuitry and in relation to memory and other
cognitive disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.***//
