Questions about properties of positive integers, especially the way in which
integers factor and the distribution of prime numbers, have fascinated people
for thousands of years and have recently found applications in computer science,
information security, and signal processing. This proposal concerns several
projects in the theory of numbers, emphasizing connections with other areas of
mathematics such as Probability and Combinatorics. The principal investigator
was part of a team that made a recent large breakthrough on the distribution of
gaps between prime numbers, and further investigations will be made along these
lines, together with additional problems about primes and combinatorial objects
arising from our techniques. The principal investigator will also continue work
on counting integral solutions of certain types of systems of equations, number
theoretic functions, and the Riemann zeta function.

This research concerns several projects in the theory of numbers. The first
concerns accurately counting the integer solutions of certain special types of
systems of Diophantine equations that are multidimensional analogs of
Vinogradov's system. The chief goal is to obtain near best possible upper bounds
for the number of solutions of such systems, for a large class of such systems.
The second major project is to improve lower bounds for large gaps between prime
numbers and chains of consecutive gaps between primes, and gain more information
about the integers within such gaps. The principal investigator will also
investigate related problems about the distribution of primes in arithmetic
progressions to large moduli and the efficiency of hypergraph coverings, both
important tools in research on prime gaps. Further projects include refining the
counting function of distinct values taken by Carmichael's function, and
studying the distribution modulo 1 of the zeros of the Riemann zeta function.
