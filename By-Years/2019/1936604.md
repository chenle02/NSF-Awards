Non-technical abstract &lt;br/&gt;Meeting of New Investigators is organized to
provide researchers with necessary information about NSF process, opportunities
and mechanisms related to proposal submission. A group of first-time applicants
or those who did not apply to NSF in the past will be provided helpful
information designed to improve their proposal writing skills and understand the
NSF process better. A mock proposal review activity will enable better
understanding of the merit review process. Participation of PIs from small
colleges and underrepresented groups was encouraged. Applicants from
underrepresented groups are especially encouraged to apply, with a goal of
broadening participation of talented new PIs from diverse backgrounds in STEM
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract &lt;br/&gt;Participants of the
2019 MPS Workshop for New Investigators will receive information about the NSF
process presented by current or past Program Directors. Specifically, the
participants will be trained in Merit Review Principles, writing a successful
proposal, building a strong Broader Impact component, Conflict of Interest and
Ethics rules and they will learn about funding opportunities within NSF.
Participants will write and review one-page proposals, to be evaluated by
panels, including a full panel review process, discussion and writing panel
summaries. The two-day intensive training obtained during the Workshop is
expected to be most beneficial to a diverse pool of young PIs and increase their
chances of successful interactions with NSF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is
co-funded by Divisions within the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical
Sciences: Division of Physics, Division of Mathematical Sciences, Division of
Chemistry, Division of Astronomical Sciences and Division of Materials
Research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
