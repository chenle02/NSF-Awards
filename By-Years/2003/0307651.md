#0307651&lt;br/&gt;Title: A GENERALIZED FRAMEWORK FOR THE CONTROL OF
CHEMOFLUIDIC ACTUATORS&lt;br/&gt;PI: Goldfarb, Michael&lt;br/&gt;Vanderbilt
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work focuses on the
formulation of a framework for the control of chemofluidic actuators for self-
powered robots. The control of these actuators is markedly different from
standard types of actuators and as such requires the development of unique
approaches to their motion and force control. In order to make such chemofluidic
actuators broadly available to the robotics community, a formalized theoretical
framework for the low-level (i.e., position, force, impedance) control of such
actuators will be developed. The proposed work includes system identification
for establishing a first-principles lumped-parameter model of reaction dynamics,
energetic transport delays, hydraulic flow dynamics, pneumatic flow dynamics,
and the transduction of thermal energy through the constitutive behavior of a
gas into the mechanical domain. Nonlinear observers will be developed to enable
elimination or minimization of sensor requirements, which in turn will reduce
the cost of implementation of such a system. Thirdly, nonlinear control design
will be fused with nonlinear optimization methods to render the multi-input
single-output system energetically efficient. The result of this work will be a
chemofluidic actuator modeling and control framework that will enable others in
the robotics community to safely and effectively incorporate similar actuators
into self-powered robots. &lt;br/&gt;
