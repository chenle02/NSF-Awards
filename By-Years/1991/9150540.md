This project will develop and implement the second semester of a newly conceived
integrated science course for elementary education majors. This one-year course
includes topics from chemistry, earth science, and biology in the first
semester, and topics from physics, astronomy and meteorology in the second
semester. The principal objective of the course is to prepare students to teach
science in the elementary schools. Thus, the lectures rely heavily on
demonstrations and the explanation of natural phenomena through what is termed a
"discrepancy approach". A major innovative feature of this project is the heavy
emphasis on laboratory experiences. In the lab, the prospective teachers perform
hands-on activities which they will utilize in the future in their own
elementary classrooms.
