The New York Academy of Science will implement the Early Steps ResearchTraining
Program, a ten week summer program with an academic year component designed to
involve 142 students in grades 8 through 12 in the state of New York. This
program will foster and encourage a multi-cultural participation by Asian,
Black, Hispanic, Native American and Caucasian junior and senior high school
students exploring science and technology career options. A major impediment to
active participation of lower social-economic level students has been the
inability of their parents to support them financially when the local school
systems cannot pay for external science and technologyeducation experiences. The
Young Scholars Program Project would enable the New York Academy of Sciences to
offer cost free to students, the Bridge to Environmental Sciences Careers, a new
program and expand minority youth participation in our existing Advance Skills
Internship Program. Twenty-five (25) minority 8th - 10th grade students selected
from New York City junior and senior high schools will be involved in THE BRIDGE
TO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES CAREERS, a new project which provides hands-
onexperiences in the environmental science and technology related occupations.
Participants will be engaged in environmental problem solving, conservation
leadership and skill development training workshops, fieldtrips and internships.
Approximately 117 11th - 12th grade students will be selected from high schools
in New York City and six New York State Counties, to participate in the ADVANCE
SKILLS INTERNSHIPS component. Students will be assigned for eight weeks with an
outstanding scientist as their mentors at commercial, industrial laboratories,
research facilities at colleges, universities, local government and
environmental science sites in the State of New York. ***//
