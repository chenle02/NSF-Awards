The relationship between leaf longevity and the physiology and secondary
metabolite production among leaves varying in longevity is an area severely
lacking in information. This proposal, through various hypotheses and rigorous
experimental designs, seeks to better understand these relationships and to
provide baseline data about the interactions between leaf longevity, leaf
physiology, and secondary metabolite production. Information gained from this
study will be useful in understanding how plants with leaves of varying
longevity may defend these important photosynthetic tissues against herbivores
and pathogens. Such information would be useful in theoretical considerations
dealing with photosynthesis of crop and forest systems, and in describing how
the polyphenolic defenses of plant species in natural communities have evolved.
Furthermore, compounds or structures will be identified that may not be known
and may prove useful as natural insecticides. For example, on the basis of
preliminary data submitted in the original proposal, none of the 15 known
phenolic compounds for which we screened tissue were present in the plants from
Panama.
