This proposal seeks to initiate geodetic measurements of plate motion in the
Cascadia subduction zone. Three sites off the Oregon coast, one on the incoming
plate to measure relative plate motion and two on the continental slope to
measure motions related to fault motions and deformation will be monitored for
horizontal displacement at the cm scale. These will be the first offshore
monitors of upper-plate Cascadia motion and fault behavior. This work will lead
to a better understanding of earthquake and tsunami risk in Cascadia. It
implements a new autonomous approach to data collection. It places permanent
benchmarks on the seafloor so that monitoring can continue into the indefinite
future. Transponders will be recovered and reused and become part of instrument
pool that can be used to extend these studies in the future
