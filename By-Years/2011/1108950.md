This work aims to constrain models of the physical conditions of star formation
by focusing on the dissipation of proto-planetary disks. As a test of the
importance of stellar irradiation to the physics and chemistry of the
environments of pre-MS and MS stars, the PI will make key observations of
infrared and radio emission lines of key molecular species such as HCO+, HCN, CN
and CO of the disks around eight nearby young stars undergoing accretion. He and
his team will conduct ground-based mid-IR and space-based far-IR spectroscopy
(Chandra, Spitzer, Herschel), and radio spectroscopy with single-dish
instruments (IRAM 30-m, JCMT and APEX), the SMA and ALMA. He will also carry out
detailed numerical simulations of the spectral lines to constrain the radiation
field information. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program will have broader impacts
of training a postdoctoral researcher, producing a series of animations and
lectures on topics related to planet-formation, and developing a new course on
orbital resonances.
