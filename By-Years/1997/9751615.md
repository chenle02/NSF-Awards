This is a proposal to provide equipment for an undergraduate neurobiology
course and for undergraduate independent research involving neurobiology
techniques. Each year the laboratory course will impact 12 students, with at
least 2 more students able to use the equipment for independent research. An
additional 171 students enrolled in other courses will also benefit through the
equipment being used in laboratory exercises or lecture demonstrations. The
course helps fill a significant gap in the undergraduate education at the
University of Tennessee, Knoxville, in that there are no laboratory courses
devoted to the rapidly growing area of neuroscience. The proposed course will
compliment the lecture course, Foundations in Neurobiology (BCMB 415), currently
being taught by the PI and Co-PI. The proposed laboratory course is an intensive
semester-long analysis of the neural circuitry controlling feeding behavior in
the snail, Lymnaea stagnalis. During the course, students will be exposed to a
variety of neuroanatomical and electrophysiological techniques while they learn
basic principles associated with the field of neurobiology. In addition to
completing 5 formal exercises, students will also be given the opportunity to
conduct their own hypothesis-driven experiments. Required written reports and an
oral presentation of the results of their independent project will provide
students with further training necessary for advancing in the field of
neuroscience. Finally, lab exercises will be disseminated electronically via the
development of a neurobiology laboratory page accessible via the World Wide Web.
