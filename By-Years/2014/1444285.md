This grant enables student participation at the International Conference on
Machine Learning (ICML). ICML is one of the premier conferences in Machine
Learning. In addition to rigorously refereed conference papers, it features
poster sessions, tutorials, workshops and invited talks. This award provides
funds for travel scholarships for students from US institutions to help cover
their travel and costs of attending the conference. The selection of students to
be funded is based on a review by the selection committee of their authorship
and financial needs. The student scholarships are very important for encouraging
student participation in this premier conference and for shaping the future of
the field as a whole. Special attention will be paid to broadening the
participation of students from groups that are traditionally underrepresented in
Computer Science in general and Machine Learning research in particular, and
students from institutions with limited Machine Learning expertise who would
benefit from the opportunity to interact with researchers from around the world.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attendance at the ICML represents a unique opportunity for
students interested in Machine Learning research. The poster sessions at the
conference are designed enable students to recieve feedback from leading Machine
Learning researchers from around the world and to help them become part of the
larger Machine Learning research community. The award contributes to the
education and training of the next generation of researchers and educators in an
increasingly important area. It also helps broaden the participation of
underrepresented groups and women in Machine Learning research.
