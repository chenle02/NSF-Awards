This research is focussed on two projects. The first part involves continued
studies on magnetites and zinc-ferrites. The main thrust of this research is
directed to the investigation of nickel sulphide-selenide systems. This material
exhibits properties of a good insulator, a good metal, or a metal-insulator for
x values of 0, 2, and 0.5, respectively. This property presumably is driven by
electron correlation effects. The systems can be studied by varying the
sulphide/selenide ratio while leaving the cation sublattice intact. The
following studies are planned: growth of single crystals, followed by
adjustments of stoichiometry, electrical measurements, magnetization
investigations, specific heat studies, structural research, and optical
measurements. The data acquisition is not just of intrinsic interest but is to
be used to identify the changeover from the insulating state, through a narrow
band correlated state, to the metal-insulated transition regime, and into the
region of good metallic behavior, during which the lattice remains basically
unaltered. The data thus serve as a test for current theories of electron
transport in the various regimes.
