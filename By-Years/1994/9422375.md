9422375 Niemi How term limits affect legislative representation was addressed as
early as the debate surrounding the adoption of the Constitution, but the matter
was then largely set aside for 200 years. Beginning with California in 1990,
however, some sixteen states have enacted term limits for their state
legislative or congressional representatives, and additional states are likely
to enact such limits in the near future. Owing to this recent timing, most
writings about the topic are prescriptive, but the arguments are intense and the
claims are grandiose. This project is the first large-scale study of the actual
effects of term limits, The investigators will focus on the state legislative
level. The heart of the project consists of: a) a mail survey of all state
legislators as of spring 1995; b) personal interviews during 1995 with
legislators and key political observers in four states, one highly
professionalized legislature with term limits, one more amateur legislature with
term litis, and one of each type without term limits. In addition, the
investigators will make use of data on state legislative elections as well as
other published data about legislators and the legislatures. This project should
substantially enhance our understanding of this interesting and important topic.
