This research is concerned with the computer modelling of the fluid dynamics of
aquatic animal propulsion, in which the fluid motion is described by the
incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and the immersed organism is regarded as
a filament undergoing time-dependent motion. In contrast to previous studies
there is no restriction placed on the size of the Reynolds number or on the
dependence of the amplitude of the swimming motion upon its direction. Among the
specific goals of the research are the modelling of different modes of swimming
such as jet propulsion and undulation and the modelling of three-dimensional
motions. The motions of immersed animals in water have always been of interest
to naturalists and fluid dynamicists, both for their inherent aesthetic beauty
and for the insights they provide into our understanding of the fluid dynamics
of bodies moving in air and water. Here the principal investigator will use the
power of a supercomputer to model the behavior of organisms swimming in water
over a range of body shapes and sizes and speeds that has not been attempted
before.
