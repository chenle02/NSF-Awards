This program provides scholarships to low-income, academically talented
students, many from underrepresented groups, to complete associates degrees in
computer information systems, engineering, and mathematics. In addition to
expanded and individualized academic support services, the project supports a
wide range of activities for students, including internships, mentoring and
research opportunities. There is significant involvement in the program by high
schools, industry/government, and four-year colleges for recruitment, retention,
and transfer of students. &lt;br/&gt;
