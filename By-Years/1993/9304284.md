Professor Reeder will continue his work on the representations of p-adic
algebraic groups. He will seek explicit results about the representations
containing an Iwahori-fixed vector. This work exploits the interplay between
p-adic harmonic analysis and complex algebraic geometry. This project falls into
the general area of arithmetic geometry -a subject that blends two of the oldest
areas of mathematics: number theory and geometry. This combination has proved
extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems that withstood
generations. Among its many consequences are new error correcting codes. Such
codes are essential for both modern computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
