This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) is to develop a new liquid
metal flow anemometry method suitable for use at temperatures above the
operating range of existing non-consumable probes (i.e. at temperatures in
excess of 770 degrees Celsius). It is anticipated that the device will provide
spatial and temporal resolution on the order of 2 mm and 1 ms, respectively,
thus significantly improving upon present measurement capabilities. The device,
fabricated from temperature resistant ceramics, will incorporate thin pressure-
sensitive ceramic diaphragms and dual-cantilever. The development of a new
liquid metal flow anemometry method will provide the basis for a number of new
technical and scientific applications, most notably high-temperature process
control and monitoring, and high resolution velocity measurements in fundamental
liquid metal flow studies.
