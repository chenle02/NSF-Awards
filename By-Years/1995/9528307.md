This starter grant award to Ohio State University will support the research of
Professor Christopher M. Hadad. The theme of the research is gas phase studies
of reactive intermediates by a combined approach of experiment with theory. The
fundamental reactions of radicals in the gas phase will be studied using a
variable temperate flowing afterglow-neutral flow reactor. The hybrid system
allows the generation of radicals via flash vacuum pyrolytic methods followed by
examination of the chemistry with neutral reagents. The experimental information
is supplemented by computational studies -- ab initio molecular orbital
calculations to provide insight into transition state structures and possible
mechanistic alternatives. This research will advance the fundamental
understanding of radical reactions relevant to combustion and atmospheric
chemistry. Such knowledge is important to the efficient use of fuel resources
and for maintaining the environment.
