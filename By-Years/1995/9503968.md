9503968 Moody In this project robust artificial neural network (ANN) learning
algorithms and tools for forecasting time series, with specific applications to
financial and economic time series will be developed. These algorithms and tools
are difficult to predict due to the non-normal distribution of the noise and the
presence of outliers, as well as the nonstationarity of both noise and signals.
They thus make excellent benchmark problems for robust nonlinear modeling
techniques. In robust models, robust error measures for gracefully handling
outliers in the data will be incorporated. Also, a new method for automatically
regularizing (constraining) the ANN model during training by using second order
statistics of the cost function gradient. This prevents the network from
adapting to noise and thus produces robust models. In the area of learning
algorithms, the application of a new simulated annealing type learning algorithm
to recurrent networks will be investigated. It is believed that, based upon past
experience with feedforward networks with many hidden layers, this algorithm
will improve the performance of recurrent networks. In variable selection, a
novel use of genetic algorithms (GA) in combination with ANN models to select
optimal subsets of variables for solving a problem will be pursued. Combining
GAs with a newly developed statistical test, the so-called delta-test, into a
more powerful tool for determining the optimal variable subset will also be
done. ***
