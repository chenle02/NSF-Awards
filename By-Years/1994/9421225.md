ABSTRACT HARVEY, Paul The Starfire system is a state-of-the-art 1.5m adaptive
optics telescope with laser guide star correction. This means that for objects
brighter than about 9 mag (visible) it is possible to obtain essentially
diffraction limited imaging over a field of view of order 10-20 arcseconds at
near-infrared wavelengths. For fainter objects, it is still possible to obtain
such imaging over short time periods, of order 0.05-0.1 sec by using the laser
guide star with no optical "tracking" correction. This capability opens up a
variety of astronomical problems for observational breakthroughs. The first
scientific goal in this program is to obtain images of pre-main-sequence stars
to study the distribution of circumstellar matter on solar-system size spatail
scales. The second goal is to search for brown-dwarf companions to known, young
T-Tauri type stars. This project makes use of the fact the T-Tauri stars have a
relatively well defined age, and thus any companions that are found were
probably formed nearly simultaneously. The final goal of the program is to
determine the relative abundance of old giants and young supergiants in several
"starburst" galactic nuclei. this will make it possible to estimate the ages of
the starbursts and hence their frequency, much more reliably.
