9321019 Jasso This project is part of a program of theoretical research, with a
substantive focus on social comparison theory and a methodological focus on the
mathematical and statistical techniques of theoretical work. There are two
overarching goals. The first goal is to extend and refine comparison theory and
prepare it for empirical test, by renewed scrutiny of its postulates, continued
derivation of implications for varied domains. The second goal is to systematize
and sharpen the methods employed in the development of comparison theory,
especially through computer simulation, so that they can be used in the
development of other theories. %%% Social comparison theory is one of the chief
contenders for a scientific model of how people decide whether they have been
treated justly in social exchanges, and thus it offers a theoretical basis for
explanations of many forms of human behavior in situations marked by
competition. This abstract theoretical work lays the intellectual basis for
empirical research applied to human problems. ***
