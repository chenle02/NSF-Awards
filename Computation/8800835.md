Two areas of research are proposed: the computational complexity of
approximating zeros of polynomials and systems of polynomials. The main focus of
the proposed projects on linear programming is on interior algorithms. The
primary objective of these projects is to develop a better understanding ot the
mathematics underlying the algorithms so that provably efficient modifications
to the algorithms can be made. Both worst-case and average-case measures of
efficiency are to be considered. The goal of the proposed projects on polynomial
zero approximation is to develop mathematics which is useful for constructing
theoretically fast algorithms and useful for proving results regarding the
inherent difficulty of the zero approximation problem.
