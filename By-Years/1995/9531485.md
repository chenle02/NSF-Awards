35th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) to be held in Kobe, Japan

important conferences on control theory and applications. The Kobe location will
be only the third time the CDC has been held outside the United States. The
requested funds will be instrumental in improving the technical success of the
conference by enabling participation of sufficient numbers of key U.S. authors.
