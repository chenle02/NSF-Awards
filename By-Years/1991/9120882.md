The aim of this project is to initiate a program of paleontological and
geological exploration in the Manonga Valley of northern Tanzania in order to
ascertain the potential of the fossil sites in the area for the study of human
evolution. A preliminary reconnaissance by the principal investigator in 1990
demonstrated that the Manonga Valley which has been almost completely unexplored
previously, is an area of tremendous potential for future paleoanthropological
research. The ancient lake basin, with its extensive, well-exposed and fossil-
rich sediments can now be considered one of the most significant paleontological
research areas in eastern Africa. Only a few isolated and fragmentary fossil
remains of early human ancestors are known from Africa prior to 4 million years
ago. The estimated age of the sites in the Manonga Valley (3-6 million years
old), in conjunction with their paleontological productivity, and their close
geographical proximity to other important sites that have yielded fossils
pertinent to human evolution, makes the region of evident significance for the
study of human origins. The major objectives of the project are: (1) to make
paleontological collections at the principal fossil localities and to continue
to prospect for new sites; (2) to further assess the geological context and the
age of the fossil sites; and (3) to obtain data that will help to reconstruct
the paleoenvironmental setting of the ancient lake basin.
