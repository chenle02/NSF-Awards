This research investigates the temporal correlation of eight years of Total
Ozone Mapping Spectrometer and Microwave Brightness Temperature data. This
project would be the first study to perform such correlations on a global scale.
Results would isolate regions where total ozone data could corroborate recent
observational reports of atmospheric normal modes and provide input for current
atmospheric climate modeling attempts. This research is important because
climate models that must account for ozone concentrations and variations require
implicit techniques using correlations such as those studied under this grant.
