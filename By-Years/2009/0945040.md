This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I research project aims to
make trend discovery on text documents a mainstream activity within the familiar
workflow of search engine users, by using a linguistic approach that leverages
many years of prior commercial research and technology development. The
objective of this research is to develop the right representations and
algorithms, implement a prototype, experiment with the appropriate user
interfaces to support both initial discovery and the end-user's assessment of
the discovered trends, and evaluate the system's ability to enable insightful
trends that are not available with normal use of search engines.

Executives, market analysts, science and technology monitors, and government
intelligence analysts all are concerned with finding trends. There are
established commercial business-intelligence methods for finding and
understanding trends in structured data. However, research accomplishments from
trend detection in text data have not entered mainstream use because of
complicated user experiences and an inability to discern what are truly emerging
topics, rather than merely recurring salient topics or linguistic variations on
old topics, e.g., "lawsuit" as an old topic and "litigation" as a new topic. If
successfully embedded within the familiar search workflow, it is anticipated
that trend discovery will be a boon to many knowledge-work professions, leading
to early detection of changes that can impact science, technology, government,
healthcare, and business performance.
