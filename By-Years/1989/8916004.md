This study will continue work begun on a previous grant on the vibrational
properties of silicate minerals and related systems. Infrared and Raman
spectroscopy will be used, coupled with solid state nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) spectroscopy and ab initio molecular orbital calculations, to study the
structures and thermodynamic properties of high pressure hydrated silicate
minerals, the mechanism and composition dependence of water solubility in
aluminosilicate melts, and pressure-dependent coordination changes of Si and Al
in aluminosilicate melts and glasses. This will further the understanding of and
the capability of modelling of a broad range of earth materials.
