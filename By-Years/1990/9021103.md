The purpose of this research is to identify and quantify the metal species that
exist as a result of thermal degradation of hazardous waste. To realize this
objective three task have been formulated: 1) to review the literature for
analytical methods which have been applied to the determination of metal species
2) to apply existing methods or develop new methods to analyze for metal species
in samples obtained from a controlled combustion environment, and 3) to modify
or develop and test metal species sampling systems To this end, analytical
methods using the currently available techniques of ion chromatography and X-ray
diffraction to identify and quantify the metal species found in the gas phase of
an experimental reactor will be developed, along with a sampling system for
metal species. Future research will determine the effect of combustion
parameters (e.g. temperature, chemical makeup, and residence time) on the metal
species formed. Knowledge of the actual species will be utilized to develop an
algorithm to predict the fate of the metal constituents during rotary-kiln
incineration.
