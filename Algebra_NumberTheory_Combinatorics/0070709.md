This proposal concerns questions related to intersection multiplicities and the
study of divisor class groups. The intersection multiplicities studied by the
investigator include Serre's multiplicity, Dutta's limit multiplicity and the
Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity, all intimately related, most notably via the theory
of localized Chern characters of Baum, Fulton, and MacPherson. Of particular
interest are the following: the connection between characteristic p and
characteristic zero situations, the possible misbehavior of Serre's multiplicity
when both modules have finite projective dimension, and the question of the
rigidity of Tor. Some of these projects will be joint work with Anurag Singh.
The second project involves the study of how the divisor class group changes
between a variety and a hypersurface inside that variety. The third project
involves determining the divisor class groups of symmetric mixed ladder
determinantal varieties.

Commutative algebra is a crucial tool in developing the foundations of algebraic
geometry. Together with number theory, these fields were in the center of the
revolutionary new approaches and ways of thinking about classical problems which
were eventually responsible for the modernization of much of mathematics in the
middle of this last century. Noether, Krull, Weil, Grothendieck, Serre and
Zariski were among those who brought about this revolution. Especially central
was the modern development of intersection theory and it continues to be an
especially exciting and important area of research. In the same time period, the
importance of divisor class groups was realized and the connection between those
of a variety and a hypersurface in the variety has been a question of interest
since then. Eventually these studies lead to applications, such as the recent
example of algebro-geometric codes in coding theory.
