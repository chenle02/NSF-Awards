This research is an expansion on an existing atlas being maintained at the
University of Denver of high resolution balloon-borne infrared solar absorption
stratospheric spectra of trace species in the upper troposphere and
stratosphere. The effort includes corresponding laboratory, ground-based and
theoretical studies initiated under earlier NSF awards. This work contributes to
the field of atmospheric chemistry by improving fundamental knowledge in the
solar spectroscopy of molecules in the stratosphere.
