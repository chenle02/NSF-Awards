A request is made to fund additional and back-up instrumentation for the R/V
Pelican, a 116 foot Coastal vessel operated by the Louisiana Universities Marine
Consortium (LUMCON) as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory
System (UNOLS) research fleet. The vessel is owned by the LUMCON and the mission
of the ship is to support funded oceanographic research in the Gulf of Mexico.
With this proposal, LUMCON provides technical descriptions and rationale for the
acquisition of the following Oceanographic
Instrumentation:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Knudsen Chirp 3260 Dual Channel
Echosounder $80,690&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The
principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of
the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for
scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of
their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo
separate review by the relevant research program of NSF). The acquisition,
maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded
researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated
instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and
expanding the base of potential researchers.
