New US/Russian findings imply catastrophic flooding of the continental shelf of
the Black Sea in mid 6000 BC. A shelly gravel surface marking an erosional event
extends across the entire northern Black Sea continental shelf. This event has
important implications for Holocene climate in the intercontinental setting of
Eastern Europe and the exchange through Bosporus and Dardanelle Straits. The PI
will use the existing sediment core material and conduct a new field program
with European scientists. Sediment, faunal and isotopic analyses will be used
together with C-14 dating and ultra-high resolution seismic profiling and wide-
aperture multibeam bathymetry to test these ideas.
