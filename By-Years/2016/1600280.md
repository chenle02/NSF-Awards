The main research focus of this proposal is to create a platform that allows to
automatically find attacks in unmodified binaries of distributed systems. The
attacks are conducted through message manipulation by insider attackers and
impact primarily performance and availability. The platform combines existent
open-source virtualization environments such as KVM, and network simulation and
emulation tools such as NS3, to create a realistic environment in which target
systems will run. The platform is general, scalable, and can be used for testing
a large variety of distributed systems such as intrusion-tolerant and peer-to-
peer systems.

The platform will improve the trust that distributed systems work according to
their intended specifications in spite of faults, misconfigurations, or attacks.
The platform can serve as a tool for system developers from industry, government
labs, and academia to test their systems. In addition, it can be used for
programing exercises for distributed systems and computer security courses at
both undergraduate and graduate level.
