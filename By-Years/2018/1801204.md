Research Initiation Awards provide support for junior and mid-career faculty at
Historically Black Colleges and Universities who are building new research
programs or redirecting and rebuilding existing programs. It is expected that
the award helps to further the faculty member's research capability and
effectiveness, improves research and teaching at the home institution, and
involves undergraduate students in research experiences. The award to Howard
University aims to reveal how spatiotemporal information is integrated and used
by cells to affect signaling pathways promoting expulsion of substances from
cells (exocytosis) and will enable researchers to better understand how
exocytosis allows cells to communicate with other cells, tissues, and the
extracellular space. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exocytosis is a fundamental cellular
behavior that is ubiquitous across eukaryotes and other cell types. The goal of
this study is to provide a better understanding of how proteins, lipids, and the
actin cytoskeleton network act as organizing "elements" regulating exocytosis.
Fluorescence microscopy will be utilized to establish an understanding of the
spatial and temporal requirements governing the biophysical principles that
organize cell membranes and influence biological processes like regulated
exocytosis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
