This project is concerned with statistical model selection by means of
optimization of information criteria. Specifically, the investigator develops a
generalization of the Bayesian information criterion for irregular model
selection problems, such as determining the number of components in mixture
models or the number of factors in latent factor models. The main difficulty in
these irregular model selection problems is a lack of parameter identifiability.
The investigator studies identifiability properties of widely used statistical
models to provide the mathematical foundation for application of the new
information criterion.

Virtually every scientific data analysis brings about a problem of statistical
model choice, where the different statistical models capture different
scientific hypotheses. In many applications, the hypotheses involve latent
variables that cannot or were not observed. Such latent variables could be, for
instance, notions of intelligence in a psychological study or variables
describing a patient's genetic composition in a medical study. Statistical
models that are formulated using such latent variables typically lack the
regularity properties that underlie the justification of standard statistical
procedures. This project develops new statistical techniques for model selection
that are theoretically justified and allow for an improved assessment of model
uncertainty in a wide array of applications in which influential unobserved
variables are at play.
