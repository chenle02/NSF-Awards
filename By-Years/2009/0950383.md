The purpose of this grant is to study the structure of certain categories of
sheaves on symplectic algebraic varieties. When the variety in question is the
cotangent bundle to a flag variety, then the category that one obtains is
equivalent to a block of the "Category O" of representations of a Lie algebra,
originally introduced by Bernstein, Gelfand, and Gelfand. For this reason, this
category is referred to as "Geometric Category O". This category is conjectured
to have many beautiful properties, which have been verified in certain special
cases that arise naturally from representation theory and polyhedral geometry.
Chief among these conjectures is that the categories are Koszul, and that each
symplectic variety has a "symplectic dual" whose associated category is Koszul
dual to that of the original variety. This phenomenon is expected to form a
bridge between various approaches to categorification of Lie algebra
representations and link invariants that were previously thought to be
unrelated.

Symplectic algebraic varieties arise naturally from many different areas of
mathematics. Geometric and topological properties of hypertoric varieties have
shed new light on the topology of hyperplane arrangements and the combinatorics
of matroids. Quiver varieties provide geometric realizations of actions of
infinite dimensional Lie algebras, leading to canonical bases and to actions on
categories of sheaves. This grant plays a key role in this picture, providing
new geometric insight to such phenomena as Gale duality in combinatorics and
level-rank duality in representation theory. This project will contribute to
each of these endeavors independently, and will also advance a common treatment
that unifies our understanding of the various individual phenomena. In addition
to the research component, the grant includes an annual workshop for graduate
students and postdocs that bridges these various fields.
