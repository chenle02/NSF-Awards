This proposal will develop the theory of "flocking": the collective, coherent
motion of large numbers of organisms or biomolecules. This ubiquitous biological
phenomenon occurs for organisms (flocks of birds, schools of fish), cells
(collections of swimming bacteria, migration of cancer cells in tumors) and
subcellular molecules (long molecules such as microtubules and actin filaments
involved in the operation and reproduction of cells). The project will apply
ideas originally developed for fluid dynamics (air flow over airplane wings,
weather forecasting, and plumbing) to flocks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
will extend that approach to investigating what holds flocks together at their
boundaries; to study the effects of birth and death of organisms or molecules
(which is very important for molecules inside living cells, which are constantly
created and destroyed as they move), and to compare predictions of the theory
with experiments on diverse biological systems. Among these are experiments on
the mitotic spindle, a spindle-shaped structure of long, rigid molecules called
microtubules that forms inside cells when they divide, and which acts to
separate the chromosomes into the two daughter cells. This work will also
address flocks of organisms (such as birds and fish) to study their shapes and
how those shapes fluctuate as the flock moves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work is
strongly interdisciplinary and will advance condensed-matter physics, molecular
biophysics, cellular biology, fluid mechanics, organismal biology, and medicine
(through a deeper understanding of processes that impact cancer cell migration
and wound healing). The proposed work will integrate research and learning by
involving students and postdoctoral fellows in the research, and through the
development of new course materials at CU-Boulder and the University of Oregon.
