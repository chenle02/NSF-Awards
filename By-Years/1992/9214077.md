The classical crystallographic groups of ordinary Euclidean space are basic
examples of discrete subgroups of Lie groups. The crystallographic groups
arising in the very rigid geometric structures known as locally symmetric spaces
of higher rank have been classified by Margulis. Witte will investigate whether
these important groups can be realized as symmetries of one-dimensional spaces.
Witte will also investigate the crystallographic groups that arise in
homogeneous spaces other than the usual symmetric spaces. This project involves
research in ergodic theory. Ergodic theory in general concerns understanding the
average behavior of systems whose dynamics is too complicated or chaotic to be
followed in microscopic detail. Under the heading "dynamics can be placed the
modern theory of how groups of abstract transformations act on smooth spaces. In
this way ergodic theory makes contact with geometry in its quest to classify
flows on homogeneous spaces.
