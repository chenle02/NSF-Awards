In symplectic topology, computation of Fukaya categories can be broken into two
steps: (1) identify a collection of Lagrangians from which all others can be
obtained by formal algebraic constructions; we say that this entails finding a
generating subcategory, then (2) explicitly determine the product (and higher
multiplications) for the generating subcategory. The PI proposes to study
generalisations of a newly developed generation criterion to families of
Lagrangian manifolds, and to the variants of Fukaya categories associated to
Landau-Ginzburg models. This will enlarge the class of symplectic manifolds for
which large parts of Floer theory can be explicitly
described.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Symplectic manifolds give an abstract setting
generalising the relationship between position and momentum in classical
mechanics. The study of such manifolds has recently impacted areas as diverse as
the study of knots (mathematically understood as embeddings of circles in
space), and theoretical physics. This proposal will study algebraic invariants
that appear in symplectic topology, with the goal of furthering our
understanding of the subject and its applications.
