The request is for funds, for scientists and science educators K-16 from the US,
to participate in an International Conference on the topic of a Global Science
Curriculum Framework. All countries are interested in being or becoming globally
competitive and more and more countries are signing on to participate in the
international assessments of mathematics and science such as TIMSS and PISA. It
is vital that the US participates in discussions related to all aspects of
research and development in science education for all students. The US
participants will share a new science education framework developed by the Math
and Science Partnership (MSP) project, Promoting Rigorous Outcomes in
Mathematics and Science (PROM/SE). &lt;br/&gt;This request is for funds for the
PI and 5-6 other US representatives, from K-12 and higher education, to attend
the next conference to be held in Paris 2009. The request is for $14,000 in
travel funds. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
