This is a continuation of a study based on the GEM program in 2009 where its
research was originally funded for three years. This covers that last two years
of that effort. The only change is the location at which the research will be
carried out. The effort had two parts. One is to carry out a scientific
investigation and the second is to aid in running the scientific parts of the
GEM program. Both tasks are discussed below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
plasmasphere is a region of relatively dense cold plasma (1000 cm-3) found near
the Earth (~ 4 RE). This is proposal to use data analysis and simulation to
investigate drainage of this cold plasma from the plasmasphere and its effect on
the dynamics of the magnetosphere. Recent findings indicate that leakage of
plasma from the plasmasphere may affect magnetospheric dynamics during disturbed
times. This research will focus on four of the effects that have been suggested
during magnetic storms. In particular the following questions will be examined:
1) Does the cold plasma affect the reconnection rate at the dayside
magnetosphere? 2) Does this reduce the overall solar-wind/magnetosphere
coupling? 3) Does the cold plasma influence the decay of electron radiation
belts? 4) Does it lead to radiation belt dropouts and sudden recoveries? Answers
to these questions should lead to a deeper understanding of the effects of cold
plasma in the magnetosphere.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This research will impact
future global models to magnetospheric dynamics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GEM
program's research protocol is to concentrate on specific focus topics. Each of
these lasts three years. Part of the funding for this research will be used to
help coordinate two of these focus group efforts. These are the focus group on
'Plasmasphere-Magnetosphere Interactions' and the group on 'Diffuse Auroral
Precipitation'.
