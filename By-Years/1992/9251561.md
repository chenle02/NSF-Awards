The undergraduate program is being strengthened by providing student access to
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy throughout the curriculum,
including courses for non-science majors as well as undergraduate research. This
project will allow students to use specialized techniques to conduct
investigations that would not be possible otherwise. For example, non-science
students use attenuated total reflectance to identify unknown fabric samples;
organic chemistry students use diffuse reflectance and thin-layer chromatography
to identify and analyze complex organic mixtures; physical chemistry students
analyze gas phase spectra, including vibrational isotope shifts; and analytical
chemistry students carry out a modified gas chromatography interfacing
experiment.
