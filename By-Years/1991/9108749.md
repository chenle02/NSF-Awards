This project is concerned with research in algebraic combinatorics and
combinatorics motivated by theoretical computer science. The principal
investigator will consider problems pertaining to an algebraic and topological
investigation of partially ordered sets of combinatorial objects, sorting of
partially ordered sets, and graph coloring in connection with distributed
computing. This research falls in the broad category of combinatorics, which is
one of the most active fields in today's mathematics. Combinatorics represents a
systematization of the very first of all mathematical activities, counting. In
its modern development, however, combinatorics has gone beyond just counting to
make use of a wide variety of advanced mathematical techniques. The field has
had an explosive development in the past few decades because of its importance
in communications and information technology.
