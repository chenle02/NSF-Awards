Every country in Western Europe has become multicultural in the most fundamental
sense of the containing multiple cultures. But is far from obvious how to go
forward. Universalism in the French style has not been successful. Neither has
the approach taken by Great Britain or the Netherlands. If mutual accommodation
is desirable, how can it take place. This purpose of this study is identify
terms under which a national majority will willingly include Muslim immigrants
as full members in their new societies on terms acceptable to both the majority
and the minority populations. This will be done by conducting a series of
experiments in the Netherlands and Denmark. The results of this study could be
of use to policy-makers across the globe who are dealing with growing minority
populations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mutual accommodation is a topic that has just
begun to be examined by social scientists. The usual manner of studying this
topic is to either use limited ethnographic studies or to use national surveys
to measure attitudes. While the ethnographic studies allow one to examine causal
factors, they are limited in the scenarios that can be examined. The national
surveys can uncover attittudes towards groups, but it is difficult through
standard survey questions to get at what actions are possible. In this study the
principal investigator will be using a series of survey experiments on two
surveys that will be national in scope. The survey experiments will allow the
teasing out of causation in a much larger population than usual ethnographic
methods. In addition, it will allow the examination of what levels of
accommodation are acceptable to both sets of parties.
