This award supports U.S. student participation at the Urbino Summer School in
Paleoclimatology (USSP). Every summer since 2004 the USSP offers 40-70 graduate
students from around the world an intensive, integrative experience which
includes lectures, investigations, case-studies, parallel specialized-sessions,
and field work and analyses; building a network of young scientists in the
field. Support for faculty and student participation is shared among several
participating countries.

The summer program provides a unique immersion experience in the latest thinking
in paleoclimate science and the hands-on nature of the teaching provides a
strong bridge between theory and practice. The process for selecting
participants is structured to enable recruitment of a diverse student body.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
