As part of this Information Technology Research project, the PIs will design and
develop a US Earth Science Knowledge Node that is composed of diversified,
regional scale, reviewed, high quality earth science data sets, and related web-
accessible information retrieval and knowledge extraction tools. This system
will assist (1) earth scientists in their research, (2) educators in their
classrooms and curriculum development, (3) students in their learning and self
discovery process, (4) the public at large in their curiosity driven life-long
learning efforts related to earth science phenomena that affect their daily
lives, and (5) decision makers in their case evaluations and assessments. The
organized knowledge node will grow to become a persistent node to larger scale,
information technology driven research efforts undertaken to build distributed,
interoperable, multidisciplinary data and information networking by various
groups, such as the NSF's National Science Digital Library (NSDL), Digital
Library for Earth System Education (DLESE), the earth science research
initiative of Geoinformatics, and the broader efforts of building a Digital
Earth. Data and information management has always been a major obstacle in
sharing and accessing data. High quality, organized, and ready-to-be-used data
sets in the planned knowledge node will eliminate problems and help researchers
save time and to effectively communicate generated and available knowledge.
However, the maximum benefit of this knowledge system will come from its ability
to enable multidisciplinary earth science research by providing data sets and
data manipulation/analysis tools that will be used to understand complex earth
system dynamics. The repository will include data sets from those researchers
who do not wish to manage their data for longer terms. In addition, the PIs will
develop a web-based mapping and analysis interface that will allow seamless
access to data sets of interest and help users retrieve information fast and
efficiently. ***
