DMS 9626134 Tsay This research involves two main topics in data analysis for
processing information and making inference. The first main topic is Bayesian
modeling of multivariate time series. The research seeks to develop a unified
modeling approach for a wide variety of vector models. In particular, the
investigator proposes a nice method for simultaneous dentification of Kronecker
indexes and parameters of a vector process, and considers common features such
as common trends, common business cycles, and common nonlinearity in a large
system. For co-integrated series, the method identifies the number of common
trends at the stage of model specification and, hence, differs from the existing
methods that test co-integration rank under a given model. The research employs
Gibbs sampler in estimation; it uses closed-form conditional posterior
distributions for linear parameters, but augments the sampler with other Markov
chain methods such as the Hasting-Metropolis algorithm and the griddy Gibbs to
handle nonlinear parameters. The second topic is model uncertainty via data
perturbation in time series analysis. The research relaxes the commonly imposed
assumption of existence of a model and uses data perturbation to investigate
model uncertainty. The investigator uses single and simultaneous data-
perturbation to study the impact of model uncertainty on model selection,
parameter inference, and prediction. Based on the Kullback-Leibler measure, the
research produces a selection criterion that has three components, namely
"goodness of fit," "complexity penalty," and "uncertainty measure." This result
differs from most of the existing selection criteria that only contain the first
two components. Furthermore, the research shows that the impact of "uncertainty
measure"is most pronounced when the sample size is small. %%% This research
involves two topics in the analysis of a large system for processing information
a nd making informed decisions The results obtained are widely applicable in
many scientific fields. For example, they can be used in stochastic process
control in manufacturing, to monitor simultaneously air pollution indices at
several locations in an environmental study, to study common business cycles in
macro-economics, and to study common seasonality and trends in ozone
concentrations. The research also seeks efficient computational methods to
perform high dimensional optimization for statistical estimation. The first
topic of the research is analysis of multiple processes in which the
investigator develops a unified modeling approach that can identify the complete
dynamic structure of a large system. The structure may contain important common
characteristics such as common trends, common business cycles, and common
nonlinearity. When common trends are present, the method identifies the number
of common trends simultaneously with other relationships between the processes.
The second topic of the research is the role of model uncertainty in statistical
inference. The inference may be prediction, trend estimation, or assessing the
effects of a change in an input variable on the output variables. ***
