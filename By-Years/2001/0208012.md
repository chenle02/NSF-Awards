Li Isotopic Investigations of the Crust and
Mantle&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0208012&lt;br/&gt;PIs: Rudnick, McDonough,
Tomascak&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lithium, the lightest lithophile
element, is fluid mobile. The large mass difference between its two isotopes
makes measurement of the Li isotopic ratio a powerful tool for tracing fluid
processes in the Earth. This project will complete Li isotope investigations of
peridotite and eclogite xenoliths from the mantle and sedimentary and granitic
rocks from the continents. The goal is to understand the role that fluid
processes play in the growth of the continental lithosphere and to evaluate the
inventory of Li isotopes in major solid Earth reservoirs in order to constrain
Li isotope mass balance in the Earth system. The Li isotopic measurements will
be performed using MC-ICP-MS methodology on solutions of rocks and minerals. The
PIs have established this technique at Maryland and are routinely able to
measure 40 ng or smaller Li fractions to plus or minus1 per mil precision (2
sigma). The newly acquired data sets will provide insights into the processes
that control the Li isotopic composition of the crust and mantle, define the
d7Li of potential contributors to subduction zone magmas and, ultimately, the
influence of crustal recycling on d7Li of the mantle over time.&lt;br/&gt;
