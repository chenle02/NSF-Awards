ABSTRACT:

The principal research initiative results from a theory of Hilbert spaces of
entire functions produced in the postdoctoral years 1957--1962 and from a
related theory of Hilbert spaces of analytic functions then produced in joint
work with James Rovnyak. A striking application was made in 1984 to a proof of
the Bieberbach conjecture. Another research initiative results from a proof
obtained in 1959 of the Stone--Weierstrass theorem. An application to the
invariant subspace problem was made in 1991 by Victor Lomonosov. Existence
theorems for invariant subspaces are currently pursued by methods of the Stone--
Weierstrass theorem and of Hilbert--spaces of analytic functions. Hilbert spaces
of entire functions are being applied to a proof of the Riemann hypothesis.

The significance of the present work lies in its effective combination of two
research concepts, a classical concept whose aim is to solve difficult problems,
and a modern concept whose aim is to introduce innovative techniques. The test
of success is measured by the successful application of new methods to old
problems. The Riemann hypothesis has been a consistent aim of the present work
since the doctoral thesis. A successful conclusion of this longstanding project
would be a major contribution to mathematics.
