The departments of Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of
Wisconsin-Eau Claire have developed a scholarship program called the Excellence
in Mathematics and Computer Science (EMACS) program. The EMACS scholars will be
UWEC mathematics and computer science students selected on the basis of
financial need and academic potential. The project contains academic support in
the form of faculty and peer mentoring, student/faculty research opportunities,
capstone experiences and independent study opportunities. These students are
also provided with solid career counseling that includes preparation for
graduate school, service learning opportunities, internship opportunities and
effective employment strategies such as resume writing and interviewing skills.
This project also contains an excellent sustainability
component.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
