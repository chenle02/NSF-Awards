9407372 Schal Hydrocarbons comprise a major component of arthropod cuticle and
they play crucial roles in preventing water loss. The German cockroach sex
pheromone is derived from a hydrocarbon biosynthetic pathway. Experiments are
proposed to investigate which tissue(s) produces hydrocarbon and pheromone, how
synthesis is regulated, and examine the mechanisms of lipid transport to the
cuticle through the blood by lipophorin, a reusable protein shuttle. Dr. Schal's
results will identify critical, and potentially vulnerable, biochemical and
physiological processes in the life of the German cockroach, a worldwide pest of
tremendous ecomonic and human health importance. ***
