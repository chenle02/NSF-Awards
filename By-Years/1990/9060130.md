Radiation Monitoring Devices, Inc., is investigating the chemistry and physics
of a new approach to detect synchrotron radiation which combines thin film
semiconductor techniques with electrochemical panel technology to produce a
large area detector with 100 >m spatial resolution. This approach will lead to a
detector with sufficient density to stop diffracted rays with high quantum
efficiency while maintaining high flux performance and wide dynamic range. This
innovative solid state position sensitive X-ray detector will have the
performance needed to more fully utilize modern high intensity synchrotron
sources.
