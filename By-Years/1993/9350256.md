9350256 GRAUER This award provides support to Dr. Anne Grauer under the National
Science Foundation's Presidential Faculty Fellows (PFF) Program. The PFF Program
was established at the request of the President of the United States to
recognize and support the scholarly activities of some of the Nation's most
outstanding science and engineering faculty members early in their careers.
Awards are intended to allow Fellows to undertake self-designed, innovative
research and teaching projects, to establish research and teaching programs, and
to pursue other academic related activities. This award will allow the
investigator to pursue her research interests in the patterns of health and
disease in historic populations as a means towards reconstructing the past. In
the reconstruction of history, reliance has been placed upon documentary sources
which are often biased and frequently reflect the lives of wealthy and well-
educated adult males. Comparably less is known about the health, disease and
lives of women, children, and the poor. Dr. Grauer, using paleodemographic and
paleopathological techniques, will focus her research on this "forgotten"
population. Specifically, she will excavate the 19th century Almshouse Cemetery
near Milwaukee which provides a large sample of over 1200 individuals and well
preserved skeletal remains. The goals of the research are to reconstruct
patterns of health and disease, explore the biases of these same scientific
techniques through the analysis of the historical documentation, and formulate
hypotheses concerning human adaptation in urban environments under extreme
conditions, with particular emphasis being placed upon adaptations made by women
and children and the poor. This research promises to make an important
contribution to our understanding of the history of the urban poor. Also, this
five year award will provide an opportunity for the investigator, who is an
exceptional and innovative teacher, to train undergraduate a nd graduate
students in biological anthropology. ***
