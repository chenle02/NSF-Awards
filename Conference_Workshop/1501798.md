This award supports participation in the 2015 meeting, held at the University of
Nebraska-Lincoln during April 25-26, 2015, of an annual conference series
designed to promote interaction among junior researchers in commutative algebra
and related disciplines (including homological algebra, algebraic geometry,
K-theory, and coding theory) at Midwestern schools. The conference series is
anchored by the Universities of Kansas (KU), Missouri - Columbia (MU), and
Nebraska - Lincoln (NU). The gathering will provide an opportunity for young
algebraists to interact and establish research connections with each other. This
interaction will help to lay a foundation for fruitful research collaborations
as the participants advance in the field.

The goals of the conference are to foster collaboration among young researchers
in commutative algebra from Midwestern institutions, and to expose commutative
algebra students and postdocs from Midwestern institutions to the current work
being done in their fields at neighboring institutions. The primary impacts of
the conference are its enrichment of the research careers of the participants
and the dissemination of recent ideas in commutative algebra research at the
graduate and postdoctoral levels. In particular, the interaction and exposure to
the work of their peers will benefit students from universities with small
commutative algebra research groups, those who will become faculty at small
institutions, women, and members of groups underrepresented in mathematics. In
addition, participants will take ideas and collaborations initiated at the
conference to the institutions where they eventually establish careers.
