This research concerns the modeling and least squares parameter identification
for a class of nonlinear input-output differential and functional-differential
systems using projected equation error methods. Examples for this class will be
found in diverse areas such as pharmacokinetics, robotics, lasers, and
viscoelastic materials, as well as models for control systems engineering. The
projections are designed to obviate the necessity of dealing with unknown
initial or boundary conditions for time limited input-output data. Special
emphasis is given to a projection method based on Fourier type modulating
functions which facilitates utilizing well known DFT/FFT techniques at each
stage of the least squares identification. Proposed topics include delineating
and extending the class of nonlinear systems that are amenable to the projection
methods, structure determination procedures for certain classes of models,
methods for handling modeling errors, determining optimal inputs for the
projected equation error identification, and a multicomponent signal analysis
problem. The singular value decomposition and total least squares estimate will
aid as important computational tools for the proposed research.
