9411724 Pankow This is an award to assist in the purchase of equipment for
conduct of research. Topics of the investigator's research on which the
equipment will be used includes mechanisms of the reductive dehalogenation of
chlorinated organic compounds by elemental iron, gas/particle partitioning of
organic compounds in atmospheric aerosols and gas/particle partitioning of toxic
compounds in air that has been polluted with tobacco smoke. Acquisition of the
equipment to be purchased with this support will have a significant effect on
improving the productivity of this investigator's laboratory in connection with
its work on topics of important environmental significance. The proposal leading
to this award was submitted in response to NSF 93-155, Research Equipment Grant
Program. ***
