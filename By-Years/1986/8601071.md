In many signal detection and communications systems, probability of error is the
appropriate fidelity criterion for evaluation of system performance. Attention
is restricted to those systems which use large samples of data to make
decisions, and hence operate with extremely small error probabilities. The
accurate computation of these small probabilities is the subject of this
research project.
