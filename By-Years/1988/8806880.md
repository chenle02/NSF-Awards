This award funds acquisition of a high-temperature test cell for friction and
wear tests. The equipment allows accurate control of the various test conditions
- temperature, environment, load and sliding velocity; and it allows accurate
measurement of friction forces and wear. It will support on-going and planned
research on elevated temperature tribological behavior and surface reactions of
ceramic materials and on performance and deterioration of high temperature solid
lubricants. These are areas of currently intense research interest.
