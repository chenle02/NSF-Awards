This project applies tools from homomorphic encryption to improve security in
cloud services. Cloud computing saves money for companies by allowing them to
pay for services only if they need them and just at the time that such services
are needed, rather than purchasing and maintaining hardware/software that may
see little use. The drive to gain these savings may transform both business and
personal computing. This new level of resource sharing and complexity naturally
generates new problems related to security and privacy, problems that are both
novel and challenging. &lt;br/&gt;In the broadest sense, homomorphic encryption
allows one to borrow computational power from an untrusted source. If made
practical, this has especial implications for cloud computing. The software
owner may employ homomorphic encryption in this setting to reduce the threat of
reverse engineering and to administer software licenses. When made available
over a untrusted cloud, the software is run homomorphically, data is submitted
and returned in encrypted form, and the execution of instances is highly robust
against malicious users. This project removes the uncertainties in the
implementation efficiency of homomorphic encryption schemes and improves it to
the point where it becomes practical for use in cloud computing. Specifically,
the project centers on three modules: instruction set development for
homomorphic computing, processor-specific optimizations for homomorphic schemes,
and the investigation of new homomorphic schemes.
