This award funds a workshop to explore the research needs related to the
interface between computer vision and control. The workshop will be held June
23-25, 1997 on Block Island, Rhode Island. A small number of key researchers
from the computer vision and control communities will come together to examine
the topics which bridge these two domains. Their presentations and discussions
in working groups will undertake to delineate the common ground and to challenge
one another with fundamental unresolved problems. The results of the workshop
will appear in a widely distributed report on research directions in vision and
control.
