Research in theoretical physics will involve work on a great variety of topics
in elementary particle physics, statistical mechanics, and astrophysics. The
studies will include analyses of the effects of the strong nuclear force using
an approximation in which the continuum of space is replaced by a discrete
lattice of points, research in conformal quantum field theory (which has
applications to particle and condensed matter physics), analyses of weak
interaction phenomena in stars, studies of inflationary cosmological models and
of candidates for the non-luminous matter in the universe, and work on numerous
additional topics. The discrete approximation to the strong nuclear force is the
leading approach to understanding many of the effects of this force, weak
interaction phenomena can play a decisive role in such processes as a supernova
explosion, and the nature of the non-luminous matter is one of the major riddles
of astronomy.
