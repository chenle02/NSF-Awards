This award will provide travel support for approximately twenty graduate
students to attend the First Annual International Conference on Security for
Mobile, Wireless and Ubiquitous Systems (MoWiSec) jointly supported by the
European Commission (EC) and NSF. This new conference will provide a forum to
exchange ideas, techniques, and applications, discuss best practices and future
directions, raise awareness and share experiences among researchers,
practitioners, standard developers and policy makers in the field of security
for wireless/mobile networking based systems including pervasive and ubiquitous
systems. The conference will provide for interactive and fruitful discussions on
the various topics among participants from the academic, governmental, and
industrial sectors. The travel award will target graduate students, since
attending conferences is an important part of their educational experience, and
they often have limited funds. This travel support thus contributes to initiate,
develop, and foster relationships with leading international groups undertaking
research in the related technical areas.
