Research:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Grant for Exploratory Research is
being funded under NSF 02-2: "Next Generation Chemical and Biological Sensors
and Sensing Systems." The objective of the research is to establish proof-of-
concept of a novel way to monitor, detect, and characterize concealed biological
and chemical agents that pose threats to people, buildings, mass transportation,
urban environments, mail/packages, etc. The method to be studied is non-
invasive, and allows for real-time, wide-area/field-of-view surveillance. The
technical approach is to detect these agents via spatial interferometric imaging
of their characteristic transmission or reflectivity wavelength spectrum in the
Terahertz (THz) electro-magnetic radiation range (0.1-3 THz). Neural network
analyses of the THz spectra and images will provide the specificity of agent
detection and reduce the frequency of false
alarms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Impact:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research is to
promote homeland security - its impact is thus timely and important. In
addition, the institution has a primarily minority student population.
