Saint Anselm College is a small, liberal arts college in Manchester, New
Hampshire participating in targeted big science with partners across New
Hampshire and the world. A significant challenge for small institutions is
providing access to major data pathways necessary to transfer key scientific
data and share major resources at the capacity demanded by today's scientific
data sets. This project creates a new network instrument - a Science DMZ to
enable scientific collaboration and data sharing. These campus networking
activities provide other small colleges and universities a road map for
connecting small institutions to larger institutions in the New England region,
across the US, and around the world to support research, teaching and learning
with students of all backgrounds. The project broadens opportunities for
individual and interdisciplinary scientific research, as well as all research
occurring at Saint Anselm College. This project is the key component in
elevating research collaboration to the next level of connectivity and
effectiveness for the Saint Anselm College scientific research enterprise. The
implementation of a 10Gbps networking infrastructure connects Saint Anselm
College with other established partner research universities in New Hampshire
and around the world. The completion of a Science DMZ is expected to have an
immediate and transformative impact on several representative science research
areas actively in need of such support such as current research in the areas of:
Lidar systems and analyses of hyperspectral data, chromosome evolution,
variation in spicule network morphology in dorid nudibranchs, and chemical
analyses to support archaeological field work.
