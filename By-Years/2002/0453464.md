The main focus of this research project is to rationally design and study self-
assembled porphyrin-, fullerene-, and carbon nanotube-bearing supra-molecular
complexes and nano structures that are essential for understanding the
fundamentals of photoinduced energy and electron transfer reactions, as well as
for developing optoelectronic devices. The principal aim of these efforts is to
provide information on the distance and orientation dependences of charge-
separation and charge-recombination in donor-acceptor conjugates, and in
addition to this, to develop materials with longer-lived and more useful excited
states.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the proposed supramolecular
architectures and their study include diverse applications in materials
chemistry, especially for building devices for light energy harvesting, and
optoelectronics applications. Professor D'Souza is developing nanotech
strategies for light energy harvesting. Such self-assembled constructions are
beginning to obtain the same capabilities as natural photosynthetic systems.
Such devices based on this type of chemistry facilitate energy strategies that
are alternatives to dependence on oil. The work involves B3L VP/3-21G* (small
basis set, hybrid density functional theory) calculations and integrates
collaborative research efforts with scientists from national and international
laboratories, The proposed research also provides extensive teaching and
training of graduate, post-doctoral, undergraduate and women students (including
NSF-REU students) involved in the interdisciplinary research program.
Development of novel energy sources other than those based on fossil fuels or
nuclear energy is a research topic that is of considerable scientific and
societal importance.&lt;br/&gt;
