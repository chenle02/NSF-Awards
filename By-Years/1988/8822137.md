This project consists of a research agenda in applied dynamic macroeconomics.
Several broad problems are investigated: The first topic concerns the dynamic
co-movements between average productivity, hours worked and output. The second
centers on the role of aggregate fiscal policy in postwar US business cycles.
The third category focuses on the interaction between growth and business cycles
in modern industrialized economies. The fourth broad area continues the
investigator's long-standing research on the structural determinants of
inventories of finished goods. The total research effort involves both
theoretical model development and analysis. The latter will be conducted using
aggregate and industry specific postwar US time series data. The several
projects are united by their methodology, which is to use dynamic general
equilibrium theory to generate time series models which are tightly
parameterized and which are estimated using the generalized method of moments.
The linkage between dynamic theory and dynamic econometrics offers the
possibility of evaluating competing theories of trends.
