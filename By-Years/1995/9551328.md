This project is introducing undergraduate students to a broad range of materials
processing concepts through the development of a laser materials processing
laboratory. A 700- watt CO2 laser system was recently donated to the department.
However, in order to effectively integrate the system into the undergraduate
laboratory curriculum, a workpiece motion system is required. This project has
added a computer numerical control (CNC) workpiece motion system to this laser
system. With the CNC enhancement to the laser system, materials processing
topics such as heat treating, laser joining, surface modification, and alloying
are being introduced. The laboratory is primarily used in welding metallurgy,
manufacturing processes, and materials science courses. In addition, the
laboratory is used extensively in computer-aided manufacturing courses where
computer-machine interfacing topics are introduced, as well as CNC programming
concepts and CAD/CAM integration.
