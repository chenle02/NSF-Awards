Research involves the exploration of the use of multi- dimensional cubic spline
approximations in the context of continuous-state dynamic programming emanating
from multi-echelon inventory/distribution problems. New theoretical and
computational results should result, as well as a better understanding of when
spline approximations are appropriate.
