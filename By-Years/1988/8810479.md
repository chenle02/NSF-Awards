The design of special purpose computers for cost-effective plasma simulation is
being addressed. The primary goal of the project is to design and evaluate
computers that efficiently execute plasma particle simulation codes. A second
goal of the project is to build such computers using today's technologies. A
more cost-effective particle simulation system will aid physicists in their
investigation of plasma phenomena. Results could be extended to higher
dimensionality and to other domains with similar computation requirements.
