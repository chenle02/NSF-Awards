The goal of this workshop award is to identify critical challenges in the field
of neuromechanical engineering that can be addressed by research in the areas of
dynamics, control, and optimization. It is expected that research in these areas
will lead to new models of human sensory-motor coordination and to new ways of
leveraging these models in developing technology that can assist, rehabilitate,
and augment human sensory-motor function. A diverse group of engineers,
scientists, and clinicians will be invited to assess the current state of
research and educational activities in neuromechanical engineering and to
develop recommendations for new research themes. Deliverables include a final
report that presents these recommendations to the broader research and
educational community and to the general public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
workshop will promote research that has high impact on areas of critical
national need related to assistance, rehabilitation, and augmentation of
sensory-motor function. Some of these areas are as follows: (1) powered
orthotics to assist drop-foot gait in people suffering from complications of
stroke, polio, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, and cerebral palsy; (2)
robotic therapies to rehabilitate coordination and basic motor skills for stroke
survivors; and (3) brain-machine interfaces and prosthetics to restore sensory-
motor function to amputees and to people with spinal cord injury. The workshop
will also catalyze transformative progress toward ?reverse-engineering the
brain,? a grand challenge proposed by the National Academy of Engineering for
the 21st century. The diverse group of participants will enhance cross-
disciplinary collaboration and will increase engagement with researchers who are
from under-represented groups and who are early in their careers.&lt;br/&gt;
