The Center for Education of the National Academy of Sciences proposes to develop
a program of workshops to help the MSP awardees and future applicants improve
K-16 STEM programs. The content of the workshops builds on recent NRC reports
(e.g., How People Lear; Adding it Up; Transforming Undergraduate Education in
Science, Mathematics, Engineering and Technology; Knowing What Students Know;
Learning and Understanding), and participants will have opportunities to examine
the research and implementation issues identified in these reports in depth and
apply them to their project designs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is anticipated that
two workshops each on two different topics (making a total of four workshops)
will be offered annually for three years. MSP grantees would be guaranteed slots
in the workshops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshops will be jointly developed
by the Center for Education and the National Science Resources Center.
