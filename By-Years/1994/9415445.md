9415445 Pecht ABSTRACT Work Force Retraining in Manufacturing Science and
Engineering of Cost-Effective Electronics The University of Maryland at College
Park proposes to train current and future workforce to seek new manufacturing
paradigms in a dual-use economy by emphasizing problem-solving and knowledge-
synthesis skill. Building on the strength of its State/Industry University
Cooperative Research Center on Life Cycle Engineering in Electronic Packaging,
its state-of-the-art facilities, and the participation by industry and DoD, DoC,
and DoE laboratories, the project targets graduate and undergraduate students
and industrial workers, with emphasis on those employed by regional small
businesses. Furthermore, through its strong ties with national societies and
other academic institutions, especially those involved in the ECSEL Engineering
Education Coalition, this project will undertake innovative curriculum,
courseware and textbook development in the chosen technical areas. ***
