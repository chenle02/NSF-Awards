This grant funds the development of an NSF proposal to 1) investigate the
effects of price dynamics on the profitability of real investments in
manufacturing and 2) evaluate the power of modern investment evaluation methods,
including real options and portfolio optimization methods, in predicting the
effects of price dynamics. The study that would be proposed would include a
theoretical portion to integrate financial profit models, production profit
models, and economic models of price dynamics, as well as empirical tests to
evaluate the power of each model in predicting firm and shareholder profits. The
grant funding will be used in planning the study that will be proposed. The
planning activities will include developing at least one integrated model to
demonstrate the efficacy of this approach, identifying data sources, and
developing one or more case studies. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The impact of the
eventual research would include identifying which characteristics of price and
output dynamics are the most important predictors of profitability, and
generating evidence to support or refute the applicability of finance-based
profit models to real investments in manufacturing. These results will be
especially important for manufacturers that are considering conservation
investments, supply contracts or vertical integration to reduce price risk, or
diversifying their inputs or outputs-for example, a carpet fiber manufacturer
considering a process that uses biomass instead of petroleum-based
materials.&lt;br/&gt;
