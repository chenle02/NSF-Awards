This project uses GC/MS and related computer equipment for the separation and
analysis of organic and organometallic substance relevant to the Department of
Chemistry Laboratory curriculum and for the separation and analysis of organic
contaminants that are commonly tested for commercially according to EPA
standards in hazardous waste areas and groundwater supplies, which is of
importance to the education of chemistry majors as well as to others who take
environmental science and environmental chemistry courses. There are many
situations in which analysis are presented with mixtures of small amounts of
substances to be identified such as in the testing of drinking water for organic
impurities. Our students, both major and non-major alike, have a clearer
representation of the problems caused by organics in the environment and how
these organics may be detected and analyzed. The institution is matching the NSF
grant with an equal amount of funds.
