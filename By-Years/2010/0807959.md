The planned research is concerned with deciding how to infer what new physics
exists at the TeV scale from various planned experiments at LHC and B-Factories.
The PI believes that to decide between different New Physics scenarios we have
to study their impact on the weak transitions of heavy flavour states (B, K, D
hadrons and top quarks). His program involves three components: (i) To determine
ever more accurately the values of the basic input parameters that control the
Standard Model predictions, like the CKM parameters; (ii) to refine the
algorithm used for calculating transition amplitudes; (iii) to study the high p!
- low p! connection and prepare the ground for 'reverse theoretical
engineering'; i.e., to infer the nature of the New Physics fields that generate
forces affecting heavy flavour decays. The PI intends to also analyze possible
manifestations of CP violation in leptodynamics, mainly in ! decays and electric
dipole moments of electrons and undertake to classifiy New Physics scenarios
that can generate observable effects there. This is driven by a dual motivation,
namely to search for unorthodox variants of New Physics and to try to understand
baryogenesis as being due to a primary leptogenesis. This analysis will be aided
by new experiments at flavor factories and in 'tabletop' experiments searching
for T odd effects in atoms, molecules and nuclei. The PI also intends to study
the impact of the existence of extra dimensions on heavy flavour decays. Broader
Impact: As in the past the PI's research will provide guidance to many
experimental studies and support the feedback from experiment to theory. It and
its presentation in lectures at schools etc. will provide training to a sizable
number of graduatestudents. The book he is revising on 'CP Violation' and his
review articles should educate non-specialists about some of the fascinating
developments in HEP.
