The object of this project is to produce device-quality expitaxial layers of the
wide-band gap compound semiconductor, ZnSe. The approach to this problem will be
to investigate ZnSe growth by the Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) technique with
particular emphasis on doping studies employing a custom- designed MBE system.
The program is designed to result in the fabrication of short-wavelength
semiconductor laser sources operating around 460 nm for optical storage of
information applications and, also, the fabrication of low-loss waveguide
structures and "all-optical" computers. The proposed research addresses, in
particular, the problem of developing ZnSE material through growth and
characterization studies to the point where devices such as those mentioned
above can be realized.
