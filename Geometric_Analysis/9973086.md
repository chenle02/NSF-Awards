Abstract: This project proposes to study several problems in the area of
laminations/foliations. One of these problems is concerned with the geometric
structure of the leaves of a lamination. Some natural questions that the
proposer intends to study are: what do the leaves of a lamination look like? how
many different leaves (e.g. quasi-isometry classes) are there? what geometric
invariants can be (and cannot be) used to distinguish them? Still concerned with
the geometry of the leaves, there are questions about two dimensional
laminations and metric uniformization of their leaves. Especially interesting
are those which have a Euclidean conformal structure, which are often
encountered in problems of low dimensional topology and geometric group theory.
Other part of this project falls in the area of rigidity of virtual subgroups of
semisimple groups and harmonic analysis on them. Research in this area has been
concerned with virtual subgroups which have an invariant measure. The proposer
seeks to develop the study of harmonic measures, which are non invariant in a
reasonable way, and how they fit in the existing body of work on rigidity. Other
part of the project concerns the study that certain geometric properties of the
leaves of a foliation have on its transverse or dynamical structure and on the
topological structure of the ambient manifold.

The research of the proposer is in the general area of qualitative structure
and behavior of dynamical systems. Dynamical systems are used to model processes
in many areas, for example the evolution of living organisms and their
morphology, the weather or other physical or chemical processes. Other systems
of interest come from processes which evolve from a finite amount of data
according to some set of rules, either specified before hand or of a random
nature. This could be neural networks in the brain, systems of digital
processors in a computer, branching processes (as in nuclear fission, evolution
and growth of cells, etcetera). Even when appearing under different
circumstances, their dynamic behavior and structure follows similar laws
dictated by the individual elements and the nature of their interaction. The
purpose of the researcher is to study and classify, from a geometric/qualitative
viewpoint, invariants of these systems relating to their long time asymptotic
behavior, their dependence on the initial data, the generic properties of the
possible states, and their global structure, all which can be used to understand
the mechanisms underlying such processes.
