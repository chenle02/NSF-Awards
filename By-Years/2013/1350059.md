The aim of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program award is to
develop simple and effective dynamic control policies to improve hospital
patient flows with a primary focus on the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). ICUs
provide care for the most critical patients. They are very expensive to operate
and often operate at or above capacity. Variability in patient flows from the
Emergency Department (ED) and other inpatient units can exacerbate congestion in
the ICU; this can alter the type and quality of care provided. There has been
significant effort from the medical community to reduce process variation;
however, in general, they have not considered how operational factors may
contribute to this variation. The research will use operations research tools to
improve patient flows by augmenting traditional models and introducing new ones
which account for congestion effects.

The results of this research will generate insight for how congestion affects
the timing of care and, subsequently, impacts the best practices for healthcare
operations in the ICU and other care facilities. Such quantitative modeling and
optimization will provide the foundation for systematic decision making. Close
collaborations with clinicians will help facilitate exposure and acceptance of
operational tools by the medical community. Adoption of these policies and
methodologies will help improve patient outcomes via increased access to care
and may also reduce hospital costs. This has important implications for
improvement of healthcare provision and is of direct impact to patients and the
wider community.
