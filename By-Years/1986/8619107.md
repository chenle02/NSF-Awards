This research develops artificial intelligence methods for the automatic
formulation and use of concepts by computer systems. In particular, techniques
which enable a machine to develop concepts based on its ability to "explain"
instances presented to it are combined with methods to rapidly "classify" new
instances into one of its learned categories. The goal is to convert the
machine's inefficient but correct "explanation" procedures into efficient
classification routines. Methods used will include both symbol-processing
strategies and newer, "connectionist" approaches. The importance of this
research is that exploratory artificial intelligence programs, now capable of
some limited learning, must be substantially improved. In particular, artificial
intelligence systems must be developed to both learn new categories (concepts)
efficiently and apply these categories rapidly when presented with a high rate
of data and new experience.
