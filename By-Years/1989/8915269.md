Studies of nuclear reactions at low and intermediate energies will be carried
out in three distinct projects. First, measurements of analyzing powers in the
radiative capture of polarized deuterons on deuterium will be performed to study
the energy dependence of the odd-parity multipoles in the transition. These
measurements will be performed at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and/or the
Indiana University Cyclotron Facility. Secondly, a recently developed
microscopic DWBA model, used to consistently analyze elastic and inelastic
nucleon scattering, will be enhanced and possibly used as a basis for
formulating an empirical effective nucleon-nucleon interaction which may be used
to more accurately describe the scattering data. Finally, measurements of
charge-exchange reactions will be performed at Los Alamos National Laboratory,
extending the body of knowledge about such reactions to energies in the 50-250
MeV region and providing further data for use in the study of reaction dynamics.
