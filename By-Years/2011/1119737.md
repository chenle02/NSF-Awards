ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;08 August 2011&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:
1119737&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium
(LUMCON)&lt;br/&gt;PI: J. Malbrough&lt;br/&gt;Co-PI: D.
Guidry&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests one Shipboard Scientific
Support item for the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium (LUMCON) for use
aboard the R/V PELICAN; namely a new side A-frame. This item will enhance safety
and provide greatly enhanced support capabilities to
science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The R/V PELICAN supports
federally funded scientific research in the Gulf of Mexico in order to expand
human knowledge of the ocean environment. During operations, the vessel
routinely exposes graduate and undergraduate students to seagoing oceanography.
Pubic outreach is also achieved through real-time satellite connectivity from
ship to shore, open house events, educational cruises, and involvement in the
Marine Advanced Technology Education (MATE) Center which is an intern-based
training program for marine technicians. PELICAN also provided significant
federal agency science support following the Deep Water Horizon disaster in
2010.
