The Oceanographic Instrumentation Program Supports requests to acquire
instrumentation for the collection, processing and analysis of Oceanographic
data. This proposal from University of Southern California (USC) requests
funding for equipment that will be used to support NSF-funded research cruises
aboard the R/V VICKERS, a 220 foot vessel that is owned and operated by
Univertiy.
