With this project, the Chemical Synthesis program is supporting Professor Ohyun
Kwon of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of
California, Los Angeles to systematically study the 6 pi-electrocyclizations of
nitrodienes. The 6 pi-electrocyclization of nitrodienes is a new reaction that
permits the highly efficient assembly of complex nitroso acetals with
predictable stereochemistry and the subsequent capture of the intermediate
nitronates through [3+2] dipolar cycloaddition. A key component of these studies
relates to the control of olefin geometry in electrocyclizaton precursor. The
new tandem electrocyclic ring closure/dipolar cycloaddition will be applied to
the construction of heteroatomic nitrogen-containing scaffolds of increasing
complexity, including natural product targets.

The project will provide a practical and intellectual training environment in
modern synthetic organic chemistry methodology development for undergraduate and
graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. This skill set can then be
applied to tackling problems relevant to industrial, medicinal and
agrochemistry, in producing tomorrow's scientists.
