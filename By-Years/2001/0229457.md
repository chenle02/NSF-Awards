This three-year award for U.S.-France collaboration in geometry involves Matthew
L. Gursky at Indiana University, Paul C. Yang and Sung-Yung Chang at Princeton
University, Frank Merle and Emmanuel Hebey at the University of Cergy-Pontoise.
The collaboration addresses higher order elliptic, in particular fourth order,
and parabolic equations in geometry and mathematical physics. These geometry
problems arise in conformal geometry, Einstein manifolds, and canonical metrics.
The US mathematicians bring to this collaboration expertise in higher order
equations. This is complemented by French expertise in analytical problems.

This award represents the US side of joint proposals to the NSF and the French
National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS). NSF will cover travel funds and
living expenses for individual visits of US investigators and students and group
travel to a workshop. The CNRS will support the visits of the French
researchers. The collaboration will advance fundamental understanding of higher
order equations as applied to problems in physics, geometry, and analysis. The
project adds an international dimension to training of students and provides
opportunities to develop international partnerships.
