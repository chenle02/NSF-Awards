Professor Christodoulou will study the problem of the global nonlinear
stability of Minkowski spacetime. This will include the complete analysis of the
global asymptotic behavior of the spacetime, including the geometry of the null
hypersurfaces, the maximal spacelike hypersurfaces as well as the behavior of
physical quantities. It will also contain the solution of a number of problems
in Riemannian geometry and partial differential equations which are of
independent interest and have applications beyond the problem at hand.
