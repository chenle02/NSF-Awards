9504878 Tugnait The goal of the proposed research is to provide estimated system
models together with evaluated (quantified) modeling errors given experimental
input-output data for a wide variety of systems (electrical, chemical, power,
manufacturing and production, robotic, electronic etc.) operating in open or
closed loop. Such information (system model and quantified modeling error) is
crucial to synthesis of a robust controller which maintains its design
objectives under uncertain modeling. As such, successful completion of the
proposed research is expected to significantly impact the state-of-the-art in
robust control design. Approaches are being considered to transform the given
time-domain experimental input-output data into a frequency-domain transform
function model description along with the associated noise error
characterization. Both second-order spectrum and cross-spectrum of the data
record as well as higher-order integrated polyspectrum of the data record is
being exploited for such purposes. This allows for far fewer a priori
assumptions; rather such modeling is dictated by the acquired data. The case of
noisy input measurements is also being considered. A stochastic embedding
approach is being followed for quantifying modeling errors. ***
