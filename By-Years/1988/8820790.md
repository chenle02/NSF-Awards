The core of this study involves the characterization of leaf developmental
mutants in maize. Two have been cloned via transposon-tagging. The questions
addressed in this proposal are: 1.Are the leaf development mutants under study
altered in cellular age-identity, as hypothesized, or in position-identity?
Problems of developmental time-keeping are especially approachable in plants. 2.
Does the animal concept of developmental compartments apply to plants? Dr.
Freeling will address this question using a dominant dwarf in genetic mosaic
studies. 3. Are the provascular cells the primary inducers of other leaf cell
fates? Is the epidermis an information "blank sheet" until induced to
differentiate into particular cell types? Dr. Freeling will approach these two
related question using detailed vein lineage maps, periclinal chimeric analyses,
and mutants that fail to anastomose intermediate veins. %%% These studies will
establish the maize leaf as a powerful developmental system amenable to mutant
analysis as well as for cell biological, and embryological studies. The approach
to the mutants at these levels will provide a context for the on-going studies
on the molecular descriptions of developmental gene regulation.
