Funds are provided in support of a RAPID award to study the dynamics of the
tongue of Hubbard Glacier, Yakutat, Alaska. It is anticipated that the sustained
advance of Hubbard Glacier?s tidewater terminus will soon create an ice dam at
Gilbert Point, closing the tidal channel linking Disenchantment Bay with Russell
Fiord and forming a 64 km long lake. The natural event has only rarely been
observed and the creation of an ice dam by an advancing tidewater glacier
represents an unparalleled opportunity to monitor the process. This study will
document the anticipated formation of the ice dam and analyze the processes,
mechanics and factors determining method and style of closure, dam stability and
or failure. Understanding the dynamics of the ice margin is crucial to
understanding how ice dams are created and their performance as a permanent
closure to Russell Fiord. During the advance and closure, instrumental
measurements coupled to sequential image analysis will examine the ice marginal
marine environment in relation to monitored ice flow and ice structure at the
dam site. Additionally, if a lake is formed behind the ice dam, the freshening
evolution of the lake will be monitored.
