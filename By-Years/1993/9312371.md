The proposed research is directed toward the exposition of hadron structure,
both at the nuclear and meson levels. Photon and hadron beams will be used to
excite sub-nucleon currents in proton and few-nucleon targets. The measurements
to be performed include Compton scattering, meson production and nucleon knock-
out reactions on few-nucleon systems at (1232) energies, and exotic-meson and
baryon resonance production with high energy beams at BNL and CEBAF.
