9310193 Land This project will develop, estimate, and evaluate hierarchical
linear models for several datasets on criminal victimization, thus taking into
account the implicit hierarchical structure of victimization survey data - from
individuals to neighborhoods to cities or urban areas. This approach will
integrate and compare the two major theoretical approaches to victimization: 1)
the routine activities/crime opportunity approach that stresses individual-level
covariates such as age, sex, and life style characteristics, and 2) other
approaches that emphasize characteristics of aggregate units, such as
neighborhoods and cities. The research will address critical criminological and
sociological issues that have been at issue in the assessment of variations in
victimization rates. The research will improve scientific understanding of the
factors that put people at risk of being the victims of crime. In so doing it
will demonstrate the power of new techniques of statistical analysis, thus
encouraging social scientists in several fields to use them. Knowledge of the
factors that affect the risk of being a victim of crime will be useful in
reducing that risk. ***
