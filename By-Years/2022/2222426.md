The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project will create a sustainable business model for a
new approach towards forest mensuration and monitoring. The core
commercialization strategy is that multi-Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) teams
replace the tape measure, not the forester. This technology addresses the needs
for forest measurement techniques that are more accurate, efficient, and
verifiable. The advances are critical for climate-smart forest management and
carbon markets. There is a global environmental need for the assessment of trees
and forest conditions, since trees are the lungs of the world as natureâ€™s carbon
sequestration engines. This technology is also addressing labor shortage
challenges by making foresters more productive and providing opportunities and
education in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) for rural
workforces. The results of this project will be a foundation for capturing data
of the natural world to accelerate growth of nature-based solutions.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
Phase II project will advance knowledge in the fields of robotics and forestry.
Improving forest measurement techniques is a generational challenge as lack of
forest management, wildfires, natural disasters, and diminishing biodiversity
are negatively affecting the broader economy and society. However, the current
standard for measuring forest volumes is a manual human measurement, and there
is a need for a more scalable solution. Robotics is the key to that solution,
but there are still deep technical advances necessary to bring it to market. The
first anticipated outcome is the development of algorithms, software, and
hardware for intelligent, decentralized, autonomous multi-UAV systems that can
coordinate in a dense forest. The second anticipated outcome is new forest
sampling and tree volume techniques that leverage the ability to measure vast
quantities of trees in precise detail, relative to manual measurements. The
first outcome expands the frontier in the field of robotics and the second
outcome expands the fields of forestry and ecology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
