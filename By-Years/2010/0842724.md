Brain cells (neurons) transmit electrical information through the central
nervous system and elicit specific behaviors through specialized connections
called synapses. During development, the intricate and precise pattern of
neuronal synapse connections is formed. The goal of this project is to
understand the mechanism by which a novel protein (SynDIG1) that was identified
in the Principal Investigator's (PI) laboratory functions in synapse
development. This study will test the hypothesis that SynDIG1 anchors AMPA-type
glutamate receptors (AMPA-Rs) at the postsynaptic compartment via interaction
with scaffolding proteins. The researchers will use a combination of approaches
including biochemistry, immunocytochemistry, and electrophysiology to address
this possibility. While significant progress has been made in the field
regarding presynaptic differentiation such as synaptic vesicle clustering and
postsynaptic recruitment of scaffolds and NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NMDA-
Rs), less is known about the molecules implicated in AMPA-R recruitment during
synapse development. Thus, the results of the proposed experiments will fill a
major gap in the field of synapse development and function.

The broader impacts of the proposed studies include integration of the research
and education activities of the PI, specifically in the context of broadening
the participation of undergraduate students from underrepresented groups
(primarily Hispanic/Latino). The PI is an active participant in various campus
programs aimed to increase the number of underrepresented students pursuing
postgraduate degrees in science; thus, the PI is in a strong position to recruit
such students to the laboratory as members of the research team for this
project. Undergraduate participation will be directed by the PI in conjunction
with graduate students in the laboratory, thereby integrating research,
teaching, and scientific community outreach activities for students pursuing
graduate studies in the laboratory.
