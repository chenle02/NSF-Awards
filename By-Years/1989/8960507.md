The importance of aseismic design of structures using base isolation techniques
is becoming increasingly evident to architects and structural engineers. Many
different types of base isolators, generally complex mechanical systems which
require an extra floor beneath the building, have been proposed to date.
Existing isolation systems are either of a pure-friction or flexible type, or a
combination of the two. They reduce earthquake-induced lateral inertial forces
on structures through limiting friction effects and/or lengthening the natural
period of vibration of the total system. This research project studies a new
base isolation system comprised of alternate geosynthetic liners and soil
layers. Geomembrane and geotextile geosynthetics typically have very low
friction coefficients. A layered geotextile/geomembrane-soil system provides a
practical, low-cost, and simple-to- install base isolation system through low
frictional properties of geosynthetics and the flexibility of a soil layer.
Lateral deflection of structures may be limited by hysteretic damping of the
soil layer and by soft backfill materials around the building basement. This
research project is Phase I of a Small Business Innovation Research Project.
