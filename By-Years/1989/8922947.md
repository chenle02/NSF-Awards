This award will support continued studies of Japanese technologies under the
Japanese Technology Evaluation Program (JTEC), and expand this program to
Europe. The JTEC program was initiated in 1983 to examine Japanese research and
development in selected areas of technology and to access the impact of this
R&amp;D on future U.S. economic competitiveness. Each selected technology is
studied by a panel of experts who, in addition to their broad knowledge of the
field, travel to Japan to see firsthand the current Japanese research
activities. The panel then conducts an open workshop to present its results, and
it provides a written report. Unlike corporate studies of the same sort, the
reports of the JTEC panels are in the public domain and are accessible to both
private individuals and Federal policymakers. This effort will extend the JTEC
studies to include five additional technologies. An additional study will be
conducted in Europe to verify that the methodology that has been used in Japan
will be effective there. The detailed research will be conducted by six expert
panels that will analyze foreign literature, visit foreign laboratories, and
present their findings in workshops and technical reports.
