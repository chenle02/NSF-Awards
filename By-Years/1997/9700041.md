9700041 Alexander ABSTRACT The Delta Rural Systemic Initiative The Delta Rural
Systemic Initiative (DRSI) is an award to the University of Mississippi on
behalf of a consortium of state, local, and university educators in Arkansas,
Louisiana, and Mississippi. The project targets rural, impoverished school
districts in the Lower Mississippi River Delta region of the three states. The
DRSI project will: (1) improve the K-14 learning environment in the targeted
counties/parishes to address student needs and promote student achievement in
science, mathematics, and technology (SMT); (2) increase the capacity of local
communities to build and maintain quality science, mathematics, and technology
educational opportunities; (3) establish mechanisms that promote the development
and implementation of appropriate policies at local and state levels that will
sustain SMT education reform; and (4) create a regional infrastructure that will
utilize intra- and interstate alliances to develop sustainable regional
improvements in science, mathematics and technology education. The DRSI has 3
primary focus areas: Local and regional capacity building and leadership
development-The initiative will offer to the district and school personnel
leadership institutes and professional development opportunities that are
designed to promote standards-based instruction, and adoption of systemic reform
principles. Some of these will be given directly by the initiative team or
through sub-contracts, and some will be developed by the districts and supported
by sub-awards from the initiative. Resource convergence and brokerage-The
initiative leadership and field personnel will provide assistance to regional
school personnel in realigning and redistributing funding allocations in a
manner responsive to systemic reform . . . . prmclples. Technical assistance and
on-site follow-up-The initiative, through field personnel, will systematically
provide technical a ssistance to district and school personnel in a manner that
will improve educational efforts to adopt standards-based practices. DRSI will
facilitate educational systemic reform by working directly with district and
school personnel--some district-specific opportunities and some offered on a
regional basis. Much of the district-specific work will be the responsibility of
six Field Coordinators (FCs), who will be assigned to certain participating
districts. -
