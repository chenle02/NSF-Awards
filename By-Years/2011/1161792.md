This project will investigate the genetic basis of dark body pigmentation
(melanism) in high altitude African populations of the fruit fly Drosophila
melanogaster. Pigmentation genes identified in Cameroonian and Ethiopian
populations will be compared to one already identified in a Ugandan sample to
test whether melanism has evolved via distinct genetic pathways. High-throughput
DNA sequence data will be collected from fly "introgression lines" (where dark
pigmentation has been crossed into lightly pigmented fly stocks) to identify
genomic regions containing pigmentation loci. Similar data from wild-collected
fly stocks will allow specific genes within these regions to be tested for
associations with pigmentation and evidence for natural selection.

This research will significantly improve scientific understanding of how natural
selection operates at the genetic level. It will also lay the groundwork for
studies that utilize the genetic resources of this model species to pursue the
precise mutations underlying melanic evolution. Broader impacts supported by
this grant will include (1) the development of instructional materials for the
college evolution curriculum, (2) the involvement of a diverse group of
undergraduates in research, and (3) the creation of a Virtual Stock Center for
Drosophila Population Samples to allow researchers to more efficiently manage
living fly stocks.
