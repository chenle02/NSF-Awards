The nature of structural relaxations during the glass formation process will be
investigated using the viscous behavior of liquid oxide systems using the
Brillouin light scattering technique. A signal in the GHz frequency range,
related to a complex modulus, allows direct study of viscoelastic relaxation on
an atomistic scale. Processes which reflect in the Brillouin spectrum include
cooperative vibrations of larger molecular units, structural rearrangements
involving bond breaking and reorientations and momentum exchange between
diffusing particles. No mechanical coupling is necessary between the probe and
the investigated substance, which eliminates some of the difficulties of high
temperature measurements and facilitates the study of viscoelastic phenomena in
the glass transition region. The fundamental relation between the experimental
observations and the structural characteristics of glass.forming liquids is
elucidated by complementary numerical simulations.
