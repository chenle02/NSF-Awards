To deliver the high performance required for large scale applications, the next
generation of supercomputers will be organized as massively large networks of
processors. Before such large networks can be effectively used, a number of
questions must be addressed. How will parallel programs be written, and how will
high-level languages be efficiently supported on network architectures? What is
the most efficient way to perform fast local, and global, communication? The
goals of this project include the development of algorithmic techniques to
efficiently support high-level languages on large network architectures.
Algorithms to reduce communication costs are critical to efficient compilation,
and also influence the way large networks are designed and programmed. Based on
these algorithms, the research is aimed at the design of massively parallel
networks and languages geared for large scale applications.
