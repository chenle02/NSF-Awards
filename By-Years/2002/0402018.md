The International Research Fellowship Program enables U.S. scientists and
engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research abroad. The
program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique
or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.

This award will support a twenty-two month research fellowship by Dr. Jeremy M.
Bono to work with Dr. Bernard J. Crespi at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby,
Canada.

The goal of this project is to use a combination of molecular techniques and
field experiments to determine the roles of genetic and ecological factors
promoting cooperative colony founding, which promotes social evolution, in
Australian Acacia thrips. This project will provide an opportunity for the PI to
learn new techniques and methodologies, including formal training in
phylogenetics, that he will continually apply throughout his career. This
research will make significant contributions to the field of evolutionary
biology by providing insight into the genetic and ecological factors that
promote the evolutin of cooperation. Systems with cooperative colony founding
afford unique opportunities to study social evolution.

Dr. Crespi has extensive knowledge of Australian Acacia thrips and is a leading
authority on the evoution of social behavior.
