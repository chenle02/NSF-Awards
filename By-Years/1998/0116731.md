With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at Trinity University will acquire a chemisorption-
physisorption surface area and pore size analyzer. This equipment will be used
to fully characterize new supported bimetallic catalysts. In addition, student
researchers at this predominantly undergraduate institution will be exposed to
fundamental concepts of the rapidly growing fields of solid state and materials
chemistry.

The determination of surface areas, pore sizes and chemisorption properties of
catalysts is critical in evaluating both in evaluating new preparative
procedures and in understanding how synthetic schemes affect metal particle
morphology. The control over particle size and composition will allow the new
catalysts to be used to understand how these fundamental factors impact activity
and selectivity in oxidation reactions.
