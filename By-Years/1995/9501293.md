Baernstein DMS-9501293 Baernstein will continue his work on the theory of
symmetrization. Of particular interest will be the use of symmetrization
techniques to solve extremal problems of various sorts. Examples include finding
the exact values of the Bloch and Landau constants in complex function theory,
determining the lowest critical buckling load on a clamped plate of given area,
and proving isoperimetric inequalities in which the size of the boundary of a
set on a Riemannian manifold is compared with that of a ball of the same volume
in a space of constant curvature. Symmetrization is a process in which sets or
functions are changed into other sets or functions of the same "size," but with
more symmetry. For example, a set of given measure in Euclidean space might be
replaced with a ball, centered at the origin, with the same measure. A function
might then be symmetrized by replacing it with a function whose pre-image of
half lines are the symmetrization of the pre-image of half lines of the original
function.
