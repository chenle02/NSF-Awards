9417637 Soldi Measurement of polarization observables in low energy nucleon-
deuteron scattering will be carried out at the TUNL facility. The central focus
will be to study charge symmetry breaking in the three-body system. Theoretical
work using Faddeev calculations will be carried out in support of this
experiment. Studies relating to the extensions of these three-body experiments
to CEBAF energies will be carried out, specifically working on field mapping the
large magnetic spectrometers which will be needed. These activities will be
carried out in collaboration with personnel at TUNL and CEBAF. ***
