EXP-LA: Active Sampling and Reactive Chemistry for Enhanced Detection of
Explosives

This is a project to develop integrated planar optical waveguide spectrometry-
interferometry for sensing explosives with imprinted polymers. The proposal
involves synthesis of molecularly imprintable polymers with reactive groups to
increase signal to noise and selectivity. To concentrate the plume signal, both
acoustic and vibration-assisted agitation methods will be investigated as well
as the impact of intake port geometry.
