The proposed research investigates high-tech ceramics based on crystalline
phases in the Si-Al-Y-O-N system. Better knowledge of their thermodynamic
properties could lead to the synthesis of lower-cost materials with better
properties. This project combines the expertise of the calorimetry group at
Princeton with the materials and processing group in Stuttgart. The Stuttgart
group will synthesize and characterize samples, while the Princeton group
performs high-temperature solution calorimetry to obtain enthalpies of formation
of the crystals. The data derived will be incorporated into databases and used
to calculate phase equilibria, crystalline paths, and crystal-chemical
correlations.
