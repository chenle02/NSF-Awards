Dr. Alice Tryon has prepared a comprehensive study of the anatomy of fern
spores, correlating evidence from scanning and transmission electron microscope
studies. Fern spores are single-celled structures that have a major role in the
reproduction and distribution of ferns. They are represented by extant lineages
that flourished from Carboniferous times to the present. Connections between
fossil and extant forms are often supported wholly on spore evidence. Thus,
Tryon's work will be extremely important for those researchers studying the
systematics and evolution of ferns. It will also be useful to petroleum
geologists and stratigraphers. This award will provide a subsidy to partially
defray the costs of publication of Dr. Tryon's manuscript, which is estimated
will result in an 800- page book. The subsidy will lower the retail cost of the
book from $400 to $100, thereby permitting individual scientists and libraries
with limited budgets to purchase it.
