Levitan This research is on verifying timing specifications for interconnection
of modules in both synchronous and asynchronous digital systems. The notion of
temporal behavior is being abstracted from the notion of functional behavior by
focusing primarily on the control protocols of the modules and ignoring the data
values computed by the modules. In this model, the interface protocols of each
module are given along with the connectivity between modules. A static graph is
built that describes the temporal relationships among all the external signals
of all the modules. The verification process is based on a comparison between
the possible behaviors of the system, represented by the graph, and the legal
behaviors as represented by a set of constraints. The key constraint is that the
temporal behavior of one module cannot violate the temporal constraints of
another module within the system. The algorithms support multiple system states,
state transitions, and checking of conditionals and loops within the protocols.
This searching is tractable because functional behavior and data values
generated by modules are not considered.
