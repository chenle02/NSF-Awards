9315285 Hankins Although radio pulsars have been known for nearly three decades
and have been attributed to rotating neutron stars for nearly that long, the
mechanism producing the radiation is still poorly understood. Observational and
theoretical studies will be conducted to distinguish which of several existing
models for pulsar emission is correct. The theoretical studies will focus on the
rapid fluctuations of the emission expected from various models with the goal of
uncovering features which will distinguish among them. The theoretical
predictions will be tested through observations with time resolution an order of
magnitude better than has been achieved previously. ***
