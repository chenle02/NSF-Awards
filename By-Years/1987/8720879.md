The seismological study of the three-dimensional structure of the earth's
interior is a very active area of current research, with a variety of different
methods and data types being applied to the problem. In a previous grant a new
and effective approach to this problem was developed which used short-period
body wave travel time data from ISC bulletins to estimate the intercept time tau
as a function of slowness in a tectonically regionalized Earth, and this led to
meaningful results concerning the lateral heterogeneity of P velocities in the
shallow mantle. Taking advantage of information already acquired about the
shallow heterogeneity, a tomographic approach will be used to estimate deeper
and more general lateral heterogeneity in the mantle. Three basic tasks are
proposed. The first will involve the refinement of the regionalized tau studies
of P and S velocities in the shallow mantle and a number of tests to check the
reliability of these estimates. The second will concentrate on subduction zones
and will use the existence of earthquakes at various depths to estimate
incremental velocities within these zones. The third and major task will be a
tomographic imaging of the entire mantle using ISC travel time data.
