The study will initiate a series of experiments to investigate theeffects of
supercritical phase separation on the distribution ofelements and isotopes in
subseafloor hydrothermal systems. Thiswill allow modelling of phase separation
processes. Gas and trace element-spiked NaCl-dominated fluids will be used in
analyses. Funding is provided for two years.
