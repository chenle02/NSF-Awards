9704861 Chen This project lies in the area of Riemannian geometry and nonlinear
elliptic partial differential equations. The investigator wishes to pursue the
problem of prescribing scalar curvature on spheres: given a function on a
sphere, can one find a metric conformal to the standard metric whose scalar
curvature is the given function? This problem can be stated in terms of a quasi-
linear elliptic partial differential equation; the current project is to study
various aspects of this underlying differential equation. Rimannian manifolds
are higher dimensional generalizations of curved surfaces. Such manifolds have
well-known applications in theoretical physics. A Riemannian manifold possesses
a notion of distance, or a metric. And by taking the derivative of the metric
one can measure its curvature. The problem of prescribing curvature then is to
see if one can reverse this process: one specifies the curvature property first,
and then look for a suitable metric.
