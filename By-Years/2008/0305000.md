Considerable damage can occur to buildings sited on liquefiable soil (such as
loose saturated sand) during strong earthquake shaking as a result of soil
liquefaction. It is difficult and expensive to perform conventional in situ soil
modification underneath a building without damaging the building and/or
utilities and surrounding structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This action is to
support an exploratory research program involving a proposed new solution - to
immobilize the porewater. The objective is to verify the practicality of this
approach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The method uses custom microparticles to reduce
pore pressure buildup. Two methods of installing the microparticles are
investigated. This solution is untested, and is a blend of high technology
chemistry, chemical engineering and civil engineering. Installing the hydrogel
under a building will require special hydrogel microparticles that exhibit time-
delayed activation, thus enabling all the hydrogels to be in place before
activation occurs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the method will have
applications in civil engineering, chemical engineering, agricultural
engineering, and medicine: The immobilization of porewater can be used to
undertake projects in dam rehabilitation, in environmental groundwater problems,
water supply, and landfill isolation. Learning about the construction of custom
microparticles may impact medical delivery technologies, and coating
technologies.&lt;br/&gt;
