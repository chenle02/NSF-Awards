This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop
high-performance and commercially attractive solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFC) using
a unique and cost-effective laser- based deposition technique based upon laser
pyrolysis, Laser Reactive Deposition (LRD), and single stage sintering. The
project addresses simultaneously the economic and performance barriers delaying
SOFC commercialization and will focus on identifying the anode and thin-film
electrolyte LRDTM processing conditions that yield optimal microstructures in
both layers after sintering at temperatures suitable for single-stage sintering
of complete anode/electrolyte/cathode cells.

By overcoming the economical and technical barriers for SOFC mass
commercialization, the project will enable adoption of fuel cells as
environmentally benign alternatives to current fossil fuel based generation
methods and will reduce the dependence on imported oil. In addition fuel cell
enabled distributed generation greatly increases power supply security and
reliability by eliminating central grid dependence. Additionally, LRD, laser-
based nanomaterials synthesis and deposition technology, has many potential
applications in electronic, optical, energy storage, and energy conversion
applications.
