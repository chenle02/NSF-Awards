Dinosaurs and mammals have many similarities, including warm-bloodedness, a
global distribution, and diverse body forms and lifestyles. This project will
explore the ways in which these two animal groups became diverse and widespread
across the globe. The results of this analysis will yield insights into why
different animal groups dominate the world's ecosystems and adapt to a large
variety of lifestyles. The fellow will measure Mesozoic dinosaur and mammal
fossils and calculate muscle lever arms, an indicator of general movement
capability. These data will be used to model the rates and patterns of lever arm
change over time and test for associations with environmental change. The fellow
will visit the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology in
Beijing to work with Dr. Xu Xing, one of the leading experts on vertebrate
paleontology, and collect data from Chinese dinosaur and mammal species.

The origins of biological innovations, such as terrestrial colonization and
powered flight, are pivotal events in vertebrate evolution, and are often
coupled with changes in locomotor morphology. Yet, little is known about how the
rate of such changes are due to trait-environment interactions. The overall
objective of this project is to quantify the rate of locomotor change in
Mesozoic mammals and dinosaurs. The fellow hypothesizes that high rates coincide
with shifts in physiology and the environment. Dinosaur locomotion has
remarkable parallels with mammal locomotion and thus provides a natural
experiment for investigating how trait-environment interactions influence
biological innovation. We will collect morphological data on the locomotor
lever-arms from Mesozoic mammal and dinosaur fore- and hind-limbs. The
simplicity of these parameters allows rate shifts to be modeled across clades
that would be undetectable using species-specific models.

This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports
summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and
China's Ministry of Science and Technology.
