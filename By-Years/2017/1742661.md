This award supports travel of graduate students to a multi-disciplinary workshop
in 2017 with emphasis on topics related to cyber-security. The travel grant will
enable career development and learning opportunities. Attending conferences is
an important component of graduate school education for future computer security
researchers. Students will have the opportunity to discuss leading edge research
with world-class computer security researchers, and establish networks,
connections, and mentoring relationships that will serve them well during their
research careers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop the graduate students will
attend is called the Secure Knowledge Management (SKM) workshop. This workshop
deals with topics in machine learning, privacy, trust, risk, and social and
economic aspects, and technology domains such as IoT, cloud computing and big
data. The requested funds will be used to support student travel awards, and
members of underrepresented groups will be especially encouraged to apply.
Students will be exposed to the state of the art in cyber-security as presented
by experts from both academia and industry. In addition, students will hear
about internships and job openings, and have ample opportunity to discuss
employment and collaboration with more senior members of the field. The results
of the conference, and the awards made possible by sponsors will be made
available to the research community.
