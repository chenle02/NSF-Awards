Atmospheric dust is an important component of physical, chemical, and biological
processes occurring on the surface of the Earth. Dust is an important result of
erosion and results in the remote deposition elsewhere of essential plant
nutrients and other chemicals. The relative role of humans in dust generation is
the subject of much conjecture supported by very little actual data. Preliminary
data from lake sediment records show that for a mountain range in the western
United States, dust deposition in the time period since the mid 19th century is
five to seven times higher than average rates over the past several thousand
years. This increase coincides with the rapid land use change of the western
states that occurred after the construction of railroads and introduction of
livestock in the late 1800s. This apparent increase results in many fold
increases in the deposition of nutrients such as calcium and phosphorus to
downwind high elevation areas, with potentially profound implications for both
the source and sink ecosystems. This project will lead to a new regional
reconstruction of western dust deposition based on analyses of high elevation
lake sediment cores. Diatom composition in the cores will help establish more
complete understanding of biological responses to changes in dust deposition.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The issue of dust is not just academic. The results have
implications for everything from chemical teleconnections across regions of the
United States, to understanding the mechanisms behind changes in reflectivity
and melting rates of alpine snow in the Rockies, and understanding trends in
regional air quality and connections to changes in land use. The project will
include the training of a postdoctoral researcher, one graduate student, and two
undergraduate students. The portion of the work in Colorado will be carried out
under the auspices of a newly developed science education and outreach effort
titled the San Juan Collaboratory, designed to provide scientific information
and educational opportunities to rural southwestern Colorado.
