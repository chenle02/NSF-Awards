This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Facilities Program will
help the Department of Chemistry at University of Wyoming acquire a console for
a 400mhz spectrometer. The research activities to be supported include:
Reguation of Extracellular Proteases by NO/ONOO: Mechanistic Control by Cysteine
Modification Photoxidations of Disulfides Reactive Geometries in Lewis Acid
Mediated Reactions of Enones Regioselectivity of Diels-Alder Reactions in
Surfactant-Based Organized Media NMR Investigation of Fluoroalkylphosphine
Complexes Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful
tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It
is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometery is essential
to chemists who are carrying out frontier reset. The results from these NMR
studies are useful in the areas such as polymers and cataysts, and in biology.
