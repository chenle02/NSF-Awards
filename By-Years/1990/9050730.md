This project incorporates two modern spectroscopic instruments into a novel,
four-year, project-based laboratory program. The instruments include an atomic
absorption (AA) spectrometer, used in first- and second-year labs, and a Fourier
-transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer, used in second- and third-year labs.
The major goal for students in this program, the development of independence and
resourcefulness, is implemented by labs with integrated content that are
separate from lecture courses and that operate on the basis of individualized,
multi-week student projects. Both the realism and openendedness of such a
program necessitate early and intensive use of modern instruments that are fast
and versatile. The chemistry program at the institution offers a realistice
introduction to the investigatory nature of science for the many students taking
only one or two years of chemistry and fosters a smooth transition by majors
into undergraduate research, graduate study, and chemical careers. Student
projects using these instruments range from AA analysis of coordination
compounds prepared in first-year labs to research-level study of hydrogen
bonding with FTIR in third-year projects. The insitution has contributed to this
project in an amount equal to the NSF funds.
