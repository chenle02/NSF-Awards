The purpose of this proposal is to continue the PI's research on the development
of various aspects of harmonic analysis and partial differential equations. The
main focus of the PI's research will be the study of soliton resolution and
blow-up properties of solutions to the energy critical wave equations and
related models, the study of the global behavior of solutions to dispersive
geometric flows, such as wave maps and Schrodinger maps, the study of periodic
homogenization, the study of uniqueness and reconstruction in local inverse
problems, the study of elliptic boundary value problems under minimal regularity
assumptions and the study of quantitative unique continuation arising from
localization problems in mathematical physics. This is a very ambitious and
innovative program of research, which should develop new ideas and tools to
treat important problems in the subjects mentioned above, which will have
lasting consequences for the developments of these subjects and which builds on
the PI's previous research accomplishments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many of the
topics in the PI's research have their origins in problems coming from physics,
engineering and medical imaging. In addition, the problems to be researched
bring together in their study tools from different areas of mathematical
analysis and geometry, further developing those areas. It is hoped that the
synergy thus created will enrich all the fields involved. The research developed
in the proposal will be the basis for graduate course, mini-courses and lectures
by the PI. It will be disseminated widely through the publication of research
papers, survey articles and monographs, through arXiv, a freely available
electronic server of preprints, where the PI posts most of his preprints and
through the PI's web page. In addition, this proposal will lead to topics of
research for the PI's graduate students. The PI works actively to increase the
participation in research of underrepresented groups. In this connection, the PI
is very proud of his record of training female mathematicians as PhD students
and postdocs. The PI hopes that the research in this proposal and its broad
dissemination will lead to an even larger number of female graduate students and
postdocs to be trained by the PI.
