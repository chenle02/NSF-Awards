As is well-known, silicon is brittle so that it shatters on impact. Due to this
brittle fracture, silicon-based structures are not machined, but fabricated in a
variety of artful ways. Above a critical temperature though, at about 600 Â°C for
bulk silicon, silicon becomes ductile, i.e., it can deform plastically. Several
recent experiments have found that sub-micron silicon structures exhibit plastic
deformation even at room temperature. While this size-dependent brittle-to-
ductile transition has a strong potential to improve the reliability and
manufacturability of silicon-based nanotechnology, our current understanding of
the phenomenon remains incomplete. The objective of this grant is to achieve a
fundamental atomic-level understanding of the size-dependent brittle-to-ductile
transition of single-crystal silicon using computational modeling. This will be
accomplished by reproducing the experimental observations with atomistic
simulations and then analyzing the simulation results and constructing
predictive multiscale models. The knowledge and understanding obtained in this
research will improve the reliability of the ubiquitous micro- and nano-electro-
mechanical systems through better designs as well as cost-efficient
manufacturing processes, which will have significant impact on the national
economy as the global nanotechnology market is estimated to reach $90.5 billion
by 2021. This grant will also be used to engage undergraduates in research by
leveraging the women in science and engineering summer research program and the
co-op program, respectively, at the University of
Cincinnati.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this study, accelerated molecular dynamics
simulations will be performed to unveil the atomic-scale mechanisms responsible
for the room-temperature plastic deformation of single-crystal silicon at sub-
micrometer scale. Computational models of single-notched blocks and nanowires
will be considered to analyze the effects of various key factors such as
temperature, size, geometry, loading rate, and free surface structures and oxide
layers. To carry out the simulations under near-identical experimental
conditions, an accelerated molecular dynamics simulation method called
hyperdynamics as well as a spatial multi-scale quasi-continuum method will be
employed. The outcomes of this research will enable investigation of other
brittle materials such as sapphire and zirconia whose machinability has also
been an ongoing issue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
