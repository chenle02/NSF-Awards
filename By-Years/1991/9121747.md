This grant is to establish a Materials Research Group at Brown University to do
research on the topic of ultrafast spectroscopy of nanostructure materials. This
is a coherent, basic program of research with a particular investigative
emphasis on the study of specific nanostructured semiconductor-based electronic
materials. The focus is defined by the study of electronic heterostructures in
terms of real-time dynamics of electronic and vibrational excitations as well as
their coupling by ultrafast laser spectroscopy. The propagation and interaction
of these excitations, and how they are affected by spatial constraints provide
the main theme of the proposal. Topics being investigated include electron-
phonon interaction, propagation of phonons, ultrafast space resolved
spectroscopy of electronic phenomena in compound semiconductors, ultrafast
electron dynamics in metallic thin films, and ultrafast dynamics of electron-
phonon interaction in semiconductor nanostructures. The Materials Research Group
undertakes materials research of a scope or complexity that would not be
feasible through traditional individual investigator research. Progress is
enhanced through a group of investigators with diverse backgrounds participating
in interactive, collaborative research.
