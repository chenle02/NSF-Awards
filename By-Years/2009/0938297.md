Dr. Michelle A. Williams is a Professor of Epidemiology and Global Health at the
University of Washington's (UW) School of Public Health. Dr. Williams is also
Co-Director of the Center for Perinatal Studies at Swedish Medical Center and
the Director of the Reproductive Pediatric and Perinatal Epidemiology (RPPE)
Training Program. In 1993, she developed the University of Washington
Multidisciplinary International Research Training (UW-MIRT) Program, which
trains students from economically and educationally disadvantaged backgrounds
for research and leadership careers in public health. By identifying and
implementing alliances for this global health program, Dr. Williams provides
undergraduate students with life enriching and academically rigorous experiences
in developing countries. At the same time, students and faculty in the MIRT
Program dedicate themselves to addressing real global public health problems
with their partners in developing countries. Dr. Williams and her team of
collaborators around the world have been able to give "hands on - minds on"
experiences to more than 150 students, affording each participant the
opportunity to become actively involved in researching and bringing solutions to
global health issues that literally affect hundreds of thousands of individuals
in twelve nations. Dr. Williams has had an enormous impact on training the next
generation of researchers, public health leaders, and epidemiologists and that
impact has been and continues to be far reaching. To date, through her work in
the Department of Epidemiology and the Minority International Research Training
Program, she has trained and mentored 23 MD graduates, 28 PhD. graduates, and 67
Master's degree graduates, twenty of whom are now faculty in institutions of
higher learning in the United States and abroad.
