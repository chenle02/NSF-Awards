This project involves the dissertation research of a student in cultural
anthropology from Johns Hopkins University. The student will study workers in a
factory in Poland which has been taken over by a western company. Using
ethnographic methods of participant observation as a worker on the shop floor
and in orientation workshops, as well as formal interviews with company
officials, government officials and workers, the student will attempt to
delineate how the `socialist` model of work-place identity is being transformed
(or failing to transform) into a `capitalist` model of the `total quality`
worker. Parallels between the change-over from assembly-line to flexible
accumulation and the change from socialist to capitalist production ethos will
be explored, since both stressed the importance of making flexible an older,
more rigid definition of personal worker responsibilities. By documenting the
changes in local beliefs about how people `naturally` act in a work-place, the
project will advance our understanding of how the global process of economic
restructuring affects workers' actual behavior in the work-place. Because
similar changes are taking place in factories around the world, this research
will contribute to the understanding not only of Eastern Europe, but on changes
in the global capitalist economy.
