This proposal provides funding for the second GREPSEC: Underrepresented Groups
in Security Research workshop, which will be affiliated with the annual IEEE
Symposium on Research in Security &amp; Privacy, in May 2015, in San Jose CA.
The first event, held in May 2013, attracted 50 participants, two-thirds of them
students, and almost all from underrepresented
groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;USC/ISI will organize a day-and-a-half-long
workshop for women and underrepresented minorities in computer security and
privacy. The workshop will be held May 16-17, 2015. This is the weekend before
the IEEE Computer Society's Security and Privacy Symposium, the premier
conference in security, and this workshop will be co-located in San Jose,
California.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broad goal of the workshop is to increase
the number of women and underrepresented minorities in computer security
research. Security is a wide field, encompassing network security, operating
system security, language-based security, forensics, privacy, as well as legal
and policy issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the organizers is to
encourage Ph.D. students who are female and from underrepresented groups to
choose security as their field of specialization. Their approach is to show the
wide range of problems within the field and how women and underrepresented
groups are working towards solving those problems.
