ITR/SY: Foundations of Solid-State Quantum Information Processing

Quantum Information Processing (QIP) lies at the forefront of revolutionary
computing research, promising radically new powers to computation and
communication, e.g., unconditionally secure quantum cryptography and quantum
logic for greatly enhanced speed on certain computational problems. This project
addresses the critical question of how to achieve a physical system capable of
meeting the two most challenging requirements for building a quantum computer --
scalability, the fabrication and coupling of a large number of quantum bits
("qubits"), and quantum coherence, the control of noise and external coupling
effects so that the exquisitely fragile quantum mechanical circuits will not be
perturbed by unwanted influences.

An interdisciplinary research team at the University of Illinois at Urbana-
Champaign is exploring a wide range of solid state systems based on the
manipulation and measurement of magnetic moments to perform quantum logic
operations. By studying the full range, from single spins to small clusters of
spins (in quantum dots), to large current loops in superconductors, they are
attempting to assess the relative merit of different techniques, and determine
the physical size limits for magnetic systems acting as qubits. The ultimate
goal is the physical realization of a small system for performing quantum logic
operations. A key component is the integration of research and education via a
highly interactive program involving undergraduates, graduate students, and
postdoctoral investigators. This project is providing a crucial role for an
explosive new field such as QIP, by providing general awareness of the issues
involved and by training a pool of experienced researchers.
