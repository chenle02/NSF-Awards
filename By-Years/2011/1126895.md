With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program, Professor
Michael Carrasco from Santa Clara University and colleague Amelia Fuller will
acquire an electrospray inonization tandem (ESI-MS/MS) mass spectrometric
system. The award will enhance research training and education at all levels,
especially in areas such as (a) identification of foldamers that mimic proteins,
(b) chemoselective glycosylation of peptides that protection from proteolysis,
(c) synthesis of glycolipopeptides, (d) aptamer selection for glycopeptides and
glycoproteins, (e) characterization of release of biogenic amines from the
pericardial organs of cancer borealis, (f) characterization of interactions
between proteins and silver nanoparticles, and (g) identification of the ligand-
binding properties of porphyrin assemblies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mass
spectrometers (MS) are used to identify the chemical composition of a sample by
measuring the mass of the molecular constituents in the sample after they are
ionized and detected by the mass spectrometer. This instrument couples a high-
resolution liquid chromatography system with the mass analysis ability of mass
spectrometry. A liquid chromatograph located at the mouth of the spectrometer
separates mixtures into their molecular components. These components then flow
into the mass spectrometer where they are ionized using an electrospay source.
The tandem mass spectrometer (MS/MS) involves multiple steps with some form of
fragmentation occurring between stages. In this way their masses, and those of
their fragments, are measured. The instrumentation will be used not only for
research but also in laboratory courses to train significant numbers of students
in the use of this important analytical technique.
