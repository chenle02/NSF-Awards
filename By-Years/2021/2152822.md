Five thousand years ago, populations from west-central Africa started to migrate
and spread into central, eastern and southern Africa in what is considered to be
the most influential event in African history. The area of origin is known to be
linguistically extremely heterogenous, and the modern languages spoken there
display unique features. This project focuses on these salient features by
compiling the first database of lexical data and grammatical properties of these
languages. Computational and phylogenetic methods applied to these new
linguistic data will provide a better understanding of the origin and the causes
of linguistic divergence. Additionally, the collection and analysis of these
different types of linguistic data will sharpen our understanding of how
language evolves and will elucidate the different evolution rates of different
components of language.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on the study
of underdocumented and underdescribed languages. The data will be analyzed with
computational and phylogenetic methods that will generate novel insights into
the first steps of the expansion from west-central Africa. Statistical analyses
will be conducted in order to measure rates of evolution for the different
components of the languages in order to understand their evolutionary dynamics.
The project will not only contribute a better understanding of African history
but also help the discipline of historical linguistics refine its methods by
identifying the optimal datasets (lexical or grammatical) to use for
phylogenetic analyses of any language family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
