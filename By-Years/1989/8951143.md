The Computer Science Department is revising its curriculum to conform to the
Association of Computing Machinery guidelines. The project is strengthening the
course content and hands-on experience of the computer graphics segment of the
sophomore and senior curricula. Clusters of Sun Graphics workstations provide
better preparation and learning of advanced graphics techniques. The project
also has significant minority student involvement. This award is being matched
by an equal sum from the grantee.
