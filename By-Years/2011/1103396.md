This project will continue and augment US representation to the International
Arctic Science Committee (IASC) through some salary support to the US VP, Jackie
Grebmeier, and travel support for both Jackie and US working group members to
attend IASC and related meetings. The proposal will also allow Sara Bowden to
provide full time support to three of the five IASC working groups. IASC is
currently undergoing internal restructuring and revitalizing in response to a
recent external review. The 10 US working group members ? two per disciplinary
area of Marine, Atmosphere, Terrestrial, Cryosphere, and Social Science ? have
recently attended their first IASC meeting in Potsdam and join an international
team purposed with the task of synthesizing, coordinating, and, to a small
extent, supporting broadly interdisciplinary, international research in the
Arctic. The proposal requests travel funds for the working groups members to
allow them to meet biannually and advance the IASC scientific agenda.
