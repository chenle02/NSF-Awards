Decision makers whose work it is to allocate resources to industrial R&D and
academic research have a vital interest in measuring the importance of patents.
If for example, the patents of today were fewer but better than the patent of
yesterday, then the observed decline in the rate of patenting would signify
little for the future of technical change and economic growth. This research
sets out (1) to measure the significance of patents in order to better gauge
their quality, and (2) to supplement the evidence on importance with better
information on networks of technology, including any limitations imposed by
localization phenomena that inhibit these flows. By carrying out tests that
provides (3) better evidence than before to bear on issues of increasing returns
to scale at the firm, regional, and national levels. These matters of the
returns to scale are central to modern economic analysis and to prospects for
growth. The research includes a series of tests of importance of patents using
two distinct cuts of the evidence: a national cut drawn from a variety of
technology-based industries that uses previously collected evidence and original
data; and an overlapping, largely regional cut that will collect original, and,
in our view, deeper evidence. The previously collected evidence draws on
received measures of the importance of patents such as citations, size of citing
firm, and number of claims, in order to assess the importance of patents for
productivity and profitability. The original, evidence, which includes an
overlapping set of firms to verify the results, cross-checks the national sample
by collecting the firms evaluations of significant patents for progress of that
firm. These measures compare to the measures used in the national sample,
including tests on a common subsample of firms. The regional sample will include
universities and government labs, enabling an (5) assessment of the importance
of these nonprofit entities to the firm's productivity with the importance of
R&D conducted by other firms.
