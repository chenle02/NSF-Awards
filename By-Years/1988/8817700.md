There are numerous examples of astrophysical phenomena where knowledge of the
effect of bombardment of ices by charged particles is crucial. Cosmic ray
particles in the Galaxy modify gases and organics which are condensed on the
mantles of interstellar ice grains. Ions in the solar wind and from solar
flares, which bombarded ice grains and icy materials in the early stages of the
evolution of the Solar System, altered the chemical nature of those materials
which then accreted to form objects such as comets. Bombardment by plasma ions
in the magnetospheres of the outer planets can alter the spectral
characteristics of the surfaces of the satellites and rings of these planets.
With this grant, Drs. Johnson and Boring, at the University of Virginia, in
collaboration with colleagues at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories will continue their
laboratory study of the changes produced in the spectral and chemical properties
of icy surfaces when bombarded by energetic, charged particles. The experimental
results will be used to understand the spectral alteration of icy grains and the
production of large molecules in the interstellar medium, the modification of
the surfaces of the satellites and rings of the outer planets, and the effect of
long term ion bombardment on cometary debris and pre-cometary materials.
