The goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to support
Native-serving institutions of higher education in building their science,
technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research
capacities. The project directed by Turtle Mountain Community College titled
“Turtle Mountain STEM Infusion Project” addresses this goal through the
implementation of a faculty professional development project that bolsters
faculty members’ STEM research knowledge and skills. Professional development
experiences span multiple years and involve faculty in cross-disciplinary
research work. The strengthening of STEM research capacity at TMCC translates to
improved STEM instruction and greater opportunities for student-involved
research experiences, strategies that studies indicate improve students’ STEM
outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through the delivery of intensive summer
workshops spanning a comprehensive set of research-related topics coupled with
summer research opportunities, this three-year project supports cross-
disciplinary faculty members in building their capacity to collaboratively
design and conduct research and to mentor students in research work. Workshop
topics include research design, data collection and analysis, and research
ethics. Project funding also allows faculty to purchase materials and equipment
to implement their research with the eventual goal of engaging students as
collaborators in the work. The project also supports faculty members and student
collaborators in presenting their research studies at local and national
conferences. Through documentation and wide dissemination of the project’s
professional development model by project staff, other colleges and universities
are afforded the opportunity to adopt and adapt the model for use in building
their institution’s STEM capacity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
