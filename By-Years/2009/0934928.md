The University of California, Irvine (UCI) Schools of Physical and Biological
Sciences is collaborating with the UCI Department of Education, regional school
districts, community colleges, informal science centers, and industry partners
to provide the infrastructure for recruiting, training, and providing
professional and financial support for future mathematics and science teachers
who are to teach in high-need school districts in Orange County, California.
Over the five years of the grant, approximately 100 summer internships for
freshman and sophomore students are to be awarded. Interns fulfill their
commitment by completing academic year preparation activities, summer teaching
and training with informal science centers, enrolling in funded summer classes,
and cohort trainings with Noyce scholars and UCI faculty. Thirty four junior and
senior students enrolled in UCI's Cal Teach 4-year STEM degree with Credential
program are to receive scholarships. Scholarship recipients fulfill their
commitment by completing their Cal Teach 4-year STEM degree with Credential
curriculum, teacher development in-service, and online training. Twenty percent
of these internships and scholarships are to be held for students from the local
community colleges, all of which are minority-serving institutions. The
supportive infrastructure for new teachers includes funding to California
Science Teacher Association conferences, semi-annual reunions with Cal Teach and
Noyce alumni and fellow new teachers, and mentoring by Cal Teach and Noyce
alumni in the schools.
