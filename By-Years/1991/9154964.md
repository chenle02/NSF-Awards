The University of Washington will initiate a four-week, commuter Young Scholars
Early Alert Initiative project which will provide science enrichment activities
for 40 precollege students entering grades 7 and 8. This program will provide
students with an opportunity to work in small groups with University faculty and
students, as well as with peers who have the same interests. The first week will
focus on proficiency in the use of computers and activities to facilitate
collaborative learning; the second on electricity; the third on machines; and
the fourth on the physics of robotics. Each unit will include a team project, a
mathematics investigation, career exploration and an ethical "dilemma".
