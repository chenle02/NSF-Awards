This is a renewal award to support Hampton University to continue a program, in
cooperation with the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography (ASLO), to
increase the numbers of underrepresented minorities electing careers in aquatic
sciences and becoming involved in ASLO activities. The program is targeted at
minority students, faculty, and professionals with interest in aquatic sciences
as well as at majority faculty working at Historically Minority Colleges and
Universities (HMCUs). The proposed activities include: free membership in ASLO
and support to attend annual meetings for three years; pre-meeting workshop to
prepare attendees for active participation in the meeting; and special sessions
during the meetings for HMCU representatives to make presentations. The combined
efforts of an HMCU and a professional society should provide an effective
mechanism to attract minority students and get them actively interested and
involved in scientific research and in professional society activities.
