through the Iowa Communications Network over a 56 kbps line. Faculty and
students will benefit from access to the resources of the Internet, including
libraries and supercomputers. In addition, they will be able to communicate and
collaborate with colleagues at other institutions in pursuit of research and
educational projects. The award provides partial support of the project for two
years.
