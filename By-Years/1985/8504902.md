The objective of this project is to develop a rational, theoretically
consistent, computer-based decision support system as a practical tool for the
evaluation of exploration programs in underground construction. The development
of this system is based on EVGE, a decision support system for determining the
value of pilot tunnels, which can also be used for computing "the value of
perfect information" (EVPI) of other exploration programs. The proposed system
utilizes a powerful geologic model based on the "continuous space, discrete
state Markov process" which is automatically updated to reflect the impact of
imperfect geologic observations. Furthermore, it makes use of computer graphics
and hypothesis testing to emulate the behavior of designers and contractors
(i.e., the users) and uses Monte Carlo simulation for the evaluation of future
exploration.
