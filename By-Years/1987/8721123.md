While normative models of judgment suggest that preferences should be invariant
across elicitation procedures, prior research has shown that preferences are
susceptible to many different influences. These include changes across response
modes, the compatibility of attributes describing the alternative and response
scale, and order effects. Because these effects contradict basic tenants of
theories of rational choice, they are of interests not only to psychologists,
but economists and management scientists as well. This proposal suggests that
these effects originate from the use of multiple underlying strategies in
judgment. Decision-makers, we hypothesize, select among a set of simplified
strategies, or heuristics in an attempt to minimize effort while providing
satisfactory level of accuracy. Many observed task effects may have their
origins in these changes in strategy. The proposed research extends our work in
modeling the effort and accuracy associated with decision strategies. We propose
a series of process-tacing studies which attempt to validate the framework for
modeling effort and error. We also hope to contribute to the empirical base by
providing process analysis of some common judgmental phenomena.
