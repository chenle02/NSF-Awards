This award continues the analysis of existing satellite data related to the
behavior of thermospheric hydrogen in the polar regions and its horizontal
distribution over the summer thermosphere. This study will include the effects
of magnetic disturbances on the perturbations in the thermosphere H density and
will examine the global morphology of the H+ ion flows in the topside F region.
The extent of the observational data base will be reviewed to identify specific
situations and the viability of the data for more comprehensive analyses in the
future. 7/13/89//
