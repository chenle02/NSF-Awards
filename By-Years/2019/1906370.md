In this project the PI will continue to study problems mainly in differential
geometry that can be formulated as highly nonlinear partial differential
equations. One of the themes is the existence of canonical geometries or shapes
on spaces. These originally grew out of Einstein's famous equation in general
relativity. One example is the existence of Kahler-Einstein metrics with conic
singularities. These beautiful structures turn out to be of central importance
in mathematics and physics, and touch upon many fields and their theory involves
progress relevant to algebraic, analysis, and geometry and topology. The
analytic techniques developed in this proposal should be useful to researchers
working in geometry, physics and elsewhere. Also, developing a better
understanding for the polarity transform in convex geometry could be useful to
solving a range of partial differential equations, and generalizes the known
theory for the Legendre transform that is a classical tool in mathematics,
mechanics and economics. The award also supports graduate students working on
their dissertations in related topics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding
Kahler-Einstein metrics with conic singularities will deepen our understanding
of smooth Kahler-Einstein metrics on both compact and non-compact Kahler
manifolds, including Fano and Calabi-Yau spaces. These spaces are central in a
wide variety of fields, ranging from algebraic geometry and number theory to
theoretical physics. Monge-Ampere type equations arise in a wide variety of
problems in pure and applied mathematics and have a wide range of real-world
applications. Developing methods and techniques to construct and approximate
such solutions and to study their regularity could have applications in other
instances where these equations appear. Moreover, developing novel connections
with algebraic geometry, convex geometry, and micro-local analysis will be an
important goal of this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
