DMS-9801013 Jean Bourgain ABSTRACT Aspects of nonlinear Hamiltonian PDE's J.
Bourgain 1. The PI intend to continue research on several aspects of nonlinear
Hamiltonian PDE's. A first line of investigation is the KAM-theory for PDE's (on
bounded domains - assuming periodic boundary conditions say), concerned with
existence and persistency of time periodic and quasi-periodic solutions. A
second theme is the wellposedness theory for the initial value problem with
special emphasis on critical nonlinearity and data of minimal regularity. The
first research direction is closely related to the theory of smooth dynamical
systems (here in infinite dimensional phase space) and localization theory for
lattice Schrodinger operators. There has been a substantial technological
progress over the recent years leading also to results in higher space dimension
(D > 2), for instance in the construction of time-periodic solutions and quasi-
periodic solutions for 2D NLS. But these developments are still in an initial
stage and a lot of challenging work needs to be done involving mainly so-called
"small-dimension" questions. The second direction aims to exploit recent
advances in Harmonic Analysis And its interplay with conservation laws and
apriori inequalities, in order to progress on some of the remaining open
problems on the Cauchy problem for certain nonlinear Schrodinger equations for
instance, with critical nonlinearity. A typical issue are the global
wellposedness questions in the defocusing case for large data. 2. Nonlinear
Hamiltonian PDE's such as the nonlinear wave equations (NLW) and nonlinear
Schrodinger equations (NLS) are mathematical models in a number of issues in
physics and engineering. They are studied by many distinct groups of scientists,
with different emphasis and often different (mathematical) tools. My interest in
this proposal is an analytically purely rigorous inv estigation. From this point
of view NLW (resp, NLS) are the typical model equations for finite (resp.
infinite) speed propagation. When considering questions of global dynamics, one
should distinguish the case of bounded and unbounded spatial domains where
different features should be expected and the "natural" problems (often
unsolved) are also distinct. Of course, a first question to ask is whether the
solution exists for all time and remains smooth in case of smooth data. Next is
the question of long time behaviour, both for individual data and the dynamics
in various phase space. In the case of bounded domains, we are particularly
interested in almost periodic behaviour. On the line, due to dispersion,
scattering often occurs and we intend to investigate this phenomenon in certain
critical cases.
