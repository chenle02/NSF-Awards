In this project, the PI will collect and analyze upper ocean velocity data using
an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) during cruise P14-C from Aukland, NZ
to Suva, Fiji, as part of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE).
Hydrographic and tracer work have already been funded for this section, and the
addition of velocity data will allow more thorough interpretation of the entire
data set.
