LAY ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;BARTNESS, TIMOTHY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Animals in nature
must forage for food to help pay their energy debts. Once they find a food
source, the food found has three fates. First, it can be eaten and the energy
used immediately if they have an immediate energy debt to pay. Alternatively, if
no immediate need exists, the energy can be stored as body fat. Finally, it can
be brought to their homes and stored as a food hoard. Little is know about what
drives the animals to forage for food, in terms of underlying brain or hormonal
factors, or what causes them to eat and burn the calories, eat and store the
calories as fat, or hoard the food for later consumption. The purpose of the
first experiments is to test some brain chemicals that control these fates of
the foraged food, as well as foraging itself by applying them to the brain. The
purpose of the second experiments is to test whether changes in body fat affect
foraging, food hoarding and food eaten by experimentally removing or adding body
fat and measuring these responses. How animals acquire, use and store food
energy is a fundamental problem in the regulatory biology of all
species.&lt;br/&gt;
