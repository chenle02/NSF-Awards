State courts are rapidly changing their operating procedures in response to the
COVID-19 pandemic. As courthouses close their doors to the public, judges,
administrators, and staff are developing and implementing policies that are
responsive to the needs of people who otherwise would rely on in-person court
processes for remedies to their civil legal problems. The COVID-19 pandemic
provides a unique opportunity to study the generation and consequences of
massive change and innovation to court policies and procedures across the United
States. This RAPID project will investigate the processes underlying the
development of these major institutional changes as state courts respond to the
challenges of remote operations during COVID-19, how the various changes are
implemented, and the effect of these changes on access to justice for state
court consumer populations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By taking advantage of the
unique circumstance of forced innovation during COVID-19, the project will
examine the procedural changes state courts craft in their move to remote
operations. Employing a mixed-method approach, the research will catalogue the
rapidly evolving COVID-19 responses in the states. The project will include
surveys and interviews of court administrators, judges, and staff about their
involvement in the changes and their attitudes about institutional design and
implementation. Further, the project will analyze how these changes influence
outcomes and processes on state court staff and consumers. By testing theories
of institutional arrangements and design, findings from the project will provide
an understanding of the external and internal forces that drive institutional
change, how policies disperse and replicate across states, and the consequences
of institutional design and changes thereto for access to justice during
COVID-19.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
