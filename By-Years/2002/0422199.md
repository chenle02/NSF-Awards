This is a project of scholarship support and student services that increases the
number of low-income computer science, engineering and mathematics undergraduate
majors who complete their baccalaureate degrees at Colorado State and prepares
them to make a smooth transition into the workforce or graduate school. Colorado
State coordinates its existing science and engineering student services
resources and its resources in the industrial sector in Northern Colorado
creating a comprehensive program to support scholarship recipients. This project
assists industries and current initiatives such as 29 CO-AMP, McNair, Women and
Minorities in Engineering Program and AGEP project to recruit and enroll
underrepresented and low-income students including women and persons with
disabilities in CSEM fields. This project not only impacts the lives of
scholarship recipients and strengthens Colorado State's ability to train its
students, it also demonstrates that students from low-income populations, given
appropriate support, can help to meet the critical need for well-prepared
technology workers in the U.S.
