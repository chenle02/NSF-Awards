9319871 Mishler The Herbaria at the University of California, Berkeley house a
botanical collection of international importance to research in biodiversity,
ecology and systematics of plants. The collection, which is now divided across
two locations in Berkeley, will be combined into a newly renovated Life Sciences
Building. This support will allow placement of the collection cases on space
saving compactor carriages, which will enhance collection growth and access by
researchers and students. %%% This support will enable the housing of the
University of California herbaria collections in compactorized units in a newly
renovated facility on campus. The collections, an international resources for
research and education in the biodiversity and ecology of plants, are now hosed
in two geographically separate locations, one of which is off campus and
therefore not readily accessible. The reintegration of the two collections on
compactor carriages in one collection area will increase room for future growth
and provide efficient access to students and researchers. ***
