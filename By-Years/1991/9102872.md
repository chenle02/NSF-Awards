The principal investigator will continue his study of Riemannian metrics and
spectral geometry. In particular, he will consider the following problems: find
conditions for the solvability of the equation of prescribed scalar curvature on
spheres, find bounds for the Sobolev constant of a Riemannian manifold in terms
of its spectral data, and construct extremal metrics with respect to functionals
arising from spectral considerations. The research supported by this award
generally will attempt to relate the local geometric information on a manifold
or surface with global information about the surface. The local information is
given in terms of partial differential equations on the surface and the global
information involves globally defined solutions to these partial differential
equations. The theme of relating local to global information is a common one in
differential geometry. One of the locally defined operators to be considered
here is the Laplacian which is perhaps the most important operator for
applications to engineering or physics.
