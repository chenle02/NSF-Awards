9623353 GRAVES This award will provide funds for materials and supplies to
enhance the dissertation research of a graduate student, David B. Carlini,
working with Dr. John E. Graves at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science. The
research project of this student involves obtaining DNA sequence data for two
genes, one nuclear and one mitochondrial, in efforts to determine the higher
level relationships among cephalopod molluscs in the subclass Coleoidea. This
fascinating group of marine invertebrates includes squid and their relatives.
The group includes many deep sea species that are not readily obtainable. Thus,
the group has been relatively neglected and is in need of systematic study and a
robust classification. This molecular phylogenetic study should provide that
classification or hypothesis of relationships, which can then serve as a basis
for other interesting research studies involving biogeography, reproductive
strategies, morphological adaptations, etc.. This award will provide support for
a graduate student pursuing information about relationships of squid and their
relatives. Support for the training of graduate students in modern systematic
methodologies is important for maintaining the workforce of scientists capable
of addressing the questions and issues of biodiversity which are of increasing
global concern. This group of marine invertebrates, like many others, is in need
of systematic study which will provide the background necessary for many other
areas of basic research as well as informing applied work such as conservation
research and bioprospecting efforts.
