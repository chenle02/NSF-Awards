Physical anthropologists study the growth and development of our primate
relatives because they offer insights into the evolution of our species. There
have been many studies which investigate postnatal craniofacial growth of the
pigtailed macaque. However, there is a paucity of data that describes the growth
and development of the fetal craniofacial complex in this species. The purpose
of this research is to construct a three dimensional model of the fetal
craniofacial complex in the pigtailed macaque and describe its growth in three
dimensions. Landmark data will be collected from three dimensional reconstructed
computed tomographic images. Finite Element Scaling Analysis will be used to
generate a three dimensional model and to describe the patterns of size and
shape changes in the craniofacial complex through time. This research will
provide the first three dimensional model of the fetal craniofacial complex in
this species. Furthermore, it will provide baseline data for the discussion of
evolutionary size and shape transformations during the fetal period throughout
primates. Finally, a non-destructive method of data acquisition (3D-CT
reconstructions) is introduced that can be used to study rare museum specimens.
