It is now evident that natural populations harbor far more genetic variation
than was expected prior to initiation of electrophoretic studies 20 years ago.
Theoretical work has clarified what processes may potentially be responsible for
the maintenance of such vast stores of genetic variation, but there has been
insufficient experimental work to demonstrate the actual mechanisms in more than
a few unusual cases. The proposed studies will investigate the importance of a
particular mechanism for maintaining genetic variation: the process of locally
varying selection in conjunction with genetically based variation in
environmental response. In particular, the magnitude and nature of genetic
variation of individual plants in response to the density and composition of
neighboring plants will be documented. These studies will permit prediction of
the response to selection under differing biotic environments. Such predictions
will be compared with observed responses in selection experiments. Because
natural variation in the biotic environment is ubiquitous in wild populations,
the findings of these studies may have bearing on the general importance of
locally varying selection. The focal species for this work include one native
and one introduced species. This system may therefore serve as a model for
elucidating the evolution of interactions between species following invasions of
exotics into wild communities and may provide insights into methods for
enhancing the success of native communities following such introductions.
