This project is a one-year study focused on clarifying the field, age, spatial,
and genetic relationship of normal and strongly- contaminated and reduced
peraluminous granite plutons with specific pre-batholith wall rocks of the
Caucasus. Biotite mineral and whole rock chemistry will be used to characterize
the redox state and halogen contents of magmatic and hydrothermal fluids. Four
weeks of field work in the U.S.S.R. is required for five north-south transects
crossing the Caucasus, ahd the research will be done in collaboration with three
Soviet geologists. A return visit for them to the U.S. will provide an
opportunity for them to engage in research of magma/wall interaction.
