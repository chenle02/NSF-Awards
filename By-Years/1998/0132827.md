This pilot project proposes to interview principals in young knowledge-based
firms in the Madison, Wisconsin area. Half will be firms that depend on
university-generated science, typically involving faculty members. Data will be
gathered to generate new inductive insights into how and when these firms use
improvisation (in contrast to more traditional action modes of planning followed
by execution, or following organizational routines) as an action mode in key
behavior. Data will also be used to assess feasibility and develop measures to
assess (1) setback incidents; (2) whether and when a firm switches to or from an
improvisational action mode; (3) changes in the firm's network of key advisors;
(4) other theory and control variables. The feasibility and measurement work
will lay the groundwork for the design of a systematic study of related formal
hypotheses. The pilot project is part of a long-term project to increase
understanding of how improvisation can either help or hurt the prosperity of
knowledge-based start-ups, and how key advisors moderate these processes.
Contemporary entrepreneurship correctly emphasizes planning skills, which are
essential. However, there is also some evidence that improvisation can represent
a valuable organizational competency, especially for firms in high risk, high
tech settings. Understanding and codifying knowledge about improvisation will
encourage the development of theory as well as more sophisticated curriculum
development in the area of entrepreneurship.
