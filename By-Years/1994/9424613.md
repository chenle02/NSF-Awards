DMS-9424613 PI: Margulis Margulis will investigate the dynamics of subgroup
actions on homogeneous spaces with applications to number theory, properly
discontinuous groups acting on homogeneous spaces, rigidity questions and
related problems in geometry and ergodic theory, and geometric aspects of
reduction theory. The theory of Lie groups, named in honor of the Norwegian
mathematician Sophus Lie, has been one of the major themes in twentieth century
mathematics. As the mathematical vehicle for exploiting the symmetries inherent
in a system, the representation theory of Lie groups has had a profound impact
upon mathematics itself, particularly in analysis and number theory, and upon
theoretical physics, especially quantum mechanics and elementary particle
physics.
