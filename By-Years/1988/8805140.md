The Research Improvement in Minority Institutions (RIMI) program was designed to
increase the participation of minorities in scientific and engineering research.
The program provides support to strengthen the research environments and
capabilities of institutions that have substantial minority student enrollments.
Eligible institutions must also have graduate programs in science or programs in
engineering. Researchers at Lehman College will use RIMI support to acquire
instrumentation to establish a central facility for research in molecular
biology. Investigators in the Department of Biological Science and Chemistry
will use the requested equipment to perform research on the analysis of multiple
two-dimensional protein gels, analyzing and sequencing of DNA molecules, and
conducting chromatographic separation of chemical solutions. These studies will
increase the institution's capability to examine the regulation, structure, and
function of large biological molecules. This project on molecular biology will
strengthen the research infrastructure of an urban university that trains
significant numbers of minority scientists. The principal investigator has a
very strong background in biochemistry and molecular biology. She publishes in
refereed journals and collaborates with excellent investigators in this area.
This award will provide opportunities for more minority students to engage in
meritorious biological research.
