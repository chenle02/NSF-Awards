Trust is important for all forms of human social interaction and lack of trust
appears to be a critical factor in creating the divisive controversies that
surround the management of risks from modern technologies. Over the past 25
years, our society has witnessed a steady erosion of trust in the technical,
legal, governmental and institutional systems that are called upon to manage
risks. This proposal describes research designed to understand the nature of
trust, its role in risk management, and the individual, technical, and
organizational behaviors that are needed to build and maintain it. Specific
studies are planned to determine the multiple facets or characteristics of
trust, analogous to the characteristics that have been found to underlie
perceived risk. Additional studies are designed to illuminate the events and
processes that create and destroy trust in risk management.
