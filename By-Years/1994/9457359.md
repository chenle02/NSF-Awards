9457359 Horne Columbia University New synthetic methodologies and strategies
will be developed uner this NSF Young Investigator Award for the construction of
structurally complex guanidine-based marine natural products possessing
important biological activities. The research will focus on the chemistry of
2-aminoimidazoles, where key targets are saxitoxin and related gonyautoxin
alkaloids. A recently discovered 2 + 4 -cycloaddition reaction of
2-aminoimidazoles will be employed to generate tetrahydropurines, which will
allow a short synthetic route to saxitoxin and gonyautoxins. This grant from the
Organic Dynamics Program supports the research of Professor David A. Horne at
Columbia University. Marine naturally occurring compounds that contain basic
nitrogen atoms (alkaloids) will be synthesized. Some of the alkaloids to be
synthesized are neurotoxins which are found in red-tides. In the course of this
research it is anticipated that new synthetic methods will be developed as well
as shorter routes to the naturally occurring alkaloids. Related compounds that
will be synthesized have potentially interesting medicinal properties.
