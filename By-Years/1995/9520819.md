9520819 ANDERSON Groundwater enriched in nitrate may be a significant non-point
nutrient source to near-shore ecosystems. The importance of this nitrogen source
will depend upon the site of discharge and biological transformations that occur
during transit of groundwater from uplands across the coastal margin. Intertidal
wetlands are conspicuous occupants of intertidal areas throughout the eastern
coast of North American. As groundwater contacts anaerobic marsh sediments, the
nitrate present may undergo denitrification to nitrogen or dissimilation to
ammonium. Depending upon which process occurs, nitrogen will either be conserved
within or exported out of the system. There is no method currently available to
simultaneously quantify and differentiate between dissimilation and
denitrification. This work proposes using stable isotope technology along with
conservative tracers to determine rates of dissimilation and denitrification and
relate measurements to seasonal organic carbon fluctuations and net marsh
community production.
