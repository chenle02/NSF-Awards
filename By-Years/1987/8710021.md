Dr. Harold Papkoff plans to continue his important studies on the isolation and
characterization of pituitary hormones from the pituitary glands of a number of
lower vertebrates (birds, reptiles, amphibians and chickens). These hormones are
the factors that regulate growth, development and the reproductive cycle in
these organisms. Over the past few years, Dr. Papkoff has developed procedures
for the purification of these important hormones and has supplied them to
comparative endocrinologists working on reproduction and growth in these
animals. In this proposal, he plans to characterize the pure hormones in terms
of their amino acid sequences, the nature of any carbohydrate side chains that
may be part of the molecules and the physical nature of the hormone molecules in
terms of their shape and steric orientations. These latter studies are
particularly important because they may lead to a better understanding of the
differential biological potency or reactivity of these hormones in the different
biological systems. This information is critical to understanding hormone action
at the molecular and cellular level and in the design of drugs or hormones that
could be used to regulate growth and reproductive process in all vertebrates.
