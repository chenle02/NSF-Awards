9308660 Keeney Regulations intended to reduce health and safety risks and
thereby reduce fatalities cost billions of dollars. A crucial question is
whether the costs of some of these regulations induce more fatalities than the
regulations themselves avoid. Several aspects of this critical issue are
addressed by the methodology developed in this research. Existing evidence
indicates that lower incomes are associated with higher mortality risks.
Previous work quantified the relationship between lower incomes and higher
mortality risks. A model was developed for estimating the number of fatalities
induced by economic expenditures. This model indicated that, depending on the
distribution of costs of regulations throughout society, one fatality may be
induced for each $3 to $7.5 million cost of regulation. This research will
extend the existing model. Analyses will be performed to examine the
implications of using average census tract income data in analyses using the
model and to indicate whether the relationship between lower incomes and
increased fatalities has been changing over the last forty years. Because of the
important role that such results might play in policy decisions affecting the
allocation of billions of dollars to address public risks, the proposed research
will also address questions of how to appropriately interpret and use the
results of the research. ***
