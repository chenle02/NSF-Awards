Abbott, Nicholas L.&lt;br/&gt;Gordon Research
Conference&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"2003 Chemistry of Supramolecules and
Assemblies"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this grant is for partial
support of the Gordon Research Conference of&lt;br/&gt;Chemistry of
Supramolecules and Assemblies to be held 6 - 11 July 2003 at Proctor Academy,
Andover, New Hampshire. The funds requested will be used to fund graduate
students, in particular, female and under-represented graduate students, and
provide them with an exceptional opportunity to learn about the frontiers of
colloid and surfactant science. Funds will also be used to support the
attendance of foreign speakers. The participation of foreign speakers will
enrich the conference by enlightening the US participants of research in
supramolecular engineering and science outside of the US.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attendance of 110 -120 scientists and engineers is
expected. The conference will be organized along the lines of synthesis,
properties and applications. The program for the conference has four themes: 1)
Novel Materials for Sensing, 2) Surfactant-Templated Materials, 3) Novel
Surfactant Systems and 4) Supramolecular Chemistry for Nanotechnology. A final
report will be prepared and submitted to the National Science Foundation.
