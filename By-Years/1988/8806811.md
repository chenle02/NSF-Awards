Decision-based design, where the engineer makes decisions associated with the
design of an artifact, consists of four phases, namely, partitioning, planning,
solution, and post-solution analyses. The principal investigator will develop
the capability for partitioning and planning in original, adaptive and variant
design. To accomplish this he will develop two computer programs, namely,
partitioner (an expert system) and planner (a hybrid computer program). In order
to validate this approach, he plans to develop three cases, namely, design of a
novel mechanism (original design), design of a solar powered irrigation system
(adaptive design), and design of pressure vessels using composite materials
(variant design). This work will contribute to two aspects of the knowledge
needed in design, namely, knowledge about design and knowledge for design.
