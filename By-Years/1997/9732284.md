9732284 Irlandi The University of Miami, Rosenstiel School of Marine and
Atmospheric Science (RSMAS), Center for Marine and Environmental Analyses (CMEA)
is establishing a Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site focused on
science in support of management of south Florida coastal resources. This
project will develop a three-year program (1998-2000) of summer research
experiences involving eight undergraduate interns per year, with emphasis on
(but not restricted to) recruitment of students from Historially Black and
Historically Minority Colleges and Universities (HBCUs and HMCUs). Participants
will assist research mentors from CMEA in laboratory and field work, as well as
develop and execute an independent research project with the direction and
guidance of their mentor. Participants will be involved in projects ranging from
the effects of anthropogenic stressors on the status and health of coral reefs,
seagrass ecosystems, and fishery resources to the integration of science and
management. On-site field trips to management agencies will also be made to
heighten the awareness of the type of research needed for effective management
of coastal resources, as well as to introduce participants to non- academic
career options.
