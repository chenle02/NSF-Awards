The California Institute of Technology Submillimeter Observatory (CSO) operates
the only U.S. based submillimeter wavelength telescope. With excellent
sensitivity for both continuum and spectroscopic observations and with angular
resolutions between 30 and 8 seconds of arc, innovative projects can be
undertaken to provide critical new information in many fields of astronomy,
including studies of the Solar System, our Galaxy, and extragalactic phenomena.
This grant will support a multifaceted scientific research and technology
development program focussed on the 10.4 meter diameter telescope of the CSO.
The telescope is sited at an altitude of 4100 meters on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, where
the atmosphere is very dry and ideal for observations at wavelengths as short as
320 microns. During the grant period, new receivers should become available for
routine observations at wavelengths shorter than 800 microns. One half of the
observing time is available for use by the general astronomy community.
