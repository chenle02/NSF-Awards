9628266 Faulds The response of the continental crust to extension is complex and
incompletely understood, as is the role that magmatisms plays. This project will
examine the response to extension in the Eldorado Mountain area of the Colorado
River extensional Corridor where a strong depth gradient is exposed. to the
north, extension is accommodated by primarily brittle features while to the
south, large-scale normal faults bring deeper-level rocks to the surface.
Mapping and structural analysis of the plutons and structural features,
supported by geochronologic geochemical and paleomagnetic studies, will
establish the composition and three-dimensional partitioning of strain in the
thick crustal section. Results should provide important insights into several
fundamental problems including mechanism of crustal extension, how continental
crust is modified by extension and the role of magmatism in extending terranes.
