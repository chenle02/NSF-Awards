The control of bacterial metabolism will be studied at very low growth rates
under conditions in which product formation may be uncoupled from cellular
growth. Experiments are designed to provide data for the development of
structured metabolic models capable of quantitatively predicting microbial
growth based on a cell's genetic organization. Fed-batch or cell-recycle reactor
systems will be developed to allow accurate measurements of microbial metabolism
at controlled rates of nutrient supply. Measurements of cell viability,
macromolecular synthesis, and energy consumption will be performed to determine
the extent and stability of metabolic uncoupling. Growth rate control of the
expression of regulated enzyme networks (regulons) will be measured using
radioisotope labelling, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and enzymatic gene
fusions. Initial studies will look at the particular case of phosphate
limitation in two model systems: E. COLI in which the behavior can be analyzed
in terms of the genetics of the PHO regulon; and B. SUBTILIS in which the
regulation of protein secretion, antibiotic synthesis, and sporulation
initiation can be investigated.
