Managing a secure software environment is essential to a trustworthy
cyberinfrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;Software supply chain attacks may be a top
concern for IT departments, but they are also an&lt;br/&gt;aspect of scientific
computing. The threat to scientific reputation caused by problematic
software&lt;br/&gt;can be just as dangerous as an environment contaminated with
malware. The issue of&lt;br/&gt;managing environments affects any individual
researcher performing computational research&lt;br/&gt;but is more acute for
multi-institution scientific collaborations as they often preside over
complex&lt;br/&gt;software stacks and must manage software environments across
many distributed computing&lt;br/&gt;resources. Increasingly, these
collaborations and individual investigators have turned to
Linux&lt;br/&gt;container images (packing application software, operating system
and other needed libraries&lt;br/&gt;into one entity) for their platform
portability and scientific reproducibility advantages. However,
in&lt;br/&gt;doing so new software sources from both public and private
repositories are introduced into the&lt;br/&gt;supply chain, thus bringing new
risks. The Securing an Open and Trustworthy Ecosystem for&lt;br/&gt;Research
Infrastructure and Applications (SOTERIA) project is an element within NSF's
fabric of&lt;br/&gt;coordinated Cyberinfrastructure that helps collaborations
avoid security pitfalls while reducing&lt;br/&gt;the burden of scientific
software management. SOTERIA aims to provide researchers with&lt;br/&gt;improved
discoverability, visibility, and traceability of their software
environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SOTERIA operates a container registry for
open science. The registry has been customized to&lt;br/&gt;meet the unique
needs of the scientific environment, including associating the
researcherâ€™s&lt;br/&gt;identity with container images, providing image security
scanning and introspection (visibility),&lt;br/&gt;and integration with other
digital object identification and archiving services. SOTERIA
also&lt;br/&gt;operates a container distribution service with tools to trace
image provenance through the&lt;br/&gt;ecosystem. Finally, as the challenge of
managing secure software environments goes far&lt;br/&gt;beyond container
security, SOTERIA provides training and education on best practices
tailored&lt;br/&gt;to researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
