This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will address the need to
of power component performance as a function of system design to reduce the
overall risk associated with integration. The project focus is the development
of a Power Component Evaluation System (PCES) which improves on traditional
methods of system evaluation. PCES couples actual power hardware to a virtual
simulation of a system through a Simulation-Stimulation (Sim-Stim) interface
which sources and sinks power to the Hardware Under Test (HUT) as well as
measuring variables. Since PCES should replicate the HUT's performance just as
if connected to a physical system, the Sim-Stim interface will be transparent to
the overall operation. The objective is to develop a methodology to design Sim-
Stim Interface parameters for a wide range of power system types, operating
modes and phenomena so the HUT operates as if it were in a physical system
within a prescribed level of accuracy. The anticipated result of the research is
a metric to perform trade offs between implementation complexity and accuracy.
PCES will enable the development of new all electric and/or hybrid-electric
systems as well as quantifying the effect of new/prototype hardware components
on such issues as power quality, vulnerability and power transients.

The potential commercial benefits of the PCES system will be a faster, cheaper
and more effective method for the design, development and commercialization of
new electric power products and services.
