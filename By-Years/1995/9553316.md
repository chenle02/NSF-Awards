9553316 Peak The National Conferences on Undergraduate Research (NCUR) is a not-
for-profit organization dedicated to encouraging and nurturing scholarship done
by undergraduates in all academic disciplines and at all institutions of higher
learning. The catalytic agent for NCUR's various programs in support of
undergraduate research is its annual, three-day conference that brings together
some 1200 students and 400 faculty representing about 300 colleges and
universities from almost every stat in the nation. In addition to being the
primary showcase for the intellectual achievements of American's undergraduates,
this conference provides a unique opportunity to build communities of scholars.
In particular, NCUR has a strong commitment to facilitating the networking of
minority undergraduate scholars with each other and, to help meet that goal,
NCUR has an avowed policy of providing scholarship support for minority students
with financial need to attend the annual conference. Aided by continuing funds
from the National Science Foundation, scholarships at the last six conferences
have risen sharply from 33 to 115 and total attendance by those designating
themselves as being of minority ethnicity now approaches 20 percent. The funding
requested in this proposal will permit NCUR to continue to actively seek out
wide participation of minority students and faculty (in the sciences and
engineering) at the annual National Conference. It will permit NCUR to develop
workshops and other activities at the annual conferences of special interest to
these participants. And, finally, it will allow NCUR to develop a database to
assess the effectiveness of undergraduate research participation in influencing
the career choices of minority students.
