There is a current, critical need for developing novel methods for the
separation and purification (or, removal) of valuable (or, waste) products from
process liquids. This research program seeks to develop a novel membrane with
chemically-active "carriers" to selectively remove ionic and other species form
liquids. The program, if successful, will lead to very selective membranes with
the stability of the more conventional membranes.
