LBP:\A9320285 Lieberman This project involves a cultural anthropology graduate
student from the University of Florida, studying the health and medical
practices of a small group of South American Indians. The student will live with
the Indians in three hamlets in the Brazilian Amazon to assess the effects of
varying contact with the Brazilian National Indian Agency (FUNAI) on their
health and medical practices. Using techniques of compiling personal medical
histories, dietary analysis, anthropometry, time allocation studies and
ethnographic interviews, the student will assess the viability of the
traditional belief system. This research is important because it provides
information about one of the few remaining communities of foragers in the world,
who are changing rapidly. Aside from the benefits to U.S. science of training a
professional anthropologist and providing knowledge about this important area of
the world, this sort of case study about medical traditions and practices will
provide valuable information which can be used to inform policies of any state
with respect to such small, unintegrated groups. The research also has the
potential of discovering valuable traditional health practices which could be
beneficial in other situations. ***
