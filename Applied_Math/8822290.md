The general objective of this project is the development and analysis of
mathematical models of solid tumor growth by diffusion. The models will describe
the evolution from an initial multicellular spheroid of a tumor, taking into
account the diffusion of nutrient and growth-inhibitory factors within the
tumor. The mathematics involved in the project includes the study of nonlinear
diffusion equations and integro-differential equations. Questions of existence,
unicity, stability, and qualitative behavior of solutions to these equations
will be addressed.
