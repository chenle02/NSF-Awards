0118594&lt;br/&gt;Miller &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a planning
visit for PIs Kate Miller, University of Texas at El Paso&lt;br/&gt;and Lincoln
Hollister, Princeton University to travel to the Kingdom of Bhutan. Their
research goals require that they first visit the country where they will work
with Bhutanese geoscientists to deploy a seismic network in Bhutan. They will
also train scientists at the Bhutanese Geological Survey (BGS) in modern seismic
monitoring techniques. Once they have finalized this work, they will prepare a
full proposal for submission to the Geosciences research directorate.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This activity will initiate seismic studies in a unique
and previously inaccessible region of the Himalayas and will enhance current
seismic research on the Himalayan region. Collaboration and training of
Bhutanese scientists in seismic hazard assessment will constitute the first
steps toward establishing a national seismic monitoring network in a region with
significant seismic hazard. &lt;br/&gt;
