The research of this project falls in the area of 3-dimensional topology. The
central objects of study in this area are spaces called 3-manifolds. A
3-manifold is an object that locally looks like the ordinary 3- dimensional
space but whose global structure can be complicated. An important part of
3-dimensional topology is also the study of knots (loops embedded in some
tangled way in 3-manifolds) and their classification. The solution of Thurston's
Geometrization Conjecture has established that 3-manifolds (and complements of
knots in them) decompose into pieces that admit explicit geometries and that
hyperbolic geometry is the one that appears more often. In practice, however,
3-manifolds are often given in terms of combinatorial topological descriptions
and it is both natural and important to seek ways to deduce geometric
information from these descriptions. One of the ways that topologists have been
approaching the study of 3- manifolds is through the use of invariants. In the
last few decades ideas originated in physics led mathematicians to the discovery
of a variety of invariants of knots and 3-manifolds. Understanding the
connections of topological and combinatorial quantities and invariants to
geometry is a central and important goal of low dimensional topology. The main
theme of this project is to establish such connections and explore their
ramifications and applications to other areas of mathematics.

This project will establish relationships between geometry and combinatorial
descriptions, properties, and quantum invariants of links and 3-manifolds. The
PI has developed a setting for establishing new unexpected relations between the
colored Jones link polynomials, the topology and geometry of essential surfaces
in link complements, and hyperbolic geometry. One part of the project will
continue developing this theory and exploring its applications. Another part,
will combine several new techniques, to develop methods for recognizing
geometric structures on 3-manifolds from purely combinatorial input, and derive
estimates on geometric quantities from topological data. A third part will study
skein link theory in 3-manifolds, its invariants, and its interaction with
geometric decompositions of 3-manifolds. A fourth part will explore the
applicability of quantum knot invariants to classical questions in knot theory
and search for a classification of crossing changes that do not alter the
topology of the underlying knots. The project also involves the research of
graduate students currently working with PI.
