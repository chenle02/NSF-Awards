This project includes the development and evaluation of pilot studies of
creativity in an IT research organization with three primary objectives: (1)
combine IT and social science methodologies; (2) extend our understanding of
individual and team creative processes; (3) develop and evaluate new types of
interventions and interfaces that incorporate affect, context, and social
interaction to leverage opportunities to promote creativity. The intellectual
merit lies in the development of hybrid methodologies, combining social science
and computer science approaches to multiple behavioral and affective elements
for creativity in an IT research organization. The research will improve our
understanding of organizational creativity and advance the development a new
generation of integrated Creativity Support Tools that are applicable within
teams and organizations. Broader Impacts: Creativity is required for advances in
all areas of human endeavor. The methods and frameworks developed are broadly
applicable throughout academic and industrial IT research organizations, and
they are also adaptable to a broad spectrum of organizations that increasingly
need guidance and support to foster creative practices and innovation. The
methods and tools will also apply to people performing a wide range of personal
endeavors as they engage in their own creative pursuits. The findings and
systems will advance academic and industry collaborations and will be broadly
disseminated throughout multiple research communities, IT organizations, and on-
line communities.
