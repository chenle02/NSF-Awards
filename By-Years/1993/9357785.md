Within the next several years, worldwide information systems will deal with the
collection interpretation of several gigabytes of data generated daily at
thousands of individual sites. Locating data in such a heterogeneous
distributed-database system, is tantamount to funding the proverbial needle in a
worldwide haystack. To accomplish this endeavor, an appropriate data model based
on an understanding of the type and magnitude of the data collected and on the
type and relative frequency of the queries to be performed on the data are being
developed. Algorithms for conducting parallel searches, indexing, and
compression of the multi-faceted data are required. Also necessary are the
protocols for communicating among the many nodes that constitute the entire
search space. These protocols must allow for efficient, reliable, and secure
distribution of queries and results among a variety of platforms. Multicomputer
search engines at each data storage site are developed. A set of collaborators
employs the prototype for evaluation and their feedback will be incorporated
into the final implementation. The results obtained in this research may serve
as a guideline for the development of worldwide both rigidly and loosely
structured databases.
