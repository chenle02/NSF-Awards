This project aims to better understand random and pseudorandom processes and the
interplay between them. For example, one major focus of the project is a model
from statistical physics that replicates power-law behavior seen in the
distributions of the frequencies of earthquakes, avalanches, etc. This model
exhibits behavior of striking complexity resulting from simple rules, and is a
natural de-randomization of related stochastic models from physics. Another aim
of this project involves new kinds of probabilistic analyses of algorithms.
These may, for example, give guidance on which algorithms may be efficient for
"typical" inputs, and which will not. Finally, this project supports the
education and mentorship of undergraduates through opportunities for engagement
in research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal concerns two principal research
directions. The first concerns a pseudorandom diffusion process -- the Abelian
sandpile -- which is at the same time both extremely simple in its mechanics,
and extremely complex in its behavior. The rich fractals produced by the model
had frustrated decades of inquiry. This project aims to extend the mathematical
framework recently developed by the principal investigator and collaborators;
for example, to understand the effect the choice of underlying lattice has on
the behavior of the sandpile. The second area concerns new kinds of
probabilistic analyses of point configurations and networks. For example, the
question of the length of the shortest cycle through a collection of points in
the plane is the Traveling Salesman Problem for Euclidean space, a problem of
both classical theoretical interest and immediate practical utility (in
transport problems, drilling problems, etc.). A major educational goal of the
project is the mentorship of undergraduate research; the investigator has
experience in designing courses and research seminars that have been effective
for this goal.
