The project is to pursue ongoing investigations into core areas of computational
geometry, in particular, cell decomposition, mesh generation, multidimensional
searching, and geometric optimization. The research will span the spectrum from
the theoretical (e.g., lower bounds, geometric sampling techniques,
derandomization) to the practical (implementation and distribution of geometric
software). Progress in the field has been hampered by the difficulty in testing
out new geometric ideas on a computer. As a result, experimentation has often
taken a backseat to theoretical research. Essential to this project is the
building of software tools (e.g., algorithm animation, visual debugging, test
data generation) that facilitate and encourage the use of experimentation. ***
