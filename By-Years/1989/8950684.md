An undergraduate research program has been established involving about one-half
of the college's graduates each year. This program was developed after thorough
review and revision of the curriculum. To implement the program and perform
research on a variety of topics of interest, the department will purchase a
research quality light microscope for study of cells, tissues, plankton, and
chromosomes, a horizontal laminar flow hood and inverted microscope for cell and
tissue culture studies, a low temperature freezer for storage of a variety of
materials used in cell, tissue, and biochemical studies, and a high performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) system for analysis of red oak flavonoids and
bacterial toxins. The equipment will be housed in the research lab to be used by
undergraduates. The department will now be able to offer high-quality research
experience, a key ingredient in undergraduate science education. The college
will provide 50% matching funds.
