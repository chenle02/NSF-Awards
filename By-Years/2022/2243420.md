The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is a single-step
preparation of a special class of materials, chitin nanofillers, from biomass
waste such as shrimp shells. The preparation process demonstrates increased
safety by utilizing environmentally friendly solvents of high stability in place
of boiling acid, which is currently employed in repurposing biomass waste. The
process also eliminates the disposal of acidic waste, reduces scale-up issues,
and minimizes production costs. There is a unique commercial opportunity for
these materials as they exhibit mechanical strength and are suitable additives
for the preparation of high-performance plastics. This technology may ultimately
result in sustainable products such as high-end plastics that form
nylon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the use of
chitinous waste to prepare chitin nanofillers and the subsequently use of these
materials to impart strength in commodity plastics. Specifically, this
technology is a one-step method for obtaining chitin nanofillers by direct
treatment with a specific solvent. The process reduces the amount of chemicals
required and decreases the volume of process waste while avoiding the need to
handle the boiling acidic solutions that are used in traditional preparation of
chitin nanofillers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
