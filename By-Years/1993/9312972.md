This is a travel award for exploratory visits to the University of Washington,
Seattle, and the University of California, Berkeley. Both visits will provide
opportunities to meet faculty and examine facilities at the institutions. The
purpose of the visits is to facilitate discussion of potential postdoctoral
training, and tentative planning of scientific research to be pursued. Both Drs.
Gelb (Seattle) and Klinman (Berkeley) have expressed interest in having Mr.
Francisco visit their laboratories for this purpose, and in ultimately serving
as his mentor.
