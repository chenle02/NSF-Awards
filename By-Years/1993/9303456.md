9303456 Cole Newly isolated mutations that cause specific lesions during
conjugal development in Tetrahymena thermophila will be characterized by
fluoresence and immunofluorescence microscopy in combination with double-mutant
analysis. The analysis should identify significant developmental checkpoints as
well as the necessary and sufficient conditions for passing such checkpoints.The
biochemical control of chromatin condensation will be studied by the use of
conjugal-block mutants in collaboration with Dr. David Allis. Conjugation
mutations that produce 100% penetrant conjugal-arrest phenotypes will be used to
isolate secon- site suppressor mutations in order to expand the genetic base of
our investigation. As possible, developmentally important genes which complement
conjugal-block phenotypes will be cloned. %%% Tetrahymna thermophila is a
genetically complex but approachable experimental system which can be induced to
undergo conjugation between two compatible mating types. This process will be
dissected by genetic and microscopic analysis and, when possible,
developmentally important genes will be cloned and preliminarily characterized.
Undergraduate students will be involved in the research. ***
