This research concerns the arithmetic theory of quadratic forms. In particular
there will be special emphasis on the classification and representation problems
of positive definite forms. With respect to the classification theory the
Principal Investigator will investigate both the explicit and complete
determination of certain genera as well as the relationships between even
unimodular quadratic forms over integers of a number field and their algebraic
descents. In the area of representation of quadratic forms he will study
primitive representations of n-ary forms by positive definite m-ary quadratic
forms and representations of binary forms by certain positive quaternary
quadratic forms. Quadratic forms are homogeneous polynomials in many variables
of degree two. This research concerns the number theory problems which arise in
determining which integers can be values of them when integer are substituted
for their variables. Classifying quadratic forms in classes that all have the
same values and representing the forms by simpler forms are valuable tools in
answering this problem.
