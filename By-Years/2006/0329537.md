This is a Dissertation Research proposal by Peter Schweitzer and Sveta Yamin of
the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, to do comparative research in Alaska and
Russia, Beringian region, on the social dimensions of taste, starting from the
divergent cultural attitudes of these populations toward mushrooms. Utilizing
ethnographic and ethnohistoric research methods, the proposed project aims to
better understand the historic and contemporary social-cultural context of
Beringian populations through the symbolic, economic, historic and political
meanings and uses of mushrooms specifically and food generally.
