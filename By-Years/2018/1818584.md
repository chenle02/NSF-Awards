This grant will fund the annual summer CEDAR (Coupling, Energetics and Dynamics
of Atmospheric Regions) workshop for the three summers of 2018 to 2020. CEDAR is
a broad-based, community-initiated, upper atmospheric research program with the
targeted goal of understanding the behavior of atmospheric regions from the
middle atmosphere upward through the thermosphere and ionosphere into the
exosphere in terms of coupling, energetics, chemistry, and dynamics on regional
and global scales. These processes are related to the sources of perturbations
that propagate upward from the lower atmosphere as well as a result of solar
radiation, particle inputs and electric fields from above. Traditionally the
CEDAR meeting has been regarded as the foremost workshop for the CEDAR community
of over 1,850 people worldwide. The activities supported within this program
combine observations, theory and modeling. Additional services are provided
throughout the year to keep the database of names, addresses and emails current,
as well as supporting community unity through wiki web pages and community
emails.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CEDAR Workshop and associated community
services would be managed by the UCAR Cooperative Programs for the Advancement
of Earth System Science (CPAESS). The mission of CPAESS is geared toward
preparing and training the next generation of weather and climate scientific
leaders and workforce by supporting effective and collaborative fellowships,
visitor, and workshop programs that meet emerging training and research
needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
