This award supports participants in the 2017 Maine-Québec Number Theory
Conference, to take place on October 14-15, 2017 at the University of Maine.
This is an annual conference, held at Laval University in Québec in even years
and at the University of Maine in odd years. By providing a forum for number
theorists from New England, Québec, and beyond, it promotes interaction and
collaboration between Canadian and American mathematics researchers.

The conference features approximately 35 lectures addressing recent progress in
different areas of number theory. The small scale of the meeting (with roughly
65 attendees) makes this a good opportunity for graduate students and young
mathematicians to interact with leading researchers. This award also provides
some travel support for U.S.-based participants to attend the 2018 meeting in
Québec. The conference website has more information, including participant lists
and programs from recent years:
