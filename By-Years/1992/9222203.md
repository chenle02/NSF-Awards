9222203 McIlvane A continuing interest in comparative psychology is the degree
to which different species can perform different types of stimulus
classification. Stimulus classes are demonstrable when (1) two or more
physically dissimilar stimuli occasion the same behavior and (2) events that
directly affect one class member also affect the other(s) indirectly. This
project asks if rats can form one type of stimulus class, called a "contingency
class," which may result when two or more stimuli covary in their relation to a
common behavioral outcome (e.g., a food delivery). Contingency classes have been
demonstrated in humans and birds, but not yet in rodents. A demonstration of
these classes in rats would establish the generality of the relevant behavioral
processes in relatively small-brained mammals. It would also permit further
tests to evaluate whether or not rats can form a second type of class, an
"equivalence class." Equivalence classes are higher-order, contextually
determined classes that are thought to underlie relatively advanced cognitive
capabilities. Such classes have so far been demonstrated only in humans, higher
primates, and sea lions; the capacity of smaller-brained species to form
equivalence classes is unknown.
