This Small Business innovation Research Phase I project proposes to demonstrate
the feasibility of using a passive sensor, embedded within concrete, to measure
moisture, temperature, and concentrations of chlorides. It will provide critical
data for evaluating concrete performance starting with the initial quality
control period of freshly mixed or freshly cast concrete, through its useful
service life, to the period of deterioration and repair. Data obtained from
these sensors should result in longer service life, lower infrastructure costs
and the development of more effective means of remediation. The device will be
powered and interrogated using radio frequency energy from a distance of over
one meter, returning a unique identification number so that data can be
correlated with sensor location. Data will be read by frequency analysis of one
or more RLC antennas in the device, whose resonance frequencies will be altered
by changes in the surrounding material. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The initial
strength and the service life of concrete used in roadways and its moisture
content from the time that it is placed onwards significantly affects bridges.
Such a multi-functional sensor can be so pervasively useful because moisture and
temperature are the primary drivers for the hydration of portland cement, and
are essential factors in the most prevalent deteriorative processes such as
damage due to freezing and thawing, alkali-aggregate reaction, sulfate attack or
delayed Ettringite formation. &lt;br/&gt;
