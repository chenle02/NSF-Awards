Reproduction in most species of animals occurs during that season of the year
when conditions for raising young are optimal. This study explores physiological
control of seasonal reproduction in the American tree sparrow by focusing on the
mechanisms that regulate secretion of an essential hormone of reproduction
Ä±luteinizing hormone) (LH)!. Previous work has established that LH secretion
increases when male tree sparrows are transferred from a short to a long daily
photoperiod (for example, from 8 hr. of light per day to 20 hrs. of light per
day). Two mechanisms control LH secretion: one is analogous to a throttle and
drives LH secretion; the other is analogous to a brake and retards LH secretion.
A long daily photoperiod is stimulatory because it augments the drive on LH
secretion, rather than in the brake, and largely determines when the
reproductive season begins and ends in birds exposed chronically to long daily
photoperiods. The mechanisms that decrease the drive on hormone secretion or
modulate the brake to terminate or control the transition from the non-breeding
to the breeding state, respectively, are not understood. This investigation
specifically explores (a) whether the drive on LH secretion in male tree
sparrows exposed to short daily photoperiods is daylength-dependent; (b) whether
the eyes are components of the mechanism that decreases the drive on LH
secretion at the end of the breeding season and modulates the brake on LH
secretion; and (c) the relationship between restoring the drive on LH secretion
and intensifying the brake. The results will clarify general physiological
principles underlying initiation and termination of seasonal reproduction and
suggest improved management strategies for domestic and /or wild (including game
and pest) species that breed seasonally.
