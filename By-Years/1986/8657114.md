Many Drosophila homeotic and segmentation genes contain a conserved protein-
coding sequence - the homeo box. These genes function in the morphogenetic
programming of early Drosophila development and genes homologous to the homeo
box have been found in a wide variety of higher animals including mouse and
human. A very realistic possibility is that the homeo box may enable the
identification and cloning of genes controlling the patterning of early
mammalian development. Dr. McGinnis is attempting to determine whether the homeo
box encodes part of the morphogenetic programming function of homeotic genes. He
is also studying the nature of the genetic functions that are included in the
Drosophila gene family with homeo box homology. In addition he will determine
what role the homeo box genes of the mouse play in development. Dr. McGinnis has
made substantial contributions to the field of Developmental Biology by his
discovery of the homeo box. The Program recommends support for this outstanding
young investigator.
