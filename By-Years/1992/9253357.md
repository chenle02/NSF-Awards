This proposal provides for the enhancement of content knowledge and pedagogical
skills of under-prepared teachers of physical science. Participants will include
24 high school teachers of physical science in Texas. The program will utilize
the instruction of a team of experienced, highly successful high school physical
science teachers who are officers of TTOPS (Texas Teachers Organization for
Physical Science) in conjunction with a pair of university professors in physics
and chemistry. The project includes three components. These components focus on
a two-week series of summer institute workshops on the basic concepts taught in
the high school physical science courses; a series of follow-up workshops during
the academic year on supplementary topics; and visits to the school and
classroom of the participants to provide assistance with the implementation,
evaluation of the program and reinforcement. Cost sharing is equivalent to 25%
of the NSF award.
