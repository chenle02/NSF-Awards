This project seeks to identify portfolio management strategies that are optimal
for endowment and retirement planning. Endowed institutions and retirees have a
shared preference to avoid spending cuts at the expense of foregoing spending
increases -- shortfall aversion. A central aspect of retirement planning is the
role of health spending in extending life spans, which is still poorly
understood and largely ignored in standard models. Graduate students will be
trained as part of the project.

Shortfall aversion introduces a novel aspect of preferences, distinct from
usual risk aversion, and leads to different implications for investment and
spending policies. Retirement planning problems lead to a rich class of new
models, in which agents can reduce their mortality through investment in health
at the expense of current consumption. Such models have the potential to explain
the low annuitization observed in reality, and bear on several questions for
retirement planning, such as the relation between wealth and longevity and the
dynamics of medical expenses.
