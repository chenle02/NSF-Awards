Systematic software analyses, such as model checking and symbolic execution,
perform systematic exploration of program behaviors to find faults in software
systems. While the usefulness of systematic software analyses for improving
software reliability has long been established, scaling them to real-world
applications remains a key technical challenge, since the state spaces of these
applications typically are large and computationally expensive to explore
systematically.

This project develops a memoization-based approach to enhance scalability of
systematic analyses. Specifically, the analysis results are re-used to amortize
the cost of analysis over multiple successive executions of the analysis. The
project investigates foundations that provide the basic tool-set for enabling
reuse of analysis results, optimizations that specialize memoized analyses in
the context of change, and the use of parallel techniques to effectively utilize
the available computing resources. The technical contributions of the project
could significantly enhance the efficacy of systematic analyses, which could
have a broad impact by improving the quality of software systems.
