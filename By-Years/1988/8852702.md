Current optical communication systems utilize radio frequency/ microwave signals
to modulate an optical carrier, which is then transmitted through an optical
fiber. An interdisciplinary laboratory is being established at the undergraduate
level for the design of rf/microwave circuits for optical communication systems,
with an emphasis on design considerations and interactive aspects. The proposed
laboratory will enhance experimental skills in both rf/microwave and optical
concepts.
