9319409 Subramanian A new computational prototyping tool is proposed for
conceptual design and simulation of opto-electromechanical devices. The primary
objective is to improve the quality of designed products and to reduce the
number of physical prototyping iterations by using this tool in early design. A
compositional technique of constructing complex design topologies by putting
together known design fragments in a systematic manner is used. This process is
grounded in a set of primitive design fragments which are parameterized
solutions to specialized sets of design constraints. The focus is on multi-
domain designs, in particular designs with electrical, optical and mechanical
components; instead of single domain designs. Constraints are a unifying
representation in the design process. The behavior of multi-domain devices is
specified as sets of constraints, the process of generating alternate conceptual
designs is that of constraint solving, and the design tool as a whole is
embedded in a constraint programming environment. The constraint-based
unification achieves rapid generation of conceptual alternatives, and tight
integration of design with fast simulation to verify behavior.
