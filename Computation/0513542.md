The investigators study reduced-order models for distributed parameter systems
with an emphasis on complex fluid flows. They seek flow-adapted reduced-order
bases and methods that synthesize energy-based developments in turbulence
modeling with approaches that exploit approximate inertial manifolds. Their aim
is to overcome limitations of linear model reduction methods that don't
accurately model the transfer of energy among time and length scales. An
important part of this study is the development of efficient algorithms to
compute reduced-order bases that respect the distributed data synonymous with
the simulation of complex fluid flows. Many of the techniques they study can be
extended to larger classes of dissipative systems.

Reduced-order modeling is required when either predictions need to be made in a
timely manner, such as in weather forecasting, or when multiple high fidelity
simulations are not practical, such as in product or manufacturing design. By
incorporating better energy transfer among scales and utilizing the structure of
the underlying mathematical model, this study aims to build better predictions
and extend the range over which these reduced-order models are useful. Improved
models for complex fluids would, for example, lead to better forecasting and
climate predictions, better estimates of the spread of pollutants, and more
integration of reduced-order modeling in the design of molds for die-casting.
The investigators also have a plan for training undergraduate and graduate
students in techniques of reduced-order modeling.
