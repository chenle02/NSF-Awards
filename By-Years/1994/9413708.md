A 20 Tesla superconducting magnet system and a Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-
IR) spectrometer will be acquired with funds from the Academic Research
Infrastructure Program. The magnet system will be utilized in conjunction with
the UC-Santa Barbara free-electron laser, a femto-second optical laboratory, an
existing dilution refrigerator, and the FT-IR spectrometer to explore nonlinear
and linear magneto-optics and magneto-transport in scientifically and
technologically important systems. The research focuses on: nonlinear magneto-
transport in the terahertz frequency regime associated with quantum wells and
superlattices in semiconductors; saturation and relaxation in semiconductor
nanostructures in large magnetic field; linear and nonlinear spectroscopy of
vortex cores in high temperature superconductors; magneto-spectroscopy of self-
organized quantum dots; spectroscopy of quantum wire superlattices; magneto-
luminescence and magneto-absorption experiments in spin-superlattices; quantum
hall effects in mesoscopic structures; and magneto-transport and the metal-
insulator transition in conducting polymers. An acquired 20 Tesla
superconducting magnet system, used in conjunction with a free-electron laser, a
femto-second optical laboratory, an existing dilution refrigerator, and a new
acquired Fourier transform infrared spectrometer, will be used to study a range
of topics in the magneto-optic and magneto-transport areas concerning
semiconductor superlattices, quantum wells and quantum dots as well as high
temperature superconductors, one-dimensional conducting polymers, and spin
superlattices.
