Dr. Jack A. Kampmeier and other members of the Chemistry Department at the
University of Rochester are being supported to continue a Research Experiences
for Undergraduates (REU) site in chemistry. For the period 1997-99, ten
undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in
basic research projects drawn from the traditional areas of chemistry. Research
opportunities also include the university-industrial collaborations in the NSF
Science and Technology Center for Photoinduced Charge Transfer. Additional
activities include discussions of careers, graduate work, and scientific ethics
with graduate students and faculty. Participants are recruited from four-year
colleges, inlcuding women's colleges and historically black colleges, as well as
the University of Rochester.
