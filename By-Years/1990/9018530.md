This award supports a ground-based radar sounding program in Antarctica on Ice
Stream B with a primary purpose of determining the differential motion between
the top of the ice and the base of the ice and the top of the bed. This will be
done by measuring the movement, relative to the surface, of diffraction
("fading") patterns associated with irregularities in the ice-bed interface.
Differential motion, which can be measured with a resolution of about 1 meter,
will be attributable to shear deformation within the ice sheet and sliding on
its bed. It is also planned to determine bed topography for drill-hole site
selection and strain analyses, monitor drill holes for lateral penetration of
water layers, study internal layering, and map near- surface crevasses using a
short-pulse, high-resolution radar system.
