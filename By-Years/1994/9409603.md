9409603 Keasling The goals of this project are to understand how low-copy
plasmids are maintained in bacteria by quantifying the cell-cycle replication
patterns, the degree of segregative stabilization, and the metabolic burden of
naturally-occurring replication and segregation elements. This information is to
be used to design and engineer chromosome-like vehicles in applications
involving complex cellular manipulations and requiring a high degree of
regulation. Escherichia coli is to be used as the subject for these
investigations, because metabolism and macromolecular synthesis are well
understood in this organism. ***
