9316871 Henyey This research is to reduce and analyze seismic reflection data
from the Mojave Desert and San Bernardino Mountains in Southern California. The
seismic data were collected using three-channel portable recorders to detect
seismic waves generated by aftershocks of the 1992 M=7.5 Landers earthquake. The
goal of the experiment is to study the depth of the crust in the region by
comparing the travel time differences between waves traveling through the crust
and those reflected from the base of the crust. Crustal depths are important to
models of the shape of the San Andreas fault surface in the southern California
region. This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction
Program. ***
