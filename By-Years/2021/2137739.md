This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of
2021 (Public Law 117-2). Recent advances at the intersection of mathematics and
biology have demonstrated that topological methods can help address one of the
fundamental challenges in science: how DNA functions as the building blocks of a
living organism. In laboratory experiments, biologists react circular DNA
substrates with proteins and capture protein signatures in the form of changes
in the shape of the DNA. The mathematics of topological objects (for example,
knots, links, and tangles) are then applied to these biological observations to
deduce the action of proteins. The project's research objectives are to classify
experimentally obtained images of products of protein-DNA interactions; to
accurately model strand dynamics of protein-DNA interactions; and to share the
computational tools developed in the course of this work, ultimately creating a
database for mathematicians and biologists working on related scientific
questions. This project is also designed to attract underrepresented students to
STEM studies and careers, particularly at the intersection of mathematics and
biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To further the understanding of the dynamics of
DNA topology, the PI will apply combinatorial tools to interpret 2-dimensional
projections of DNA products of protein action. As DNA knots are 3-dimensional
objects, some information is inevitably lost when they are projected into
2-dimensions. In previous work, the PI extended the relationship between skein
relation knot quadruples of 4-plats algebraically. The overall goal of this
proposed research is to extend the utility of knot quadruples with combinatorics
by focusing on the 2-dimensional projections of knots with no crossing
information. The proposed study will allow for the creation of quadruples that
have not been categorized with previous techniques, while also refining
previously found bounds on knot distances. In addition, the project will
continue to pursue the PI's service mission: to support those underrepresented
in STEM by creating and supporting programs that increase visibility of, and
amplify the voices of, women and people of color in STEM, and create networks
and community in STEM to provide opportunities to share
resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
