This award supports the principal investigator's research on the connections
between Algebra, Algebraic Geometry, and Topology. The goal is to gain a better
understanding of the way that structures in algebraic geometry are reflected by
structures in topology, using a blend of algebraic and topological methods.
Several old conjectures will be attacked, and hopefully settled. In addition the
project provides research training opportunities for graduate
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One part of the project is to find clean proofs
of parts of the proof of the recently-verified Bloch-Kato conjecture. A related
part of the project involves motivic homotopy theory; one goal is to understand
how Voevodsky's slice filtration is related to algebraic cobordism and other
motivic spectra and to verify several of the slice conjectures. The PI will also
study the relationship between the singularities of a variety, its K-theory and
its cdh-cohomology, using recently developed cohomological techniques. A final
part of this project is to show that the algebraic Witt group of varieties
behaves well with respect to polynomial and Laurent polynomial
extensions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
