Most member states of the United Nations are not democratic. Developments over
the past decade have shown, however, that undemocratic regimes are increasingly
unstable. The collapse of Communism offers an extraordinary opportunity to study
the process of change from authoritarian to democratic regime. Democratic
transitions are occurring simultaneously in more than a dozen Central and
Eastern European countries. And, unlike transitions elsewhere, democratization
is occurring simultaneously with the transition from non-market to market
economy. Every one of the democratizing regimes faces major problems that
threaten the establishment and maintenance of their representative institutions.
This project investigates the evolution of political support for new democracies
of Central and Eastern Europe. A pooled, time series data set will be created
from a series of 46 New Democracies Barometer surveys conducted over the past
five years in the nations of Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary,
Poland, Romania, Slovenia, Belarus and Ukraine. This data set will allow the
testing of political-cultural, economic, and social theories of mass support for
(or rejection of) democratic regimes.
