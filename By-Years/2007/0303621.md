This collaboration between the University of Colorado at Boulder (CU) and Texas
A\&amp;M University (TAMU) will explore a new nanostructured material concept
and new nanofabrication techniques for Hybrid Magnetic Nanostructures to explore
predictions of dramatically novel properties. In hybrid systems, fabricated from
materials with different and even mutually exclusive states, a strong mutual
interaction between subsystems can dramatically change the structure and
properties of the constituent materials. This approach offers unlimited horizons
for qualitatively new science and technology. The main focus in this exploratory
research will be Hybrid Magneto-Superconducting Nanostructures (HMSN), but,
prospects for application of this concept to novel nanostructured magnet/magnet
and magnet/semiconductor hybrids will also be evaluated to explore predictions
of dramatically novel properties. The concept of magnet/superconductor
nanostructures has been introduced by a number of researchers, including the
PIs' groups, with expectation of novel physical phenomena and important
properties for applications. However, experimental realization of such hybrids
is far behind theory. Existing experimental results in the field have relied on
nanolithographically fabricated magnetic dots on superconducting films.
Nanolithography, however, is comparatively cumbersome, thus limiting further
development in the field. We propose a new nanofabrication strategy: magnetic
metal will be electroplated into etched pores in alumina or polycarbonate
substrates to create Magnetic Nanorods (MNR) with the diameter in the nanometer
range and length in the micron range. Superconducting (SC) films will be coated
on the substrate, which has been polished smooth or partially etched to leave an
array or protruding MNR.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dependence of the critical
current versus MNR concentration, shape, size, materials and the external
parameters temperature and field will be studied with the goal to optimize the
FL pinning and the preparation technique.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An immediate
benefit is an inexpensive procedure for preparation of superconducting films
with high critical current. Of broader impact is the availability of a unique
HMSN system, which can have not only the theoretically predicted unusual
properties, but also unexpected physical behaviour. More significantly, the
fabrication technique can be readily extended to produce magnetic nanorods
embedded in other types of materials (different magnetic materials or even
semiconductors) to yield hybrid magnetostructures with potential for even
further new physics and/or technological applications. Both senior researchers
routinely involve students/postdocs from underrepresented groups&lt;br/&gt;
