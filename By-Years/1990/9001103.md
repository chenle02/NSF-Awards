This project will study transport phenomena in symplectic mappings of four or
more dimensions. The goal is to partition phase space into regions bounded by
partial barriers through which flux occurs. A candidate for such a region is a
resonance, defined as a volume in the neighborhood of an elliptic point; its
boundary will be obtained from limits of librational periodic orbits. Resonance
volumes will be computed and we will determine whether resonances partition
phase space. The correlation function for orbits in the neighborhood of a
resonance boundary well be studied to determine whether the series for the
diffusion tensor converges. Transport will be defined in terms of the flux
across resonance boundaries, including branching ratios for transitions from one
resonance to a neighboring one, as well as drift along a commensurability
channel. To compute the latter a restricted symplectic map will be introduced
and studied. Numerical techniques will include frequency filtering and finding
periodic orbits.
