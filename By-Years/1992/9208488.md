This project focuses on the physics of metal surfaces and thin films. The
collective and dynamical properties of electrons in surfaces and thin films are
studied by a range of surface physics techniques, including photo electron
spectroscopy, LEED, and inelastic electron scattering. The research provides
some of the best current tests of theories of the electronic structures of
metal. The work also tests theories of electron spectroscopy lineshapes, and
their relation to electronic structure. The inelastic scattering experiments
address dynamical properties, such as plasmon excitations of electrons in
metals.
