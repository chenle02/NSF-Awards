In order to address the needs of regional employers, this project at Chippewa
Valley Technical College (CVTC) is creating pathways for its students to pursue
careers in the STEM professional workforce. One pathway is providing well-
qualified associate's degree graduates to employers in fields such as advanced
manufacturing, construction and computing, while a second pathway leads to
transfer to four-year institutions to pursue higher academic degrees as STEM
majors. In addition to serving the needs of a growing industrial presence in
western Wisconsin, the project is establishing a point of entry into STEM higher
education for students in several rural high school districts in the vicinity of
CVTC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From a technical standpoint, the project is awarding
100 S-STEM scholarships to full-time students enrolled in the following
associate's degree programs at CVTC: Industrial Engineering Technician, Civil
Engineering Technician, Manufacturing Engineering Technologist, Information
Technology-Network Specialist, Information Technology-Software Developer and
Nano Engineering Technology. Besides the scholarships, support for the S-STEM
scholars includes monthly events that focus on future educational and
professional opportunities, access to a STEM Career Advisor, peer-led study
groups and mentoring by faculty, alumni and industry professionals. Through the
use of institutional research data and student surveys, outcomes being measured
include the impact of the project on the enrollment, academic performance,
retention and graduation of the S-STEM scholars, employment secured by program
graduates and successful transfers to four-year institutions.
