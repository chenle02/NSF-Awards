This is a Phase II SBIR proposal to develop holographic techniques and
instrumentation to structural and earthquake engineering applications. The Phase
I research produced viable holography tools, and achieved a successful
demonstration of the technique from the instrumented water tank experiment. The
Phase II research will design an operational system through an experiment to
test the necessary components for a prototype instrument employing double pulse,
TV holographic interferometry. Experimental and analytical study in advanced
optical methods in hologram recording and data interpretation will be conducted.
Methods in structural engineering and measurement of earthquake effects will be
investigated using the techniques developed in this project. The research will
lead to development of advanced techniques for measurements and monitoring of
structural response and damage assessment. It has a high potential to contribute
to the solutions of nation's civil engineering infrastructure problems such as
aging transportation systems and to the mitigation of earthquake and other
natural hazards in terms of improved safety resistance of existing structures.
