Research on theoretical, empirical and public policy issues of technological
standards in computing and communications is producing a growing body of
important literature, a part of which deals with understanding the process of
standardization and the impact of standards on technological progress and
economic efficiency. This workshop seeks: to assess the contributions of recent
research in this area, from presentations of papers by representative leading
researchers in economics and related disciplines; to facilitate and clarify
examination of these issues by developing some basic conceptual and
terminological guideposts for this young research area; and to identify the most
promising theoretical and empirical research questions relevant to the policy
issues surrounding standardization. The workshop will be limited to about 24
participants and will be held in mid-June, 1988 at Stanford University. The
eleven papers presented at the workshop will be reproduced as part of Stanford
University's Center for Economic Policy Research's Discussion and Technical
Paper Series.
