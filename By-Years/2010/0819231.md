Children, adults, and scientists alike confront the world with a common
question: Why? We wonder why people behave in particular ways, why objects have
specific properties, and why events unfold as they do. Previous research
suggests that there are different kinds of explanations with unique properties,
among them mechanistic explanations that appeal to causal mechanisms, and
functional explanations that appeal to functions and goals. For example, a
tiger's stripes can be explained mechanistically by appeal to genes and
development, or functionally by appeal to camouflage. The proposed project
investigates the relationship between these kinds of explanations and basic
cognitive processes. In particular, the investigators will ask the question of
whether mechanistic and functional explanations lead to different ways of
conceptualizing objects, and even to different ways of representing the causal
structure of the world. Given the intimate relationship between explanation and
understanding, explanations may have far-reaching effects on
cognition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The proposed work will address contemporary
issues in cognitive psychology concerning causal reasoning and categorization,
and has the potential to resolve current controversies concerning the nature of
causal representation and the role of causal beliefs and functions in
categorization. The project is also of relevance to issues in philosophy
regarding causation and explanation, and will foster interdisciplinary
communication. Finally, by uncovering the characteristics and consequences of
different kinds of explanations, the proposed work will lay the foundations for
research concerning children and adults' understanding of scientific
explanations, including why some scientific explanations are especially
difficult to grasp and how this difficulty can be overcome.
