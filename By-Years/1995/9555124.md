This project is to develop an interactive multi-media software package to
enhance a student's ability to read and interpret engineering construction
drawings. Construction drawings convey to other engineers and lay people the
designs of bridges, highways and buildings. They are called "contract drawings"
because they define a contract between the architect, the engineer and the
contractor as to how the finished project is to look, what materials are to be
used, and how it is to be built. The goal is a set of software called Civil SEVE
(Structural Engineering Visual Encyclopedia). Besides filling the void created
by the elimination of reading and interpretation of engineering construction
drawings, the software will promote the understanding of structural engineering
terminology and increase the a student's three dimensional visualization of
structural systems.
