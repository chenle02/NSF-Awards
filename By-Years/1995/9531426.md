9531426 Nemser This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project
explores a new concept for a self-contained, compact oxygen-enriching membrane
module that can enhance net peak power of electric vehicle fuel cell (EVFC)
stacks by at least 25%. By both simulation and fuel cell tests, Phase I
confirmed feasibility of 30-38% oxygen enriched air can improve net peak power
(over 35%) compared to gains achieved by conventional pressurization (12%).
Cruising efficiency was also found to be improved. Phase II will pursue
demonstration of the technology with tests on a 10kw utility vehicle and the
effects of higher operating temperatures and increased oxygen levels Potential
commercial application of this technology will be in on-board fuel cell power
packs for the next generation electric vehicle. It may also find use: 1) on
conventional cars and trucks for enhanced engine power and less pollution; and
2) in enhanced breathing apparatus for patients with respiratory ailments.
