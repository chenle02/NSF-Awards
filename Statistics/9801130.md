9801130 Project: Sixth Purdue International Symposium on Statistics Abstract:
This international symposium will be held from June 17 to 21, 1998, at Purdue
University. The symposium consists of a workshop June 17-19 on "Synthesis and
Interfaces of Major Statistical Paradigms" and a conference June 19-21 on
"Statistical Decision Theory and Related Topics". The workshop will focus on the
major approaches such as frequentist, Bayesian, likelihood, and bootstrap
paradigms. The different paradigms are not simply separate approaches that
should be developed individually, but are instead pieces of the puzzle of
statistical inference that must be fit together. One of the primary purposes of
the conference on decision theory is to use the unifying nature of decision
theory to enhance cross-fertilization among apparently disparate areas of
statistics. The conference is a natural adjunct to the workshop. Statistical
decision theory is increasingly used in modeling and analysis of decision
problems in business, economics, medicine, law, reliability and quality control,
risk assessment, and numerous other fields. It attempts to provide a formal
approach to decision making and statistical inference by asking that explicit
numerical criteria be given and that the merits of a statisitcal procedure or
decision be assessed by these criteria. The broad topics for the conference
include classical subjects within or related to statistical inference and
decision theory. The interface workshop examines areas where the different
paradigms used by statisticians may be unified in methodology. The focus is on
model selection and testing, confidence sets and prediction intervals,
nonparametrics and statistical computation. A large portion of the grant will go
towards expenses of graduate students, new researchers, and members of
underrepresented groups.
