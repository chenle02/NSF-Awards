ABSTRACT 97-07383 Lidstrom Environmental significance of population diversity in
methane-oxidizing bacteria This project investigates different classes of
methane-using bacteria to ascertain their properties in a natural ecosystem: the
sediments of Lake Washington, Seattle. Newly developed environmental gene probes
will be used to enumerate specific classes of methane-utilizing bacteria, and
these results will be correlated with process measurements for trace gas cycling
by these bacteria. Bacteria that use methane gas are important components of
natural ecosystems. Methane gas is produced from the natural breakdown of dead
organisms, and these bacteria consume this gas, keeping the carbon in the
methane within the ecosystem. Methane gas that escapes from aquatic and
terrestrial ecosystems enters the atmosphere, where it becomes a greenhouse gas
with a potentially significant contribution to global warming. It is important
to understand natural populations of methane-utilizing bacteria, and the details
of how these bacteria cycle trace gases such as methane.
