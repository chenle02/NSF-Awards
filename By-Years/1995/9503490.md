9503490 Flynn The Low Energy Electron Microscope (LEEM) is a recently- available
materials characterization technique which allows low energy electrons to probe
the outer layers of a solid. With LEEM it is possible first to image surface
topography, second to observe diffraction from the periodicities of the near-
surface structure, and third to image using photoelectrons and thus probe the
spatial variation of electronic structure. These instruments are very well
adapted to the examination of samples through the range from high temperature to
below room temperature. In situ dynamical studies offer special opportunities to
view in real time not only bulk but also surface phenomena. As LEEM instruments
operate in the limit of ultrahigh vacuum where surfaces remain uncontaminated
for many hours, the dynamics of surface structure and reactions thus become
accessible. A further major asset is the availability in the vicinity of the
sample of access ports that can house molecular beam sources for eptiaxial
growth conducted before or during observations. Commercial machines which offer
these powerful combinations of capabilities are just now becoming available. The
time is therefore ripe for the dedicated application of a LEEM instrument to
materials research problems of critical interest tot the materials research
community. This machine will be used to study the real time imaging of kinetic
step flow processes that occur during growth, oxidation or other reaction on the
surfaces of precisely tailored samples. Our focus on the materials themselves
promises to document and systematize information of this type for a variety of
crystal types, in addition to the discoveries of new processes that typically
rewards this type of exploratory research. This (LEEM) will be placed in the
University of Illinois EpiCenter, a central facility dedicated to the crystal
growth and surface processes of metals, ceramics, and semiconductors.
