A laboratory course on computer design for computer science and engineering
science students will be improved by the addition of a pair of Tektronix
microprocessor development systems. This instrument provides for the creation
and editing of software in assembler, Pascal, and C languages, storage in
memory, and (by interface of the instrument with the prototype) monitoring of
program execution to correct hardware and software errors. Such instruments are
in common use in industry so that such CAD training should be standard for
laboratory courses of this type. The addition of the instruments at Loyola will
greatly improve students' understanding of the relationship between computer
hardware and software.
