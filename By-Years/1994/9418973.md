ABSTRACT CTS-9418973 Morteza Gharib Detailed measurements of three-dimensional
velocity, vorticity, and temperature fields in the wake behind a circular
cylinder will be carried out using novel high-resolution techniques; these
measurements will be related to the mean global properties of the cylinder (heat
transfer coefficient, for example); and provide information for comparison with
numerical models of flow and heat transfer in the same geometry being performed
concurrently by another investigator. The comparison will provide needed
validation (or invalidation) of the accuracy of contemporary numerical
predictive techniques.
