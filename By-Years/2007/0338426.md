This U.S.-Polish cooperative research project aims to apply new results obtained
in the field of nonlinear light-atom interactions, based on the atomic coherence
and quantum interference effects, into the studies of nonlinear magneto-optic
phenomena. The principal investigators are Dr. Dmitry Budker from the University
of California - Berkeley and Wojciech Gawlik from Jagiellonian University in
Krakow. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts resulting from the proposed
activity are that the results of the research on novel methods in magnetometry
may be applied in medicine, biology, military surveillance, space research and
national security. There may also be no better teaching tool as many of the best
young scientists in this field in the U.S. were trained to work on precision
measurements - such as the ones proposed in this project.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project in physics research fulfills the program
objectives of bringing together leading experts in the U.S. and Central/Eastern
Europe to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong
mutual interest and competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and
mutuality of benefit.
