Researchers have predicted that there would be significant economic aftershocks
of any major California earthquake, with the magnitude of that impact estimated
to be two to five times the value of direct physical damage. This project will
examine the data from the Loma Prieta Earthquake to assess the macroeconomic
impact of that earthquake on the Bay Area economy. Macroeconomic impacts include
the economic effects of the earthquake on employment, income, and output of
industries in the region. Some additional work will be conducted, if possible,
to estimate the effects on the economies of the State and nation. Data will be
obtained from both published and unpublished reports on the economic impacts of
the earthquake, unemployment claims and employment statistics. Additional data
on damage to transportation and lifelines, buildings, and building contents will
be obtained from public agencies and other sources. The analysis of these data
will use ABAG's input-output model for the San Francisco Bay Area. Input-output
analysis provides a method of desegregating an economy into its constituent
sectors, thereby providing a format within which these sectors can be studied in
depth and structural interdependence of the economy can be related to
consumption patterns. One key goal of this project will be to identify the major
factors affecting the size of the economic losses (and gains) for two reasons:
(1) to enable future researchers to better predict the economic implications of
future earthquakes; and (2) to enable better analysis of the costs vs. benefits
of earthquake mitigation strategies.
