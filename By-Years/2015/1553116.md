Billions of geotagged and time-stamped images are publicly available via the
Internet, providing a rich record of the appearance of people, places, and
things across the globe. These images are a largely untapped resource that could
be used to improve our understanding of the world and how it changes over time.
This project develops automated methods of extracting useful information from
this imagery and fusing it into high-resolution global models that capture geo-
temporal trends. Once the trends have been captured, these models are used to
improve performance on computer vision tasks and make geotagged imagery a usable
and navigable resource for education and research in other disciplines. The
project includes an education and outreach component that brings real-world
problems to computer science (CS) students, mentors students across the
educational spectrum, and makes the research accessible to the
public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops computer vision technologies
to capture spatial and temporal appearance trends and is organized into four
main research thrusts: (1) investigating novel methods for extracting
information from Internet imagery using weakly supervised learning, (2)
developing techniques that integrate ground-level imagery with aerial and
satellite data to model the expected image appearance anywhere in the world at
any time, (3) evaluating methods for using such models to improve the
performance of computer vision algorithms, and (4) automatically creating visual
representations that make it possible for novice users to explore the learned
geo-temporal trends via the Internet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project webpage:
