This project is an investigation into some computational problems that arise in
the physical mapping and sequencing of chromosomal DNA. The goals of the project
are (1) to investigate new strategies for certain parts of these computations,
aimed at improving speed and/or reducing the amount of expert intervention
required, while preserving solution quality, and (2) to add new capabilities to
existing mapping and sequencing systems. A pervasive theme throughout the
project is to take experimental error into account in the computations. The
investigation into physical mapping concentrates largely on one method in use at
the University of Washington's Department of Molecular Biotechnology, namely
Multiple Complete Digest mapping. Within the map assembly stage of this method,
new algorithms are being investigated for identifying the clone fragment
containing the cloning vector, determining which clone fragments arise from
identical fragments on the target DNA being mapped, determining the probability
of pairwise clone overlap, and other related problems. In addition, the project
includes investigations into a general placement problem in physical mapping, a
method of sequencing without mapping, and the effects of experimental error on
molecular computation. The principal investigators will use their experience in
algorithm design and analysis to help establish a rigorous foundation for the
computational aspects of these biological problems. This may in turn result in
direct impact on the experimental methods used.
