A new, comprehensive method for the analysis of seismic hazard is developed to
incorporate features of the earthquake source, the attenuation of seismic waves,
and the effects of local geology and soil. The new method, based on a fast
probability integration scheme developed in structural reliability, will allow
the incorporation of refined models in the hazard analysis. It will also allow
proper analysis of model uncertainties and evaluation of sensitivities of the
hazard to various models or parameters. Alternative measures of ground motion
intensity, including vector representations, will be possible with the new
method. A general-purpose computer code with the above capabilities will be
developed and will be made available to the engineering community. The research
will lead to a rational hazard analysis method which breaks across the
interdisciplinary barriers by making use of the expanded seismic data base
available and the better understanding of the physical process involved by
earthquakes achieved lately.
