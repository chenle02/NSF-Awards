In most heat transfer devices which involve fluid flow, the flow passages are
irregular in shape. Furthermore, in an attempt to increase the rates of heat
transfer, irregularities are often introduced into flow passages. A focused, in-
depth study of heat transfer in irregular passages will be conducted. It will
cover both forced convection and natural convection situations. As a special
focus, the research will deal with the cooling of electronic equipment, which is
a key heat transfer application.
