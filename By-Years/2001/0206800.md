This grant provides funds to support an annual engineering design contest to be
held in conjunction with the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE)
National Conference. All members of SHPE student chapters will be eligible.
Students will work in teams of two to six to provide the design and a prototype
of a commercially marketable product that is a benefit to mankind and improves
quality of life. The design shall not be a duplicate of an existing product, but
may be an enhancement of an existing product. About ten finalists will represent
their student chapters in a formal presentation run-off, and a winner will be
selected by a panel of four to six judges. The selected students will be funded
to travel to and attend the National Conference, where the final competition
will be held. &lt;br/&gt; It is expected that this activity will help to attract
Hispanic students into engineering and to improve their retention rates. It also
will provide an interesting and useful experience to those who participate.
