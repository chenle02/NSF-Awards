The objective of the research is to develop a mathematical foundation to gain-
scheduling and nonlinear control engineering. While gain- scheduling enjoys
widespread application, it remains an ad hoc practice guided by heuristic rule-
of- thumb. The research will provide further understanding of gain scheduling,
thereby confirming the heuristic guidelines behind gain- scheduling and giving
them precise quantitative interpretations. The nonlinear control engineering
research deals with robust stability analysis, performance limitations of
nonlinear systems, and nonlinear time-varying controllers for linear uncertain
systems.
