Markets bring together traders with widely divergent beliefs and motivations for
the purpose of exchange. Economic tradition asserts the market selection
hypothesis, that the market sorts traders. Those traders most directly concerned
with profits and with the most accurate forecasts of the future will come to
dominate the market. This hypothesis is used to justify a variety of modeling
assumptions about markets, including rational expectations in macroeconomic
models and informationally efficient markets in finance. However, it has never
been carefully examined.

This project has two goals: To study the validity of the market selection
hypothesis and, more generally, the implications of trader heterogeneity for
market behavior. The validity of the market selection hypothesis depends upon
market structure. If market structure allows all potential gains from trade to
be realized, the market selection hypothesis will be valid. If not, markets will
sort traders in other ways which we hope to uncover. Market selection becomes a
more delicate issue when traders have incorrect beliefs but are learning. In
this case the question is how the market sorts across learning rules. Although
general equilibrium analysis does not require similar traders, modeling practice
in macroeconomics and finance eschews trader heterogeneity. We will show how
market models with diverse traders exhibit very different (and more realistic)
market behavior from the market models now in vogue. Our work opens a door for
behavioral analysis in markets because the market selection hypothesis is not
always correct, and even when it holds it has implications only for long-run
market behavior. While it is possible to postulate the existence of traders with
arbitrary behavior patterns, the market sorts among these traders and only a few
behaviors will in fact determine market prices in the long run.
