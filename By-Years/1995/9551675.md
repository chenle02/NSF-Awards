60305-1402 ILI - Instrumentation Project: Life Sciences Title: Incorporating
Modern Molecular Biology Lab Activities into the Undergraduate Curriculum The
singular purpose of the project is to enhance the undergraduate students'
understanding and experiences in biology through the incorporation of modern
molecular biology experiments and activities into courses in their programs. The
few current lab experiences in this area point to an evident curricular need for
updating the program. Modification of an existing course together with the
development and implementation of two new courses enables the students to have
meaningful hands-on experiences with molecular biology equipment and techniques.
Depending on the course level, students will understand and do some or all of
the following procedures: isolate and visualize DNA through agarose
electrophoresis, isolate plasmids and cut with restriction enzymes, transform
bacteria, clone and subclone genes, amplify DNA, utilize computer analysis. The
molecular biology equipment associated with this project (micropipetters,
microcentrifuges, electrophoresis apparati, UV transilluminators, PCR equipment,
a computer station, and other supporting equipment) is essential for students to
acquire the desired hands-on familiarity with modern molecular technologies as
they develop the conceptual framework of this discipline.The course ehhancements
are targeted to a large number of future teachers, health care workers and
future research scientists.
