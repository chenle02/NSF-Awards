This award will continue work on multiple generations of hematite growth. CRM
research to include synthetic magnetite will be expanded by synthesizing
magnetite at room temperature by exploiting the fact that "green rust", easily
produced in the laboratory, alters spontaneously to magnetite in the absence of
oxygen. The magnetite thus produced possesses a strong and stable remanence,
nearly ideal for testing hypotheses concerning the acquisition of CRM
