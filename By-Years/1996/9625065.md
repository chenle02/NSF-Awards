Dr. George Richter-Addo, Department of Chemistry, University of Oklahoma, is
supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program of the
Chemistry Division under a Faculty Early Career Development Award for studies of
nitrosyl- and nitroso-metalloporphyrins. Nitric oxide is an atmospheric
pollutant and it plays an important role in some biosynthetic pathways. Organic
nitroso compounds may play a role as physiological mediators in reactions of
nitric oxide. Metalloporphyrin complexes will be synthesized, and the chemical
reactions and modes of interaction with the metal centers will be investigated.
The education plan is aimed at involving undergraduate students in research,
designing laboratory experiments involving metalloporphyrin synthesis, and
developing an undergraduate bioinorganic course. The overall goal of this
research is to examine the reactions of synthetic analogues of biologically
important molecules known as metalloporphyrins. These molecules, which consist
of a metal ion surrounded by a ring of nitrogen and carbon atoms, are ubiquitous
in biological systems and have been found to react with nitric oxide and its
derivatives. Nitric oxide is an atmospheric pollutant, and organic nitroso
compounds are carcinogens found in some food and in cigarette smoke. This
chemistry has the potential to provide a better understanding of the role of the
interactions of metalloporphyrins with nitric oxides in physiological systems.
The education plan focuses on undergraduate research and the development of new
laboratory experiments and courses which emphasize the biological significance
of inorganic chemistry.
