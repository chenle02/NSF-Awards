The project aims at developing a Fredholm theory encompassing both a single
operator and a tuple of commuting operators acting on a common Hilbert space.
The Koszul complex approach will be emphasized in order to introduce ideas and
methods in commutative algebra to operator theory. The strategy is to introduce
stabilized invariants such as the Samuel multiplicities into operator theory to
calculate the multivariable Fredholm index. This has many connections with
existing topics such as the codimension of invariant subspaces of the Bergman
space and the Dirichlet space, Toeplitz operators on the Hardy space, Arveson's
curvature invariant on the symmetric Fock space, function theory on Hardy spaces
over higher dimensional domains, Apostol's triangular representation.

The Fredholm index of a linear operator is one of the most intensely studied
numerical invariants in mathematics. The content of the celebrated Atiyah-Singer
Index Theorem, one of the deepest results in mathematics, is on how to calculate
the Fredholm index of a special class of operators. This project will focus on
developing a multivariable version of the traditional one variable Fredholm
theory. This allows one to introduce ideas from commutative algebra, a seemingly
distant area in mathematics, into multivariable operator theory, which in turn
shed new light on traditional problems in one variable operator theory.
