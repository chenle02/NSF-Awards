Salem State College, Universidad de Puerto Rico en Humacao, TERC, and school
districts from Massachusetts and Puerto Rico are working together to transform
the way life sciences are taught in the two colleges and up to 17 school
districts. Using the MSP-Start, they are building a foundation for this
transfomation by focusing on coastal and forest microbial and community ecology
and related conservation to integrate the study of genes to ecosystems. The
Atlantic Partnership for the Biological Sciences brings together a diverse group
of stakeholders that is leading teachers in professional development to better
understand how to make science accessible to a multicultural student population.
Through guided experiences in scientific research these teachers are
systematically enhancing their understanding of the diversity and unity of
biological processes at every level of organization and are translating this
learning into pedagogically effective changes in classroom practice.
