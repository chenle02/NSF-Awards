This project is to perform research on the design of management accounting
information systems. Accounting information is used by large firms to support
budgeting, decision-making, and performance evaluation. The research concerns
the design of integrated systems in which managers participate in the budgeting
and decision process with the objective of maximizing their performance
measures. This project also includes research on models of decentralized
decision- making in which individuals attempt to learn their optimal decisions
from data generated by past decisions. Simple individualistic learning
mechanisms sometimes give rise to unstable interactions among the learning
adjustments of different individuals. This research concerns the apparent trade-
off between the simplicity of learning mechanisms and the range of environments
for which the learning mechanisms coverage to optimality.
