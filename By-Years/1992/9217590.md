The University of Hawaii will continue a project to adapt and test two new
types of oxygen sensors for oceanographic purpose: an amperiometric membrane YSI
sensor and a carbon-fiber micro-hole potentiostatic solid-state oxygen sensor.
Unlike existing polarographic oxygen sensors, potentiostatic sensors have no
membrane and therefore have comparatively fast response to changes in oxygens
levels. This work will focus on the electro-chemistry of both the membrane and
membrane-less oxygen sensors. Temperature and pressure are known to affect
oxygen determinations, but it is unclear whether pressure affects the chemistry
at the surface of the electrode, or the oxygen permeability through the
membrane. A series of experiments will be run in a pressure chamber measuring
the response of the sensors under different oxygen concentrations, temperatures,
and pressures up to 100 atm. Solid-state potentiostatic oxygen sensors should
provide greatly improved capabilities over present methods for making
scientifically important dissolved oxygen measurements in the oceans. Developing
a more reliable and more accurate dissolved oxygen sensor has been recognized as
a high priority of the oceanographic research community.
