9526747 Clayton Natural variations in the abundances of isotopes of the light
elements oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen will be used to study a variety
of geochemical and cosmochemical problems. The fundamental thermodynamic basis
of isotopic fractionation will be expanded by additional laboratory experiments
and theoretical calculations. These results will be applied to the determination
of thermal histories of igneous and metamorphic rocks. Particular emphasis will
be given to rocks from the Earth's mantle in order to assess the degree of
recycling of crustal rocks into the interior. The origin of the earth and the
nature of its raw materials will be studied through oxygen isotope abundances in
meteorites. The three-isotope method, developed at the University of Chicago, is
a very powerful tool for establishing genetic relationships among the various
constituents of the early Solar System. This approach has shown that currently
popular models for formation of the Earth are incorrect, or, at best,
incomplete.
