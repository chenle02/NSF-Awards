The study of cultural attention to risk has developed greatly over the past two
decades. One area where there has been only limited work is that of non-western
perceptions of and responses to risk. This study of the management of
technological risks in China seeks to expand cross-cultural understanding of the
social construction of risk by examining how different cultural formations in
modern China have interacted with powerful influences from the international
environment in devising responses to risks. Through archival research and
interviews, both in the United States and in China, the project will develop
case studies of Chinese risk management strategies for flood control, nuclear
power, hazardous chemicals and airline operations. In addition to adding an
important non-western example to the comparative risk analysis literature, the
project should contribute to understanding how major influences from abroad,
including technology transfers, international educational experiences,
membership in international organizations, study and emulation of foreign policy
models, and exposure to foreign risk controversies, affect a nation's "risk
transitions." Sharpening an appreciation of how risks are identified, assessed,
and managed will also provide additional insights into Chinese approaches to its
complex environmental problems and, thus, how to build a stronger base for what
is likely to be a long-term international engagement with China on environmental
affairs.
