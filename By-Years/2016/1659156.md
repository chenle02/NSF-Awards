This award funds work that will help us understand how federal regulations
affect oil and natural gas markets in the United States. The project will
proceed in several stages. First, the research team will catalog and
characterize federal regulations that affect the development of petroleum and
natural gas resources. Second, they will develop methods to estimate the effects
of these regulations on industry, including the possible impact of changing
existing regulation. Third, they will estimate the effects of these regulations
on the public, including consumers of oil and natural gas. The final part of the
project will examine the overall welfare economics of lifting and/or lessening
federal regulation in this sector of the economy.

The project is directly relevant to issues facing the US Department of Energy,
and the results will help policymakers make judgements about the appropriate
types and levels of regulation in this economic sector.
