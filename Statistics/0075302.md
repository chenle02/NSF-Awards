This award provides support for Ph.D. graduate students and new investigators in
the International Society for Bayesian Analysis attending the Sixth World
Meeting, ISBA 2000, held 28 May - 1 June 2000 in Hersonissos, Crete. More than
125 talks by over 200 presenters, and three poster sessions, are planned on the
themes of Official Statistics, Public Policy, and Governmental Statistics. This
conference brings together academic and applied Bayesian statisticians
throughout the world, many of them recent Ph.D.s or current Ph.D. candidates,
due to the demographic consequence of the rapid growth of the Bayesian
statistics. The award funds are primarily devoted to defraying the expenses of
graduate students, new researchers, and members of underrepresented groups from
the U.S. Partial support is provided from the Division of International
Programs.
