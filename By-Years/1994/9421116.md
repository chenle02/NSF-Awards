9421116 Javanainen Computational methods for semiclassical laser spectroscopy
and semiclassical and fully quantal theories of laser cooling and trapping will
be developed and applied. Optical manifestations of particle statistics will
also be investigated in order to better understand Bose-Einstein condensation in
a cooled, trapped gas. ***
