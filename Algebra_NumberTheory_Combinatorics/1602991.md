The PIMS-NSF Undergraduate Workshop in Supersymmetry will be held August 15-19,
2016 at the Pacific Institute for the Mathematical Sciences (PIMS) at the
University of British Columbia, Canada. This award is co-funded by the Division
of Mathematical Sciences and the Office of International Science and Engineering
(OISE) and provides support for US-based participants. The workshop combines
lectures on the mathematics of supersymmetry, emphasizing graph theory and
algebraic structures, with problem-solving sessions. By introducing students to
this thriving area of research outside the standard curriculum, the workshop
will have direct impact on undergraduate education. The speakers and problem
session leaders will develop a community of mathematicians interested in
research in supersymmetry and they will use this experience to enhance the
research programs at their home institutions.

In physics, supersymmetry is a pairing between bosons and fermions appearing in
theories of subatomic particles. One may study supersymmetry mathematically by
using adinkra symbols, which are graphs with vertices representing the particles
in a supersymmetric theory and edges corresponding to the supersymmetry
pairings. The study of adinkra symbols highlights deep connections between
algebraic, combinatorial, and physical structures. The workshop presents a
unique opportunity to introduce students to this topic and encourage them to
pursue further research at the boundary of mathematics and physics. Moreover,
the workshop will encourage new connections between US and Canadian students and
researchers. For more information about the workshop, visit
