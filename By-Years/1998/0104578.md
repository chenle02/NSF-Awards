The Buffalo Bill Historical Center will develop the "Greater Yellowstone
Adventure project," encompassing 1,719 square meters of exhibits in the Center's
newly constructed Draper Museum of Natural History. The exhibits and associated
programming constitute a major cultural and educational resource for underserved
residents of rural, northwestern Wyoming and approximately 500,000 annual
visitors to the region. The goal of Greater Yellowstone Adventure is to promote
understanding of the relationships binding humans and nature and the use of
science in exploring those relationships. The exhibits are orgainized into three
galleries: Expedition Trailhead, Braided Paths and Tangled Destinies, and
Seasons of Discovery.
