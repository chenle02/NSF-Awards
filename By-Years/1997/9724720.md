9724720 TARBOTON Spatially distributed hydrologic models are being used
increasingly in environmental management and design. They have the advantage
that they can capture to a large degree the spatial variability in hydrologic
processes and can give spatially distributed predictions. However spatially
distributed models suffer from problems associated with the large number of
variables involved. When calibrated against integrated quantities, such as basin
outflow, they do not generally represent internal processes correctly. The work
proposed has the objective to develop and formalize methods for using spatially
distributed data and spatial pattern comparison in the validation and testing of
spatially distributed models. This work will be a collaboration between David
Tarboton at Utah State University and Charles Pearson and Ross Woods at NIWA,
New Zealand. David Tarboton has distributed hydrologic modeling experience in
the semi-arid western U.S., while Woods and Pearson have experience in
hydrologic modeling focusing on scale issues in New Zealand and Australia. Data
from the Reynolds Creek experimental watershed in Idaho, USA as well as the
Buller and Grey Rivers on the South Island of New Zealand will be used. The
research will develop methods that extend model calibration and validation from
reliance on integrated measures only to the use of spatially distributed data.
The benefits will be greater reliability of model results and forecasts and
better understanding of spatially distributed hydrological processes due to
better representation of the internal watershed dynamics and variability.
