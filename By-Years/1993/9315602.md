Mehta 9315602 The Wind Engineering Research Center (WERC) and the Institute for
Disaster Research at texas Tech University have pursued intensive wind-related
research for over twenty-three years. Besides extensive wind-storm-induced
damage documentation and research regarding wind effects on buildings and
structures, these research centers have excelled through accomplishments such as
development of a full scale building field test facility, a missile impact test
facility, and a wind engineering library containing close to 3,000 wind-related
documents. The WERC is currently involved in an NSF sponsored cooperative wind
engineering project with Colorado State University that involves faculty and
students from the departments of Civil, Chemical and Mechanical Engineering, as
well as atmospheric sciences. In the present grant, the results of these
research accomplishments will be transferred to the curriculum of these and
other departments. Visual aids such as instructional video modules, color slide
sets and detailed notes on pertinent topics will be prepared. These materials
will then be integrated into different courses offered in the courses both in
the undergraduate and graduate levels. These instructional aids can also be used
by other universities offering similar courses. ***
