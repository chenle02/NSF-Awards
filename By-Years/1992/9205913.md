In this project the principal investigator will measure and interpret
distributions of chlorofluorocarbons (CFC's or Freons), F-11 and F-12, in the
Pacific Ocean on hydrographic sections along 179|E and 149|E, designated by the
World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) as P-14N and P-10, respectively. A
principal focus would be on the ventilation and circulation of North Pacific
Intermediate Water and Subtropical Mode Water. Also to be addressed are inter-
gyre exchange and cross-equatorial exchange. CFC measurements have not been made
in these regions before, and are integral to WOCE Hydrographic planning.
