Nonmonotonic reasoning and logic programming are both areas of crucial and
growing significance to artificial intelligence and to the whole field of
computer science. Nevertheless, despite the close realtionship between the two
areas, they have been developed largely independently of each other. However,
the recent discovery of the equivalence between the perfect model semantic of
logic programs and natural forms of all four major formalizations of
nonmonotonic reasoning establishes a closer link between the two areas and paves
the way for using efficient computation methods, developed for logic
programming, as inference engines for nonmonotinic reasoning. The problem of
finding efficient inference mechanisms that can reason in a commonsense manner
in the absence of complete information is one of the major research and
implementation problems in artificial intelligence. To permit the use of logic
programming as such an inference engine, the investigator will develop effective
procedural mechanisms for efficient execution of such methods, and will
implement an experimental nonmonotonic reasoning system, based on logic
programming.
