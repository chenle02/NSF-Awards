The extent to which partners in a relationship are able to accurately infer each
other's private thoughts and feelings during a discussion is known as empathic
accuracy. Previous research on empathic accuracy has revealed a major paradox:
Although most studies find that greater empathic understanding tends to be good
for relationships, some studies have found that greater empathic accuracy can
harm relationships in certain situations. To reconcile these contrasting
findings, researchers have proposed that empathic accuracy should be good for
relationships when routine and non-threatening issues are being discussed by
partners, but it should be bad for relationships when relationship-threatening
issues are discussed. Understanding when empathic accuracy is good or bad for
relationships is important for advancing knowledge about basic social
interaction processes in close relationships. This project develops and tests a
theory that specifies when higher versus lower levels of empathic accuracy are
likely to occur in interactions. The theory will be tested in four studies
involving large samples of long-term dating couples and married couples. ?&gt;
