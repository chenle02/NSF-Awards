An electrochemical junction will be formed which mimics an neural synapse. This
device will be on a scale of a few microns wide by a fraction of a micron thick.
The ionic solution will be sealed into a stable gel structure. The device will
be in a form that can be produced as arrays and incorporated into standard
electronics to provide a physical model for the synapse that can be tested in
conjunction with studies of neural networks. Reinforcement of individual
junctions and short-time modification of network properties will be incorporated
to allow studies of "memory" and "mood" in networks.
