An interdisciplinary computer graphics and image processing laboratory is being
developed by the Departments of Computer Science, and Physics and Applied
Optics. Laboratory facilities permit undergraduate students to investigate the
effects of hidden surface removal, color, shading, and lighting on computer
graphics images. Students also study edge detection algorithms, image
reconstruction, and holographic interferometry. Animation sequences are
generated in the laboratory in real time or frame by frame and stored on
videotape. The equipment allows students to undertake senior projects that
investigate graphical display methods for scientific and engineering data. The
laboratory supports a new, team-taught interdisciplinary course in medical image
processing. As part of the course, students learn about graphical display
methods for medical data. This significantly enhances the preparation of Rose-
Hulman students participating in the Research Experiences for Undergraduates
program at the NSF sponsored Engineering Research Center at Duke University,
where graphical display methods for cardiovascular data are being studied.
Computer science and applied optics students interact with each other in the
laboratory, consulting on each other's projects as well as doing joint,
interdisciplinary projects. Students are strongly encouraged to pursue
undergraduate research in computer graphics and image processing with the
laboratory equipment, and to publish the results of their work.
