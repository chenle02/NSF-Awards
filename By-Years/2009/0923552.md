0923552&lt;br/&gt;Hacker&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds from this Major Research
Instrumentation (MRI) grant will support the acquisition of a state-of-the-art
electron microprobe for the Institute for Crustal Studies and Department of
Earth Sciences at the University of California Santa Barbara. The new EMP will
serve a broad range of NSF funded research that will be advanced by the
capability for submicron compositional imaging of natural materials. PI studies
of the uplift history of orogens that rely on precision geothermobarometric
techniques, and studies of continental crustal genesis, magma chamber dynamics
and evolution, and microbial-mineral interactions will all benefit from a state-
of-the-art electron probe. Broader impacts include graduate student training and
the regional impact of a new EMP facility in the populous southern California
region.&lt;br/&gt;
