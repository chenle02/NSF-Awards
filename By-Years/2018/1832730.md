The broader impact of this award is to support the goals of the NSF I-Corps
program to increase the economic and societal impact of NSF research funding
directly, through enabling commercialization of research, and indirectly, by
equipping scientists and engineers with skills and experience in developing and
testing economically scalable models for the development of a product or
technology. The structured, repeatable program that has been developed engages a
national community of institutions and faculty to deliver the training and
support these outcomes. Through the work proposed here, this project supports
the training of more than 500 additional participants, supports the training of
additional faculty to increase the diversity of the faculty pool and maintain
fidelity of the program pedagogy, continues conducting systematic data
collection and tracking of teams immediately before and long after formal
participation in the program, and creates and disseminates datasets of use to
both novice and experienced researchers in the field as well as the
dissemination of scalable systems for impact measurement that provide both a
framework that can be adopted by others in the field. The systems created
through this work, and the insights gained, will advance the understanding of
how best to track venture outcomes and assess the impact of early-stage
entrepreneurial support programming.

This NSF project will support the evaluation of I-Corps program outcomes and
tracking of program impact in a systematic and timely way. This work is
important to the operation of a consistent, high-fidelity program at scale and
to the measurement of long term program results and an understanding of what
works. The core intellectual merit of this work is insight into the program's
impact, both economic outcomes and participants' career and research outcomes,
over time. To gain this insight, the project evaluates the delivery of each
cohort, administers a longitudinal outcomes survey, and tracks venture outcomes
independently to verify program impact data. Working with NSF, the project makes
these datasets accessible to the research community to enable the continued
study of how best to support emerging science and technology innovation. The
processes and data systems that efficiently track outcomes and provide insights
into the development of technology-based products and ventures are a product of
this project, as well.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
