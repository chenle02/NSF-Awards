Sakallah This research is on the temporal modeling of latch- controlled
synchronous digital systems. The use of level- sensitive latches, as opposed to
edge-triggered flip-flops, has become quite common in recent years because
latches are easily implemented in MOS VLSI, the leading technology for building
digital systems. A consistent theoretical framework for describing the timing
constraints which must be satisfied by such systems for proper operation is
being developed. This framework is being used to develop efficient algorithms
for timing verification and optimal clocking. Both of these problems require the
solution of large linear programs (LPs). The special structures of these LPs
will be utilized to reduce the solution time so that the algorithms can be used
in an interactive design environment. The practical significance of this
framework and associated algorithms is being assessed experimentally on actual
industrial VLSI designs.
