Funding is provided to continue operations and maintence of the Maintenance of
the Monterey Accelerated Research System (MARS). The MARS cabled observatory
provides a deep-water facility for testing and development and is a compelling
solution for many ocean science experiments. MBARI has integrated the MARS
Observatory into the Monterey Bay Aquarium 'Discovering Monterey Canyon'
auditorium program as well as in the new MBARI exhibit. The Monterey Bay
Aquarium has over one million visitors a year, thereby providing wide exposure
for MARS and OOI to the public. The EARTH Project, a science teacher outreach
effort, has used MARS as a tool at over 20 presentations to high school
educators. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute
(MBARI) installed a cabled test bed and has been operating the Monterey
Accelerated Research System (MARS) since MARS became operational November 10,
2008. The purpose of this proposal is to provide continued funding for
operations and maintenance costs of MARS.
