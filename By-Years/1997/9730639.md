*** 9732129 Street The project is for a one year study to explore the physics of
topographically- induced turbulence impinging on a free-surface, and to explore
the feasibility of surface detection of bottom topography in a variety of
circumstances. The PI will perform a Large-Eddy Simulations (LES) with a free-
surface for flows in four scenarios: 1) a single polynomial hill, 2) two-
dimensional sinusoidal topography, 3) three-dimensional sinusoidal topography,
and 4) a channel and shoal configuration. The numerical output will be analyzed
to investigate patterns of stress and advection on the surface which may be used
to identify underlying topography. ***
