This proposal seeks funds for meteor radar studies of the mesosphere and lower
thermosphere using a meteor echo detection and collection system (MEDAC). The
objectives of the work are to provide an understanding of the long period wave
motions, including the migrating and non-migrating tides, and their interaction
with the large scale wind circulation. The studies will use data collected from
the equatorial Pacific wind profiler network , which has been augmented with
MEDAC systems that allow the determination of the winds in the mesosphere and
lower thermosphere. In order to generate the long data sets necessary for this
work, an upgrade of the MEDAC sites is required. Because the MEDAC requires the
use of a wind profiler that is often not optimized for meteor echo detection,
the PIs propose to design a new portable meteor radar system that would stand
alone. This new system, as well as the current system, will be augmented with
new data analysis techniques utilizing genetic algorithms. A final aspect of the
proposed work is to establish a cooperative research program with the University
of Adelaide allowing experiments to be done on the Buckland Park radars.
