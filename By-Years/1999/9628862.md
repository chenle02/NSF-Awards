This CAREER grant will focus on studying the solar atmosphere and magnetic
fields for both active and quiet regions. Using the existing instrumentation
expertise in various departments of the New Jersey Institute of Technology, the
PI will apply state-of-the-art devices to solar observations. These devices
include the infrared detectors, narrow bandpass infrared filters, super-speed
CCD cameras, and super-speed real time data processors. In addition, the PI will
obtain and study best data sets from ground-based observatories and satellites
to investigate (1) the structure and magnetic fields of several solar features
at opacity minimum, (2) the relationship between the magnetic fields and dynamic
phenomena on the quiet Sun, and (3) the structure and evolution of magnetic
fields in active regions and solar flares.***
