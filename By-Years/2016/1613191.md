This award will support students at U.S. institutions to attend the Seventeenth
Workshop on Mobile Computing Systems and Applications (ACM HotMobile 2016).
HotMobile, sponsored by ACM SIGMOBILE, will be held in February, 2016 in St.
Augustine, FL. HotMobile 2016 is an important workshop targeting mobile
computing and system integration fields and attending this event will benefit
the scientific progress of the student's research. The exposure to the technical
content of HotMobile 2016 will inspire students to address the tough problems in
their respective fields, with a long-term benefit of scientific advances in
these types of networks.

Priority will be given to students who will benefit from attending this
workshop, but are unlikely to attend due to the unavailability of travel
funding. In addition, applications from female and underrepresented groups in
networking research will be strongly encouraged. Up to fourteen students will
receive travel grants from this award to attend HotMobile 2016.
