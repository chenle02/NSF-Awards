In this project in the Theoretical and Computational Physical Chemistry Program
of the Chemistry Division, Reinhardt will carry out research which will
fundamentally explore the relation of chaotic Hamiltonian dynamics to problems
of spectroscopy, chemical dynamics, semi-classical quantization, and the
correspondence principle. The emphasis will be on development of new
mathematical and computational approaches relating to electron-atom collisions,
atomic and molecular photoabsorption leading to ionization and/or dissociation,
and the structure of atoms in intense ac and dc external fields; and condensed
phase intermolecular dynamics following mode specific excitation of pyrrole as
related to experiments on a picosecond time scale.
