9452905 Tornatzky The project will focus on research universities in seven
Southern states (Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma,
and west Virginia) in a region-wide effort to upgrade their technology transfer
performance and practices. Operating under the auspices of the Southern
Technology Council (STC), the project will develop regional performance and
practice benchmarks; engage in widespread dissemination of those exemplary
practices and lessons learned; focus on accelerated professional development
efforts on institutions in EPSCoR states; and conduct policy analyses on
relevant state and university-level practices. The project will improve the
university-based technology transfer infrastructure of the Southern EPSCoR
states and at the same time fully document the impacts achieved. It will also
link with major academic institutions from other states in the region to use
them as a source of best practices and to maximize networking and information
sharing.
