Under this project, a Gleeble test facility will be constructed for
undergraduate materials laboratoy experiments. The facility will allow students
to conduct experiments involving the dynamic thermal and mechanical stressing of
materials, simulating the process stresses received during manufacture and use.
In addition, basic property determinations will be made, including dilatometry
deformation mapping, weld heat affected zone studies, sintering, solidification,
heat treatment, precipitation kinetics, hot ductility, corrosion, and thermal
fatigue and stress rupture. It is expected that this facility will provide a
prototype undergraduate metallurgy and materials laboratory for the 1990's.
