This research focuses on collective behavior, examining the conditions under
which groups of individuals engage in protests, riots, and other forms of
contentious action in order to identify characteristic patterns and common
elements of such actions. The study has three principal objectives. The first is
to analyze how and why these patterns of collective behavior change over time.
The second is to determine why the involvement of various types of individuals
in collective actions changes, with different groups engaged at different points
in time. The third objective is to assess the effects of various forms of
collective action on the interests of the individuals involved. These questions
are addressed in a broad historical context, attending to the implications for
collective action of changes in the national state and the economy. Dr. Tilly
focuses specifically on collective action occurring in London during the last
half of the 18th century and in Great Britain generally during the early part of
the 19th century. The 1828 to 1834 period is of particular interest, since this
was a time of political turmoil and reform that set the stage for the rest of
the century. The years preceding 1828-1834 are also sampled to establish a basis
for assessing changes up to this period. Dr. Tilly will draw his data from
newspaper accounts of contentious gatherings and use multiple regression, event
history and network analytic techniques to analyze the data, with individual
gatherings as the units of analysis. The theory and findings of this study,
though historically anchored, bear equally on major questions being asked
regarding contemporary forms of collective action. The analysis of the role of
the state and the economy in fostering or thwarting such behavior may be
especially revealing in gaining a deeper understanding of the conditions and
events precipitating collective action.
