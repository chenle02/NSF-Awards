This award provides funding to initiate a Research Experience for Undergraduates
(REU) site that will provide a eight-week summer research experience in
limnology and environmental science for a total of five students. The REU site
will be run by Kent State University and will focus on the environmental issues
in Lake Erie, its tributaries and its coastal wetlands. The REU program is based
on the theory that mentoring and networking are the most effective methods for
recruiting students into a profession and for training young researchers. This
program will provide students with an in-depth understanding of the ecology and
limnology of the Great Lakes, particularly Lake Erie. Plans for the site include
all the essential elements for an excellent REU site. A team of faculty mentors
will help the students develop research projects on the freshwater ecology,
microbiology, geology and environmental chemistry of the Great Lakes. Students
will participate in a series of lectures focused on scientific methods, ethics
in science, and an interdisciplinary view of the Great Lakes, and they will
receive one-on-one mentoring from researchers. They will also participate in
field trips in the Lake Erie watershed. At the end of the program, students will
develop a presentation on their research project and will be encouraged to
present their results at a major scientific conference. This program fills an
important niche in the continuum of program supported under the REU program by
the Division of Ocean Sciences. It's focus on the ecology and limnology of the
Lake Erie is unique. The program will advance the awareness of students
concerning important environmental issues in the coastal regions and watersheds
of the Great Lakes. The program also has the potential to recruit minority
students to the Geosciences.
