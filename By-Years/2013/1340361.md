ID: MPS/DMR/BMAT(7623) 1340361 PI: Peyton, Shelly ORG: University of
Massachusetts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Multiscale Materials in the Study and
Treatment of Cancer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Part: This a proposal for
partial support of a symposium to be held in conjunction with the Fall 2013
Materials Research Society (MRS) conference in Boston. Biomimetic surfaces,
nanoparticles, and even large three-dimensional scaffolds are able to capture
the chemical and physical properties of certain biological systems, from
nanometers (size of proteins and drug carriers), to microns (mimicking whole
cells), to centimeters in length (modeling tissues). This biomimetic approach
aims to detect invasive disease at early stages, to identify and image its
location within complex, dense tissues, to identify novel drug targets, and to
deliver therapeutics or contrast agents to a specific region. As with all new
biomedical tools, variations in the unique properties of these materials (size,
topology, functional moieties, mechanics, and chemistry) directly impact their
interaction with the biological medium and surrounding environment. The
importance of controlled design and fabrication and subsequent characterization
of the materials will be emphasized. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-Technical Part:
This symposium brings together an international group of investigators in the
synthesis of functional materials, surface chemistry/coatings, and
identification of targeting agents to share their findings and insights from a
variety of perspectives. The attendance of eight new and/or young investigators
will be supported by $500 travel awards. Awardees will be selected by the
symposium steering committee based on the abstracts of presentations proposed by
attendees.
