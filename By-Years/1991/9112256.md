New HPLC and CZE equipment will provide not only a base from which the Principal
Investigators (PIs) will develop new separation techniques, but also essential
analytical tools to cross-check and monitor and corroborate theoretical
advances. Four separation techniques will be studied: capillary zone
electrophoresis, supercritical fluid-based processes, analytical chromatography,
and displacement chromatography. The requested HPLC and CZE equipment will be
used in these projects for analytical work and for collection of physico-
chemical data required in simulation and design of the various processes. They
will also be used, sometimes with modifications, to explore novel techniques to
be developed for the enhancement of the efficiency of both liquid chromatography
and CZE in bioprocess applications.
