9615390 KOOYMAN The emperor penguin is one of seventeen species of penguins and
the only one to breed during the extreme Antarctic winter, when temperatures can
drop to below -50 degrees centigrade and winds can reach 300 kilometers per
hour. The total number of emperor penguins is unknown because new colonies are
still begin discovered. Current population estimates range from 135,000 to
175,000 breeding pairs, living at about 40 sites on the sea-ice margin of
Antarctica. Seven of these colonies are in the Ross Sea, where Gerald Kooyman
has been studying the physiology and ecology of emperor penguins since the early
1960's. This project will focus on data analysis and synthesis from this long
term study. Work will focus on physiological adapations pertinent to hypotheses
on habitat exploitation and on ecological aspects of breeding and foraging and
habitat selection. A major goal of the project is the completion of a monograph
on emperor penguins at Cape Washington, Coulman Island and Cape Roger. This
project will produce synthetic work which will provide new insights into the
role of emperor penguins in the Antarctic ecosystem.
