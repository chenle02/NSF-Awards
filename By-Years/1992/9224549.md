9224549 Seyler Three separate, but related topics will be investigated concerned
with small and intermediate scale phenomena of the magnetosphere- ionosphere
system and the role that they play in mediating the coupling, energetics and
dynamics of the auroral zone. The first topic is an exploration of the small and
intermediate scale structure of auroral arcs using a three-dimensional
simulation model that has been refined over the past four years. The second
subject is concerned with the auroral acceleration of electrons through wave
processes, including Alfven wave acceleration and acceleration through the
parametric decay of auroral kilometric radiation (AKR). Recent sounding rocket
observations (TOPAZ I, II and III) have found tranverse ion acceleration events
associated with intense lower-hybrid wave packets. The third topic of inquiry
will explore the characteristics of lower-hybrid wave phenomena in the upper
auroral ionosphere. We presently have at our disposal three-dimensional
nonlinear simulation models for lower-hybrid waves which we will use to compare
to sounding rocket observations as well as to test the theories of lower-hybrid
collapse and the associated transverse ion acceleration. ***
