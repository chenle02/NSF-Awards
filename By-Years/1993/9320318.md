IRI-9320318 This research explores a sensor- and domain-independent event-
driven sensing manager and sensing execution mechanism to address the need for
reactive sensing in mobile robot architectures. Success in reactive motor
control will have important applications in perceptually demanding applications
in space, environmental remediation, defense, and reconnaissance and rescue
operations. The specific objectives of this project are to formalize the control
scheme for an event-driven manager; develop a sensing execution manager; and
create a general purpose structure for representing, reasoning, and propagating
evidence about a percept. These objectives will lead to a system which can model
a percept independently of sensors and algorithms; translate this model into an
executable sensing plan, given the intended task, state of the robot, and state
of the world; share sensing resources if possible and arbitrate contention if
not possible; maintain sensing given the occurrence of uncontrollable events
such as occlusions, malfunctions, and environmental change; and temporarily
reduce the computational load associated with sensing without sacrificing
certainty. The research results will be evaluated based on experiments on a CSM
Denning MRV-3 mobile robot using video, ultrasonic, and laser range data for
navigation and assessment of partially known environments. Resulting code and
data sets will be made available over internet.
