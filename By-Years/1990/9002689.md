The Florida Museum of Natural History is an active center for paleontological
research and preservation of fossil collections. Under the stewardship of Dr.
Douglas S. Jones, the invertebrate fossil collections have been the subject of
renewed interest and significant support. This fossil collection now represents
one of the fastest-growing repositories of invertebrate fossils in the country,
and will soon become the premiere repository for marine invertebrates of
Cenozoic age from the southeast U.S. and the Caribbean Ocean. Dr. Jones proposes
transfer of the collection to high-density storage units, and acceleration of
the efforts to arrange, catalog, and computerize the collection's holdings. The
proposed curatorial improvement project will have wide- ranging benefits for the
research community. Researchers will have improved access to the collections
during their visits to Gainesville, and through a more effective program of
borrowing specimens. The computer database will be a research resource in its
own right, allowing investigators to explore patterns of fossil distribution
through time and space. Natural history collections such as this are the primary
documents of the evolution of life on earth. The research community realizes
important dividends from their proper curation.
