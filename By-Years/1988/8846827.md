The U.S. Geological Survey will continue the final drafting, printing, and
distribution of a uniform series geologic maps of Antarctica. The maps to be
produced under this arrangement will be selected by the National Science
Foundation each fiscal year depending on the availability of material and other
related factors. For fiscal year 1988 work will begin on selected maps from the
Central Transantarctic Mountains. No antarctic field work will be carried out
under this interagency agreement.
