A new two-semester sequence is being developed that includes differential
equations and linear algebra and that is based on the philosophy and spirit of
the first year calculus course developed under the Five Colleges Calculus in
Context Project. Students gain a better grasp of the concepts of calculus when
they are presented in the context of real and substantial applications that
require a combination of techniques and that involve open-ended problems that
often do not have clean, simple solutions. Writing and the use of computers are
an integral part of this approach.
