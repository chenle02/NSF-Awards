9522897 Argento This project will develop methods to design, build and test
filament wound composite spindles for operation at rotational speeds of 60,000
r.p.m. The analytical methods, based on composite design and advanced beam
theory, will predict the natural frequencies, stability and dynamic response
from cutting forces, and the time history of stresses that may lead to premature
failure. Complementing this analytical design work, composite spindles will be
fabricated by filament winding. These spindles will be tested statically in
bending and torsion, and dynamically, both in a rotating and non-rotating manner
to experimentally determine the modes and mode shapes. The impact of this
research will be analysis tools to take advantage of the light weigh and high
stiffness of anisotropic composite spindles. This is significant because high
speed machining is a way to increase productivity when machining compliant
precision components. High speed spindles are a critical component for machine
tools to achieve these improvements in productivity and precision.
