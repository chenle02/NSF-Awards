This project supports the participation of Dr. F. C. Adetuyi of the Federal
University of Technology, Nigeria, in an ongoing study led by Dr. Jon Y.
Takemoto of Utah State University, (NSF Grant DCB-9003398), of the properties
and chemical structure of the Syringae toxin. This collaborative component will
expand the work to investigate an antifungal toxin produced by Pseudomonas
syringae isolated from wheat seed coats. The toxin's structure will be
determined and its mode of action on yeasts studied. The cooperation could lead
to methods for controlling fungal deterioration of stored cereal grains. This
has implications for the use of wheat seeds for genetic stock as well as for
food uses. The project is consistent with the criteria for the Science in
Developing Countries (SDC) program in that it strengthens collaboration between
U.S. scientists and engineers and their counterparts in developing countries,
and increases the capacity of scientists and engineers in developing countries
to address constraints to development.
