This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes a novel
approach that can significantly improve the operational reliability and quality
for disbursed/renewable generation facilities. Due to price hikes and rotating
blackouts in California, the power industry has reached a consensus that
disbursed or distributed generation via renewable generation facilities seems to
be one of the best alternatives for future utility industry. There is a serious
coordination mismatch between the local renewable power facility and the utility
supply. If external faults occur, the local user will be out of power, will need
to manually disconnect tiebreaker, manually connect the local generation
facility to provide power, etc. This will not only cause serious problems in
operation reliability and quality of service, but also significant inconvenience
to the individual users. The innovation proposed is to develop an intelligent
utility tie monitoring, control, and protection system that can guarantee a
smooth delivery of power to the user irrespective of internal and external
faults. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial impact of this technology would be
a significant cost savings.&lt;br/&gt;
