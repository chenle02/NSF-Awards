This grant covers experimental Elementary Particle Physics research by a group
at Vanderbilt University in collaboration with other NSF and DOE supported
scientists. The group will conclude studies of the production of jets of
particles in high-energy photon-nucleus collisions by comparing the experimental
yields with Quantum Chromodynamic calculations within the standard picture of
interacting quarks and leptons. The group plans to help construct a deep
underwater cerenkov detector to study ultrahigh energy neutrino and muon induced
cosmic ray showers and hence search for galactic or extragalactic point sources
of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays.
