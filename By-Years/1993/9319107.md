9319107 DeLyser The equipment purchased through this grant will be dedicated to
support research in the Departments of Engineering and Chemistry in computer and
information science and engineering. The equipment will be used for several
research projects, including: (1) Investigation of slotline to microstrip and
coaxial transitions and passive devices that incorporate those transitions, (2)
Microwave field calculations to support electron paramagnetic resonance
instrumentation development and measurements, (3) Speech enhancement and noisy
speech processing, (4) Gas turbine heat transfer and particle deposition in gas
turbine engines, and (5) Robust Wigner-Ville signal analysis. The equipment
consists of two IBM RS6000 model 370 Powerstations, each with a two Gigabyte
internal fixed disk, 128 Megabytes of RAM, and a 19-inch color display monitor.
They will be networked with three existing X-Terminals, an 8mm tape drive, and a
Hewlett Packard LaserJet Printer. The software, in addition to the pre-loaded
IBM software consists of the Hewlett Packard High Frequency Design System and
Microwave Design System, Entropic Signal Processing Software xwaves+, Fluid
Dynamics International Fluid Dynamics Analysis Package, and MATLAB from the
MathWorks, Inc. The Department of Engineering has no computational facilities
dedicated to research. Furthermore, the department's workstations lack the fixed
disk space and RAM required by the researchers. *** E @ j E B TERMINALHLP @ j
