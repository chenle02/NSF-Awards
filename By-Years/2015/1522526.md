This project will develop new computational tools that will allow mathematicians
to investigate some major open questions in number theory. The same tools can
also be used to help build faster and more secure cryptographic systems, and to
construct error-correcting codes that allow data to be reliably transmitted over
unreliable networks. Preliminary results indicate that it should be possible to
improve the performance and precision of the algorithms involved by several
orders of magnitude, which would make it feasible to address a number of
questions that are currently out of reach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The bulk of the
project will be aimed at the practical realization of average polynomial-time
algorithms for computing zeta functions of arithmetic schemes, with a particular
focus on algebraic curves. These algorithms allow one to efficiently compute the
zeta function of the reduction of a fixed arithmetic scheme modulo all primes up
to specified bound. This is precisely the computation needed to investigate
various questions in arithmetic statistics, and to approximate the associated
L-function to high precision. These tools will be used to study Sato-Tate
distributions and explicit aspects of the Langlands program. Computational
results of the project will be published in open access electronic databases
such as the LMFDB (L-functions and Modular Forms Database).
