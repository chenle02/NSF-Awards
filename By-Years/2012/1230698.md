Past studies of laboratories, test fields, museums and other sites of scientific
dissemination and production have found that physical places often limit the
kinds of knowledge that can be produced and circulated. This study challenges
that framework, offering a new theoretical framework and methodology that treats
physical spaces as permeable and important sites of knowledge circulation and
transformation. Its second major contribution is to integrate studies of federal
regulations with empirical qualitative evidence of biomedical practices.

The study is based on a global hospital ethnography that examines the factors
that shape the global distribution and circulation of biomedical knowledge. It
investigates how the physical layout and organization of a hospital, cultural
understandings of biomedicine, and rules and regulations intersect to shape how
knowledge is understood, used and circulated by different actors. The main
research methods are participant observation, interviews, and content analysis
of regulations and laws.

Broader impacts include new knowledge delivered to agencies that provide
services for immigrants in the greater Portland, Maine area where the study
takes place; reports and presentations for biomedical staff; and scientific
publications.
