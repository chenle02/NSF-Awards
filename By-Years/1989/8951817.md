This project provides a conceptual understanding of key concepts in science for
prospective elementary school teachers. It builds upon earlier research and
development programs in science learning that use a computer-based system to
remedy deficiencies in student understanding of science concepts. The project
provides bridging activities for increasing knowledge integration in science and
for helping students connect schematic representations to physical phenomena in
physics. The grantee provides funds for this project that are more than an equal
match for the NSF award.
