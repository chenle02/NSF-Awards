The Fallen Leaf Lake Conferences initiated in 1985 is a yearly event devoted to
the molecular biology and genetics of plant pathogenic bacteria, fastidious
prokaryotes and related areas dealing with these and other microorganisms. This
year's conference follows the ancillary field of broad-host-range (or
"promiscuous") plasmids, the first meeting of which took place in Birmingham,
England in the summer of 1987 (sponsored by EMBO). The Fallen Leaf Lake
Conferences offer the special opportunity for plant pathologists to interact
with experts in a particular field. Only the latest unpublished information is
exchanged at the Fallen Leaf Lake conference and ample opportunity for
scientific interactions is provided during the course of the conference. The
conference is attended by members representing most of the major laboratories
from many different countries, and therefore provides excellent opportunity for
graduate and postdoctoral student to interact with internationally recognized
experts in a specific field.
