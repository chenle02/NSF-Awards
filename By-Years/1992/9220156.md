A number of adhesive proteins have been found on the surfaces of cells.
Understanding how these adhesive proteins work will help us understand the basis
of certain cell-cell interactions. One of the best studied cell adhesion
molecules is the neural cell adhesion molecule or N-CAM which is found on the
surfaces of many nerve cells. N-CAM was originally shown to bind directly to
other N-CAM molecules. More recent work from this laboratory and others has
altered our picture of N-CAM-mediated adhesion by suggesting that N-CAM can also
bind to target molecules other that N-CAM. This would greatly broaden the range
of interactions in which this molecule could participate. Other than N-CAM
itself, the identities of the molecules that are targets for N-CAM binding are
not yet known. The goal of this project is to identify these target molecules
and to define the chemical and cellular properties of adhesion to them. The
first aim of the study will be to test whether a particular group of molecules
found on cell surfaces and in the extracellular matrix, namely heparan sulfate
proteoglycans, can act as the target for cell adhesion brought about by N-CAM.
These molecules have been implicated in other adhesive systems, but their direct
role as an adhesive target for N-CAM has not been demonstrated. The second aim
of the study will be to identify and purify from cell surfaces as-yet
undiscovered proteins that act as targets for N-CAM binding. This information
could transform our understanding of the normal and abnormal functions of N-CAM
and of the cellular interactions in which it is involved.***//
