This research aims to study processing--solid state structure-- property
relationships in microlayer (50 to 1000 layers) polymeric composites. Dow
coextrusion technology will be used for the production of microlayer systems.
Polymers of widely dissimilar solid-state structures and properties will be
combined into microlayer structures, thereby producing a composite system with
the desirable features of each component. In some instances, further property
enhancement will be achieved by uniaxial and biaxial orientation in a post-
processing procedure. The complex behavior of these composite systems will be
analyzed in terms of heirarchical levels of structure. The dependency and
evolution of properties from these interactive hierarchical levels will be
elucidated. In particular, the effects of layer thickness and adhesion between
layers will be analyzed. Polymeric materials selected for this study are chosen
with attention to unique advantages that are achievable with the microlayer
process. Tough structures with coupled properties, such as selected light
transmission or shielding, differential barrier and transport properties or
piezoelectric response, will be investigated. By using microlayer processing of
highly dissimilar polymers in combination with the hierarchical approach to
solid-state structure and property analysis, a new class of polymeric composite
systems will be examined.
