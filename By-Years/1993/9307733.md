9307733 Helentjaris Most of the natural variation we see between individuals of
any species is under the control of multiple genes. Use of molecular markers has
begun to identify major loci involved in this variation. Height in maize is
chosen for study as there are ample data describing major quantitative factors,
excellent molecular tools for this organism, several candidate genes which might
contribute to this variation, and physiological correlations between these
candidate genes and the quantitative variation. The general approach would be to
use isogenic lines for regions containing obvious candidate genes to reduce the
complexity of the variation for height and then to determine precisely what is
the contribution of individual genes to the natural quantitative variation
within maize genotypes. Clones for these genes will be obtained. Variation
within the coding region, will be studied using molecular techniques to identify
whether gene product function or overall expression of the gene are affected.
Efforts will then be directed towards determining what aspects of this natural
genic variation actually contribute to the variation in height observed in these
maize lines. The effects of environmental influences upon quantitative variation
will also be studied. The overall goal of this program is to develop an
experimental system which bring together elements of quantitative, Mendelian,
and molecular genetics to enhance our understanding of the functional basis for
natural quantitative variation, and to develop strategies for translating
positional information on major genes into practical methods for their
isolation. %%% As many of our economical ly most important traits in
domesticated plants and animals (as well as in humans and non domesticated
species) possess a complex inheritance, this approach will help to lay the
ground work for more improved approaches in understanding the genetic basis of
inheritance, and improved breeding strategies for domestic species using either
traditional or molecular strategies.
