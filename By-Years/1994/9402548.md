9402548 Colton This the quality-control portion of a major study of the Russian
legislative elections, sending scientifically-trained monitors to the areas in
the Russian Federation where surveys are administered to random samples of
voters. Not only does their work greatly increase the scientific quality of the
data collected, but it also provides valid measures of the variable quality of
data from one research site to another. The resulting data set will offer deep
understanding of the processes of democratization and radicalization currently
in progress in Russia. For example, the survey collects rich data about the
individual and social characteristics that lead to support for the competing
political parties. %%% This research will test competing theories of the factors
that promote or impede transition from authoritarian to democratic systems of
government, and of the social courses of political radicalism. If the United
States is to navigate successfully the ocean of problems and opportunities that
lie ahead in its relations with Russia and other nations of the former Soviet
Union, we will need far more complete and accurate scientific information than
currently exists about the factors that facilitate or destroy democracy. In
addition, this grant will strengthen ties between American social scientists and
their colleagues in Russia. ***
