IBN-0117754, Ward Watt&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spatial patterns of inherited
variation in natural populations can give important clues to the means by which
living creatures adapt to their habitats. But patterns alone can result from
different causes (e.g., natural selection by local conditions, migration
patterns of organisms with different traits, historical artifacts, etc.). This
study attempts to elucidate causes of an interesting pattern of variation in
which, despite extensive migration among habitats, groups of individuals living
in adjacent habitat types are less similar to each other than they are to groups
living in a similar habitat types hundreds of kilometers away. This research
will focus on in the insect genus, Colias, and will focus on variation in a key
enzyme in the energy-processing system that supports the insects' flight in the
wild, phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI). Extensive previous work on selection and
energetics on Colias in the wild and the insect's distribution patterns in
montane areas make it an ideal system for addressing these
questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will test several alternative
plausible explanations for this phenomenon, examining the multiple potential
causes of geographical variation in organismal traits. These tests will include
studies of the mechanistic links between variation in molecular structure of
enzymes, enzyme function, organismal performance, and other factors that
influence population genetics. The results will illuminate the relationship
between local adaptations to habitat and more general and longer-term questions
of how adaptive specialization varies among species and how different kinds of
organisms may or may not adapt to common environmental stresses in the same or
parallel ways. They will also help inform important issues in the genetics of
conservation, the genetics of agriculture, and the biological impacts of
potential global change as manifested in changes of local habitat
types.&lt;br/&gt;
