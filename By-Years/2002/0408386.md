The Genome Consortium for Active Teaching (GCAT) will conduct a workshop in
summer, 2004, to prepare professors to use microarrays in their undergraduate
teaching and research. The manual and readings will be prepared based on
planning from the GCAT's 2003 workshop at Institute for Systems Biology. The
workshop will be held at Georgetown University and The Institute for Genome
Research (TIGR). The faculty for the workshop will be participants from the 2003
workshop. The workshop period will begin with an introduction to the features
and uses of microarrays, followed by data analysis training for 30; 20 of these
will continue into a microarray hybridization session. During the array
hybridization, another 30 participants will be introduced to microarrays and
have a data analysis workshop. In this way, professors will be prepared to use
microarrays with undergraduates in both their teaching and their research. The
manuals for data analysis and microarray hybridization will be placed on the
GCAT web site, articles featuring the lessons of the workshops will be written,
and the findings will be presented at meetings by the workshop faculty.
