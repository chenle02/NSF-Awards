9310964 Kelly This project is on research for the isolation and growth of new
thermophilic bacteria, and the characterization of enzymes for known and novel
biotransformations. This project will also continue on-going studies for
understanding the basis of enzyme thermostability. A secondary goal is the
assessment of the biotechnology and engineering aspects. The research team which
will perform this work is made up of a chemical engineer, a biochemist, and a
microbiologist. ***
