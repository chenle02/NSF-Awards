High-level managed languages, such as Java, provide strong semantic guarantees,
but these guarantees are only as good as the underlying software stack. The
research funded by this EAGER award will address the problem of verifying the
compiler and runtime systems of managed languages and address the interplay
between the formal verification of the underlying software stack and the memory
models used by these languages&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The correctness of safety-
critical code is very important, but also very difficult to guarantee. Existing
practice relies on manual code reviews and testing to ensure correctness, which
are methods that do not provide strong guarantees. This research has the
potential to improve the safety and robustness of managed-language
implementations. These implementations, in turn, will improve the reliability of
safety-critical software that runs on them.
