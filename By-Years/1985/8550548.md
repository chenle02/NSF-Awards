This project will bring about changes in instructional practices in secondary
science classrooms in the area surrounding Utah State University. Teachers will
be supplied with materials and taught the techniques necessary to implement the
Learning Cycle approach to instruction. The program will include three phases.
Phase I will consist of the preparation of appropriate teaching materials and
will be conducted during the 1985-86 academic year. Phase II will be a three-
week summer session, for 30 participants who will receive instruction in
cognitive psychology with emphasis on the Learning Cycle Model. Activities
during the following academic year will apply the principals and activities in
the classroom environment. Videotaping will allow the participants and staff to
document changes which occur in the classroom. Phase III will consist of a
summer workshop for ten of the participants, to revise the previous program.
During the following academic year, the revised programs will be used in the
classroom and reevaluated.
