OISE 11-57598&lt;br/&gt;David McNelis&lt;br/&gt;University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project provides support for
the PI and four colleagues to travel to Moscow and Arkhangelsk, Russia for
research planning. The team will spend two days in Moscow meeting with
colleagues at the Higher School of Economics (a State funded collaborator in
this project). They will then proceed to Arkhangelsk for five days where they
will meet with the Administration and Department Heads of the Northern Arctic
Federal University (NArFU) to initiate the planning and logistics for long-term
collaborative research programs in energy efficiency, biomass, and land-
atmosphere methane exchange. These meetings will lay the foundation for follow-
on interdisciplinary collaborative research proposals to be submitted to
appropriate NSF disciplinary programs. The US team will also evaluate the
feasibility of establishing a capstone program and field site at NArFU. The US
team will examine laboratory facilities, field research sites, demonstration
project facilities, appropriate mentors, and academic
curriculum.&lt;br/&gt;NArFU in the Northern Arctic provides researchers from
North Carolina access to resources that can significantly enhance an already
strong research and educational program. This project will facilitate expansion
of the program at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill from their
existing well-established research program built around the climate in lower
level latitudes to the climates of the far northern
latitudes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a synergistic project that
will provide the researchers and students from North Carolina a unique and
worthwhile basis to expand their work on sustainability and the impacts of
climate change.
