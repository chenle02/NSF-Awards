Pathways to Mathematics (PTM) is a collaborative program between the University
of South Alabama Colleges of Education, Arts &amp; Sciences, and Engineering,
Bishop State Community College, and the Mobile County Public Schools System
(MCPSS). PTM is addressing the need to increase the number of mathematics
teachers in the MCPSS through enabling recent mathematics and engineering
bachelor degree graduates to complete secondary mathematics certification in an
intensive four-semester program that culminates with certification and an earned
master's degree. The newly certified teachers (Noyce Scholars) are then
participating in a two-year post-employment mentoring program designed to
provide classroom support after graduation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PTM is
preparing a total of up to 25 mathematics teachers (over the five-year period)
certified to teach mathematics at the secondary level. PTM is doubling the
number of math teachers who earn their certification from the University of
South Alabama by creating a pipeline of undergraduate students beginning at the
community college level and culminating in an earned master's degree and
certification in secondary mathematics education. This project is expected to
enhance middle and high school student achievement by providing certified
mathematics teachers in high needs schools that currently lack certified math
teachers.
