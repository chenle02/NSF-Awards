The goal of this research is to generlize and clarify a number of recent results
on periodic optimal control theory. In particular, a number of theoretical and
computational issues will be investigated: to show that the sufficiency
condition, if weakened in a minimal way, is also necessary; to show how a
neighboring optimum periodic regulator can be constructed and, for a special
class of systems, generalized to obtain global stability to a limit cycle; to
study the relationship of this periodic regulator with that of the linear-
quadratic regulator and its associated symmetric algebraic Riccati equation; to
indicate how the periodic constraints, bounded state and/or control constraints,
can be included in the periodic optimal control formulation; to determine the
effects on robustness of uncertain dynamical systems by using periodic feedback
gains; and to extend the necessary and sufficient conditions to quasi-periodic
optimal control problems with slowly varying parameters. It is expected that
these results could have significant impact on such diverse areas as chemical
process control and flight mechanics.
