The University of Tulsa will initiate a four-week, residential Young Scholars
project in Engineering Technology for 35 students entering grades 9,10. The
primary component of the program is the summer session in which the scholars
interact with departmental faculty, undergraduate students, and representatives
from local industry. The hands-on activities will include engineering laboratory
experiments, computer workshops, and a design project. The academic year will
include follow-up activities designed to reinforce the students' experiences in
engineering. Each of the four follow-up sessions will focus on a specific issue
in engineering and will include hands-on workshops conducted by industrial
mentors and faculty. A major goal of the program is to increase awareness of
engineering as a career potential for Native American, minority, and women
students. A high priority is given to students with high potential for
engineering but with limited prior exposure to engineering or science.
