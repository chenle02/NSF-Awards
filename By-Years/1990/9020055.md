Onagraceae is one of the most thoroughly studied families among the flowering
plants. The family has the potential to serve as a model for the study of
adaptive radiation. However, a rigorous, detailed phylogeny is required to
provide a foundation for additional work on radiation within the family.
Traditional characters have failed to resolve adequately the evolutionary
pattern wtihin Onagraceae. The PI proposes to use cpDNA restriction site
variation and sequence analyses of nuclear rDNA to explore phylogeny within the
tribe Epilobeae and to sequence rbcL from cpDNA to examine intertribal
phylogenetic relationships within the family as a whole. He will also use these
and other methods to fix Onagraceae within the larger order Myrtales. Finally,
the inferred phylogeny will be used to assess character evolution within the
family. The proposed research should permit the reexamination of the systematics
of the family as well as morphological and physiological evolution that will
permit additional levels of syntheses concerning adaptation and evolution.
