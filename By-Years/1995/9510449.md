9510449 Looze This proposal is in response to the Grant Opportunities for
Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) program. The goal of the proposed project
is to provide the opportunity for the Principal Investigator and a graduate
student to closely work with Adaptive Optics Associates (including on-site
interaction and laboratory work with technical staff members) to develop, test
and implement control algorithms for an adaptive optics system for astronomy.
This will be the first operational adaptive optics system outside the U.S. Air
Force. The development of control algorithms for the adaptive optics system will
require applying modern multivariable control techniques to a large dimensional
(97 inputs, 240 outputs, and as many as 300 plant states), practical problem
which exhibits significant uncertainties and nonlinearities. In addition,
implementation issues such as the computational time for the control algorithm
and continued operation when measurements are degraded or missing must be
considered. Thus, this is an opportunity to test multivariable control system
identification, analysis and design techniques on a large, real problem. In
accordance with the guidelines of this program, Adaptive Optics Associates has
made a commitment of $10,000 (non-federal funds) to support this effort. ***
