9723610 Sheen The proposed work extends the analysis of how sugars influence
gene expression in plants and hence control plant development. Nutrients are
central regulatory signals controlling physiology, metabolism, cell cycle,
development, and gene expression in all organisms. In plants, it has been shown
that sugars control a number of processes, with a most significant effect on the
regulation of photosynthesis through changes in gene expression and signaling
leading to gene expression. In the proposed work, sugar responses will be
defined which are mediated through hexokinase as a sugar sensor. Included is an
analysis of the mechanism through which hexokinase functions and how the signal
is transmitted. In addition, cross-talk between the sugar signaling pathway and
other signaling pathways will be studied. The work includes the use of
Arabidopsis mutants which are insensitive to glucose as a major component. The
information gained through this work will enhance our ability for manipulating
plants genetically for biotechnological purposes.
