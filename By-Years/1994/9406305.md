9406305 Hodges This award provides partial funding for the support of a
technician assigned to the solid-source and gas-source mass spectrometry
laboratories in the Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The laboratories are engaged in
ongoing programs of research and graduate education that require full-time
technical assistance. Current basic research projects focus on the use of
radiometric dating techniques to interpret large-scale tectonic processes and
Earth history. *** 9405805 Craig This award provides 75% of the funds required
for the acquisition of a microscope system for use with transmitted and
reflected light to be used in the rare gas isotope laboratory, Scripps
Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego. The
University is committed to providing the remaining funds necessary for the
acquisition. The microscope system is mainly to be used by researchers working
with fluid, glass, and crystalline inclusions trapped in samples of basaltic
rocks that have been extruded from the Earth's mantle. The microscope is needed
for the location and identification of these small inclusions prior to
extraction of the rare gases (argon, helium, and neodymium) for isotopic
analysis. The researchers at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography are using
the isotopic content of the rare gases brought up from the mantle to understand
the geochemical evolution of the mantle. ***
