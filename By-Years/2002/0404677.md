David Lynn, Stefan Lutz and Ichiro Matsumura (Emory University) and Nicholas Hud
(Georgia Tech) are jointly supported by the Division of Chemistry to develop
self-replicating polymer systems. This interdisciplinary team will pursue both
rational and diversity-based approaches to the development
of&lt;br/&gt;macromolecular catalysts for the sequence- and chain length-
specific synthesis of chiral polymers. These systems are inspired by the
efficiency of DNA and RNA biopolymers in self-assembly and self-
replication.&lt;br/&gt;Sequence-specific polyesters, polyamines/amides and
polyphosphonates will be prepared through the merger of synthetic chemistry,
polymer chemistry and directed molecular evolution. This strategy mimics
Nature's approach towards the most efficient and most broadly-based routes to
such polymers. These robust reactions can be used to select and evolve a
synthetic polymer to prepare new functional materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
implementation of "synthetic biology" or bio-inspired strategies for the
production of new chemicals and materials, has been enabled by advances in
molecular biology, high throughput screening and sophisticated selection
protocols. This project is funded through the Collaborative Research in
Chemistry Program (CRC) and provides outstanding opportunities for
undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers to acquire
knowledge and skills in very broad areas of research, including synthetic
organic chemistry, physical organic chemistry, biophysics and structural
biology.
