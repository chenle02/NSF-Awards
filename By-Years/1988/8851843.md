Resources are provided to improve three digital data acquisition laboratories.
These laboratories will have the capability of integrating computers and
measurement and control systems. Students acquire data from simple instruments
such as strain gauges and thermocouples, manipulate the data in various ways and
output the data to an analog strip chart recorder. These laboratories show
students that a computer can be readily used as part of larger control systems
with both scientific and industrial applications.
