ABSTRACT Proposal Number: CTS-9618627 Principal Investigator: Wallace This is
an experimental and numerical study of the turbulent mixing layer, focusing on
the properties of the vorticity and passive scalar fields. The structure and
dynamics of the vorticity field will be studied by statistical means through an
examination of the moments and spectra, as well as by the joint-probability-
density analysis of the vorticity field. Three-dimensional visualizations of the
flow will be obtained from the accompanying large-eddy simulation to yield a
complete picture of the properties of the vorticity field. Both experiments and
numerical calculations will be extended to investigate in detail the fluxes of a
passive scalar, with the purpose of highlighting the physical phenomena that
govern scalar transport. Statistical data and instantaneous fields will be
studied, and the performance of scalar transport models for the Reynolds-
averaged Navier-Stokes equations will be evaluated.
