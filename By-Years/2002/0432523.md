This is a proposal from the Polar Research Board (PRB) for continuing core
support. This includes support for meetings of the PRB, development of study
plans, and pass-through funds to the International Arctic Science Committee
(IASC) and the Scientific Committee on Antarctic research (SCAR). The PRB plays
a pivotal role in U.S. planning for the 2007-2009 International Polar Year.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed activity is primarily of an administrative
nature. Contributions to advancing discovery and understanding, and promoting
teaching, training, or learning activities are supported through separately
funded workshop and study proposals.&lt;br/&gt;
