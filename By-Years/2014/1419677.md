Strong storms can have devastating impacts on people living on the coasts, built
infrastructure, and on marine fisheries and ecosystems that lie offshore. Super
typhoon Haiyan, the largest storm ever recorded, hit the Philippines in the Fall
of 2013 causing serious damage on land. Similarly, it had devastating impacts on
marine ecosystems and biological communities, but the extent of these impacts
because they are not readily visible due to their underwater locations are
generally under documented and appreciated. This research is an NSF RAPID
response to document and assess the sediment erosion and redistribution across
the central Philippine Islands as a result of super storm Haiyan and its impact
on sea life and marine ecosystems. Mapping of seafloor sediments and sample
collection via piston coring will be undertaken to measure net changes in the
accumulation and/or erosion of pre-existing carbonate and siliciclastic sediment
cover from intertidal to deep water (500 meters below sea level) environments in
the Central Philippine Islands. Results of the investigation will be used to
examine differences in sedimentation and erosion processes between normal and
extreme-event timeframes. Sediments will be collected using piston cores and
photographic images will be recorded of the seafloor. Drone-enabled aerial
photography of the study area will also be collected. These data will be
compared with time-series data of the same locations that have been taken over
the last three years by the principle investigator. Particular emphasis will be
given to changes in sea grass beds, reefs, and biological communities that form
the basis of Philippine fisheries and tourism. Broader impacts of the work
include collaboration with Philippine and Australian scientists and hazard
assessment of shallow and deep offshore marine ecosystems that can be used for
economic assessment of damaging storms in Pacific Island nations.
