The aim of this project is to introduce upper-level undergraduate chemistry
students at James Madison University to the uses of lasers in various aspects of
chemistry. Courses in instrumental analysis, physical chemistry, and
biochemistry, and undergraduate research opportunities will be enhanced through
this project. Included are new experiments involving Raman spectroscopy,
regular, polarized, and phase sensitive emission spectroscopy, multiple photon
effects, laser vaporization, and thermal lensing. These techniques will be
incorporated through the acquisition of two lasers, Nd:YAG and He/Cd units, plus
a suitable selection of accessories. Lasers have had a significant impact on the
practice of modern chemistry. This project will expose students to many of the
important chemical applications of lasers.
