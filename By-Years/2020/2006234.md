General audience abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will explore nearly
perfect fluid flow in a “designer” quantum system, comprising a unique ultracold
gas of atoms, contained in a box made entirely of laser light. The atoms used in
these tabletop experiments feature experimentally adjustable attraction or
repulsion, from very weak to very strong, enabling measurements that impact
theories in intellectual disciplines well outside of atomic physics. The
contained atoms model new materials, such as super-high temperature
superconductors that operate far above room temperature, which will one day
enable energy-saving power lines and magnetically levitated trains. Students and
post-doctoral associates will design new optical systems, new computer control
and mechanical systems, and study electrodynamics and quantum mechanics, broadly
training them for challenges arising in science and
technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical audience
abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The experiments will study the fluid dynamics of a
Fermi gas of Li-6 atoms near a collisional (Feshbach) resonance, which enables
magnetic control of atom-atom interactions. The ultracold Fermi gas is
contained, perturbed, and imaged in a designer optical potential, which is
generated using two digital micro-mirror arrays. By imaging the atom density
profile as a function of time, the new experiments will measure the hydrodynamic
linear response and transport properties as a function of temperature,
interaction strength, and spin-imbalance. Imaging the trapped cloud in a 1D
linearly varying potential will determine the equation of state. Designer
optical potentials also will be used for in-situ imaging of shock waves as a
function of interaction strength, density profile and temperature
profile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
