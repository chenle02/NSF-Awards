9706201 Song This research involves the expansion of previous findings
concerning the differential rotation of the earth's inner core. Waveform
modeling and differential time measurements of core phases (PKP) have
successfully led to new insights on both the P- wave anisotropy, structure and
rotation of the inner core. The approach of using relative observations
(waveforms, differential times) with a common source eliminates the concern
about uncertainties in source origin time, excitation, mislocation, and velocity
uncertainties in the crust and upper mantle under the source and receiver. More
differential data will be assembled to invert the anisotropy/attenuation
structure of the inner core in a frame of a spinning inner core. ***
