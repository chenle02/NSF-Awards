This effort deals with the effort to develop idealized magnetic-semiconductor
layered structures. At the Naval Research Laboratory the technique of molecular
bean epitaxy will be deployed in evaporating single crystal iron films on
substrates of Ga1-xInxAs. For this combination of materials the lattice constant
mismatch between substrate and film is zero or relatively small. For these
growth conditions magnetic interfacial effects as manifested in microwave
measurements depend solely on intrinsic magnetic surfaces processes. In
particular the PI may be able for the first time to measure the intrinsic
uniaxial magnetic surface anisotropy parameter in iron. Besides this parameter,
other instrinsic magnetic parameters (magnetic relaxation, exchange-stiffness
constant, cubic magnetic anisotropy...) will be measured. These measurements
will be compared with well known theories. Physical understanding of intrinsic
interfacial effects in idealized magnetic-semiconductor layers should form a
strong basis in producing new artificial multilayered structures, such as
magnetic superlattices.
