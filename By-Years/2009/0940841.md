Major science and engineering initiatives are dependent upon massive data
collections that comprise observational data, experimental data, simulation
data, and engineering data. To support science and engineering collaborations, a
policy driven national data management infrastructure will be implemented. The
implementation prototype will address both the life cycle of science and
engineering data and the sustainability of data collections and repositories
over time, across changes in technology and changes in usage. The motivation for
building the national infrastructure comes from the data management requirements
of the NSF Ocean Observatories Initiative (real-time data streams, simulation
output, video), the NSF Consortium of Universities for Advancement of Hydrologic
Science (point data), engineering projects in education and CAD/CAM/CAE
archives, the iPlant collaborative (genome databases), the Odum social science
institute (statistics), and the NSF Science of Learning Centers (EEG / MRI
sensor data, video).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The approach is based on a bottom-up
federation of existing data management systems through use of the integrated
Rule-Oriented Data System (iRODS). Each of the referenced national initiatives
has implemented a core data management system based upon the iRODS data grid
technology. Through federation, the independent systems can be assembled into a
national data infrastructure that integrates collections across project-specific
technology (such as real-time sensor data acquisition systems), institutional
repositories, regional data grids, federal repositories, and international data
grids. The resulting infrastructure will enable collaborative research among
researchers in academic institutions and federal agencies, and across national
boundaries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Evolution of the policies (computer actionable
rules) and procedures (computer executable workflows) that govern each stage of
the data life cycle will be supported. Specific policies and procedures will be
implemented for each domain to support their community standards for managing
data in their local data grid. The project will develop the interoperability
mechanisms required to share data between the domains, develop sets of policies
and procedures to govern the data life cycle stages, and develop policies and
procedures that enable re-use of collections. The national data management
infrastructure will demonstrate enforcement of data management policies that
comply with NSF Data management and preservation requirements.
