This research will extend and augment previous work on knowledge-based machine
fault diagnosis, using artificial neural networks. The starting point of this
effort will be the framework of previous machine monitoring research. Analytical
modeling of behavioral phenomenon will be carried out to establish quantitative
and qualititative relationships of spatial considerations and fault diagnosis
models. This modeling will be interfaced to the real world to carry out
intelligent monitoring. Intelligent monitoring of machine tools for diagnostic
purposes is of great importance in automated manufacturing environments. This
work is being conducted in close cooperation with a major manufacturing
organization and is likely to yield important results.
