The goal of the RESYN project is to automate the development of efficient
programs by advancing the state of the art in program synthesis. Program
synthesis is an emerging technology for automatically generating programs from
high-level descriptions of the task they must perform. For any given task,
however, there are generally many programs that perform the same function, but
differ in their use of computing resources, such as time, memory, or energy.
Most state-of-the-art synthesis tools do not model nor analyze resource usage.
By taking resource consumption of candidate programs into account during
synthesis, RESYN is able to synthesize provably efficient programs, as well as
customized programs for platforms with specific resource requirements. The
project involves graduate and undergraduate students in this
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To leverage resource usage information during
synthesis, the investigators combine two recent techniques: type-driven program
synthesis and automated amortized resource analysis. First, they develop a novel
resource-aware refinement type system, which unifies the expressive type systems
at the core of the two techniques. Next, based on this type system, the
investigators build a new type-driven synthesis engine, capable of pruning and
prioritizing the search for programs based on their resource consumption.
Finally, they evaluate the synthesis engine in three relevant application
domains: server-less computing, smart contracts, and prevention of side-channel
attacks. The course materials and research products developed in this project
will be made freely available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
