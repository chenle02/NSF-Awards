Abstractions are the basis for most of the ways that programmers look at their
programs, data, and execution. Most of these abstractions have a visual
component. This work envisions a system that will allow programmers to rapidly
define abstractions and their accompanying visualizations. Such a system would
have immediate applications to programming environments, data bases, parallel
programming, and education. This project will investigate what it means to
design such a system and to explore many of the underlying problems that must be
solved before such a system can become a reality. In conjunction with other
research projects, it will lead to an abstraction-based visualization
environment to experiment with various solutions to these problems and to
evaluate the underlying concepts.
