This research extends existing models of creep deformation in metal matrix
composite (MMC) materials to include limited fiber/matrix interfacial adhesion,
matrix materials exhibiting work hardening and anisotropy, and three dimensional
microstructures. Experiments and simulations are anticipated for
aluminum/silicon carbide and copper/tungsten MMC systems, according to a four
part plan. (1) Important constituent and interface properties are measured using
several novel experiments and the microstructural configurations are determined
using metallographic techniques. (2) Finite element simulations are carried out
to predict non-isothermal creep rates in the two MMC systems. These simulations
will be expanded later to include a wider range of microstructures, constituent
and interface properties, and temperature/load paths. (3) The non- isothermal
deformation rates for the two MMC systems are measured in uniaxial tension and
biaxial tension as functions of temperature/load paths. (4) The experimental
results and model predictions for the two systems are compared and a consistent
model for evaluating the creep-based lifetimes of MMC systems with non-
isothermal histories are developed. %%% Currently there is a strong interest in
materials suitable for moderately elevated temperature structural applications
requiring low density, high static strength, and good creep resistance. MMC
materials exhibit some of these properties and promise great improvements in
component lifetimes and performance.
