The planned University of Tennessee, Knoxville site of the I/UCRC for
Integrative Materials Joining for Energy Applications has the potential to allow
accelerated development and deployment of hybrid material systems for energy
applications and will be focused on the scale-up of proven laboratory
developments relevant to automotive, aerospace, and energy applications. The
research has the potential to enable scientific discoveries related to the
thermo-mechanical-chemical properties of interfaces between these constituent
materials to be achieved. Advanced in-situ and ex-situ characterization
techniques will be applied to understand issues such as cyclic thermal and
stress loading, residual stress development, and microstructural evolution. This
new site plans to produce fundamental research at the crossroads of joining and
additive manufacturing.

The focus of the planned site on joining and additive manufacturing of advanced
materials is of central importance to the competitiveness of the automotive,
aerospace, and energy sectors. The planned new site plans to work with Hardin
Valley Elementary School (HVES) to recruit students for forming and mentoring
independent FIRST LEGOfi League (FLL) team(s) as they tackle real-world
engineering challenges. This interaction with elementary school children might
be their first towards introducing and encouraging them to consider STEM choices
in their future academic careers. Additionally, the proposed site of CIMJSEA
will collaborate with non-profit organizations in Tennessee and the College of
Engineering Office of Diversity Programs in order to foster interaction with
underrepresented groups over a wide range of ages.
