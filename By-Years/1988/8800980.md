The general objectives of this project are to develop a new theoretical
understanding of how the transport of mass to a wall or at a gas/liquid boundary
is related to fluid mechanical factors, to understand the turbulent transport of
particles and droplets, to understand how turbulent transport of molecular
species is related to Langrangian statistics, and to carry out studies of finite
amplitude interfacial waves that are generated by an air flow. Important aspects
of this work are that combined laboratory and supercomputer experiments will be
conducted and that newly developed optical techniques will be used to study
Langrangian turbulence characteristics of particles. Five sub-projects are under
investigation: (1) Mass transfer at a solid boundary; (2) Optical studies of the
turbulent transport of particles; (3) Computer studies; (4) Non-linear effects
in wave generation; (5) Mass transfer at a gas- liquid boundary. The improved
theoretical understanding of turbulent transport in a fluid and to a wall could
provide better ways to compute concentration (and temperature) fields; but, just
as important, it will help in understanding how to control or enhance mass
transfer rates. The results from basic studies of particle transport and of wave
generation will improve our methods to predict the performance of multiphase
flow systems.
