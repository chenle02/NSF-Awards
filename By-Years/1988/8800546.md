Description: This project supports participation by U.S. scientists in a
symposium on underground engineering to be held in New Delhi. The topics will
include construction of tunnels for hydro-electric power and their stability
problems, and of facilities for high-level radioactive waste in underground
repositories; rock burst problems in very deep underground excavations such as
in Indian gold mines. The Indian coordinator of the symposium is Dr. A. K. Dube,
Head, Geomechanics, Central Mining Research Station Unit, Central Building
Research Institute, Roorkee, India. The U.S. participants will present papers on
their research, and will visit Indian research facilities especially at the
University of Roorkee and at the Kolar gold field mines to learn of research
results and experiences. Scope: Indian scientists responsible for helping Indian
industrial development have dealt with major structural problems in mining,
hydro-electric power and nuclear waste disposal. They had to conduct research to
deal with these problems. They, and the U.S. participants can exchange
information on their experiences and possibly develop a viable program of
collaboration in this area.
