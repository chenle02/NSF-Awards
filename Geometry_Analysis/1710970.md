For more than a century, mathematicians specializing in the subject of
differential geometry have worked on the question of what is the best geometry
(i.e., shape) that a given space can have: Just as a beachball can be shaped
into a perfect sphere, with the same amount of curvature at all points and in
all directions, all 2-dimensional spaces can be shaped into highly symmetric and
uniform geometries, and similarly all 3-dimensional spaces can be cut into
pieces that carry such geometries. But the corresponding question is completely
open for 4-dimensional spaces. Moreover, this dimension stands out among others,
since certain 4-dimensional spaces can support infinitely many different smooth
structures, which may admit geometries with radically different properties.
These facts make 4-dimensional geometry in many ways unpredictable, and a
fertile field for interdisciplinary research, as the subject has grown in many
directions and branched into other areas of mathematics and physics. This
research project is based on interactions between fields including geometry,
topology, and analysis. The investigator will undertake an in-depth analysis of
a class of unbounded 4-dimensional spaces that are important from the
perspective of general relativity, that carry a geometry modeled on the complex
numbers, and whose geometry is mildly uniform. In another direction, the
investigator will examine closed 4-dimensional spaces whose curvature is
similarly uniform. In more detail, the investigator will undertake a
comprehensive analysis of the asymptotically locally Euclidean Kähler manifolds.
This is a special class of non-compact 4-dimensional manifolds that generalizes
the gravitational instantons from theoretical physics. The project has far-
reaching applications in understanding the global structure of closed constant
scalar curvature Kähler or almost-Kähler manifolds. A second group of projects
focuses on the study of the Riemannian properties of 4-manifolds in conjunction
with techniques coming from Seiberg-Witten theory. In particular, the
investigator will analyze the moduli space of Einstein metrics or constant
scalar curvature metrics and their compactifications in Gromov-Hausdorff
topology. The techniques employed come from gauge theory, global analysis,
algebraic geometry, and differential topology.
