The Fellow will test for the presence of lithospheric roots beneath Archean
cratons in the southern African subcontinent by (1) investigating crustal and
upper mantle seismic velocities, (2) determining earthquake source depths, and
(3) integrating new seismic observations with existing seismic, gravity, heat
flow and petrologic observations into a unified model. The Fellow will work at
the Pennsylvania State University during his tenure.
