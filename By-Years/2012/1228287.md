University of Washington proposes to support technical services on R/V Thompson,
a 274? general purpose, global class research vessel, and R/V Barnes, a 66-foot
coastal research vessel, both operated as part of the University-National
Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. The proposal requests support
for basic services. They will provide at least two shipboard technicians on each
cruise of R/V Thompson to support seagoing research projects and to maintain,
calibrate and provide for qualified users items from their pool of shared-use
research instrumentation. As part of the basic services, they will maintain and
operate the multibeam sonar systems on R/V Thompson. For R/V Barnes, a
technician is available to sail if desired by the chief scientists, though (s)he
will often not sail due to space limitations. The technician will provide
shared-use instrumentation for use by the scientists, and provide remote support
as needed if a technician does not sail. The budget included with this proposal
is for the first year of a 5-year continuing grant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the present proposal is under
criterion two, providing infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel
and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic
research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant
research program of NSF). The support of maintenance and operation of shared-use
instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab
access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost
of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.
