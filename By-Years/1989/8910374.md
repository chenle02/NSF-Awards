This Research Initiation Award is to support the study of fracture of the very
brittle piezoceramic materials. The main emphasis will be on effect of the
electric field on the rate of crack propagation. The stress and electric
displacement behavior near the crack tip will be south via the use of an
eigenfunction expansion method.
