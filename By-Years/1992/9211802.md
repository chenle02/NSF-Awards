This project will make the first direct measurements of a low altitude
atmospheric plume that has been observed in satellite imagery as rising from the
sea ice in the vicinity of Bennett Island in the Arctic Ocean. It has been
hypothesized that the plume consists of rapidly escaping methane released from
the melting and vaporization of methane hydrates along a fault structure, but to
date there has been no direct confirmation of this conjecture. This work will be
supported under the Small Grants for Exploratory Research Program (SGER), which
includes in its objectives the support of research that is risky and has severe
urgency with regard to availablity of facilities. In this instance the field
work will be a month-long deployment of a Russian AN-2 aircraft to the vicinity
of Bennett Island following the already scheduled Arctic Gas and Aerosol
Sampling Program (AGASP-4), sponsored by NOAA, in March and April of 1992. This
will take advantage of the fact that the aircraft will already have been
equipped with a suite of atmospheric chemistry instrumentation, and will only
require the installation of a separate sample inlet line. The work will identify
the composition of the Bennett Island plume, and if it is in fact largely
methane, will allow a determination of the age of the source hydrates. This in
turn will promote the construction of a global methane budget, and assess its
effect as a radiatively important trace species on the global radiation budget.
