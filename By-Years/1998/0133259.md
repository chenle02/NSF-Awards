This project integrates ecological research with university graduate and
undergraduate instruction to assess how inputs of atmospheric nitrogen (N) from
fossil fuel emission alter the carbon (C) cycling of southern Californian semi-
arid shrublands. Atmospheric N fertilization has been implicated in the decline
of northern forests. However, the effects of atmospheric N fertilization on
western shrublands have not been adequately quantified even though these
ecosystems are exposed to some of the highest atmospheric N pollution levels in
the world. This project will employ field observational and manipulative studies
to assess changes in ecosystem structure and function to atmospheric N
fertilization and provide a mechanistic understanding of the ecosystem response.
In turn, the field studies will significantly enhance lecture and laboratory
curricula in terrestrial ecology and provide students an opportunity to actively
investigate the impact of human activities on the C cycling of ecosystems that
are regionally important.
