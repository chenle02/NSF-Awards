This is a proposal to advance interdisciplinary work in cognitive psychology and
neuroscience by providing funds for travel and a workshop to train investigators
and graduate students in the use of MEG (Magnetoencephalography) technology
prior to the delivery and installation of new MEG equipment at the LIFE center
at the University of Washington in Seattle. Travel will be to the Low
Temperature and BioMag Laboratories at the Helsinki University of Technology,
centers of MEG expertise in Helsinki, Finland.

Investigators at the labs in Helsinki and in Seattle have collaborated to
develop novel uses of MEG applicable to the study of learning, and appropriate
head-tracking techniques to allow whole-brain imaging studies in awake infants
who are engaged in cognitive tasks such as learning. MEG is the only currently
available whole-brain imaging technology that is appropriate for use with awake
infants.

The primary area of study is first and second language learning in infants.
Behavioral studies have established that the brains of very young babies begin
to specialize in the ambient language between 6 and 12 months of age. The
purpose of the MEG studies will be to track exactly what is going on in the
brains of infants undergoing this specialization process, as either monolinguals
or bilinguals.

The request of $45,000 for one year is to support travel to Helsinki by
investigators from six Science of Learning Centers, plus two graduate students
from the University of Washington, and to support an international workshop in
Helsinki on MEG technology to be called "MEG as a Tool for the Learning
Sciences." The workshop is to be organized by the PI and associates from the
LIFE Center at the University of Washington.
