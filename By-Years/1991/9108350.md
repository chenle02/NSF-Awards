The primary objectives of this study are to develop a general but practical
method for the analysis of isotropic, saturated cohesive soils which take into
account not only material nonlinearities and thermo-mechanical coupling, but
also time-dependent characteristics of soil; to develop an efficient numerical
implementation of the proposed analysis method; and to verify this method by
comparing numerical simulations to results of laboratory and field
investigations. A generalized elastoplastic-viscoplastic bounding surface
formulation will be extended to realize these objectives to advance the current
state of the art in the simulation of heat and fluid flow through a deforming
porous medium.
