delegation in a conference "The First International conference on Electronics,
Circuits, and Systems-ICECS'94" to be held in Cairo, Egypt, December 19-22,
1994. The conference is planned to include regular sessions on all aspects of
the field of electronics including analog, digital, solid- state, power, high-
speed, automotive, biomedical, military and consumer electronics. Special
sessions, invited talks and tutorials on specific advanced topics will also be
included. Scope: This project supports the participation of six U.S. scientists
in an important regional conference, sponsored by the local chapter of the IEEE.
The conference is a forum for researchers and designers to present and discuss
various aspects of this emerging field which is of great importance to both the
U.S. and to Egypt. The interaction during the meeting is likely to enhance
collaborative research and the involvement of Egyptian graduate students in U.S.
research. ***
