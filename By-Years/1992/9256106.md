Dordt College seeks to provide an enrichment experience in engineering for a
three-week residential Young Scholars Program followed by academic year
activities. The program will serve 45 students entering eighth and ninth grades.
The project activities are designed to introduce students to various scientific
and mathematical principles, particularly those involved in engineering, and
reinforce them through a series of well-planned experiential activities.
Activities include: lecture-oriented sessions, laboratory exercises, field trips
to local business and industry, and research experiences which include student
design projects.
