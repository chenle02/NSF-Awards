Dr. Tomasko will continue a project to study the properties of particles which
make up a haze in the atmospheres of Jupiter and Saturn. Most of the necessary
ground-based observations are in hand, but reduction and analysis of the data
remain. Visible images of Jupiter and Saturn reveal the presence of bright and
dark cloud features over the disks of these planets. Such solid cloud particles
can play important roles in the chemistry, heat balance, and dynamics of
planetary atmospheres. It is now known that a relatively thin haze of small
particles is formed in the stratospheres of both Jupiter and Saturn by
photochemical reactions, possibly augmented by meteoritic infall. These
particles fall to tropospheric levels where they can act as nuclei for the
condensation of several atmospheric gases, including ammonia. Despite the
importance of these particles in planetary processes, the complex nature of
their interaction has made it difficult to use remote sensing observations to
uniquely determine their properties. Dr. Tomasko's project is aimed at obtaining
a coordinated set of ground-based observations of Jupiter and Saturn which will
substantially enhance our understanding of these haze particles.
