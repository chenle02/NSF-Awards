The goal of this proposal is to begin the development of a set of three courses
in natural science and technology which emphasize developing scientific literacy
in an environment in which good teaching is modeled. Each course is to be
accompanied by a one credit seminar on methods of teaching science/technology.
These courses/seminar combinations are to be taught both to undergraduates
teacher preparation students and to the teachers with whom the teacher education
majors will do their field experience and student teaching. One major theme of
the university course development is identifying and accommodating science
anxious learners. This project, in particular, will develop the first
course/seminar pair and conduct the first summer workshop for the experienced
teachers that will work with the students. In addition, the project will hold a
small conference exploring the adaptability of the planned courses and seminars
at other small liberal arts universities that educate teachers. The products of
the project will include 8-10 laboratory guides for preservice teachers as well
as a detailed course syllabus and seminar syllabus. Student materials will
include guides for short projects for use in the seminar and a set of readings
for both the course and the seminar. Capital University is contributing 85% of
the amount that NSF is contributing to the project.
