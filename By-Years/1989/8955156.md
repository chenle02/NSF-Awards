This project will establish a model program of collaboration between The
University of Michigan and regional public schools designed to train secondary
science teachers in the development and use of computer-based strategies that
are aimed at improving overall student biology performance as well as
eliminating the achievement gap exhibited by underrepresented minorities. While
it is understood that computer technology is not the sole remedy for our current
problems in science education, it is known that the educational use of computer
technology can make a significant difference in student performance, and that
this potential has barely begun to be tapped by U.S. schools. The approaches to
be employed in this project are based upon the results of a five-year study of
educational computing and student performance carried out by the principal
investigator at The University of Michigan. This study, which was initially
motivated by the underperformance of Black and Hispanic students in introductory
biology, led to the development of flexibly-paced computer exercises that use
diagnostic feedback to inform the learner about the reasoning underlying both
correct and incorrect responses. Use of this new software led to a dramatic
improvement in overall class performances, as well as elimination of the
performance gap previously seen with minority students. By training public
school teachers in the development and implementation of such strategies, the
project is thus intended to increase the computer skills and subject matter
expertise of secondary science teachers while simultaneously producing
instructional materials of proven ability to enhance student performance. An
amount equivalent to 143.2% of the NSF award is being contributed as cost-
sharing.
