The Shoo Fly Complex, northern Sierra Nevada, California has been subdivided
into, from structurally lowest to structurally highest, (1) the Lang-Halsted
sequence, (2) the Duncan Peak chert, (3) the Culbertson Lake allochthon and (4)
the Sierra City melange. Northeast-dipping thrust faults bound each structural
slice, and stratigraphic patterns in the Culbertson Lake allochthon suggest that
at least parts of the Shoo Fly Complex form an imbricate structure that formed
in a Paleozoic accretionary complex. If this hypothesis is correct and can be
expanded to include other units in the Shoo Fly Complex, then each fault-bounded
slice contains information about how the accretionary complex evolved. We will
undertake a two-year program to investigate the age(s) of chert units throughout
the Shoo Fly Complex, and the stratigraphic, petrologic, sedimentologic, and
structural characteristics of the Lang- Halsted sequence. Data generated by work
proposed here will allow for a comprehensive terrane analysis of a complete
cross- sectional portion of the Shoo Fly Complex, and will add significantly to
our understanding of the most extensive belt of lower Paleozoic rocks in
California. The results could have a major impact on the distribution of
aboriginal North American crust and exotic or suspect crustal elements.
