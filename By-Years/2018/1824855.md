The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the improved
safety and reduced cost of managing nuclear waste. Current lightweight radiation
shielding materials lack the required temperature stability. New radiation
shielding materials with better properties are needed to protect the health of
biological, electrical, and structural systems in radioactive environments.
Radiation shielding improvements in the nuclear industry could result in upwards
of one billion dollars in savings annually and result in lower electricity
costs. Commercialization of these advanced materials can also minimize the
effects of disasters like Fukushima and reduce the costs of clean-up efforts.
Lightweight radiation shielding materials are also needed in airplanes and
satellites to protect workers and electronic systems from cosmic radiation and
for medical personnel working with radiation related treatments. This I-Corps
project is based on an innovative lightweight radiation shielding material that
withstands operating temperatures nearly double those of commercially available
products. It has been demonstrated that the addition of carbon-based particles
can more quickly move heat away from radioactive waste; this enables safer
disposal options for the nuclear waste. Additional technical merit lies in the
fabrication process that has been developed to reduce the weight and size of the
material. It also enables the technology to be cost competitive with existing
products while providing better shielding properties. The I-Corps investigation
will determine the commercial potential for this material.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
