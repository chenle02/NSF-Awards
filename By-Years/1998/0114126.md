0114126 Smets The objective of this research project is to use an innovative
protein engineering approach to create dioxygenases that initiate aerobic attack
on trinitrotoluene (TNT) and aminodinitrotoluenes (ADNT), products of natural
attenuation of TNT. The approach will be to expand the substrate range of
nitroarene dioxygenases to allow oxidative transformation of ADNT and/or TNT.
The gene encoding the large subunit of the terminal oxygenase will be the focus
of this work. DNA shuffling will be used to create variants of two
2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT) dioxygenases individually. Burkholdria sp. strain DNT
will be used as the initial host to create a complete pathway for TNT/ADNT
degradation. Creation of a complete, successful ADNT and/or TNT mineralization
pathway will be initiated. Hence, the enzymatic steps for the down-stream
processing of expected transformation products will also be addressed. Using a
novel, directed-evolution approach and metabolic engineering, this project aims
to create the first oxidative enzyme and pathway for the biomineralization of
TNT/ADNT. The constructed strain will be invaluable in developing sustainable
strategies for remediation of explosives contaminated environments. ***
