9530041 Geronimo This award will provide partial support for ImageTech, a
Conference on the Mathematics of Imaging and Applications, to be held at the
Georgia Institute of Technology from March 17-20, 1996. Support will be provided
for graduate students and recent doctoral recipients. The conference will bring
together researchers who will present recent advances in the mathematics of
imaging, including fractal, wavelet, and other technologies. New developments in
image compression and analysis have led to an increased cooperation among
researchers in areas such as speech and video compression, image enhancing,
target acquisition, and many others. Participants will include researchers from
both academia and industry. The program will include both plenary lectures and a
technical program, including both invited talks and contributed papers.
