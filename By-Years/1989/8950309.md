Over a three-year period, the PRISE project of Grand Valley State University
will coordinate the efforts of a team of scientists and educators in the design
and implementation of a model program of environment oriented, hands-on science
education for preservice elementary teachers. The goals of PRISE (Project to
Improve Science Education) are to use the region's water resources to increase
the students' interest, knowledge, and confidence with science; increase the
students' understanding of the relationships between science, technology and
society; teach science content appropriate to the elementary classroom; combine
the teaching of science content with the process approach; and motivate and
encourage preservice elementary teachers to elect a major or minor in science.
PRISE is intended to serve as a model which may be readily transferred to other
regions of the nation where locally prominent resources may serve as the program
focus. Transfer will be facilitated by special written and video materials. The
cost sharing will be fifteen percent of the NSF portion.
