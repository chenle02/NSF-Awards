ABSTRACT--CTS-9310542 The PI has requested the necessary equipment to assemble a
laser based system that will be used for particle imaging velocimetry (PIV) and
planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF). This system should be capable of
obtaining fundamental information on flame-vortex interactions leading to
effects on flame strain, burn-rate, and extinction which are important factors
in determining cycle-to-cycle variations in IC and fast-burn engines. The
proposed system includes a pulsed Nd:YAG laser, dye laser, and associated
accessories and would enable measurements of flow velocities, and OH and O-atom
densities to be made. The equipment will greatly enhance the current Michigan/GM
combustion program that is funded by NSF for which no laser diagnostics were
budgeted.
