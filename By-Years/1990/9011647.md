Recent studies with microbial systems have shown that perfluorocarbon
(PF)-emulsions can increase the oxygen transfer rate and increase the growth
and/or amount of harvested bioproduct. More recently, attempts have been made to
develop useful PF microcarriers using F-emulsions. These microcarriers provide
an enormous increase in surface area. It has been known for some time that
anchorage dependent cells grow well on fluorocarbon surfaces. A new technique
has been developed by DuPont that makes it possible to fix specific proteins to
a fluorocarbon surface. This technique has the potential to provide droplets
with important and specific factors necessary for different cells to adhere to a
surface, and makes it possible to provide better aeration. The PIs have done
some preliminary studies using a purified fraction of high molecular weight
gelatin, bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a model protein, and perfluorodecalin as
the recipient fluorocarbon. Gelatin has been successfully tested for growth with
BHK cells. This project will be directed towards purifying the perfluorodecalin,
preparing beads that are more stable, and conducting preliminary oxygen mass
transport studies. Successful completion of this project will open the way to
developing PF microcarriers with special adhesion factors, and optimal gas
exchange for cells adhering to the PF microcarriers.
