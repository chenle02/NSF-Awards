Abstract&lt;br/&gt;ECCS-0801924&lt;br/&gt;S. Khondaker, University of Central
Florida&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to
design, fabricate and characterize a novel planar gated organic photovoltaic
device (OPV) with in-plane cathode and anode deposited from different metals.
The approach is to (i) fabricate interdigitated electrode arrays by a
combination of optical and electron beam lithography on a doped silicon
substrate, (ii) deposit active layers of different thickness, and (iii)
characterize device performance by photocurrent imaging, and room- and low
temperature transport measurements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: A
novel planar electrode OPV with integrated back gate will be fabricated. In
contrast to existing OPV?s, this new device will (i) allow independent control
of active layer thickness and electrode spacing, (ii) eliminate the need for
transparent electrodes giving more flexibility in choice of materials, and (iii)
allow in-situ field effect mobility measurements. Device properties will be
correlated directly with the figures of merit of the device under investigation.
This will lead to high efficiency OPVs by offering better charge mobility,
enhanced charge transport and collection efficiency, and device manufacturing
methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: Successful demonstration of the
planar gated OPV will have significant impact towards realization of high
efficiency, low cost organic solar cells. For educational development and
outreach the investigators propose: (i) training of female and minority
students, high school students and teachers, (ii) development of a new graduate
course on energy and nanoscience, and (iii) community outreach through internet,
news letters, exhibitions at the Orlando Science Center, and Florida Solar
Energy Center.&lt;br/&gt;
