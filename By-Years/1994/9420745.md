This project involves the dissertation research of an anthropology student from
UCLA. The project will explore how culturally specific rules and criteria
influence the choice of spouses in Mauritius to maintain ethnic boundaries
through endogamy. Through interviews and census data, marriage patterns in
Mauritius will be determined, including rates of intermarriage between Creoles,
Afro-Mauritians, Indians (Muslims and Hindus) and other ethnic groups. The
researcher will create a decision-tree model of mate choice to assess the nature
of the decisions and values people use to maintain ethnic group boundaries. This
research is important because it increases the expertise available about t his
area of the world, and advances our understanding of the nature of ethnic group
boundary maintenance. In the current `post-modern` era the importance of the
nation-state with respect to ethnic groups is waning, thus research on the
nature of ethnic boundaries is increasingly valuable.
