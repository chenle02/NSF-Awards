(Public Law 111-5).

The primary goal of the TeachWashington Noyce Teacher Scholarships Program is to
contribute to a larger vision to permanently increase the number of secondary
mathematics and science teachers prepared at Western Washington University
(WWU). The project is recruiting an additional 41 STEM teachers by awarding 20
scholarships to STEM majors in their junior and senior year preparing to become
secondary math or science teachers and providing one-year stipends to 21 STEM
graduates or professionals who are making a career change to become mathematics
or science teachers. Recruitment efforts begin with summer internships for
freshmen and sophomores who intern in summer school programs in supportive and
structured academic settings in two local school districts (Meridian and Mt.
Baker School Districts) assisting students needing science and mathematics
remediation. In addition to recruiting undergraduate STEM majors at WWU and
local community colleges, the project is recruiting STEM professionals from area
industries who are considering a career change. The Noyce Scholars have access
to the resources of the Science, Mathematics and Technology Education program at
WWU and benefit from an infrastructure consisting of teacher-led professional
learning communities established in 28 partner school districts under the North
Cascades and Olympic Science Partnership, a Math and Science Partnership
project.
