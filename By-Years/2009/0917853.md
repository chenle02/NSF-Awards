It has long been recognized that understanding the ecology and evolution of
Avian Influenza Viruses (AIVs) is imperative for predicting and ameliorating the
sporadic catastrophic human influenza pandemics that have occurred periodically
since the late nineteenth century. The aim of this project is to develop a
better understanding of factors that govern transmission and maintain the
diversity of influenza strains that circulate in wild birds. This new knowledge
will help to predict the geographic spread of AIVs and their movement between
species. To achieve this goal, we will (i) develop our theory about
environmental transmission, which occurs when flu particles remain infectious
for long periods of time in contaminated environments, (ii) explore methods for
detecting environmental transmission in epidemiological data, (iii) develop
predictions of environmental durability of new, previously unobserved AIV
subtypes, and (iv) study the effects of host species diversity on AIV
coexistence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work develops new computational methods
that will benefit ecology and epidemiology in general and will enhance
understanding of the emergence of influenza in humans. Additionally, this
research incorporates for the first time key environmental components, providing
a means to identify some potentially important and undescribed properties of AIV
transmission and maintenance.
