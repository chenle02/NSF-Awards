PROPOSAL NO.: 0230542&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Hyman, Scott
David&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION NAME: Sweet Briar College&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: Reform of
the Engineering Program at Sweet Briar
College&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sweet
Briar College (SBC) shares the national concern over the decline&lt;br/&gt;in
students graduating with bachelor's degrees in engineering over the
last&lt;br/&gt;two decades. Moreover, as a women's college, SBC is concerned
with the&lt;br/&gt;ongoing dramatic under representation of women in
undergraduate and graduate&lt;br/&gt;engineering programs and in the engineering
workforce.&lt;br/&gt;In response, SBC is requesting this planning grant in order
to initiate&lt;br/&gt;the reform and upgrade of its engineering curriculum. The
objective of this&lt;br/&gt;project is to develop an extensive engineering
curriculum at SBC, which would&lt;br/&gt;be only the second such program in the
nation at a liberal arts institution&lt;br/&gt;for women.&lt;br/&gt;SBC
currently offers students a dual degree program with a number
of&lt;br/&gt;cooperating institutions. Students follow a pre-engineering
curriculum and&lt;br/&gt;complete a bachelor's degree from SBC and either a
bachelor's, or in one case&lt;br/&gt;a master's, degree in engineering from the
other university. The program&lt;br/&gt;upgrade will be to institute a true
engineering curriculum at SBC: five&lt;br/&gt;courses at the introductory and
intermediate level that will comprise the&lt;br/&gt;core sequence of an
Engineering Science major, which will be supplemented by&lt;br/&gt;research and
internship opportunities. The curriculum will be designed
to&lt;br/&gt;complement the strong liberal arts and study abroad traditions of
SBC and to&lt;br/&gt;allow the students to take full advantage of the proven
nurturing environment&lt;br/&gt;of a women's college.&lt;br/&gt;
