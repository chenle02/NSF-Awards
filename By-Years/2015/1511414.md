1511414(Gharib)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is about understanding the
mechanism by which insects breath. This is a project at the interface of
microfluidics and bio-inspired fluid dynamics that could lead to the development
of pumps for microfluidic networks, like those utilized when one places a
miniature laboratory on a computer chip. Both theory and sophisticated
experiments are proposed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to investigate the
bioflow environment around dragonfly nymphs that live underwater and seem to
breath by generating a propagating wave through their body and by controlling
the flow around their body with motion of their anal valve. The goals are to (1)
elucidate the role of the wave in respiratory flow generation, and (2) study how
the tri-leafleted anal valve controls the exhalatory and inhalatory flow. It is
proposed to simultaneously measure four parameters: the kinematics of the
hindgut chamber wall, the kinematics of the anal valve, and the flow inside and
outside the chamber. Theory will be developed to describe this process, centered
on the movement of internal waves between the tail and the midsection of the
dragonfly. Sophisticated experiments involving Synchrotron X-Ray imaging at
Argonne National Labs to visualize the internal flow in dragonfly larvae will be
performed, while Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) experiments will be conducted
to examine the external flow. The nymph's pump can be viewed as a biological
zero net mass flux (ZNMF) pump and results from the proposed work could lead to
the design of ZNMF pumps with better flow generation and flow control. There are
activities designed to reach out to the UCLA Community School, whose students
are mostly underprivileged, first-generation college students. The PI will
continue the production of research related spots that appear as YouTube videos
reaching out to hundreds of thousands of people.
