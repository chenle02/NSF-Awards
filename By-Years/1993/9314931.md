9314931 Bell The P.I. will continue his program of research in the area of
stellar evolution. Theoretical calculations concerned with stellar atmospheres,
stellar interiors and nucleosynthesis will be made. Observations of stars in
globular star clusters and field stars, including Cepheid variable stars, will
be made for comparison with the calculations. The goals are to improve our
understanding of the properties of stars and how they evolve with time and to
create stellar spectral libraries needed to understand both the stellar
population of our galaxy and the evolution of galaxies. ***
