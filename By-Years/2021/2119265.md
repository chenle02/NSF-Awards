Challenges with classroom behavior management predicts teacher stress and
attrition and support for behavior management is a top professional priority
identified by teachers. Traditional training for teachers in behavior management
(e.g., workshops, whole group in-service training) has failed to produce
substantial improvements in teachersâ€™ work-related knowledge and skills. Virtual
Reality-based training provides an opportunity for teachers to practice
responding positively to disruptive behaviors with the freedom to explore and
fail in a low-stakes setting. However, existing platforms suffer from low
usability and limited realism, particularly when simulating conversational
interactions. This project offers a synergistic exploration of the educational
impact of immersive, conversational learning environments, and the fundamental
technical capabilities for building intelligent virtual agents. Specifically,
the aim of the project is to systematically study the impact of embodied
conversational agents on learning outcomes of teachers in high poverty schools,
where discipline disparities and exclusionary discipline practices are prominent
and positive discipline approaches are needed to promote engagement and
learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project supports the development and release
of a new platform for specifying embodied conversational interaction, combining
recent advances in intelligent virtual agents, generative modeling of
communicative behavior, and human-in-the-loop design. The project outcomes will
push the boundaries of agency and interactivity in virtual reality training
platforms, where teachers can fully immerse themselves in virtual classrooms and
engage with autonomous virtual students capable of expressing themselves using
facial expressions, hand and body gestures, and spoken language. These free-form
interactions are theorized to support transfer of learning from one setting
(e.g., virtual classroom) to a new setting (e.g., live classroom), where
teachers may carry forward applicable knowledge and skills. The research plan
includes a series of studies over a 3-year time period, to systematically study
the impact of agency and interactivity in virtual training platforms on the
training outcomes of teachers, and their ability to transfer knowledge and
skills to real classrooms. This type of training in behavior management provides
an unique opportunity to augment existing support to teachers and foster the
dissemination and implementation of effective training that can ultimately
enhance student achievement and student/teacher well-
being.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
