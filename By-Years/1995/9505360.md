9505360 Hollis This proposal supports a one-year postdoctoral fellowship for Dr.
Kendall Hollis at Nippon Steel Corporation in Futtsu, Japan. Project funding
will enable Dr. Hollis to undertake a collaborative research effort with Dr.
Nobutaka Yurioka of Nippon Steel Corporation. The investigators intend to study
the formation of the coating from molten particles and how the dynamics of the
deposition process determine the micro structure of the resultant coating. As
the application of coatings by plasma spraying can greatly reduce the
fabrication cost or greatly extend the useful life of equipment, it is
anticipated that the technology will continue to receive attention by government
and industrial laboratories for many years to come. As a postdoctoral fellow,
Dr. Hollis will have the opportunity to become familiar with research techniques
and equipment at Nippon Steel Corporation while contributing to the overall
research effort. Therefore, this proposal fulfills the objectives of the Program
in its exchange and transfer of scientific knowledge through an international
collaboration. ***
