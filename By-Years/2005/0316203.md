&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this research involves the use of achiral templates to
impact face selectivity and enhanced reactivity in the catalytic preparation of
beta-amino acids. The project will develop three complementary methods for
enantiocontrol using the concept of chiral relay: chiral relay in achiral
templates, chiral relay in chiral ligands and chiral relay in achiral additives.
In terms of practical value, alpha, beta-disubstituted beta-amino acids will be
prepared and exo selective nitrone and nitrile oxide cycloadditions, Reformatsky
reactions, allylations and pinacol couplings will be studied.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry
Program is supporting the research of Dr. Mukund Sibi of the Department of
Chemistry at North Dakota State University Fargo. Dr. Sibi will focus his work
on developing catalytic methodology for the synthesis of complex beta-amino
acids in enantiomerically pure form. Beta-amino acids are of significance due to
their biological properties and the project will have broader impacts in the
pharmaceutical industry. The project also provides an excellent venue for the
training of undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate students. &lt;br/&gt;
