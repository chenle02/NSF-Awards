Significant changes in two laboratory courses, Experimental Laboratory in
Molecular and Cellular Biology, and Scanning Electron Microscopy, are being
implemented by introducing new laboratory exercises which emphasize problem-
solving using a variety of techniques. In the molecular course, student carry
out projects involving separation and characterization of sub-cellular
components. Students have significant responsibility for the design of the
experiments and are expected to evaluate the advantages and limitations of the
experimental approaches and techniques used. Electrophoresis systems and an
ultracentrifuge provide students with the ability to isolate and analyze
organelles, proteins and DNA. In the scanning electron microscopy course, a
critical point dryer allows students to prepare biological specimens. This
project enhances the opportunities available to young women with the aim of
encouraging them to pursue graduate education and careers in research. The
college will contribute an amount equal to the award.
