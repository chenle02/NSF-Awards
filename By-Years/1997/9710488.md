Barbara McClintock was awarded the Nobel prize for her path breaking research
that showed how genetic material moves easily from one chromosome to another,
even from one organism to another of a very different kind. Such insights are at
the foundation of modern genetics research and technology, and with new
bioengineering techniques exchanges of genetic material may be greatly
accelerated. This biography will demonstrate how McClintock's work on genetic
exchange grew out of her studies of corn genetics, undertaken while she was a
graduate student at Cornell University. Through careful examination of course
outlines, departmental records, evaluations, notebooks and other material, the
book will trace the influence of advisors, colleagues, institutions, and
cultural context on the development of McClintock's science. The book that will
result from this project will make McClintock's work, reputed to be very hard to
understand, available to the thoughtful reader with a minimum of background in
the biological sciences. Readers of the book will include not only professional
historians, philosophers, and sociologists of science, but also undergraduate
students, graduate students, and members of the general public interested in
understanding more about McClintock and her influence on the biological
sciences. ?> &??>¥ º??Á _ÁÁ¥ ??¥© ¢¥/>?/?? ??/?¥??Á¢ ?Â ¢??Á>¥?Â?? ?>????` />?
