The IEEE International Symposium on Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks (DySPAN)
will be held in Aachen, Germany from May 3 to May 6, 2011. This proposal
requests funds to support 10 graduate students in the United States to attend
this conference. Participated students will have the opportunity to present
their work, attend panel and keynote sessions, and interact with hundreds of
other leading researchers in the field. This is an extremely important part of
the graduate school experience. The support provided enables the participation
of students who would otherwise be unable to attend DySPAN 2011. The project
will also promote diversity by encouraging and enabling women and
underrepresented minorities to participate.
