In this project of the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program in the Chemistry
Division, Prof. D.H. Levy of the Chemistry Department of the University of
Chicago will conduct a series of investigations on the photochemistry of
molecules and weakly bound molecular complexes of biochemical interest. Studies
of van der Waals systems involving complexes of amino tetrazine, proton transfer
reactions in organic dimers, and investigations of porphyrin dimers will be
undertaken. The structures of amino acids and peptides in the gaseous phase, the
charge and energy transfer in bi-chromophoric molecules, and laser desorption of
fragile organic molecules will be investigated by spectroscopic techniques. The
underlying goal of this research program is to obtain a better understanding of
the properties of large biomolcules. The relationship between the structure and
function of biomolcules is to be determined through the spectroscopic
investigations of simple amino acids, peptides and other building blocks of the
larger biomolecular complexes. Not only the structures, but also the rate at
which protons can transfer from one molecule to another, as well as the rate at
which electric charge and energy move or are localized within a complex are also
important for this understanding . Special techniques are being developed to
vaporize weakly bound biomolecular complexes without at the same time
dissociating them into their component molecules.
