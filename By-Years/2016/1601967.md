The Texas Algebraic Geometry Symposium (TAGS) will take place April 1-3, 2016 at
the University of Texas at Austin. Algebraic geometry, historically rooted in
the study of solutions to polynomial equations, remains in the twenty-first
century a vibrant subject with both its own deep internal questions as well as
far-reaching interactions with many other parts of science and mathematics. TAGS
is a major annual event in the regional algebraic geometry community, bringing
together experts in different aspects of the subject as well as graduate
students and postdocs just entering it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TAGS 2016 will
accomplish the following scientific aims. First, it will provide graduate
students, postdocs, and other junior researchers opportunities to learn about a
wide range of topics in algebraic geometry from experts known for their
effective communication skills. Second, it will provide a forum for young
researchers to build relationships with, and present their work to, faculty and
peers at other institutions in the region. Finally, it will help build and
maintain a cohesive regional community of researchers involved in different
aspects of algebraic geometry. In addition to fulfilling these scientific goals,
in 2016 TAGS will continue its demonstrated commitment to encouraging the
participation of women, minorities, and members of underrepresented groups in
mathematics. The website for the symposium is
