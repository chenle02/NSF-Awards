The development of Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy has
transformed the investigation and characterization of materials by infrared
spectroscopy. The recent acquisition FTIR instrumentation by the Chemistry
Department at Denison University is providing undergraduate students with
experience in the qualitative and quantitative applications of FTIR at all
levels of the curriculum. The instrument's superior resolution, output
flexibility, and capacity for searching spectral data bases allows students to
work on problems ranging from polymer film analysis by non-science student to
the characterization of novel oxidized porphyrins by senior research students.
