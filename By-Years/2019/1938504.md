The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) project is to offer enhanced accessibility to bring the unbanked
into the banking system by creating a savings product that is a compelling
alternative to lotteries and sweepstakes. More than half the people within the
US are estimated to lack $2,000 in savings for emergencies. The proposed product
could combine the ability to save aggressively, with exposure to the upside of
lottery style winnings that are attractive to many consumers. This prize-linked
stablecoin is enabled by blockchain, which offers efficiencies and transparency
beyond what is available in current lotteries. The commercial impact is
substantial: as of 2019, The Global FinTech blockchain market has been estimated
to reach $34 B by 2026, growing at a CAGR of 74.2%. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
SBIR Phase I project will focus on application of random number generator (RNG)
research and cryptography, as this is the critical link in games of chance. A
lottery system of this scale requires a hack-resistant and collusion-resistant
RNG. In current chance-based systems, the lack of a robust RNG is the weak link
and leaves organizations vulnerable to cyberthreats. This project proposes to
develop and deploy a robust, secure, decentralized and trusted random number
generator. The decentralization and cryptography of blockchain provides the
essential architecture to build our RNG. The resiliency of such a robust and
trusted RNG will have value in deployments beyond blockchain and financial
products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
