The PI plans to study questions in commutative algebra. This is a field that
deals with the study of algebraic varieties, that is, the solution set of a
system of polynomial equations in several variables. For example, the parabola
defined by the equation y=x^2 in the plane is smooth, meaning that locally, at
any point, it looks like a line, while the curve defined by the equation y^2=x^3
is not smooth at the origin (it looks like a cusp near the origin). The singular
or non-smooth points of an algebraic variety have very rich algebraic and
geometric structures, and investigating their properties has many applications
in other sciences and engineering. The projects that will be explored are the
study of singular points of algebraic varieties (i.e., singularities), with a
focus on measuring the singularities (e.g., assigning some invariant to compare
them with each other) using the theory multiplier/test ideals and
multiplicities.

The PI plans to develop a mixed characteristic singularity theory that is
parallel to singularities in the minimal model program and tight closure theory
from equal characteristic. This is motivated by the recent breakthrough of Yves
Andre that solved Hochster's long-standing direct summand conjecture and the
existence of big Cohen-Macaulay algebras. Together with Karl Schwede, the PI
utilizes Andre`'s techniques from perfectoid algebras and spaces to start
building such a theory, introducing a perfectoid version of multiplier/test
ideals. There will be applications on the study of symbolic powers in mixed
characteristic, as well as the study of family of singularities when the
characteristic varies. Another research direction is the Hilbert-Samuel
multiplicities attached to singularities, with a focus on Lech's conjecture,
Lech's inequality, and the Stuckrad--Vogel invariant. The PI has settled the
dimension three equal characteristic case of the longstanding Lech's conjecture,
and has recently settled the Stuckrad--Vogel conjecture (together with Klein,
Pham, Smirnov and Yao). The proposed projects include attacking the higher
dimensional case of Lech's conjecture by studying and improving the classical
Lech's inequality. A related project is to investigate the relationship between
multiplicity and colength for sufficiently deep ideals.
