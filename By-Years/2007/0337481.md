This project involves experimental investigations of chemical phenomena
occurring at high pressures and temperatures in the Earth's crust and upper
mantle. Specifically, the experiments are designed to shed light on the
mechanisms and pathways by which low-abundance chemical elements and their
isotopes move around in the Earth. Three specific sub-topics are being examined:
1) the effect of isotopic mass on the migration rates of atoms or molecules in
molten rock (emphasizing the gas-forming elements S, C, H, O, and Cl); 2) the
solubilities and migration rates of noble gases (He, Ne, Xe) in key minerals of
the Earth's crust and upper mantle; and 3) the migration rates and storage of
rare metallic elements (Pt, Au, Pd, W) in the boundaries between mineral grains
of the Earth's mantle. The intellectual merit of these studies resides mainly in
their addressing fundamental properties of Earth materials that serve as a basis
for understanding the chemical evolution of our planet and its subsystems (core,
mantle, crust and atmosphere). The mass effect on volatile-element mobility, for
example, may lead to heretofore-unanticipated isotopic differences between
volcanic emanations and their "parent" magmas. The behavior of noble gases in
deep-seated minerals has a direct bearing on gas storage in the Earth and the
evolution of the atmosphere. The presence and mobility of rare-metal atoms in
grain boundaries could influence models of core-mantle separation and continued
chemical "communication" between core and mantle over geologic time. Beyond the
purely scientific merits, the broader impacts of this project lie in the
education and training of graduate students in the design, execution and
interpretation of experiments in high pressure-temperature materials science.
The diverse skills gained in this endeavor are equally relevant to man-made
materials as to those of the Earth, and the techniques developed are
transferable to any field or application where the technology of high pressures
and temperatures is important for materials synthesis or processing.
