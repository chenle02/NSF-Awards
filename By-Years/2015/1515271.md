Habitual bipedal locomotion distinguishes the human lineage from that of all
other primates. How the head and neck responded to this radical change in mode
of locomotion remains understudied. The neck functions in two critical ways: it
stabilizes and mobilizes the head. This study will attempt to understand how the
shape of bones composing the neck (i.e. cervical vertebrae) is adapted to these
functions. This research will be conducted in collaboration with Drs. Hiroo
Kumakura and Ryosuke Goto at the University of Osaka, who possess the unique
combination of equipment, expertise, and access to live primates to be ideal
mentors on this research. Elucidating the relationship between vertebral form
and neck function will facilitate understanding the postural behavior of fossil
species. More broadly, results of this study can be used to evaluate the
appropriateness of using non-human primates as proxies for humans in spinal
injury research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A gibbon (Hylobates lar) will be filmed
during habitual locomotion with head and neck movement evaluated using motion
analysis software. Mobility will be measured using radiographs of its maximum
range of head-neck movement. These functional measures of posture and mobility
will be related to specific aspects of cervical vertebral form. Form-function
relationships established here will be used to understand the adaptations of the
primate cervical spine as well as retrodict the behaviors of fossil specimens
based on preserved morphology. This project will further the understanding of
the functional morphology of the cervical spine, its relationship to locomotor
diversification within the hominoid clade, and the mosaic evolution of hominin
bipedal locomotion. The NSF EAPSI award supports the research of a U.S. graduate
student and is funded in collaboration with the Japanese Society for the
Promotion of Science.
