May 3, 2012 commemorates the third anniversary of the environmental flood
disaster in Eagle, Alaska, and Eagle Village, Alaska. This RAPID project aims to
systematically examine social factors that may affect post-disaster resilience
and recovery and seeks to identify characteristics that optimize the adaptive
capacities of persons facing disaster that may be mitigated or exacerbated by
class, race, and gender effects. The PI presents the argument that vulnerability
to environmental change is affected by numerous social factors - age, race,
ethnicity, socio and economic class, number of children, occupation, etc and
that each of these factors are affected by gender. Thus without a full
understanding of how women and men experience and view their vulnerabilities the
ability to promote resilience is limited. This research is proposed under the
RAPID funding mechanism because time is passing and peoples' memories about the
flood are fading and changing, thus time is of the essence.
