Huntington&lt;br/&gt;0218580&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Arctic Climate Impact
Assessment (ACIA) is an international project to assess the likely impacts of
climate change on the physical, biological, and human systems of the Arctic.
This workshop provides an opportunity for international collaboration in
assessing the impacts on human systems. The workshop, called "Snowchange," will
bring together researchers and indigenous persons from Russia, Canada, and the
Nordic countries to discuss climate change, its causes, and its significance for
Arctic residents. The workshop will identify Russian case studies for the ACIA
with regard to indigenous perspectives on climate change.
