This study seeks to understand how variations in climatic conditions alter the
reproductive cycles in three populations of white-crowned sparrows living in
diverse habitats within a relatively small area of western Washington state. The
research will integrate field and laboratory studies on reproductive function.
Comparisons between populations will be made of behavior and reproductive state
in the springtime and experimental manipulations of environmental cues suspected
of signaling environmental change will be performed. The long range goal of the
project is to determine the extent and function of pathways in the brain of
these animals for environmental signals that regulate changes in appearance and
behavior. Such information is critical to understand, in general, how animals
react to their habitat to aid us in the future in solving problems associated
with global warming and habitat destruction. Understanding the mechanisms by
which vertebrates transform environmental information into morphological,
physiological and behavioral adjustments may help us evaluate the extent to
which species are able to adapt and how we may fare in a changing environment.
