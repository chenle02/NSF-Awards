Research will be carried out on three topics: stochastic spatial models,
processes taking place on random graphs, and questions related to the evolution
of biological systems. Three of the proposed questions in the first topic
concern "When can species coexist", while a fourth concerns the possibility that
the quadratic contact process in two dimensions can have two phase transitions
one for the existence of stationary distributions and a larger one for survival
from a finite set. In the second topic one interesting mathematical problem
concerns "explosive percolation" conjectured to have a discontinuous transition,
while the more biologically important question concerns how the outcomes of
epidemics and ecological competitions change when they take place on random
graphs, which arguably provide better models of the real social networks. The
third topic concern situations in which the characteristics of individuals in
ecological competitions are also not static but evolve in response to their
environment. My first steps in the area "adaptive dynamics" were taken in a
study of predator-prey systems with John Mayberry. Here, we propose to study
more complex examples that lead to evolutionary cycling and a second problem on
the evolution of virulence, which leads to consideration of the role of spatial
structure in increasing the virulence of diseases.

Many interesting mathematical questions arise from biology. Here we address some
questions that arise from ecology and evolution. Three examples should
illustrate the nature of our work. (1) At the turn of the century, observations
of social networks revealed that we live in a small world in which everyone on
the planet is separated by six degrees of separation. Now we need to understand
how this geometry of social networks effects the spread of epidemics and the
other biological and social processes. (2) The world shows much more
biodiversity than mathematical models predict, so it is important to understand
the mechanisms which allow for species coexistence. More generally, we will also
be interested in how spatial structure changes the outcome of ecological
competition. (3) In most situations the characteristics of individuals involved
in competition with other species or with infectious agents are not static but
evolve in time. For example, in most cases diseases evolve to be less virulent,
but in a spatially structured population the opposite may occur. Co-evolution of
hosts and parasites can lead to interesting evolutionary cycling, sometimes
called ?Red Queen Dynamics after the character in Alice in Wonderland who has to
keep running to stay in the same place.
