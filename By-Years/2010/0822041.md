While a number of studies have shown that the early social environment can have
a significant effect on the subsequent expression of social behavior, these
studies have either failed to examine the effects of early social experience on
control mechanisms, (changes in the brain), or have been conducted in relatively
asocial species. The aim of this project is to use the highly social bi-parental
prairie vole (Microtus ochragaster) to study the effect of early social
environment on the organization of the brain, specifically effects on
neuropeptides, steroids and their receptors, in regulating the ultimate
expression of social behavior. This study takes advantage of significant
population differences in the expression of social behavior, with prairie voles
from Kansas (KN) expressing significantly lower levels of prosocial behavior and
higher levels of aggression than voles from Illinois (IL). These differences are
also associated with differential expression of the central mechanisms. The
research will examine the effect of parent of origin and the presence of the
father on the expression of social behavior and mechanisms that regulate the
expression of behavior. The heritability of the mechanisms controlling social
behavior will also be determined. The expression of social behavior will be
directly related to the degree of social interaction during the neonatal period.
These changes will be associated with specific changes with the central nervous
system, such as an increase in the presence of estrogen receptors in less social
males. This study will provide critical understanding of how early experiences
act to mold the ultimate expression of behavior. Broader Impacts include
significant educational opportunities for undergraduate participation in
research, with an emphasis on minority inclusion through the McNair program and
interdisciplinary studies with Sociology.
