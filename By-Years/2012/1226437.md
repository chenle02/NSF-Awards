Abstract

Value Systems in Comparative Perspective

We have long sought to understand the relationship between governments and their
constituents. However, because most studies have focused on Western democracies,
we have a limited understanding of how public opinion trends resonate with, and
potentially shape, government actions in countries of strategic importance to
the U.S. It is not clear whether we can generalize across different political
systems, in particular given contemporary political conditions outside of
Europe, which continue to change rapidly, and often violently. This project will
conduct nationally representative public opinion surveys about social and
economic inequality and the proper role of government in two Central Asian
countries. Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan were chosen as comparative case studies,
because they are of strategic importance to U.S. policy, and because their
multi-ethnic, largely Muslim population makes them representative of other
countries in the region. In addition to gauging current popular opinion
regarding a range of economic and social policies, this study seeks to discern
changes in public attitudes and expectations over time, especially in the wake
of the global financial crisis.

Broader Impacts Research shows that long-term political stability is associated
with both autocratic regimes (whose survival is less reliant on fair elections)
and with governments that maintain legitimacy by implementing redistributive
policies in a range of policy arenas. Findings from this study have the
potential to make an important contribution to our understanding of how formerly
autocratic states can move successfully towards democratization. In addition,
findings from this study may inform our understanding of how the recent
financial crisis has affected public sentiments in authoritarian societies more
broadly.
