Computer Science (31) This project, jointly funded by the Directorate for
Education and Human Resources and by the Directorate for Computer and
Information Science and Engineering, supports ten faculty members to attend the
International Computing Education Research (ICER) conference in Sydney,
Australia, in 2008. This is critical as it is allowing people to attend ICER who
are doing computing education research but do not have funding for that research
or for travel. In addition to the conference's role in helping to support the
growth of the computer science education research community, the conference is
providing a dissemination medium for recent awardees from the new NSF CISE
Pathways to Revitalized Undergraduate Education (CPATH) program to present the
results of their projects.
