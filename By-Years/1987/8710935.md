The Cretaceous Long Normal Polarity Chron (83-119 Ma) represents a 35 million
year 'blind' spot in Pacific basin plate motion models based on marine magnetic
anomalies. To constrain the evolution of the Pacific basin. This study will be a
detailed paleomagnetic and paleontologic analysis of Cretaceous limestones from
ten Pacific DSDP oceanic rise sites. The study differs in a fundamental way from
much of the previous Pacific paleomagnetic DSDP studies. Rather than studying
basalts and producing a paleolatitude value for a given site at only a single
age, the emphasis is on DSDP limestones which would yield several Paleolatitude
values corresponding to a range of geologicages during which the limestone was
deposited. A key feature of this collaborative research is the development and
use of a high-resolution biostratigraphic zonation for planktonic foraminifera
studied in thin sections. As a result, the Cretaceous limestones can be dated
with increased precision and can be correlated with key biostratigraphic
sections previously dated by foraminifera in this section. Using automated
facilities of the Stanford Paleomagnetic Laboratory and improved measurement
techniques, it will be possible to obtain very rapidly paleolatitude information
from various DSDP sites. The results will help to interpret in detail the plate
motions in the Pacific during the Cretaceous Long Normal Polarity Event.
