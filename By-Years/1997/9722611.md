This work will continue experiments to measure the electric dipole moment of the
cesium atom, and from that the electric dipole moment (edm) of the electron, as
a test of time- reversal symmetry. These experiments, relying on a newly-
developed dual magnetometer, should improve the precision of the existing edm
measurement in cesium by two orders of magnitude. This would give a resulting
sensitivity to an electron edm of 10-28e-cm. If this is achieved, this new
measurement would constitute the most stringent limit on an electron edm and
would significantly constrain particle physics beyond the standard model.
