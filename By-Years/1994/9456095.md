9566095 Keynes The University of Minnesota proposes to develop a new model for
planning curriculum and instructing its science and engineering calculus
students which will fundamentally change calculus instruction and subsequent
course work at the University. This model will allow incorporation of nearly all
of the key aspects of a successful calculus reform effort, as well as enabling
significant opportunities for inclusion of interdisciplinary materials. The new
structure will attempt to reconfigure the large lecture/recitation format in
many public research universities in a cost-effective way to allow increased
personal interaction between faculty and students and encourage more student
centered pedagogy and the use of varying technology as the curriculum
progresses. This curriculum will become the standard format for engineering and
science calculus instruction at Minnesota, and will be developed as a model
program for other public research institutions.
