The objective of this project is to determine conditions that will inhibit
sulfate reduction to hydrogen sulfide in bioreactors used to anaerobically
digest sludges derived from treatment of wastewater. Experiments will be
conducted in batch cultures to determine the effectiveness of inhibitors, the
importance of inhibitor/antagonist rations, and their mechanism of action. Modes
of inhibitor addition will be studied in attached-film digesters both during
start-up and with established biofilms. Attached-film studies to determine the
effect of feed strength, organic loading, and diffusion limitation on the
competitiveness of the sulfate-reducing bacteria are planned. Anaerobic reactors
are widely used for stabilization of organic matter in wastewater treatment
plants. this project is likely to provide guidance to engineering designers for
process improvement that will reduce or eliminate problems resulting from
production of hydrogen sulfide during operation of this process.
