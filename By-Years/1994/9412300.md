9412300 Vortex excitations play an important role in determining the
thermodynamical properties of quasi-two dimensional magnetic crystals. The
proposed research will study the fundamental dynamical properties of the
vortices such as their mass and life time using numerical simulations. The
dependence of vortex properties on the nature and strength of the spin space
anisotropy will be explored in detail. These studies are relevant in various
experiments to confirm the existence of vortices. %%% Quasi-two dimensional
magnetic materials are of great theoretical and experimental interest in recent
years. It is believed that major excitations of the systems are vortices with
very unusual properties. This research will focus on studying vortex dynamics.
The study will be useful in confirming the existence of vortices.
