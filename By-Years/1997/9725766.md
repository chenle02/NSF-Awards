9725766 Wernicke It is unclear if intracontinental plate boundaries, usually
expressed as wide zones of diffuse deformation, behave as a system of
microplates, or as a continuum. The Great Basin is a prime example of an area
that behaves in this way. To determine if the observed strain pattern of today
reflects a microplate trend, an 18 station GPS network has been established and
has been operating for one year. This award provides an additional three years
of funding to complete a total of four years of monitoring the network. After
such time, the rate uncertainties will be sufficient to distinguish between
microplate and continuum behavior. The basic scientific question to be solved
will be a better understanding of intracontinental plate boundaries. This
understanding is a fundamental concept to add to our knowledge of plate
tectonics. In addition, the seismic hazard of such areas may be further
quantified. To such an end, it is important to know if intraplate strain is
localized within seismic belts, or if seismicity migrates secularly across a
wide zone of relatively uniform strain accumulation. To solve this question, the
Principal Investigator is using a series of GPS stations to compute yearly
displacement in mm/yr and its distribution. From this, stress and strain can be
calculated and the stress field examined to answer these questions. ***
