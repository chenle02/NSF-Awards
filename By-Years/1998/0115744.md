This project involves conducting a field measurements program near Cherski,
Siberia to quantify the impacts of disturbance on the seasonal cycle of
atmospheric carbon dioxide and the discharge of carbon and nitrogen into the
Arctic Ocean in forest and shrubby tundra regions. Coastal plain tundra in the
region has accumulated large stores of carbon in sediments during the
Pleistocene that has been slowly released to the atmosphere and ocean through
melting of previously frozen soils during the Holocene. Disturbance,
particularly forest fires, of the vegetation exposes the soils to accelerated
carbon loss through more direct exposure to erosion. The study will compare an
undisturbed region to recently disturbed areas and determine the effects of
changes in temperature and hydrology on the rate of carbon flux. The results
will be utilized in models to examine possible future disturbance effects,
particularly those that could be accelerated by warmer climate conditions.
