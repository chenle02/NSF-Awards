This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project proposes to develop
novel biomaterial-based microparticles called Sphericules. These microparticles
are self-contained micrometer-scale reactors capable of performing genetic
analysis without expensive instruments. The new composite beads, with
temperature stability, solvent resistance, controlled buoyancy and other
properties, will find applications in many diverse markets. The Sphericule
methodology combines layers of natural and synthetic polymers, metals, ceramics
and other chemicals to produce new composite beads, fibers and coatings. In
contrast, multifunctional latex beads using a surface coating of antibody on a
micron sized fluorescent particle are labor intensive to produce. Particle batch
processing results in aggregation, uneven surface treatment, and loss of signal
molecules. This Phase I project proposes a novel method for synthesizing uniform
particles using micro-scale systems in a continuous process. In this process,
the chemistries of bead formation, optical reagent incorporation and surface
modifications are expected to be straightforward, stoichiometric and
predictable.

The commercial applications of this project are in the areas of
biomedicalresearch, diagnostics, electronics, and defense.
