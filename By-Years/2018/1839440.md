The meeting `Advances in Asymptotic Probability' will take place in Stanford
University, on December 13-17, 2018.&lt;br/&gt;It is expected to gather about 25
talks given by some of the world leaders in probability theory and stochastic
processes, and more than&lt;br/&gt;one hundred participants. The workshop will
focus on asymptotic properties of large random
structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within probability theory and statistical
physics one common goal is to understand behavior at macroscopic (and
mesoscopic) scales in systems governed by relatively simple local interactions.
In recent years there have been numerous significant developments on questions
relating to this general theme. Topics represented at the conference will
include: integrable probability, interacting particle systems, stochastic
partial differential equations; conformal probability, random planar maps; spin
glasses, random matrices, Markov chains, random graphs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A
