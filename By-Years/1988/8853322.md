This project strengthens students' understanding of the fundamental principles
of water resources engineering through the use of a new laboratory. The
laboratory concentrates on water quantity rather than quality, giving students a
physical understanding of the conservation of mass, momentum and energy
principles. The equipment supporting this project includes: hydraulics bench,
pressure gage, orifices, open channel flume, pipe networks, soil permeability
meter and accessories. This award is being matched by an equal sum from the
grantee.
