The U.S.-Japan Panel on Wind and Seismic Effects was established in 1968. Annual
meetings alternate between Japan and the U.S. The Panel develops technologies
that advance engineering design and construction practices. The Panel is
composed of 17 Federal agencies who participate in task committees. The task
committees focus on specific national issues, e.g., earthquake hazard reduction,
buried pipelines, transportation and telecommunication systems, and repair and
retrofit of structures. The results of the task committee workshops and
conferences are shared at the annual joint meeting and usually published as
proceedings.
