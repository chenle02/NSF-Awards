The University of North Texas proposes to establish an Industry/University
Cooperative Research Center for Materials Characterization. The industrial base
for this center is primarily within the aerospace, electronics, and petro
chemical industries. The Dallas/Ft Worth area is major high technology region in
Texas, the third largest and fastest growing in the nation. The center proposes
to perform fundamental and applied research to characterize and/or modify the
nanostructure of materials at the atomic level. The center personnel will
collaborate with aerospace, electronic, energy transportation and metallurgical
industries to study the relationship between nanostructure and mechanical
properties such as field strength, deformation kinetics, creep and fatigue. It
will also study contamination and diffusion at the surfaces of electronic,
metallurgical and polymeric materials to understand adhesion, corrosion, and
electrical properties.
