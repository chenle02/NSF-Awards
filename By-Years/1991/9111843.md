This is an international travel grant to support the Principal Investigator's
visit to the 23rd UJNR Joint Meeting in Japan in May 1991, where he has been
invited to participate in one seminar arranged by NOel Raufaste, NIST, and other
meetings. While in Japan Prof. Mahin will join the UJNR Panel in visits to Gifo,
Nagoya and other Japanese cities. The proposed activities will enable Prof.
Mahin to: (a) by invitation make a technical presentation on the 1989 Loma
Prieta Earthquake, (b) exchange information on earthquake engineering, and (c)
be cognizant of current research efforts being undertaken in various research
institutes and organized research units in Japan. This effort will develop
research cooperation between U.S. and Japan as part of UJNR Panel activities in
the areas of advanced technologies involving design, composite materials and
computer engineering in connection with natural hazards.
