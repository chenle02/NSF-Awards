0456077&lt;br/&gt;Dickson&lt;br/&gt;This award to University of Rhode Island's
Graduate School of Oceanography provides instrumentation to improve the
oceanographic research capabilities of the research vessel Endeavor, an NSF-
owned ship operated by URI as part of the University-National Oceanographic
Laboratory System research fleet. The salinometers, liquid scintillation
counter, expendable bathythermograph data acquisition system, 12-position CTD
frame, nets and storage bags for MOCNESS sampler and components for the towed,
undulating vehicle will replace aging systems with modern ones, maintaining
state of the art capability for researchers using the ship. These improvements
will be of substantial advantage to marine scientists using R/V Endeavor and
other vessels in their research during 2005 and future years.&lt;br/&gt;
