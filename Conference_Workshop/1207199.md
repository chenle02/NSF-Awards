A workshop on elliptic curves over a real quadratic extension of the rational
numbers will take place April 27-29, 2012 at the University of Illinois at
Chicago. The organizers of this workshop are William Stein (University of
Washington at Seattle) and Ramin Takloo-Bighash (University of Illinois at
Chicago). The invited speakers are Jennifer Balakrishnan (Harvard), Jonathan
Bober (University of Washington at Seattle), John Cremona (Warwick), Lassina
Dembele (Warwick), Noam Elkies (Harvard), Edray Goins (Purdue), Matthew
Greenberg (Calgary), Richard Pinch, Kenneth Ribet (UC Berkeley), William Stein
(UW Seattle), Nike Vatsal (UBC), and John Voight (University of Vermont). This
is part of the annual Oliver Atkin Memorial Lecture and Workshop at UIC. The
theme of the workshop is the theoretical and computational aspects of elliptic
curves over totally real fields, Hilbert modular forms, and the arithmetic of
elliptic curves in general. The website of the workshop is

Elliptic curves are of fundamental interest in number theory. The theory of
these objects over the field of rational numbers is starting to look like a
coherent theory, but as soon as one steps away from rational numbers our
understanding of these objects becomes extremely patchy. This workshop focuses
on the theory of elliptic curves on a very simple field different from the field
of rational numbers. We hope that bringing together experts working in the area
would create an environment in which to exchange ideas and to start new projects
which will hopefully lead to a better understanding of these fundamental
objects.
