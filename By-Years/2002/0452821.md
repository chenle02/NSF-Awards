The AEA Summer Training Program is an intensive nine-week program hosted by Duke
University in affiliation with North Carolina A&amp;T State University.
Intellectual Merit: It strengthens analytical and technical skills, while
showing students that these skills are useful, and that economics can be
relevant and exciting. Students receive the requisite analytical and computer
skills for data analysis in four interrelated courses taught at Foundations and
Advanced levels. This research experience is structured to facilitate completion
during the summer by Advanced participants, while Foundations students are
expected to complete an initial version of the project, and then will refine it
during the following academic year. A variety of data sets are maintained for
Summer Program students. Weekly seminars by outside speakers, along with the
annual Pipeline Conference of leading minority economists and advanced graduate
students, familiarize students with policy issues and career options. Broader
Impacts: The Training Program is combined with a Scholarship Program that
recruits, selects, and funds Minority (Black, Hispanic, Native American, and
certain Asian-American) participants who are U.S. citizens. While the primary
objective of the AEA Training Program is to increase the number of
underrepresented and historically disadvantaged minorities in the economic
profession, the Program is open to and includes some non-minority participants.
The class of 2004 is the largest in the AEA Summer Program's 31-year history,
with 36 students from 26 universities in 13 states, plus Puerto Rico. The class
included 22 women and 14 men, of whom 16 attended Minority Serving Institutions.
The 2004 class also included 20 African-Americans, 13 Hispanics, two Vietnamese-
Americans, and one Filipino-American. Of the 103 participants during 2001-04, 41
students have entered Ph.D. programs or will do so; 25 have entered (or will do
so) MA programs. Ultimately, about two-thirds of Training Program participants
enter doctoral programs in Economics or a related field.
