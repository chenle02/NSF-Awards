This award will support collaboration between the University of Utah Department
of Chemistry (David Grant and Anita Orendt) and the Utah Supercomputing
Institute (Julio Facelli), and the University of Buenos Aires Department of
Organic Chemistry (Alicia Pomilio) and Department of Physics (Ruben Contreras).
The aim of the project is to better understand the electronic structure of
flavonoids and related compounds, using 17O NMR and quantum mechanical methods.
Flavonoids are natural products of plants native to Argentina, known for their
therapeutic effects. It is expected that research results from this project will
lead to a rational understanding of the relevant structure-activity
relationships of flavonoids and potentially to the discovery of new drugs. The
isolation and synthesis of flavonoids and the confor- mational analysis and NMR
parameters of these compounds will be done in Buenos Aires. The 0-17 NMR
chemical shielding measurements and ab initio calculations of chemical shielding
as a function of conformation will be done in Utah. The synthesis of 0-17
labeled flavonoids in Buenos Aires will make the solid state 0-17 NMR studies
feasible.
