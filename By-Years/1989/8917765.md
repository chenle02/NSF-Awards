Dr. Blandford is one of the nations leading theoretical astro- physicists, and
has been granted support in a project for theo- retical investigations of three
areas: cosmology, neutron stars, and stellar outflows. The cosmological study
will utilize the multiple images of distant quasars and galaxies formed by the
gravitational lens effects of intervening galaxies and clusters of galaxies as
probes of the size and matter content of the universe. The neutron star
investigations will explore the possibility that gamma-ray bursters are caused
by an instability or nuclear explosion deep below the surface of a neutron star.
Protostars, cataclysmic variables and X-ray binaries occasionally exhibit
evidence for collimated outflow which may be driven hydromagnetically. This
possibility will be examined in detail, with particular emphasis on determining
the observational signa- tures peculiar to these different environments.
