9311024 Jonakait It has become increasingly clear over the past few years that
molecules originally identified as having effects on the growth and development
of cells in the immune system play similar roles in the nervous system. For
example, interferon-g (IFN-g), first described for its anti-viral activity in
the immune system, has now been shown to affect the development of a population
of acetylcholine-containing nerve cells in the brain. These nerve cells are of
particular interest since they subserve functions of learning and memory. In
preliminary studies, IFN has been shown to promote the production of
acetylcholine in cultures of these nerve cells. This project will determine
whether IFN-g exerts its effect on the survival or the development of these
cells, whether IFN-g acts directly on the nerve cells or through another cell
type, whether IFN-g is normally present in developing brain, and whether it is
normally required for acetylcholine-nerve cell development or survival. These
experiments will increase our understanding of factors that control normal
growth and development of the nervous system. *** having eff ! ! F u u ( Times
