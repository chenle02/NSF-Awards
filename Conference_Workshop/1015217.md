This workshop is, in part, a meeting of the Principal Investigators that have
been funded by the Joint DMS/NIGMS Initiative to Support Research in the Area of
Mathematical Biology. However, it also includes researchers who have not been
supported by the program, but whose interests lie at the interface between the
biological and mathematical sciences. The purpose of the meeting is to promote
collaborations between the biology and mathematics communities, facilitating the
advance of biological and biomedical research. Specific aims are to provide a
forum for PIs to share experiences, exchange ideas, and explore new
collaborations; to inform NSF and NIH program officials of opportunities and
challenges in promoting scientific advances at the interface between biological
and mathematical sciences, and establishing and sustaining successful
collaborations between biologists and mathematicians/statisticians; and to
identify "big" problems in biology that require innovative mathematical
approaches. The workshop includes speakers covering a wide range of biological
and mathematical research, as well as poster presentations, and will be held at
the University of Maryland on April 26-27, 2010.
