SSC-9450337 Rutgers U. New Brunswick Camden, NJ Jackson, Lambert, Leland Butler
and Jesse Whitlow "PACE III Summer Science Camp" PACE III: Science in the city
will be conducted in four one-week phases, three of which will each focus on the
study of one scientific discipline. An umbrella social science course will help
focus students on the relevance of the studies to them and their lives. The
primary purpose of the project will be to promote and generate scientific
interest in forty-five (45) ninth grade students from the city of Camden. The
camp will build on the PACE I and II Programs for one-third of the students and
will serve as an introductory science program to new participants. It will
provide practical exposure and hands on experience to scientific disciplines
through the study of existing facilities that provide urban services.
Experiments and lectures will be conducted around how these operations work and
their importance to urban development. An integral part of the Camp will be two
related components that will build on survival skills; the first will be group
counseling sessions and the second, which will involve parents, will focus on
building family strategies for success.
