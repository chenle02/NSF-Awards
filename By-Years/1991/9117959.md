The Piedmont of the Southern Appalachians has been shown to involve major
overthrusts of crystalline rocks, possibly due to crustal delamination, but have
also been shown to have evidence for major extensional features of the Piedmont
in the southern Appalachians is therefore controversial, with competing models
having the same terranes both autochthonous with respect to North America and
exotic, and having major boundary faults extensional in one model, compressional
in another with strike-slip motion in a third. This collaborative, field-based
project centers on establishing the history of the more important terranes and
their bounding faults. The work involves mapping, petrology and age dating
within the Belair, Savannah River and Carolina terranes near Macon, Georgia, and
on the Modoc fault which separates the Carolina and Savannah River terranes.
Results are expected to resolve points of major disagreement among current
tectonic models and provide a further means of testing the fundamentally
important hypothesis that crustal delamination occurred at the onset of the late
Paleozoic Alleghanian orogeny.
