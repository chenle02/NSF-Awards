A detailed study of intra and intermolecular interactions in a more complicated
structures -- DNA, polypetides and small proteins, complex natural products,
polymetallic species and enzyme mimics requires less routine 1D NMR experiments,
pulse sequences for various 2D NMR experiments, solvent suppression, and
variable temperature experiments. Multinuclear high field NMRs are ideally
suited for use in these more complicated structures. The results from these NMR
studies are useful in areas such as polymers and catalysis. This award from the
Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program will help the Department of Chemistry
at M.I.T. acquire two high field mulitnuclear NMRs. The 300 and 500 MHz NMR
spectrometers will be used for multinuclear research investigations in the
following areas of chemistry: 1. Enzyme mechanisms 2. Protein conformation 3.
Bioinorganic chemistry 4. Synthesis of polypeptides and proteins 5. Synthetic
methods and molecular design of catalsts The spectrometers will be used
primarily for 2D NMR and multinuclear NMR spectroscopy.
