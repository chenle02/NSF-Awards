This Americas Program award will support a workshop, organized by Dr. Kirk
Winemiller, Texas A&amp;M University, Antonio Machado-Allison, Universidad
Central de Venezuela and Donald C. Taphorn, Universidad Experimental de Los
LLanos Ezequiel Zamora, in Venezuela, to discuss recent progress and future
directions in fish ecology in Latin America. The workshop will identify priority
areas in fisheries management and conservation of aquatic natural resources;
evaluate existing methodologies in fish ecological research; and explore new
means of transferring technology and expertise between institutions. This
workshop will promote international collaboration, especially in the neotropics.
It will address the need for surveys of biological diversity and international
fisheries management, and for improved data bases for dealing with increasingly
stressed natural resources.
