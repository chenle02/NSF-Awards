ABSTRACT

Principal Investigator: Braun, Benjamin J. Proposal Number: DMS - 0758321
Institution: University of Kentucky Research Foundation Title: Topological and
Algebraic Combinatorics

The PI investigates problems in topological and algebraic combinatorics. The
theory of Ehrhart polynomials is of broad interest to the mathematics community
due to connections with commutative algebra, algebraic geometry, combinatorics,
discrete and convex geometry, and number theory. The PI studies roots and
coefficients of Ehrhart polynomials, with particular focus on reflexive
polytopes. The PI also investigates problems regarding graph and poset
homomorphism complexes, continuing the application of algebraic topology to
combinatorics. The PI studies possible homotopy test graphs and investigates
connections between poset homomorphism complexes and poset order dimension.
Finally, in joint work with Richard Ehrenborg, the PI studies simplicial
subcomplexes of the boundary complexes of associahedra arising from
triangulations of non-convex polygons.

Mathematics has historically been driven by the interplay between discrete and
continuous structures. Contemporary problems arising from the interaction of
combinatorics, algebra, and topology continue this tradition. The study of
polytopes began in antiquity, with roots in the solid geometry of Euclid.
Ehrhart theory is a contemporary approach to studying polytopes from a
combinatorial and algbraic perspective, producing from a polytope with integer
vertices a polynomial counting lattice points in integral dilates of that
polytope. The roots and coefficients of these polynomials are known to carry
some combinatorial and geometric data, but there are many open questions about
exactly how far this line of investigation can be taken. The study of graphs
began in the 1700's with investigations by Euler, and has found modern day
applications in most areas of science and engineering. Studying chromatic
numbers of graphs by moving to the continuous world leads to investigations of
topological spaces with symmetries arising from symmetries of the graphs under
consideration. Investigations in this direction have been successful so far, and
many open questions remain.
