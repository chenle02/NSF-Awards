9451386 Norgard New undergraduate electromagnetic (EM) laboratory experiments
are developed to improve student understanding of the basic principles of
radiation, propagation and coupling taught in a new course on electromagnetic
interference (EMI) and electromagnetic compatibility (EMC). Students actively
participate in experiments conducted in a large, broadband anechoic chamber with
automated, computer-controlled equipment. These experiments graphically
illustrate EMI effects and EMC measurement techniques. Industry participation is
a significant aspect of this project.
