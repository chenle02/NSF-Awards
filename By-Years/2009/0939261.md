This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) in Engineering program
entitled, "NUE: Integration of Nanotechnology into the ME curriculum via Energy
Efficient Systems and Dynamic Structures",at the University of Nevada, Reno
(UNR), under the direction of Dr. Kam K. Leang, aims to prepare 21st century
mechanical engineers at UNR to meet the emerging challenges of nanotechnology
using a new top-down 'learner-centered' pedagogical approach where the first
important step is to excite them about the technology. Practical, easy-to-
relate-to macro-scale applications such as aerospace structures, wind-energy
turbine blades, and snow skis will be introduced into sophomore and junior-level
courses, the technical engineering challenges and need for improving
functionality of these applications will be presented and then linked to
solutions offered by nanotechnology. To further reinforce the concepts, a suite
of capstone-level design projects which includes nanocomposite-based wind-energy
turbine blades and snow skis will be developed for students entering their
senior year of study after being introduced to these applications in previous
years.
