This research project addresses the problem of grasp planning and object
manipulation. An innovative technique for effectively calculating the finger
forces to be applied to the grasped object is developed. The CAD model of a
dexterous robotic hand, task specification, and a contact model (e.g., soft
finger contact with friction), are used to yield a stable grasp suitable for the
task. If the desired grasp cannot be achieved in the initial phase, for example
due to presence of nearby obstacles, the system autonomously plans and executes
dexterous manipulation actions to gain the desired grasp. The results of this
research will solve the inherently complex grasp problem in a computational
efficient and physically meaningful manner.*** //
