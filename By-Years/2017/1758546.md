The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to allow more consumers to make use of
assisted and autonomous driving systems in automobiles. Fully Autonomous
Vehicles (AV) will reduce traffic collisions and enable humans to spend less
time driving and more time on productive activities. Commercially deploying AVs
requires a number of key technologies including sensing, perceptual systems,
motion planning, and actuation. Our discussions with leaders and decisionmakers
at automotive companies have shown that the development of robust, accurate, and
energy-efficient perception systems is a major technical obstacle to creating
mass-producible autonomous road vehicles. Of particular interest to automakers
is scaling down the computational requirements of perceptual systems while
preserving high levels of accuracy and robustness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will use deep
learning to create perception systems that are (a) scalable across different
computational platforms and (b) scalable across smaller or larger sensor sets.
Specifically, the company will develop scalable systems from small compute
platforms (used for Highly Automated Driving) to somewhat larger compute
platforms (used for Fully Automated Driving). Further, the company will develop
perceptual systems that scale from few sensors to many sensors. The goal is to
"do more with less," advancing the pareto-optimal frontier of efficiency-
accuracy and price-accuracy tradeoffs. The company has already engaged with
automotive OEMs and suppliers to develop partnerships and to define metrics for
success in this endeavor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
