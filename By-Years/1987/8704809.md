The discipline of systematics attempts to reconstruct phylogenetic
relationships among species from data concerning their similarity and
difference. Over the past two decades, there has been a vigorous debate among
biologists as to which methods ought to be used to make these inferences to
species relationships. The principal methods discussed are: the phenetic methods
(which use the overall similarity of a pair of taxa as a measure of the
closeness of their descent), the cladistic parsimony (which uses similarity of
derived, not ancestral, characters as evidence), compatibility methods (which
discard characters according to a certain recipe and then use cladistic
parsimony), and explicitly statistical methods (primarily maximum likelihood
techniques). These methods sometimes disagree with each other as to which
phylogenetic hypothesis is best supported by given data, and thus biologists
have constructed defenses of their own preferred methods and criticisms of rival
approaches. Dr. Sober, under this grant, will complete his efforts at clarifying
the issues involved and developing an epistemological framework for
understanding the problem of phylogenetic inference. Philosophical issues
addressed include the role of parsimony in nondeductive inference, the
conditions under which postulating a common cause for two events is preferable
to postulating separate causes, and the relevance of asymptotic criteria (like
statistical consistency) to the problem of likelihood inference. This study
promises to be of great interest both to systematic biology and the
philosophical foundations of biology.
