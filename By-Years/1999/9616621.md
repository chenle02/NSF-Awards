9616621 Rosenberg The Recent mollusk collection of the Academy of Natural
Sciences of Philadelphia (ANSP) is the oldest mollusk collection in the country,
and the second largest catalogued one in the world. It currently has more than
430,000 catalogued lots containing about 12 million specimens. Many of the land
and freshwater specimens represent species now threatened, endangered or
extinct. To further increase the scientific value of the collection, this
project will computerize the label and catalog data of those specimens collected
in the United States. Computerization has obvious benefits for scientists
studying systematics, evolution and biogeography, but there are also broad
benefits for environmental sciences. Computerization of the collections will
help in determining changes in the historical distribution patterns of mollusk
species. Little such information is currently available, but is needed not only
by scientists conducting basic systematic and ecological research on mollusks,
but to provide baseline data for monitoring the health of ecosystems. This
project is funded by a partnership between the NSF and the Biological Resources
Division of the USGS, and will contribute to the Integrated Taxonomic
Information System.
