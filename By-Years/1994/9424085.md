This award provides funding to purchase shipboard instrumentation in support of
NSF-funded research. The instruments will be used aboard the R/V POINT SUR, a
135 foot vessel, which is owned by NSF and operated by the University.
Instrumentation requested includes computer and network hardware, and Ashtech
3-DF GPS system, and meteorological sensors. The instrumentation requested is
required for support of NSF-funded cruises aboard the POINT SUR during 1995 and
will enhance the scientific capability of the vessel in the future. ??
