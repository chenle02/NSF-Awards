9723060 Tummala This award is for partial funding to establish two complete
advanced packaging system prototype facilities at the Engineering Research
Center for Packaging Research at the Georgia Institute of Technology. The
facilities are being used in research aimed at exploring the limits of packaging
technologies in design, test, materials, and processing. The facility will
expose students to product development methodologies. Undergraduate and graduate
students will work in teams with faculty and industry to explore next generation
prototypes from concept to design, to development, to testing, to operation of a
system. The cost of the facilities are shared by the State of Georgia and
industry. Engineering Research Centers normally involve studies in research that
involves proof-of- concept testbeds. This facility will be the first of its kind
in an Engineering Research Center and in a university where the students will
have the potential to go beyond proof-of-concept testbeds, to prototype
production through a systems-level engineering project. This extends their
education from study of concepts to include the effects of manufacturing
constraints on their results.
