The effect of halogens on the soot creation in flames will be studied in the
context of the incineration of modern industrial products. Equivalence ratios,
temperature and hydroxyl concentrations will be measured experimentally for a
significant range of halogen loadings (halogen to fuel hydrogen ratio). In this
manner, the mechanisms leading to soot creation will be identified in typical
flame conditions. The impact of such knowledge would be critical to the design
of better fireproof materials, where halogens are used since they tend to delay
ignition (conversely, if a fire starts, they amplify the release of soot: a
delicate tradeoff|) Also, up to one-third of the pollutants expected from
incineration come from halogenated hydrocarbons (paints, degreasers, etc...),
hence a serious soot control problem for incinerators or city fires. In
addition, soot may play in a role in the release of products of incomplete
combustion (dioxin, furans, ...). There is a pressing need for a better
understanding of this complex field.
