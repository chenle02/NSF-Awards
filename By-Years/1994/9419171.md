9419171 Seidman The focus of this research is the structure and properties of
interfaces in metals . A number of issues related to grain boundaries (GB) are
being studied, including: factors affecting the presence and scale of GB
faceting; kinetics of GB phase transitions; macroscopic and atomistic mechanisms
of GB phase transitions; and scaling, e.g., the existance of fractal-type facet
morphologies. These subjects are examined by growing specific grain boundaries
and facet morphologies and studying them in situ by hot stage transmission
electron microscopy. Atom probe techniques are used to study the kinetics of
dissolution of selected binary substems. %%% The subjects of this research are
timely: grain boundary segregation and phase transition issues are long standing
scientific problems and the boron-doped and boron-free nickel aluminides are
curently of high technological interest. ***
