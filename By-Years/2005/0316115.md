A three-year research program is pursued with the goal of using numerical
magnetohydro-dynamic (MHD) models and observations to sturdy the initiation and
propagation of solar coronal mass ejections (CMEs). There are two components to
this activity, (i) to study the fundamental physics of solar eruptive phenomena,
specifically the CME initiation process and propagation, and (ii) to predict the
disturbed solar wind parameters which are important to solar-interplanetary-
magnetosphere coupling studies. The overarching objective of this work is to lay
the foundation for the development of a science-based space weather predictive
model.
