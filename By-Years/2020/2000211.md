Research Initiation Awards provide support for junior and mid-career faculty at
Historically Black Colleges and Universities who are building new research
programs or redirecting and rebuilding existing research programs. It is
expected that the award helps to further the faculty member's research
capability and effectiveness, improve research and teaching at the home
institution, and involves undergraduate students in research experiences. The
award to Hampton University has potential to broaden impacts in several areas.
Undergraduate students will receive training in state of the art molecular and
bioinformatics methods and work with graduate students from marine and
environmental science. The PI will integrate their research in the classroom.
The study of marine mammal skin has important implications with respect to
understanding fundamental biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Marine mammal skin has
remarkable adaptations to the aquatic environment, including high rates of cell
turn over and increased wound-healing capabilities. The central goal of this
project is to investigate whether these adaptations are reflected in the
epigenome, specifically in microRNAs (miRNAs), which are non-coding short RNAs
with a pervasive role in gene expression regulation. To date, miRNAs have not
been characterized for most non-model organisms, including marine mammals. This
project will make use of small RNA sequencing technology and established
analytical platforms to identify and quantify miRNAs in common bottlenose
dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) skin tissues and conduct inter-lineage comparisons
with mammal species that have contrasting life histories. While highlighting the
epigenomic adaptations of marine mammal skin to life in the aquatic environment,
this project will also assess the feasibility of using miRNAs as biomarkers for
monitoring marine mammal health.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
