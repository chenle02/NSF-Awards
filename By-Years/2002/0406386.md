Abstract-CNS-0406386&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We propose to develop a software
framework to develop middleware service for next generation data analysis
centers built on top of heterogeneous clusters: and ii) to deploy within the
context of such centers, anytime knowledge discovery and data mining algorithms
that operate interactively on dynamic data. The key elements of the proposed
framework are: a) Storage Services: efficient mechanisms for managing,
preprocessing, and accessing dynamic data in a distributed environment; b)
Caching Services: efficient mechanism for supporting data and knowledge re-use;
c)Scheduling Services: efficient mechanism for admission control, and resource-
aware inter-task and intra-task scheduling; and d) Application Adaptability:
parallel adaptive incremental data mining algorithms for key data mining tasks
that interact effectively with the proposed services.&lt;br/&gt;
