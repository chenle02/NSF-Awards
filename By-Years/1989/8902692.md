Stable single mode laser sources and optical heterodyne receivers are needed for
high capacity single-mode fiber communications systems. An important component
for both sources and receivers is an optical frequency translator. This device
yields a frequency-shifted replica of an input optical signal. Ideally the
amount of the frequency shift should be electronically controllable. Frequency
translators are also needed for heterodyne optical spectroscopy. The PI has
recently demonstrated optical frequency shift of up to 12 GHz using interactions
with microwave magnetostatic waves in magnetic garnet thin films. Shifts of up
to + 20 GHz should be possible using this technique. Advantages over electro-
optical and acousto-optical frequency translators include single-sideband
frequency shifts, continuous electronic tunability over the range 1-20 GHz via a
magnetic bias field, selectable up or down frequency shifts, and a frequency-
independent output beam angle.
