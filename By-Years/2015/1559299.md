The Stanford Institute for Theoretical Economics (SITE) summer workshop series
offers one of the leading forums for presenting innovative economic theory. SITE
workshops bring together top scholars from around the world to highlight and
discuss current theories on almost every topic in
economics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of the SITE summer workshops is to
advance economic science for the benefit of society. SITE's mission is to
encourage and support the participation of younger scholars as well as provide
exposure for scholars and institutions that typically may not be represented at
other economics forums. All SITE attendees benefit from opportunities to engage
in critical scientific discussion, to gain exposure to new developments in their
field and beyond, to promote exchanges across disciplines, and to initiate and
collaborate on new research. Attendees bring these assets back to their work and
institutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SITE contributes to the understanding and
application of economic theory to processes, institutions, and systems,
nationally and globally. SITE workshops promote rapid dissemination of the
latest, topical research not only to economists but also to researchers, policy-
makers and scholars in other disciplines, government and the private sector. To
further facilitate dissemination of the knowledge and research, SITE maintains a
website where digital versions of the presented papers are available to all.
&lt;br/&gt;SITE facilitates sharing and cross-pollination of theoretical and
empirical work on almost every topic in economics, including behavioral and
experimental, computational, development, finance, industrial organization,
labor, macroeconomics, public, and economic history. Organizers conduct from
seven to ten sessions each summer, with an average of 16 presentations and over
40 participants per session. Organizers strive to include research papers in the
most active and innovative areas of theoretical economics, as well as under-
represented topics. There is also some cohesion along lines of research
presented from year to year, reflecting the continuing interests of the
organizers. The goal and contribution of each SITE workshop is to contribute to
the dissemination of scientific knowledge, strengthen empirical and theoretical
economic analysis and research methods, and improve understanding of the
processes and institutions of the US and global economies.
