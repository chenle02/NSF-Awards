Marycrest College has purchased equipment that is to be used to provide a
sophisticated computer interfacing experience to students of the sciences. The
training parallels as closely as possible the interfacing environment found in
the industrial and academic work environment. This is done through the teaching
of a specific course called Computer Applications in Science and by providing an
environment for computer interfacing projects for undergraduate research. The
equipment purchased consists of three work stations comprising microcomputers
and associated analog/digital hardware and appropriate software. The institution
is matching the NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.
