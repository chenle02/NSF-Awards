The lunar synodic effect consist of a systematic tendency for the precipitation
at many mid-latitude locations to be most favored to occur a few days after full
or new moon. The gravitational tidal forces of the moon and the sun cause this
effect. The exact manner in which these force affect atmospheric circulations so
as to induce the lunar synodic bias is unknown. This work will examine this
classical problem along two complementary thrusts: (1) a statistical analysis of
diverse precipitation data to delineate the types of atmospheric circulation
patterns most relate to the lunar effect, and (2) a quantitative assessment of
the dynamics of tidal and various inertial components of ageostrophic motion in
circulations that produce rain. Desirable spin offs of this research are (1) to
attract the interest of theoreticians to this neglected but fundamental
classical problem in dynamics, and (2) to encourage quantitative investigation
into the lunar synodic effect as a means of improving the skill of operational
probability-of- precipitation forecasts.
