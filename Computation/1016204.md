This project will develop efficient gradient-based innovative algorithms and
theory for the solution of large-scale nonlinear optimization problems,
including those with and without constraints imposed. The research will include
the asymptotic convergence studies of Barizilai-Borwein type gradient methods,
active set techniques and efficient preconditioners for bound constrained
optimization, subspace affine-scaling methods for problems with continuous
knapsack constraints, and active set methods for general nonlinear optimization
with linear equality constrained phase. All the techniques developed for the
optimization, as well as the sparse matrix technology for preconditioners and
projectors will be incorporated into the active set algorithm for general large-
scale nonlinear optimization. High quality software based on this research will
be developed.

Although the focus is nonlinear optimization, the methods and algorithms
developed in the project will have broad impact in the many areas of
computational science that require the solution of such large-scale nonlinear
optimization problems. Specific applications of this project include Positron
Emission Tomography (PET) which arises in medical imaging, (2) a design problem
in topology optimization where two materials are mixed so as to optimize their
electrical properties, (3) Support Vector Machines (SVM) which are used in
separation and classification problems in pattern recognition and data mining,
(4) graph partitioning which arises in parallelization of algorithms and in fill
reducing orderings for sparse matrix factorization, and (5) protein folding
where the structure of a protein is reconstructed from inter-atomic distances
derived from nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. To maximize the impact,the
software developed in this project will be made widely available. The supported
graduate student will receive training on interdisciplinary applications of
mathematics.
