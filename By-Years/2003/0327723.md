Two new features in the variation of the relative abundance of helium to
hydrogen in the solar wind have recently been observed by the WIND spacecraft:
(i) This ratio is a linear function of the solar wind speed in the range from
250 km/s to 550 km/s, and (ii) The ratio undergoes a six-month periodic
modulation in the sense that the maximum in He/H at a fixed solar wind speed
occurs at the times when the Earth is most distant from the heliographic
equator. This study will use this newly discovered effect as the basis for a
thorough investigation of the connection between coronal and solar wind plasmas
spanning observations by five different spacecraft taken over the last 30 years.
Collaborations will be developed with investigators from these other spacecraft
and with theorists and numerical modelers to connect the interplanetary
observations of the He/H ratio back to its solar origins. These features present
challenges to the currently accepted paradigm of solar wind. The abundance of
helium is a sensitive test of models of solar wind formation and of the
underlying connections between solar photospheric, coronal and interplanetary
magnetic fields.
