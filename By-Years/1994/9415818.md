This is a project to conduct an experimental campaign called CARMEN to study
ionospheric structure and dynamics in the Caribbean. This 15 to 18 month long
intensive study will use data obtained with optical and radar instruments at
Arecibo, Puerto Rico, in addition to a digital ionosonde at the conjugate point
in Argentina. The earth s ionosphere is characterized by a variety of storm-like
processes that result in a very structured medium. These structures severely
affect the propagation of radio signals from satellites to the ground and can
disrupt civilian and military communications and positioning systems. The
ultimate goal of this study is to understand the processes that lead to
ionospheric irregularities during solar minimum conditions. Collaborators from
many different institutions will participate in the campaign and students will
be supported at both Cornell and the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez.
