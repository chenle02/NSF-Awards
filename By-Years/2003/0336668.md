This project, termed "Expanding Pathways to Science, Engineering and
Mathematics" (EPSEM), is inspiring and nurturing students to pursue degrees in
science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). To accomplish their
objectives, the project is using a "multi-tiered, articulated academic
mentorship". The program is using its relationships with the Santa Barbara and
Ventura County school systems and the Allan Hancock, Oxnard, Santa Barbara City
and Ventura Community Colleges to identify and recruit students to pursue degree
programs in STEM. They are targeting students whose academic success is
challenged by factors other than their academic ability. In particular, they are
making major efforts to recruit minority and economically disadvantaged
students. All students supported by the project are participating in a two week
summer residential program at the lead institution. In addition, a full range of
academic year activities and services are being provided to both high school and
community college students.
