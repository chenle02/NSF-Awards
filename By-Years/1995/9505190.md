9505190 Pierrehumbert The research under this award involves and continues
research on a family of problems in extratropical, tropospheric synoptic to
planetary scale dynamics and the related effects on the Earth's general
circulation and seasonal and interannual fluctuations. The theme unifying these
studies is an approach to the general circulation based on mixing concepts and
the dynamical consequences of homogenized potential vorticity (PV) pools in the
troposphere. Four major topics will be pursued: (1) implications of homogenized
PV structure for identifying the mechanism for eddy-planetary wave feedback in
the troposphere, (2) determination of the effects of radiation and moist
processes on the evolution of PV in the atmosphere, (3) statistical equilibrium
models of horizontal heat fluxes where upper level vortices are coupled to low
level processes, and (4) an extension of previous work in the mixing by synoptic
eddies. While Dr. Pierrehumbert deals primarily with highly idealized models,
his work provides valuable insights which are applicable to a wide range of
research areas. Dr. Pierrehumbert is one of the most creative, original, and
productive theoreticians in atmospheric dynamics, for whom this accomplishment-
based renewal award is most appropriate.
