Changes in temperature, precipitation, atmospheric CO2 concentration, and
nitrogen deposition will likely continue to occur throughout the 21st century
and will have significant impacts on forests, grasslands, and other vegetation
across the planet. However, the effects of each of these factors alone may
depend on changes in the other factors, and such interactions are poorly
understood. Given this scientific gap, the objective of the proposed study is to
increase understanding of the interactive effects of warming, precipitation,
CO2, and nitrogen on long-term ecosystem responses. To meet this objective,
experimental manipulations will be imposed in a unique open-air grassland
experiment in Minnesota, to create all combinations of ambient and elevated
temperature (ambient and +2Â°C), current and reduced growing season precipitation
(ambient rainfall and 55% of ambient rainfall), ambient and elevated CO2
(current levels and those likely to occur late in the century), and ambient and
enriched nitrogen supply (achieved with two levels of soil nitrogen supply). The
study will determine the interactive effects of these four global change factors
on performance of plants and soil organisms, and hence on plant production, soil
fertility, and carbon acquisition and storage. Results of this project will also
help in the development of models that predict how changes in vegetation will
influence the global climate system through modifying the rise in atmospheric
carbon dioxide levels and thus the rate of climate warming.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will educate a diverse group of
undergraduates, including students from under-represented groups, and build ties
to scientists from around the U.S. and the world. Results will be incorporated
into outreach activities aimed at K-12 educators and aimed at training teachers
in global change and sustainability curricula. Researchers will educate students
and the public through classes, interviews with the press, participation in
public forums, and advising government officials.
