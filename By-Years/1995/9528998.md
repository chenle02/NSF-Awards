This is a collaborative effort among three universities (Columbia, Rochester,
and Pittsburgh) to construct, evaluate, and disseminate a package of Corpus
Analysis Resources for Discourse (CARD). The goal is to provide the means for a
large-scale, robust analysis of language use, both within and across distinct
types of discourse corpora. The three components of CARD are a Discourse
Annotation Language (DAL) to encode information pertaining to language use
directly within discourse corpora; reliability measures of the degree of
variability in DAL annotations; and a library of DAL-annotated corpora, varying
in modality, number of participants, domain, and communicative task. DAL follows
the Text Encoding Initiative guidelines and is implemented in Standard
Generalized Markup Language to facilitate common authoring and editing
utilities. DAL is a modular language with five layers of linguistic
representation: morpho-syntactic, prosodic, anaphoric, lexical, and segmental.
