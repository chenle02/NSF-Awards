The research focuses on providing a better understanding on the non-perturbative
interaction of matter with short, intense laser pulses. Computer simulations are
used to provide a detailed picture, spatially and temporally, of the evolution
of these systems in the electromagnetic field. Where appropriate, the
relativistic form of the Schroedinger equation is used to study the dynamics.
