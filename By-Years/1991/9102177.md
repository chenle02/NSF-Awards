Realistic characterization and understanding of the mechanical response of
materials and interfaces in semiconductor devices such as chip-substrate and
packaging are vital for improved and competitive designs in manufacturing. Most
of the previously used constitutive models do not account for important factors
such as inelastic response, fracture, damage, delamination and degradation under
thermomechanical and viscous (creep) effects, in an integrated manner. The
objective of the research is to develop a unified modeling approach that will
allow incorporation of the above factors in the behavior of both solid materials
and interfaces in the semiconductor devices. The models thus developed will be
verified with respect to available test results from laboratory measurements.
Semiconductor devices are extremely complex systems, often involving interfaces
between brittle and ductile materials. Because of the complexity of the system,
failures are hard to predict and, therefore, failure-resistant designs are
difficult to achieve. The reseach work will develop a much more sophisticated
approach to the design of semiconductor devices and packaging than those which
are currently available.
