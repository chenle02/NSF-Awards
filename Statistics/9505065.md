Title: Reparameterization and Longitudinal Modeling Abstract: This research is
concentrated in two main areas of statistical inference and modeling:
reparameterization and hierarchical models for longitudinal data. The
reparameterization research develops methodology that identifies
parameterizations for a wide class of statistical models for which normal
approximations to the likelihood function and posterior density are accurate.
Parameterization diagnostics based on measures of non-normality are used to
identify well-behaved parameterizations and to derive sample sizes sufficient
for reliable inference based on asymptotic normality for many commonly-used
parameterizations. The hierarchical modeling component of the research compares
and unifies models for longitudinal data, including Markov chain models,
hierarchical mixed effects models, and fully Bayesian hierarchical models.
Estimation, prediction and design issues are addressed, and special
consideration is given to the incorporation of random changepoints in these
models. This research studies statistical models which may be uqed for processes
such as the basis of a feed-forward controller for many of today's complex
manufacturing processes. Because exact inference can be very difficult in these
complicated models, scientists often resort to the simplification of summary
results which are implicitly understood in the context of normality (i.e., the
bell curve). The first component of this research studies procedures for
determining when this simplification is misleading and presents alternative
statistical models. This research will lead to increased numerical efficiency in
fitting these complex models, permitting more timely response to changing
processes. The second component of this research studies models for longitudinal
data. These models are needed when the data consist of serial mea surements
within individuals for a number of individuals. Such data arise in a wide range
of applications, from reliability studies to economic indicators to health
monitoring. The research compares and unifies a number of models for
longitudinal data, and addresses estimation, prediction and design issues.
Special consideration is given to the incorporation of random changepoints in
these models (i.e., points in time where the process exhibits some serious
change in behavior). The changepoints may represent onset of disease, critical
part fatigue, or changes in consumer behavior. The research studies how
longitudinal models may be used in a dynamic fashion to detect these
changepoints quickly.
