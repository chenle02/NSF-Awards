This research, part of the experimental Physical Chemistry Program, applies
picosecond and femtosecond time resolved spectroscopic techniques to the study
of solvation dynamics, electron transfer reactions, vibrational and
orientational relaxation, and diffusion controlled reactions. These studies will
elucidate how the interactions between dissolved molecules and their
surroundings influence molecular relaxation and reactivity. The pathways of
vibrational relaxation of medium-sized molecules in a variety of solvents will
be investigated by taking advantage of improvements in tunability, sensitivity
and time resolution of laser systems. The extent of inhomogeneous broadening in
vibrational lineshapes will be examined by using a Raman echo technique in which
a pair of pulses excite a coherent superposition of vibrational states. Such a
system evolves until a second pulse pair rephases the vibrations. After a second
delay the phase coherence is probed by Stokes scattering induced by a third
laser pulse. The origin of nonexponential decays in charge transfer reactions
will be studied. In particular, the role of a non-equilibrium initial state in
strongly adiabatic electron transfer reactions will be explored.
