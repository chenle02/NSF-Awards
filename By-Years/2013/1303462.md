The main theme of the proposed research is the interaction among symplectic
algebraic geometry, quantization, and geometric representation theory. Along the
way the PI plans to establish several unexpected links between seemingly
unrelated topics. Specifically, the PI will prove a 'quantum version' of an
important equivalence of categories due to Bezrukavnikov. This 'quantum version'
relates a category of D-modules on the base affine space to an equivariant
derived category of sheaves on the affine Grassmannian. The PI then expects to
find a natural interpretation of dynamical Weyl groups in terms of the algebra
of differential operators on the base affine space. In a different direction,
motivated by recent work of Braverman, Maulik, and Okounkov, the PI will address
the problem of finding an interpretation of the canonical flat connection on the
quantum cohomology of the Springer resolution as a Gauss-Manin connection. The
idea here is that the correct mirror dual of the Springer resolution is a
"noncommutative space" and the mirror dual of the quantum connection is the
Gauss-Manin connection on periodic cyclic homology of that noncommutative
space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work opens up a wide variety of
independent directions for research. One of the central features of the proposed
projects is the application of methods and results developed in one branch of
mathematics to a totally different area of mathematics. For example the research
involves the systematic application of various algebraic techniques to problems
in geometry and representation theory. Thus one of the goals of the project is
to enhance the concept of the "unity of mathematics". The proposed work should
also have far reaching applications not only in various areas of mathematics,
but also in mathematical physics and theoretical physics, especially in quantum
physics. The mathematical sciences, viewed as a whole, make a profound
contribution to society. The current project goes a long way toward promoting
the interactions between different disciplines and enhancing our scientific
understanding.
