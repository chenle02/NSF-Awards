The goals of this project are to develop a rod shear device to study shaft
friction, to develop experimental techniques to measure changes in tangential
stress in soil near a pile, and to measure how the state of stress near the
surface of a pile changes due to axial loading on the pile. A granular soil will
be confined in a rod shear device that can apply anisotropic confinement to the
soil specimen. The tangential stresses in the soil will be measured by the
velocity of compression waves in the tangential direction near the surface of
the rod using miniature geophones and piezoelectric crystals embedded in the
soil specimen.
