9322370 Myers This Research Experiences for Undergraduates project will continue
the cooperative effort between the National Solar Observatory at Sunspot, New
Mexico and The University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP), located in El Paso, Texas.
Student participants will be selected from juniors and seniors majoring in
Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering or Computer Science at UTEP. The
participants will be involved in electronic and computer related research
support projects suggested by either the permanent staff or visiting scientists
at the National Solar Observatory. The projects will address practical problems
that can be completed within a summer with some limited follow-up in the
subsequent Fall Semester. ***
