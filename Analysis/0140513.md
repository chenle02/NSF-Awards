ABSTRACT

The proposed research lies at the area of smooth dynamical systems and ergodic
theory. The main goal of the project is to investigate "higher rank" dynamical
systems. In particular, the investigator will study actions of discrete and
continuous higher rank abelian groups, which are natural generalizations of
diffeomorphisms and flows on smooth manifolds. Higher rank dynamical systems
appear naturally in the study of various geometric and algebraic objects. The
prime examples of these systems include hyperbolic and partially hyperbolic
actions by automorphisms and translations on compact cosets of Lie groups. Using
dynamical, analytic, and group theoretic methods the investigator will study
rigidity properties of such systems. The examples of possible rigidity
properties include description of invariant measures, regularity of measurable
isomorphisms, and existence of smooth isomorphisms to the algebraic models.

Dynamical systems and ergodic theory is a relatively new field of mathematics
which studies the evolution of physical and mathematical systems over time, for
example planet systems, air and fluid flows. This field originated from the
classical studies in differential equations and celestial mechanics. Dynamics
and ergodic theory introduced new mathematical tools into these areas of physics
and mechanics, such as the study of the qualitative behavior in the long run as
well as various analytic and probabilistic methods. New ideas and concepts in
dynamics, such as fractals and chaos, have not only affected the field itself
dramatically, but also fundamentally changed our understanding of the world. The
influence of the studies in dynamical systems nowadays goes as far as
meteorology, biology, and computer science.
