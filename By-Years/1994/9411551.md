This proposal is for funds to purchase a double pulsed laser system which would
be dedicated to Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) studies of mixing flows and
chemically reacting flows. This equipment will enhance the PI's existing Planar
Laser Induced Fluorescence (PLIV) capabilities and would allow for the first
time, simultaneous, non-intrusive velocity and scalar information to be
obtained. It would then be possible to perform fundamental measurements on the
nature and mechanisms of mixing and combustion in complex flows. Of particular
interest would be the turbulent jet/crossed flow studies of NOx formation.
