9411568 Altman Equipment to be installed in an existing ultrahigh-vacuum system
is acquired. This includes a double-pass cylindrical mirror analyzer for Auger
electron spectroscopy and low-energy ion-scattering spectroscopy, a low-energy
electron diffraction system, and a quadrupole mass spectrometer for thermal
desorption. This equipment is to be used with a high-speed, variable-
temperature, scanning tunnelling microscope (STM) to study the dynamics of
processes at surfaces. Projects using this equipment include studies of etching
reactions at metal surfaces, kinetic measurements of adsorption, desorption, and
reaction rates at specific sites on oxide surfaces, and studies of surface
intermixing during nucleation and growth of thin metal films. ***
