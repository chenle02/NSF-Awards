9401117 Smith This proposal provides for continued operation of an armored T-28
aircraft and sensors as a national facility for use by the atmospheric research
community. The aircraft is uniquely suited for research into clouds,
thunderstorms and hailstone processes. The cooperative agreement provides for
staffing, management, testing, operation, and maintenance of the T-28 and hanger
facility. The aircraft is then available for research grant opportunities
through university proposals. Grant awardees receive access to the T-28 through
approval by NSF on advice from the Facilities Advisory Council. The aircraft and
data analysis becomes available in support of research projects requiring
penetration of convective storms, such as VORTEX and RACES. ***
