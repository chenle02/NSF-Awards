9308749 Austen Computerized tomography (CT) is a well-known technique in medical
imaging. These techniques have been applied to ionospheric imaging and have
shown promising results. This project will develop this technique to the point
where it is feasible to deploy a system to amke measurements. There are several
problems which need to be addressed. One is the data is known to only within a
constant value; the determination of that constant will be integrated into the
technique. The second problem is that the vertical information is lost due to
the measurement technique. This project will address this problem by developing
methods for incorporating additional data into the technique. Other items which
will be studied are the placement of receivers, methods for increasing the
resolution of the technique, and the possibility of extending the technique to
three-dimensional imaging. ***
