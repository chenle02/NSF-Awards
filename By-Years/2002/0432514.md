This project addresses the long-range transport of pollutants in the atmosphere.
Pollution events at any given locations depend on the transport of pollutants
into the area and the local concentrations, reactions and sources. Here, the
role of transport in determining pollutant concentrations will be isolated using
several years of atmospheric reanalysis data. The partitioning of any given air
parcel according to location of last surface contact and transit-time interval
from that location, the so-called boundary propagator, will be the diagnostic
quantity on which this is based. The transport climate will comprise the
statistical properties of daily and multi-day averages as well as the
variability about the seasonal means, and the probability of extremes. The PI
will objectively evaluate the physical conditions and mechanisms conducive to
long-range transport. It is envisaged that the boundary propagator will show key
advantages over trajectory analyses that are currently used in the
interpretation of observational data and chemical transport model simulations.
Knowledge of the transport characteristics of pollutants will have strong
benefits for abatement strategies and environmental policy making.
