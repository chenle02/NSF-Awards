This project is concerned with various problems in algebraic K-theory. The
principal investigator will consider the K-theory of discrete valuation rings.
In particular, he will study Gersten's conjecture for discrete valuation rings
and related splitting phenomena. The postdoctoral associate on this project will
study the K-theory of Stanley-Reisner varieties and the dimension conjecture.
The research involved is in the general area of algebraic K- theory. In a broad
sense, this area represents the evolution of certain concepts from linear
algebra. These problems are significant in this field, as well as, algebraic
geometry.
