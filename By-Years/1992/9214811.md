This is a SGER proposal whose objectives are to (a), investigate, both
theoretically and experimentally, a new, fast high resolution Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) technique based on the discrete wavelet transform, and (b),
establish (at least, experimentally) its feasibility and superiority over
contemporary MRI approaches. The anticipated advantages of the proposed new
approach include a dramatic reduction in the overall imaging time with no
reduction in resolution or contrast.
