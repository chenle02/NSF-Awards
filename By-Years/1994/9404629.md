Relational query languages, such as SQL, were the early success stories of
declarative programming. However, as new applications areas have developed,
relational systems have been found wanting. Their limitations--both structural
and language related--have led databases and deductive databases. Object-
oriented databases (abbr., O-O) are effective when the structure of the data is
well- known and the data access paths and retrieval methods can be determined at
system development time. Deductive DBMS, based on logic, are appropriate in less
well-defined situations; situations where one does not know before-hand all the
queries that will be asked. Flexibility is extremely important for modern DBMS,
especially when the user lacks detailed knowledge about the structure of the
application domain. For this reason, logic-base languages have traditionally
been used whenever intelligent processing of data was required. On the other
hand, flat data structures inherent in such languages are ill-suited for many
scientific applications, CAD/CAM design, modeling agile manufacturing
processing, etc., where data has complex and known internal structure.
