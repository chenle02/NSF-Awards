This is a SBIR Phase I project. The goal of the project is to develop an
improved method of protein sequencing based on the capillary high performance
liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. Specifically, the project
involves the development of a probabilistic model for peptide fragmentation and
ionization that is consistent with actual data, and the development of a
prototype algorithm that finds the peptide wit the maximum likelihood of
yielding a given spectrum. The commercial potential of this work is the
development of a software system which would analyze peptide fragment mass
spectroscopy data to yield protein sequence data. If successful such a product
could be provided as a stand alone system or it could be integrated into the
software packages that are provided with mass spectrometers.
