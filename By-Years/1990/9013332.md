A central issue in developmental neurobiology is the role of cell-cell
interactions in regulating neuronal differentiation. Astrocytes secrete factors
that influence neuronal differentiation, including S-100 beta, a factor that
affects serotonergic neurons. In turn, the secretion of S-100 beta from
astrocytes is regulated by activation of serotonergic neurons. The mechanisms of
these cellular interactions will be investigated at the molecular level by
studying the transcription, translation and release of S-100 beta. In addition,
the regulatory role of steroid hormones, specifically the glucocorticoids, in
these processes will be studied. The PI will undertake these studies at Cold
Spring Harbor during a one year Sabbatical leave where he will be trained in
molecular and protein techniques in the laboratory of Dr. Daniel Marshak.
