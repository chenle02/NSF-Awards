9311508 Holmes Alarm calls are vocalizations elicited by predators that can
alert other members of the species to impending danger. Alarm calls have
functional value only if they are responded to appropriately for the type of
predator. Ms. Jill M. Mateo's doctoral-dissertation research seeks to determine
when and how responses to alarm calls develop in young Belding's ground
squirrels, as her pilot data show that alarm-call responses are not fully
developed when young ground squirrels first emerge from the burrow where they
were born. Ms. Mateo will test three predictions about the relative importance
of auditory experience and social context for the development of alarm-call
responses: (1) experience with the mother's vocalizations before weaning helps
the young to discriminate alarm calls after weaning; (2) development of alarm-
call responses after weaning is socially facilitated by observing adult alarm-
call responses, and (3) the quality of juvenile alarm-call responses improves
rapidly if they repeatedly hear alarm calls in the presence of other responding
individuals. These predictions will be tested by playing back tape-recordings of
alarm calls and recording the cardiac responses of unweaned pups and the
behavioral responses of juveniles housed in a semi-natural environment or living
in the field. Results will help explain how social influences contribute to the
development of a critical survival skill, and will advance our understanding of
how behavior develops through tightly-woven interactions between the organism
and the series of environments it encounters throughout its life.
