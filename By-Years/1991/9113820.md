Since the late 1940s, the violent upheavals in the developing world have
generated a flood of political refugees variously estimated as between 40 and 75
million people. While politically induced migrations have occurred throughout
human history, the number of political refugees appears to have reached an
historical peak. This flow of refugees has important legal dimensions as this
migration seems rooted in the increasing interdependence of the world and the
globalization of social and ethnic conflicts. Dr. Jenkins seeks to address this
issue through studying refugee flows across a wide sample of national boundaries
between 1955 and 1990. The core of this work is a cross-national quantitative
analysis of the social and political sources of the world-wide explosion in the
number of political refugees. Drawing on time series and lagged-panel
regression, the analysis will investigate various hypotheses pertaining to the
globalization of social conflicts that have been advanced to account for the
growth and intensity of the refugee problem. By constructing an annualized
account of the initiation, intensity, and duration of refugee flows, the
research will be able to illuminate the sources of civil instability and the
effects of instability, wars, famines, and facilitative conditions on refugee
migrations. This study will substantially advance our understanding of the
causes of refugee migration over the past several decades. The effort to
construct and evaluate annual data on refugee migration and populations for 152
countries for 35 years will be a valuable scientific contribution in and of
itself as is the development of this data resource. As important, however, is
the relationship of this project to recent theoretical developments. In recent
years, theoretical attention has focused on refugee producing situations and
away from conceptualizing refugee migrations as idiosyncratic. This work
constitutes the first major test of such theoretical ideas.
