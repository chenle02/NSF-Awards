This action will provide funds for a new faculty member, research associates
and students at Syracuse University to pursue experiments in elementary particle
physics. The focus of the research will be on the study of the properties of
heavy quarks, particularly the b-quark. These experiments will be performed at
the Cornell Electron Storage Ring (CESR) and in the out years of the grant,
perhaps other accelerator facilities. These experiments are a sensitive test of
the currently accepted "Standard Model" of the electroweak interactions.
