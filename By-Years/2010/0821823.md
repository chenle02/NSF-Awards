The Department of Statistics at Stanford University, California, will
purchase&lt;br/&gt;computing, storage and backup equipment which will be
dedicated to the support of research in the mathematical sciences. The equipment
will greatly enhance our ability to work with massive data sets arising from
modern high throughput data collection techniques. The equipment will be used
for several research projects, including in particular: Network Inference,
Microarrays, cell image, functional MRI, flow cytometry, copy number and SNP
data analyses.&lt;br/&gt;
