The objective of the project is to develop sensors and sensing systems that can
monitor the performance and health of completed civil structures and those under
construction. The project will involve a series of laboratory and field tests of
existing and new sensing technologies, including extensive use of embedded
optical fiber sensors for which new techniques will be developed. An existing
facility dedicated to studies in wind engineering at the Texas Tech University,
a building at the University of Vermont campus, and a bridge and a hydroelectric
dam to be built in Vermont will be the test sites. Fundamental questions related
to the operating principles of the sensors and the synthesis of the
multichannel, multiformat data streams will also be investigated.
