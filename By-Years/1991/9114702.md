The RIDGE Initiative provide support for theoretical integration of field and
laboratory studies of ridge.crest processes. To provide a strong natural focus
to attract highly capable thoreticians from within the broader geological
/biolobical community, a second annual RIDGE Theoretical Insttitute will be
conveined. The purpose of the Institute is to provide an environment for
progress on critical theoretical RIDGE problems that require an
interdisciplinary approach with two specific goals: to give researchers and
their students the required background to address complex interdisciplinary
problems, and to foster stron linkages among theoretical developments on a
particular ridge.crest problem. This Institute will focus on magmatic on
magmatic and hydrothermal systems, and will consist of a short course of
lectures, discussions, and poster sessions, to be followed by a workshop that
will provide a forum for intensive scientific interaction among participants.
