Biological Sciences (61)&lt;br/&gt;One of the greatest challenges in the
development of scientific curricula is to develop courses that teach students
important scientific concepts while fostering critical thinking and hypothesis
testing skills. The faculty and administration of the Natural Science Division
at Hope College believe that "science is best learned by doing". With the recent
commitment by the college to establish a neuroscience program, our objective is
to develop a research-oriented neuroscience laboratory that will facilitate
student understanding of neuroscience concepts and support the divisional
emphasis of nurturing critical thinking skills. This new laboratory will
continue to build on students' prior investigative laboratory experience,
wherein students are first trained in a scientific technique (using structured
lab exercises) and then use that technique to complete a long-term project based
on their own hypothesis and experimental design. We are adapting the structured
labs from two complimentary neuroscience lab programs currently being used at
other undergraduate institutions: 1) The Crawdad Program, which is currently
being used by institutions such as Cornell University and Williams College,
introduces students to modern neurophysiology techniques including
electrophysiology. 2) A Laboratory Manual of Leaning and Memory Experiments
currently being used at Wesleyan College and Kent State University, presents
students with experimental techniques used at the organismal level to study
behavior and learning. The resources used in this neuroscience lab are also be
utilized by students in the advanced physiology and introductory biology
courses.
