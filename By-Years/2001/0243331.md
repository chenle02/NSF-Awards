The grant investigates processing and characterization of aluminum and magnesium
alloys via severe plastic deformation (SPD) using equal channel angular pressing
(ECAP). Appropriate dispersion of second phase particles are expected to pin the
grain boundaries thereby retaining ultra fine grain size in submicron range. The
relatively large range of grain sizes, from micron to nanometers, will provide
an opportunity to unambiguously determine the creep and superplastic properties
when the grain sizes are extremely small and to obtain fundamental information
that will be needed in the longer term for the successful utilization of these
materials. A goal of the study is to utilize advanced techniques such as atomic
force microscopy to systematically investigate cavitation and grain boundary
sliding following ECAP as well as deformation of the processed materials. Along
with superplasticity, the underlying mechanisms of diffusional creep will be
investigated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From a scientific viewpoint, there are well-
developed theories predicting the plastic flow (or creep) of metals when the
grain sizes are small but these theories remain open to considerable speculation
and there has been much discussion and disagreement concerning their general
validity. The study is expected to fill in the gaps and provide scientific
understanding of deformation mechanisms at varied grain sizes and in a range of
applied stresses and strain-rates. In addition, the investigations will have
technological applications for forming operations. The grant avails
participation of graduate and post-graduate students along with undergraduate
senior projects. The project is co-funded by metals program in the division of
materials research and manufacturing in the division of manufacturing and
industrial innovation.&lt;br/&gt;
