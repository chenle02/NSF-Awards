The correction of reinforced concrete bridge columns to the bases transfer the
bending action to the bases and into the ground, and pilot studies have
indicated that these corrections may be unconservative for bending in one
direction. This project will investigate larger scale models to determine the
strength of the column base correction and model the action for future design
considerations.
