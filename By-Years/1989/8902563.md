and 19th, 1988 at the Auditorium of the Graduate Center of City University of
New York. A Soviet delegation of 13 mathematicians, including Faddeev, Novikov,
and Gelfand will be in attendance, and American speakers are Fiegenbaum,
Sullivan, Majda, Foias, P. Sarnak, Thurston, V. Kac, Deligne, and McMullen. The
topics of concentration are iteration of transformations, mathematical physics,
and algebra, with one day devoted to other areas of interest. The conference
director is Peter Lax of the Mathematics Department of Courant Institute of
Mathematical Science, New York.
