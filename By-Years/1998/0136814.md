&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OCE-0136814 /
OCE-0136907&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project researchers at the
Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and the University of Washington will
attempt to develop a method to evaluate anthropogenic changes in the carbon
isotopic composition (d 13C) of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC)in the oceans,
the so-called 13C Suess effect. Development of this method should permit
reconstruction of the d 13C-DIC and DIC Suess effect globally using both the new
WOCE/JGOFS/OACES d 13C-DIC and DIC datasets. These reconstructions will provide,
for the first time, global coverage of (1) the relationship between the
anthropogenic 13CO2 and 12 CO2 changes, ( 2) the total d 13C of DIC change in
the oceans, and (3) the pre-industrial d 13C of DIC distribution. The
reconstructions should also be of immediate benefit to modelers of the modern-
day global carbon cycle and to the paleoceanographic community. &lt;br/&gt;
