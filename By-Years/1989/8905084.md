This Research Improvement in Minority Institutions (RIMI) project will focus on
computational studies in atomic and molecular physics and integro-differential
equations. Studies will be in three subareas: Theoretical Investigations of
Photon-Excited Atom Interactions; A Moments Approach for Generating Rapidly
Convergent Energy Bounds for the 3N-Body Problem; and Time-Lag Control Problems
Governed by Integro-Differential Equations with Side Conditions. This project
will produce useful data in several areas of basic research that utilize
physics, mathematical physics, and quantum chemistry. The studies will also lead
to a better understanding of excited states photo-ionization, N-body bosonic and
fermionic systems, and optimal control processes that are governed by integro-
differential equations with time lag (heat flow, elasticity, etc.). This
comprehensive investigation of the photoionization of excited atomic states will
significantly increase the research capability of a predominantly minority
institution. The principal investigators are well-trained and have published
widely in several refereed journals. Faculty and students working on this
project will strengthen those research skills that will help in developing a
first-rate optics laboratory at this institution.
