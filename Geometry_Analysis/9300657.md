9300657 Grunbaum The research involves investigations in the fundamental
geometry of convex polytopes, configuations and combinatorial aspects of
symmetries. Applications are proposed to tiling patterns is a variety of
contexts including architectural design and stereoscopic viewing. Another
component of the proposal entails an undergradaute education activity in aspects
of geometrical structure. The investigator also proposes further development of
instructional material in several areas of geometry suitable for students at the
high school and junior college level. Activities in participation with teachers
at these levels is also envisaged.
