This program is designed for the educational and scientific enrichment of ten
senior high school students drawn from throughout the United states. Each
student will be immersed for eight weeks in a scientific field research program
in the Juneau Icefield of Alaska. The Juneau Icefields Research program has
operated under the aegis of the Foundation for Glacier and Environmental
Research. The program is in academic affiliation with the Glaciological and
Arctic Sciences Institute of the College of Mines and Earth Resources at the
University of Idaho and the university of Alaska Southeast. Formal lectures and
demonstrations, as well as informal seminars and discussions, will be
supplemented through direct research participation under the guidance of senior
researchers and professors.
