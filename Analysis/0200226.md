Abstract:

Lindblad's research concerns basic mathematical questions for systems of
nonlinear hyperbolic equations in mathematical physics. These include several
important equations in classical field theory and continuum mechanics as well as
in classical physics, e.g. Einstein's equations in general relativity and the
equation of fluids and elastic bodies. These basic questions are: (i) Do we have
local existence and uniqueness of solutions in a certain class? (ii) Do we have
blow-up of solutions? (e.g. black holes in general relativity) (iii) What is the
long time behavior of solutions? More specifically, Lindblad is mainly working
on two projects. One on proving the well-posedness for a class of problems that
occur in fluid dynamics and general relativity, in particular proving the well-
posedness for the free boundary problem of the motion of the surface of a fluid
in vacuum. A long term goal is to study the long time behavior of astrophysical
bodies such as gaseous stars as well as the surface of the ocean. Another
project is to study global solutions of equations related to Einstein's
equations. A long term goal is to simplify and generalize the global existence
results for Einstein's equations.

These two problems are related to the question of whether the fundamental
equations in physics have global solutions. Solution to these questions could
have important consequences. For instance, it is conceivable that one could use
the knowledge obtained from the solutions of Einstein's equations to permit the
use of gravitational waves to observe the Universe. Understanding the properties
of and controlling the interface between two fluids could have industrial
applications. To solve these problems Lindblad and his collaborators are
developing new techniques that could be useful for studying many other problems
as well. In particular, they are using geometric methods to study hyperbolic
differential equations.
