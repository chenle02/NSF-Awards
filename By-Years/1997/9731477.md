This project studies the design and analysis of dynamic computer processes. Past
research in theoretical computer science has focused mainly on static
computation problems, where the input is known before the start of the
computation and the goal is to minimize the number of steps till termination
with a correct output. Many important processes in today's computing are dynamic
processes, whereby input is continuously injected to the system, and the
algorithms is measured by its long term, steady state, performance. Examples of
dynamic processes include communication protocols, memory management tools, and
time sharing policies. The goal of this project are: (1) To develop new tools
for analyzing the performance of dynamic processes, in particular through
modeling the dynamic process as an infinite stochastic processes. (2) Use the
insight obtained from the above analysis to obtain provably better algorithm for
fundamental dynamic processes such as (a) dynamic data structures, (b)
communication protocols, and (c) resource sharing protocols. (3) Validate the
analysis though simulations to develop algorithms of both practical and
theoretical interest.
