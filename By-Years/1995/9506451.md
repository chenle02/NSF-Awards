9506451 Kent The processes of global sea-level, local tectonics, and changes in
sediment supply control passive continental margin sedimentation. Determining
the role of each requires continuous sampling and dating of stratigraphic
sections in different tectonic settings. Global sea level studies are a
fundamental component of global change programs and sea level studies require
drilling transects of boreholes on passive continental margins. These transects
will first focus on the Oligocene-Recent "Icehouse" with future drilling to
address sea-level changes during the Paleocene- Eocene "Greenhouse" and
"Doubthouse" when ice-volume changes were not apparent. The principal
investigators are currently developing, with NSF funding, a firm chronology of
New Jersey coastal plain Eocene to middle Miocene sequences, but require well-
dated sections on other passive margins to evaluate the role of eustatic versus
local effects. Previous and ongoing studies show that continuous cores from
western Alabama and eastern Mississippi provide fresh, unweathered material from
the middle Eocene to the "middle" Oligocene. The principal investigators will
conduct integrated magneto-, bio-, and isotopic (Sr, oxygen, and carbon) studies
of three recently drilled boreholes in Mississippi. Preliminary results funded
by ARCO show that these boreholes contain expanded upper Eocene to lower
Oligocene sections suitable for magneto-, bio-, and Sr-isotope studies. These
sections should compare well with the principal investigator's ongoing studies
in New Jersey. The Alabama and Mississippi studies will provide an "Icehouse"
transect of the Oligocene to compare with sequences in New Jersey and other
proxies of global sea-level change and a detailed transect of the "Greenhouse"
early Eocene and "Doubthouse" middle-late Eocene. ***
