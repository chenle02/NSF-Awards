This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of analytical mass spectrometry. During the tenure of this three-
year continuing grant, Professor Wilkins and his students will extend and expand
investigations in applications of Fourier transform mass spectrometry (FTMS)
that were initiated under the aegis of NSF grant CHE-8911685. Analyte ion
formation by both matrix assisted laser desorption (MALD) and by surface induced
dissociation (SID) for subsequent characterization by FTMS will be studied.
Professor Wilkins will also continue the development of coupled gas
chromatography, infrared spectrometry, and mass spectrometry as a sensitive tool
for the analysis of complex mixtures. Additionally, he will investigate the
analytical capabilities of the combined techniques of supercritical fluid
chromatography (SFC) and FTMS. %%% This research continues the development of
powerful analytical techniques that are applicable to a broad array of chemical
systems.
