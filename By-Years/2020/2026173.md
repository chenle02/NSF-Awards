The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project will help people who suffer from body-focused
repetitive behaviors (BFRBs). Over 4% of Americans suffer from skin picking,
hair pulling, and nail biting, the majority of whom resort to covering up the
problem with makeup, gloves, wigs, and even tattoos due to treatment cost
barriers and lack of effective tools to facilitate behavior change. While
behavior therapy, and in particular habit reversal training, has shown efficacy,
this method is traditionally burdened by unreliable journaling, a lack of access
to treatment, and difficulty for patients to perform in real-time because of a
lack of awareness. While real-time awareness devices do exist, there is room for
improvement in detection accuracy. This project will integrate a novel sensor
system into a wearable device that can lead to state-of-the-art detection
accuracy of BFRB-related behaviors. This wearable sensor solution is the first
of its kind, using the novel sensor to extract meaningful biomechanical
information. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research
(SBIR) Phase II project will result in new behavior recognition algorithms, a
new remote monitoring system, and new data generated from in-field experiments.
The project will: 1) develop a new sensor calibration system and characterize
signal artifacts that may influence detection accuracy; 2) develop new behavior
detection algorithms using data captured in the lab; 3) conduct self-guided
experiments in the field using the remote monitoring system proposed; and 4)
refine recognition algorithms. Such sensitive measurements require ideal signal
integrity, be sufficiently immune to signal artifacts, and tight electronics
integration within wearable design constraints. This wearable system can
profoundly impact the efficacy of habit reversal training during cognitive
behavioral therapy, the leading method for reducing the negative effect of these
behaviors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
