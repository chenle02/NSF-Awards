9317156 Bloxham This award provides one-half of the funds required to purchase
computing equipment to be installed and operated in the Department of Earth and
Planetary Sciences at Harvard University. Harvard is committed to providing the
remaining funds necessary to acquire the equipment. The computer will be used
primarily to serve the research needs of the department's geophysics group whose
projects include numerical modeling of the Earth's geodynamo, theoretical
calculations of magnetohydrodynamics, and interpretations of the Earth's
geomagnetic field. ***
