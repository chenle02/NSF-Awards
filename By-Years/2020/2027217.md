The Vera C. Rubin Observatory Documentary Project (working title) will follow
the people building the NSF- and DOE-funded Rubin Observatory during
construction and into its ten-year primary scientific mission. This is a
critical period in the building of the observatory (formerly the Large Synoptic
Survey Telescope, LSST). This award bridges an unfortunate gap, allowing the
filmmaker to start essential filming while working to raise full production
financing, including possible future seed funding from NSF. It reinforces
support from within the Rubin team, from the American Institute of Physics,
Cambridge and Oxford universities (UK), and from the private sector. The time-
critical events include visits to the project by the NSF Director and the DOE
Under-Secretary for Science, a visit by French contributors, and major meetings
for the Data Management Leadership team, for the Operations Team, and to discuss
commissioning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This long-term documentary project will
capture the human drama of creating a one-of-a-kind system for scientific
exploration, and will further NSFâ€™s mission to broaden participation in STEM
fields, foster a better understanding of science and the scientific process, and
ensure everyone an opportunity to participate in and contribute to the research
enterprise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
