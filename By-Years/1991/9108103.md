This program, to be carried out by one of the world's leading theoretical
astrophysicists, will use modern grid-based hydrocodes, adapted from successful
aerodynamic codes to study large-scale cosmic structure, and the infall of
matter onto compact objects. True hydrodynamic computational methods have been
developed, which can treat shocks and radiative processes, and which will permit
the direct calculation of X-ray emission, fluctuations in the cosmic background
radiation, and other phenomena not previously accessible from numerical
approaches.
