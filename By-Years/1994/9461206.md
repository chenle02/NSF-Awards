This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will seek to deposit
functionally gradient material (FGM) ceramic coatings on aluminum susceptor
materials to encapsulate the susceptor and prevent contamination of silicon
wafers during fabrication. Aluminum/aluminum nitride FGM coatings, which are
100% Al at the substrate interface and 100% AlN on the exposed surface with a
gradual transition between the two extremes, will be deposited using an ion beam
assisted deposition (IBAD). IBAD is a unique process which combines evaporation
with concurrent ion beam bombardment to controllably produce ultra-adherent thin
films with excellent control over film structure and chemistry. The AlN coating
layer will act as a diffusion barrier to eliminate aluminum contamination in
high-temperature semiconductor fabrication. The graded nature of the coating
will reduce interfacial delamination and facilitate a gradual shift of the
thermal expansion coefficient, thus reducing the probability of failures
associated with thermal expansion mismatch and increasing the working lifetime
of the coating. In Phase I, coating conditions will be varied to produce Al/AlN
FGM coatings on sample coupons of Al. Analytical evaluation and thermal cycle
performance testing will be used as feedback for additional processing parameter
development and coating optimization. Phase I will produce an adherent, durable
FGM coating which withstands thermal cycling. The project will also provide
analytical data about coating chemistry and coating structures for further
parameter optimization in Phase II.
