9316371 Koch PI will examine potential causes for large-mammal extinctions in
the late Pleistocene, specifically testing the hypothesis that large herbivores,
such as mastodonts, had specialized dietary requirements that could not be met
due to rapid floral community reorganization spurred by warming and increased
seasonality. Carbon isotope composition of tooth enamel will provide an axis for
distinguishing dietary specialization from dietary flexibility. A pilot study of
Sr isotopes will provide a monitor of seasonal migration patterns. Oxygen
isotopes will be measured as temperature proxies.
