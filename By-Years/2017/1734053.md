A Data Science Innovation Lab workshop, "Quantitative Approaches to Biomedical
Data Science Challenges in Our Understanding of the Microbiome", will be held at
the Wylie Inn and Conference Center, Boston, MA, June 19-23, 2017. (See
http://www.bigdatau.org/innovationlab2017/.) The Innovation Lab will bring
together early-career biomedical and quantitative investigators to engage in
intensive multidisciplinary interactions, with a goal of developing new and bold
approaches to address data science challenges involving the
microbiome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2017 Innovation Lab will focus on novel
approaches for analyzing high-dimensional big data derived from microbiota
associated with a health or biomedical research objective. While many approaches
have been applied to identify and explore interactions and potential causal
relationships between the human microbiome and the health of the human host,
mechanistic modeling of gut interactions largely remains an unfulfilled goal.
New mathematical frameworks, analytic tools and computational models will allow
for a deeper quantitative understanding of these mechanisms, leading to improved
treatment of microbiome-related illness. Funds from this award will support
travel for participants to attend the workshop.
