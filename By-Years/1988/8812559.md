Professor Block is exploring the case for and against an internal aspect of
intentional content -- what has come to be called "narrow content."
Intentionality is usually characterized in terms of the "aboutness" of beliefs,
desires, etc.; Professor Block's concern is whether there is a purely internal
aspect of this aboutness that is itself a kind of content. If two people are
thinking about different kinds of things, but are unaware of any of the
differences between the two things, so that they are thinking of them in exactly
the same way -- their "point of view" on the two things is the same -- is there
a kind of content that they therefore share? The field of study for this project
is the foundations of psychology. The overall objective is to determine whether
intentionality has a role to play in the science of mind, and, if it does,
whether the appropriate scientific concept of intentionality is narrow
intentionality. More specifically, the questions are: Is psychological practice
committed to intentional content? Should it be? Assuming psychology should be
concerned with content, why narrow content? Is narrow content holistic? Must any
scientific psychology that relies on narrow content be radically different from
common sense psychology? Professor Block will address these questions by first
giving some prima facie motivation for postulating narrow content, and then
moving to objections to it. He will try to produce a substantial rationale for
narrow content and a theory of what it is.
