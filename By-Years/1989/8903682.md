An unusually sensitive modulated-source Eotvos experiment will be conducted
next to a large lock on the Snake River in eastern Washington to put limits on
the existence of an intermediate-range material-dependent "gravitational" force.
A prototype experiment conducted by the author during the summer of 1988 placed
limits on a positive "Fifth Force" effect. It is important to settle this
possibility with a definitive measurement. A portable laboratory already
assembled at Yale University and already used in the prototype experiment will
be moved to the Little Goose Lock during the summer of 1990 for further
measurements. Improvements in the pendulum design will make the experiment at
least one order of magnitude more sensitive than the prototype experiment and it
is expected that the new measurements will set definitive limits on the
existence of this effect.
