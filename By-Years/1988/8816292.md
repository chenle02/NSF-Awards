The objective of this project is to determine anthropogenic pollution indicators
as well as biological marker compounds in antarctic sediments by characterizing
organic compounds present in trap particulates, surface sediments, and sediment
cores. These will be related to their probable sources, such as aeolian
transport, marine productivity, human activities, etc. The project will
initially concentrate on lipid components. Lipids are modified within the water
column, with further digenetic changes occurring after incorporation into the
sediment. In the antarctic environment this process should stand out because of
abundant marine productivity and negligible higher plant debris, and may show
evidence of the influence of human activities and the influx of global
pollution. A detailed organic geochemical analysis of free and bound lipids from
sediments and particulates, and total lipids from potential biogenic material,
will be carried out to characterize sources, estimate fluxes, and study the
digenesis of organic compounds. The result will be a better understanding of
paleo-oceanographic conditions and biogeochemical processes of the region, as
well as a more definitive identification of chemical tracers of global
pollution.
