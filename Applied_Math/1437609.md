Materials science consistently delivers game changing advances in the way we
live and the disciplines of applied and computational mathematics are
increasingly central to these developments. Motivated by this exciting synergy
the Symposium on Mathematical and Computational Aspects of Materials Science
will be held from 12/1/2014 through 12/4/2014 at the Materials Research Society
Fall 2014 Meeting in Boston Massachusetts. The symposium will bring together
investigators working at the interface between materials science, mathematics
and computational science. This NSF Grant will support graduate students and
early career researchers to attend and participate in this symposium. The
symposium offers a special opportunity for increasing diversity and breadth of
participation by actively engaging a much broader base of younger applied
mathematicians than in more standard symposium formats. This symposium format
allows graduate students and young investigators to directly interact with the
greater research community on interdisciplinary problems coming from the
frontiers of materials science and applied mathematics. This feature increases
diversity and full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and
underrepresented minorities in STEM fields. It exposes graduate students and
early career applied mathematicians to contemporary and fundamental theoretical
problems challenging materials science; enabling future breakthroughs through
interdisciplinary collaboration.

The scientific goals of the Symposium on Mathematical and Computational Aspects
of Materials Science to be held at the 2014 MRS Fall 2014 Meeting in Boston
Massachusetts will be to: 1. To foster new scientific collaborations between
applied mathematicians and materials scientists in order to address contemporary
problems at the frontiers of materials science. 2. Increase diversity and
breadth of participation in STEM fields by exposing graduate students and early
career applied mathematicians to contemporary and fundamental theoretical
problems challenging materials science; enabling future breakthroughs through
interdisciplinary collaboration. 3. To expose investigators with expertise in
materials science disciplines to the latest applied mathematical and
computational frameworks useful for the solution of challenging problems in
materials science.
