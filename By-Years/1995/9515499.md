This award supports the travel of 12 Americans to a U.S.-Western Europe
workshop on iterative methods at CERFACS in Toulouse, France, June 11-14, 1996.
This is one of four workshops associated with the International Linear Algebra
Year. The organizers are Gene H. Golub of Stanford University and Iain Spencer
Duff of the CERFACS Parallel Algorithm Group and Rutherford Appleton Laboratory.
The workshop brings together scientists from academe (including graduate
students and postdoctoral researchers), government and industry. They will
collaborate on practical and theoretical problems on key topics in linear
algebra. The workshop on iterative methods will emphasize Krylov methods for
unsymmetric problems, domain decomposition methods, multigrid methods and
parallel computing. The objective is to develop faster and more robust iterative
solvers for large-scale computer simulations.
