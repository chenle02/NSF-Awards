Bushnell The research is in various facets of automatic test pattern generation
(ATPG). Problems being considered include: false timing path detection
algorithms; reduction in memory requirements for ATPG for very large state
machines; neural net- based, switch-level algorithms for ATPG; parallel
algorithms for ATPG; robust delay fault built-in self- testing circuits;
statistical delay fault simulation. Software for algorithms is being developed.
Additionally, a distributed data base retrieval algorithm that operates on a
network of work stations is being explored.
