This dissertation project will support the research of a cultural
anthropologist studying the Navajo perceptions and cultural understandings of
autism. The student, who has extensive experience studying autism in non-Indian
society, will determine whether the Navajo have a concept of an illness syndrome
similar to the one we label "autism", and will study how the Navajo culture
conceptualizes and deals with this form of disease. Methods include participant
observation in a home for "exceptional" (i.e., mentally ill) children on the
reservation; formal interviews and informal discussions with the family of
children in the home as well as with other Navajo. This research is important
because it will add to our basic core of knowledge of the cultural variation in
the labelling and conceptualization of disease. Such knowledge is essential if
we are to improve the delivery of health care in a multi-cultural society.
