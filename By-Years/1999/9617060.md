Bechtold, Jill AST 96-17060 Dr. Bechtold will continue several programs to study
the nature of distant quasars and the intergalactic and interstellar gas which
lies along the line-of-sight to them. Observations will be in multiple
wavelengths, including optical, near-infrared, sub-millimeter, radio and X-ray.
The continuum radiation provides clues to the physical conditions of the
supermassive black hole and accretion disk. The emission lines provide further
clues to the geometry and radiation field near the nucleus. By studying the
quasars as a function of redshift, the evolution of the quasar population as a
whole may be understood.
