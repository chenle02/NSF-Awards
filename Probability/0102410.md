0102410 Taqqu The focus of this research is on a special class of stochastic
processes with the following three properties: stationary increments, self-
similar and stable non-Gaussian probability laws (stable sssi processes, in
short). Unlike the Gaussian case, there are infinitely many different stable
sssi processes. This overwhelming variety may be regarded as a fundamental
problem. One now has to understand how these processes are different or what it
is that they have in common. However, non-Gaussianity also brings to the picture
new tools that were unavailable in the Gaussian case. It has been known for
quite some time now that non-Gaussian stable processes having some invariance
property, like self-similarity or stationarity of the increments, can be
associated with nonsingular flows. It is then based on some properties of these
flows that one can describe the structure of the corresponding stable processes.
The focus will be at first on an important subclass of stable sssi processes
called self-similar mixed moving averages. The connection of self-similar mixed
moving averages to nonsingular flows allows one to decompose them into separate,
independent processes and then explore each part in the decomposition
separately. The purpose of this research is to better understand a class of
random processes that have characteristics that one encounters in many areas of
applications. Examples of such processes include the limit of the so-called
renewal reward processes applied in telecommunications and "random wavelet
expansions" introduced in probabilistic modeling of images. These processes are
fractal-like. They display scale invariance and tend to take often extreme
values that deviate greatly from the mean. Their mathematical structure is
complex. The goal of this research is to develop tools that can be used to
analyze that structure
