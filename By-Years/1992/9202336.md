This project is for a program of macrozooplankton sampling to be conducted
monthly as part of the regular JGOFS sampling at the Bermuda Atlantic Time
Series (BATS) station in the Sargasso Sea. At present no zooplankton sampling is
included in the Time Series cruises, despite the importance of macrozooplankton
grazers in the packaging and transporting of primary production out of the mixed
layer. The monthly (or more frequent) samples over a three year period will
provide valuable supporting data on seasonal distribution for other concurrent
work on vertical migration of zooplankton. It would produce a long term data set
on zooplankton abundance as a context for intensive process-oriented studies. By
providing a significant missing piece of the JGOFS sampling regime, it will
permit monthly estimation of the role of zooplankton grazing, metabolism and
migration in regulating the transformation of primary production to particle
flux.
