The most obvious signs of plant senescence are the withering and eventual death
of flowers, fruits, leaves and roots. Senescence is regulated by complex
processes involving environmental, physiological and genetic factors whose
mechanisms are incompletely known. In this project, a unique model will be
developed for the study of plant senescence, with the eventual goal of
elucidating the molecular mechanisms. Plant senescence is important to the
overall economy of the plant, fruit and grain ripening, crop production, and
post-harvest storage of crops. Chloroplasts in mesophyll cells of Nicotiana
glauca lose functionality during leaf senescence, but those in stomatal guard
cells do not. In this project, mesophyll and guard cells will be cultured in
ways that preserve the unique properties of the differentiated cell types. To
optimize cell survival and preservation of physiological properties unique to
each cell type, a variety of nutrient, osmotic, pH, light, and cell density
conditions will be tested. Once cultures are established, conditions will be
identified for fusing protoplasts from the two cell types and for culturing
fusion hybrids. The functionality of guard cell chloroplasts in fusion hybrids
will be monitored by microfluorospectrophotometry to determine whether senescing
mesophyll cells contain factors capable of initiating guard cell chloroplast
senescence.***//
