Larsen DMS-1523424

This award supports travel and lodging for participants to attend the
conference Methods of Mathematical Finance, held June 1-5 2015 at Carnegie
Mellon University. The objective of the conference is to bring together
researchers from probability, stochastic analysis, control theory, finance, and
economics to address current topics of importance within mathematical finance.
Additionally, executives from the banking industry are present to elucidate
those mathematical problems currently of most importance to industry
practitioners. Crucially, the meeting aims at bringing together mathematicians
at all stages of their careers, including junior researchers and graduate
students. In addition to plenary talks and poster sessions, the meeting also
contains a panel discussion about the state and future directions of US-based
Masters programs related to mathematical finance. These programs are central to
the training of personnel expert in finance for universities, government, and
the finance industry. The conference web site is:

This conference on Mathematical Methods in Finance emphasizes important current
topics in mathematical finance, including equilibrium theory in financial
markets, optimal investment in incomplete markets, backward stochastic
differential equations, queuing theory, pricing and hedging under model
uncertainty and frictions, and stability theory for pricing and investment
problems. It features twenty-two plenary talks by senior researchers and a
poster session open to contributions by junior researchers. It also includes a
panel discussion about the state and future directions of US-based Masters
programs related to mathematical finance. These programs are vital for
universities, government, and the finance industry. The conference enables
interactions between junior and senior researchers, and provides an excellent
opportunity for junior mathematicians within the US to confer with experts from
around the world.
