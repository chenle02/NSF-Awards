This proposal requests funds for a replacement protein sequencer for the UCSD
Biology Department. The existing sequencer has operated for 10 years and has
analyzed more than 1650 samples for 130 laboratories. However, existing
sequencer is obsolete and the day is rapidly approaching when it will no longer
be repairable. In addition, improvements in sequencer technology and chemistry
have been made since the purchase of the existing sequencer. Cycle times have
been shortened by 50%, reagent consumption has been reduced, sensitivity has
been improved from 100 pmole to less than 2 pmole of sample, and the
introduction of multiple cartridges offers significantly increased sample
throughput. The use of the protein sequence information includes the necessary
first step in the construction of oligonucleotide probes and eventual cloning of
genes, investigation of the posttranslational modifications in proteins which
are important for protein function, identification of functionally important
regions of proteins after amino acid modifications and peptide isolation,
investigations of evolution in genes from various species, and the
identification of proteins as novel, new proteins by comparing N-terminal
sequence data with the available protein sequence data bases.
