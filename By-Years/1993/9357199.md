9357199 Jarrell This is a NSF Young Investigator Award which will theoretically
study strongly correlated electronic materials including heavy Fermion, magnetic
and high temperature superconducting materials. Besides the usual analytic many-
body techniques, quantum Monte Carlo simulations will be combined with
perturbation theory so that the computationally intensive Monte Carlo is used
only for the non- perturbative part of the problem. %%% ***
