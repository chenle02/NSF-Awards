This project is concerned with the transfer of the project on the role of
location problems in combinatorial optimization from Princeton University to the
State University of New York at Buffalo. A novel algorithm for the simple plant
location problem is implemented and tested. It is shown that the best results
are achieved using an initial solution obtained by a greedy heuristic.
