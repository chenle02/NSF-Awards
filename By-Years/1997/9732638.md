The project provides a small amount of funding for the writing of a monograph
which analyzes the results of transport measurements in the Q-machine at Irvine.
The information in the monograph, which summarizes the research on this
experimental device over the past thirty years, will be extremely useful to
other plasma physicists engaged in the physics of transport in plasmas.
