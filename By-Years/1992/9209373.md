The purpose of this research is to analyze the effects of the tax system on the
international location of business activity and the employment of productive
factors such as labor, capital, and R &amp; D. Tax effects are analyzed in two
contexts. The first is the location, foreign and domestic, of the R &amp; D
activities of U.S. multinational firms. Owing to particular aspects of U.S. tax
changes in the 1980's, the tax law introduced firm-specific incentives for some
U.S. firms to reduce their domestic R &amp; D expenditures and locate some of
their R &amp; D activity abroad. The research uses the National Science Survey
of R &amp; D activities to investigate the extent to which firms responded to
these incentives. The second context is the location decision of foreign firms
doing business in the U.S. Foreign investors from certain foreign countries are
likely to be insensitive, or at least less sensitive than other investors to
U.S. tax obligations. Tax rates vary considerably between states in the U.S. The
study will determine the extent to which foreign investors respond to
differences in state corporate income tax rates, in order to identify the
features of foreign income tax systems that make foreign investors responsive to
local tax conditions.
