9412733 Tsao The objective of this research is to investigate the dynamic
modeling and real-time control of machining processes, in particular drilling.
This project will use mixed time domain and drill angle domain modeling for the
drilling process, statistical time series canonical variate analysis techniques
for identifying the multi-input and multi-output time-varying nonlinear process
parameters, and robust adaptive feedback and feedforward algorithms for form
tool drilling and high-speed drilling process control. In addition, this project
will investigate the use of spindle and feed drive power or current in lieu of
the drilling torque and thrust force as feedback measurements for cost effective
factory implementation. The successful implementation of the project has the
potential to significantly improve drilling quality and extend operating
regimes. It could also provide a methodology for dynamic modeling and process
control of other machining processes.
