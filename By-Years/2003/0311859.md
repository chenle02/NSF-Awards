The 7th International Conference on Strangeness in Quark Matter
will&lt;br/&gt;be held from March 12-17, 2003 at the Sheraton Atlantic Beach
Hotel&lt;br/&gt;in Atlantic Beach, North Carolina. This meeting is
jointly&lt;br/&gt;organized by Brookhaven National Laboratory, Duke University,
and&lt;br/&gt;the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will discuss the physics of
strange quarks - quarks&lt;br/&gt;which are produced when nuclear matter is
heated and compressed to&lt;br/&gt;densities and temperatures as have existed in
the Universe a few&lt;br/&gt;microseconds after the Big Bang. The study of
strange quarks will&lt;br/&gt;allow for novel insights into the evolution of the
early Universe,&lt;br/&gt;the properties of Neutron Stars and the behavior of
the fundamental&lt;br/&gt;theory of strong interaction (QCD) under extreme
conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSF is supporting this conference to allow for
the active&lt;br/&gt;participation of graduate students and junior
postdoctoral&lt;br/&gt;researchers, who will be either given oral presentations
or posters. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More information on the conference can be
