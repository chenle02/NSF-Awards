9708361 Ruiz This grant provides $80,000 two-years partial salary support for a
technician at the University of Arizona to oversee operations and maintenance,
train new users and develop geochemical separations and mass spectrometric
techniques utilizing both the thermal ionization mass spectrometer (TIMS) and
the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) in the W.M. Keck
Isotope Laboratory. This lab is actively applying isotopic data to elucidate
mechanisms of crustal and mantle evolution and metallogenesis. Specific examples
include, Re/Os isotopic dating of molybdenite to constrain metallogenic epochs
in the southwestern U.S., Re/Os isotopic characterization of platinum group
element (PGE) deposits in mafic-ultramafic complexes and geochemical and
geochronologic studies of the tectonics of Mexico. This group is also conducting
developmental work on coupling laser ablation with ICP mass spectrometry, a
newly burgeoning and potentially promising analytical technique for micro-scale
studies of trace element distributions in solid geologic samples. ***
