9724360 Jenkins Highly compliant (flexible) structures, such as membranes, must
use noncontact methods of vibration sensing, due to the extreme thinness of the
material. Full-field dynamical descriptions of large civil or mechanical
structures, or vibration measurements in hostile environments, are other example
where traditional methods of analysis are insufficient. This proposal seeks to
acquire a laser vibrometer, which is a multi-point measurement system which can
be used for model analysis, design studies, nondestructive testing, and system
identification. The system uses laser doppler interferometry to make accurate
noncontact vibration measurements on complex systems without the drawbacks of
conventional vibration testing techniques. ***
