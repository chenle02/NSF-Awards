The electrical engineering curriculum is experiencing a major restructuring that
requires additional control laboratory experiments. For undergraduate students
emphasizing controls, the university must provide a well-rounded education in
the theory and practice of control systems design in the areas of manufacturing
automation and classical control systems design. In addition, a manufacturing
automation course must be provided for electrical engineering students not
specializing in control and for the new Manufacturing Engineering program. The
new equipment provides equipment for a new classical control systems design
laboratory. This project provides additional equipment for the factory
automation laboratory, which can see an increased number of students under the
new curriculum. The innovative aspects of this project are a desktop version of
a manufacturing process used in undergraduate control education; introduction of
IEC 1 131-3 standard PLC programming languages to undergraduates; and small-
scale robust processes that expose students to the challenges of control design
in the context of real industry applications. *
