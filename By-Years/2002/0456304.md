The goal of this planning grant is to establish an innovative collaborative of
arts and science institutions to enhance informal science learning in Boston.
The project will create a partnership between Northeastern University, the
Boston Museum of Fine Arts, Boston Symphony Orchestra and the Wang Center for
the Performing Arts to enhance the delivery of informal science programming for
families with children ages 5-12 using interactive programs and exhibits. The
planning project will develop and prototype programs across science themes that
relate to each partner's mission, while highlighting science concenpts and
topics. Deliverables include a front-end evaluation, pilot programs and then
preliminary design of web modules. A national advisory comittee will convene to
assist with the planning process while careful study of each site will be
undertaken to determine how to maximize learning opportunities for participants
in the diverse learning venues.
