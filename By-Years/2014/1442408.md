The objective of this project is to support a meeting titled Nanophotonic
Device: Beyond Classical Limits from May 14-16th, 2014 at the OSA in Washington,
DC. USA. This support will permit top-notch experts in nanophotonics to deliver
plenary talks on recent advances and future research directions. This meeting
will allow researchers, engineers and business leaders a valuable opportunity to
meet and discuss challenges and opportunities regarding research in
nanophotonics technology. Results of the meeting will impact photonic computing
solutions, sensitive point-of-care diagnostics, and revolutions in next
generation solar cells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the last decade, on-chip
integrated photonic circuits have shown great potential for big-data bandwidth
applications. However, while the photonic device performance is steadily
increasing, the inherently weak light-matter-interactions set fundamental limits
to integration density, bandwidth, and drive power consumption. The goal of this
meeting is to determine the next revolutionary steps of photonics technologies
for communication and optical computing. Emerging nanophotonics materials,
optical confinement options, and integration schemes will be discussed,
analyzed, and planned.
