0119493&lt;br/&gt;Scherer&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the proposed research is to
develop and build compact absorption spectrometers and fluorescence measurement
systems with the capability to test and identify the composition of picoliters
of analyte. The approach is to integrate microfabrication techniques for both
microfluidic and photonic devices in order to create monolithic analysis "chips"
for bio-analysis applications. Specifically, three optical technologies will be
developed and integrated into microfluidic systems: (1) Fabry-Perot optical
resonators with high-finesse for optical spectroscopy, (2) photonic crystal
nanocavities for interferometric sensing with high sensitivity, and (3)
development of manufacturable solid immersion lenses for high numerical aperture
examination of microfluidic samples. &lt;br/&gt;
