The main goals of the project are to establish a three-year primary mathematics
and science leadership project for teachers of grades k-3. There is a subject
matter emphasis on statistics and probability, measurement, geometry and the
physical sciences. The project develops teachers' leadership capabilities by
engendering in them confidence and competence in mathematics and science through
involvement in a coordinated program of educational content and methods,
including activity-based lessons, strategies for questioning and responding,
conceptual knowledge, cooperative learning, writing across the curriculum,
appropriate integration of technology, involvement of parents and encouragement
of minority and female students. Year one involves ten teams of three teachers
representing school districts in the San Francisco Bay Area in a model local
leadership development institute which provides 120 hours of instruction and a
variety of academic year activities. The teams work together during the year to
develop leadership skills and improve science and mathematics education in their
classrooms. They also conduct workshops for their colleagues. During the second
year the model under development is refined and disseminated statewide through
the California Leadership Program. Seven new teams of teachers from different
locations in California will join the project. In year three, seven new teams of
teachers from the Bay Area districts are joined by seven teams from different
locations in the nation. The participant teams are selected from among those
recommended by the school districts that have committed to the project. A total
of 114 teachers are to participate of which 72 come from the San Francisco Bay
Area, 21 from throughout California, and 21 from districts nationwide. There are
contributions of $289,819 cost sharing which amount to 289,819/694,060, or 42%
of the funds requested from National Science Foundation. The actual duration of
the project is 42 months.
