9724289 Rahman, Talat Kansas State University Acquisition of Upgraded High
Performance Multiprocessors for Computational Research in Science and
Engineering Kansas State University is acquiring a multi-processor computing
facility with shared memory, together with a visualization workstation to
support large computation needs in biochemistry, chemistry, physics and
engineering. All the research projects have the common theme of high performance
computing applied to the simulation of physical, chemical, or biological
systems. Specific research topics include modeling of novel materials and
macromolecules, computational atomic and molecular structure and collisions,
computational fluid dynamics, and engineering software for parallel scientific
applications. The computational and visualization facilities will be available
for training graduate students in computational modeling and visualization.
Kansas State envisages that the new facility will play an important role in
their existing recruitment programs designed to attract minorities and women to
graduate programs in the physical, biological and engineering sciences.
