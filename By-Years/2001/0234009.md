0234009, K.R. Rajagopal, Texas A&amp;M University&lt;br/&gt;"A Thermomechanical
Framework for the Analysis of Soil Liquefaction "&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
action supports a new approach to modeling the phenomenon of soil liquefaction
due to earthquake excitation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The liquefaction of saturated
cohesionless soils involves a change in soil behavior from solid-like to fluid-
like. The new approach involves the application of a general thermodynamic
framework that has been quite successful in describing very diverse dissipative
processes. This thermodynamic framework is particularly suited to describing the
inelastic response of materials, and is very appropriate for describing the
transition from solid-like to fluid-like behavior. It has been used to describe
both solid-to-solid and liquid-to-solid phase transitions, as well as plasticity
and viscoelasticity. In applying this framework to soil liquefaction, the soil
is modeled as a mixture of a granular material and a liquid, capable of
undergoing large reversible and irreversible
deformations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the framework has been developed to
describe soil liquefaction, specific initial-boundary value problems of soil
liquefaction will be studied.&lt;br/&gt;
