This research is an important step to modeling contributions to the solar
irradiance and full-Sun indices often used as substitutes for direct solar
irradiance measurements. The PI will address three major aspects of magnetic
fields' variability and their relation to emission sources on the Sun as solar
activity moves from low to high levels with the rise of cycle 23. First, she
will investigate how redistribution of magnetic flux and the changing
connections between magnetic structures resulting from the emergence and
evolution of active regions relate to identifiable variations in spectral
irradiance. Second, she'll question the effect of coronal holes in modulating
the UV and EUV irradiance, potentially a significant player in the radiative
output at shorter wavelengths. Finally, she hopes to more fully understand the
mapping functions between spectral intensity and magnetic flux density for
different magnetic structures, particularly in the differences between plage and
the network. This will then relate magnetic field intensities to measurable
parameters of the magnetic field structure and its evolution, and thus, effect
on, irradiances.
