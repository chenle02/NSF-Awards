This research program will study the spin dynamics of sub-micron ferromagnetic
particles. Picosecond time-resolved Kerr microscopy will be used to study the
excitation spectra and origins of spin dephasing in individual nanoparticles
with simple magnetic microstructures. A comprehensive understanding of the
dynamics of these systems will be developed, including connections to the
important problem of spin transport. New measurements will provide information
about low-lying excitations in the presence of a magnetic field, the dynamics of
interacting magnetic vortices, and the response of domain walls to sub-
nanosecond current pulses. The second area of research focuses on the origins of
spin dephasing in smaller nanoparticles, in which the suppression of coherence
by the generation of non-uniform spin-wave modes will be explored. The third
problem addressed by this program will be the relationship between spin dynamics
and spin transport in both metallic and semiconductor devices. The impact on
magneto-electronics will be enhanced through collaborations with materials
scientists as well as the training of graduate students in ultrafast techniques
and nanofabrication. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Small magnetic particles, with
dimensions much less than one micron (a human hair has a diameter of about 25
microns), are already integrated into technologies such as computer disk drives.
New electronic devices have been proposed that combine small magnetic elements
with semiconductor components such as transistors. This program addresses the
fundamental physics that governs the behavior of small magnetic particles,
sometimes called nanoparticles, on time scales of less than a nanosecond (one
billionth of a second). For comparison, a "bit" of information in a state-of-
the-art computer disk can be written in about one nanosecond. The effects of
shape, internal structure, and the presence of other particles will be explored
using a very fast form of optical microscopy. The experiments will involve the
development of new optical and microwave techniques by graduate students as well
as significant collaboration with materials scientists. The development of new
ultrafast magnetic devices will be investigated through interactions with other
university programs as well as local industry.&lt;br/&gt;
