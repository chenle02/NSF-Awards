A laboratory for design of Very Large Scale Integrated (VLSI) circuits is
established at Loyola College to train undergraduate computer science and
engineering students in electronic design automation (EDA). The laboratory
project supports mainly a new course which includes MOS transistor and CMOS
circuit theory, semiconductor manufacturing techniques, automated design
techniques, simulation of designs, and testing of circuits. Each team of two
students designs a complete custom integrated circuit in a single semester using
engineering workstations and public domain EDA software. The major benefit to
other institutions is the conversion of the EDA software from expensive high-
maintenance workstations to cheaper Intel 80386-based personal computers. This
award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal investigator's
institution.
