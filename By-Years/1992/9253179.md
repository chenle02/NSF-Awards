SALT will offer courses and workshops for participating teachers from each
public elementary school in Pickens County for a period of 3 years. These
teachers will from a core of lead teaches and math specialists so that every
elementary school has 1 or 2 lead teachers or a math specialist. These teachers
will be trained in a hands- on/problem solving approach to learning mathematics
and will be a resource for other teachers in their school. This project is an
extension of a two year pilot program which puts a math specialist in the Forest
Acres Elementary School.
