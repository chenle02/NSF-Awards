This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address the
problems associated with polymer electrolyte membranes (PEMs) for direct
methanol-air fuel cells. The advantages of fuel cells based on PEMs include
simplicity of design, light weight, low operating temperature, improved
catalytic activity, elimination of electrolyte loss from vaporization or
redistribution within the cell stack, and reduced corrosion of cell materials.
The membranes of choice in the majority of PEM fuel cells have been based on
perfluorosulfonic acid polymers. When considered for use in direct methanol-air
fuel cells, the greatest limitations of the perfluorosulfonic acid membranes are
their cost, the rate of methanol transport across the membrane, and the
requirement to maintain hydration of the membrane. The incompatibility of
perfluorosulfonic acid membranes with methanol leads to a limited lifetime of
the fuel cell as the membrane dissolves. Phase I will develop a solid polymer
electrolyte that is not based on perfluorosulfonic acid polymers like Nafion,
for application in direct methanol-air fuel cells. This non-perfluorosulfonic
acid-based PEM will have high proton transport rates, will not transport
methanol, will be stable in the presence of methanol, will be easy to process,
and will operate at higher temperatures where carbon monoxide is less of a
problem for the catalyst. This new solid polymer electrolyte material is
expected to find use in PEM-based, direct methanol-air fuel cells, that would
power the electric-car Next Generation Vehicle (NGV). Other potential
applications include its use in polymer electrolyte batteries, electrochemical
sensors, polymer-based acid catalysts, and chlor-alkali membranes.
