This award provides stipends and other supporting services for scholars in one-
year residence as Fellows of the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral
Sciences, Stanford, California. The objective of the project is to foster the
advancement of knowledge generated by scholars conducting basic research in the
behavioral sciences. The Center's structure and procedures provide an
environment that is conducive to scholarly productivity as well as
interdisciplinary exchange and collaboration. Fellows are chosen on the basis of
their academic accomplishment and promise. The research they conduct at the
Center is of their own choice and design. The Center organizes seminars,
encourages the formation of informal groups, and plans common meals, all
designed to promote intellectual interaction among Fellows. The Center's
environment is designed to promote full-time research, and to minimize
distractions from and interruptions to productive scientific work.
