PI plans to drill the K-T transition in the Brazos River area in order to
recover a series &lt;br/&gt;of cores that span the late Maastrichtian and early
Paleocene, including the K-T boundary &lt;br/&gt;horizon, the Iridium layer and
the Chicxulub event strata at a minimal cost of $15,000. The &lt;br/&gt;Brazos
River sequence can provide a critical source of data that has the potential to
solve the &lt;br/&gt;current controversy over the age of the Chicxulub impact,
as well as the nature of the mass &lt;br/&gt;extinction in the marine realm.
Scientific analyses will be carried out by an international team led by GK and
including scientists from the US, France, Spain, Germany and Switzerland, and
will include microfossil biostratigraphies (foraminifera, nannofossils,
palynomorphs), sequence stratigraphy, mineralogy, stable isotopes, trace
elements, PGEs and Iridium analysis. These studies will have a broad impact on
K-T research and will provide one of the most complete and comprehensive
datasets for the K-T transition thanks to the unparalelled preservation of
carbonate in these sediments. &lt;br/&gt;
