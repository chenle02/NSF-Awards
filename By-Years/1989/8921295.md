The primary objective of this U.S.-Poland research between Dr. Hans-Rudolf Wenk
of the University of California, Berkeley, and Dr. Jan Pospiech of the Polish
Academy of Sciences' Institute for Metals Research is to advance quantitative
texture analysis of deformed materials by extending the tomography algorithm of
Pawlich-Pospiech (PP) to low crystal and triclinic sample symmetry. The material
chosen for emphasis is quartz which is of great tectonic importance in the
earth's crust. Its textures also vary greatly in geological conditions.
Together, the researchers plan to measure pole figures on deformed quartzites
from different classical localities and prepare a catalog of ODFs with the PP
method. Results should provide a more quantitative interpretation of quartz
textures in terms of their geophysical deformation history. This project in
geophysics fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by
enabling leading researchers in the United States and Poland to combine
complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and
competence in the field of basic scientific research on the basis of equality,
reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.
