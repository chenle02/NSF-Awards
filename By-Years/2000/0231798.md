This award supports the intial phase of a planned 4 year project that seeks to
investigate, develop, and report on the technical and scientific merit of
designing and deploying, at scale, very small integrated environmental
monitoring systems. These will consist of integrated digital radios, sensors,
and power systems that are able to link to the internet for bi-directional data
flow, and to link to such projected research networks as the planned national
ecological observatory network (NEON). This entire project has as its goal the
development of an entirely new scalable paradigm of no-license networked
wireless connectivity. The initial work, to be funded through this award, will
entail developing design parameters for classes of very small radios integrated
with networking protocols, miniaturized configurable processors, interchangeable
sensors, and advanced power supplies. An important component of the effort will
be a first-hand assessment of the needs of field researchers working in a
variety of ecosystems and physical environments. This project,which is made
possible by recent advances in electromagnetic wave propagation and evolving
rules for no-license use of digital radios, has the potential to give access to
principal researchers, collaborators, students, and the general public to raw,
as well as processed and stored, field data - in the form of numbers, audio, and
video. It will also introduce large numbers of people to the potential of
advanced wireless technology for science.
