It is proposed to carry out collaborative investigations involving scientists
at the University of Rochester, and from the General Physics Institute in
Moscow, USSR. Investigations will be carried out on several topics of common
interest including: 1.) Multiphoton ionization and electron scattering
processes, and 2.) Strong-field radiative effects in atoms.
