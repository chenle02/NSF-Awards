This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In humans and other animals, acoustic
communication often takes place in large social groups or "networks" comprising
multiple signalers and receivers. In such environments, the background noise
generated by simultaneously signaling individuals can impair or "mask" the
perception of signals by intended receivers. Auditory masking, in turn, can lead
to communication errors. In humans, such errors commonly lead to the
misunderstanding of speech in noisy social settings. This project tests the
hypothesis that receivers possess psychological mechanisms that function to
ameliorate the negative impacts of masking noise by exploiting predictable
features of the noise itself. This hypothesis will be tested using frog
communication as a model. During their breeding season, male frogs aggregate in
choruses and produce loud advertisement calls to attract females. The objectives
of the project are to understand how female frogs exploit acoustic features of
the noise of a chorus (i) to better recognize the mating calls of their own
species, (ii) to discriminate among the calls of their own species and different
species, and (iii) to discriminate between preferred and non-preferred males of
their own species. The project integrates current paradigms in animal behavior
and hearing research and could transform the way research on receiver psychology
and communication networks informs the study of human hearing, speech
perception, and auditory neuroscience. More broadly, the project will engage the
public in the process of scientific inquiry and discovery through the
development of a new multi-media exhibit on frogs at a natural history museum
and the involvement of citizen scientists in the collection of raw data. The
project will also enhance undergraduate and graduate education by developing new
project-based learning exercises, a writing-enriched curriculum, and by training
graduate students from multiple underrepresented groups in science.
