9971417 Marker The field of logarithmic-exponential series was introduced by van
den Dries, Macintyre, and Marker to study the field of real numbers with
exponentiation. This field has a natural derivation and provides a useful
algebraic framework for asymptotic analysis. For differential equations over the
real numbers, there seems to be a strong connection between having formal
solutions in the logarithmic-exponential series and having real non-oscillating
solutions at infinity. Marker will continue to study this connection. Marker
will also work on more general problems in the model theory of differential
fields. This is a fascinating area requiring a sophisticated mixture of ideas
from stability theory, differential algebra, and algebraic geometry. In
particular, he hopes to work on problems in differential Galois theory and on
applying geometric ideas of Hrushovski to understand the geometric behavior of
solutions of generic equations. In recent years, tools from mathematical logic
have provided new insights into problems in classical mathematics. Model
theoretic methods have been remarkably successful in proving new results on the
geometry of solution sets to exponential algebraic equations and general
algebraic differential equations. This work has already found applications in
asymptotic analysis, control theory, micro-local analysis, number theory and
neural networks. One aspect of Marker's work attempts to use logical and
algebraic tools to understand the asymptotic behavior of solutions to
differential equations. Another aspect is attempting to understand the geometry
of the solution sets to very general differential equations. ***
