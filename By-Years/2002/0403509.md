This dissertation proposal in the social science field of International
Relations to do research on the Inuit Circumpolar Conference in order to better
understand Arctic indigenous politics and how it influences global political
development. To test the standing theory of state-centric approaches to
international politics, the research will focus on three Inuit entities, the
ICC, Nunavut, and Greenland Home Rule. Data will be gathered through archival
research and formal and informal interviews in order to shed light on the
dynamic process of transnational Inuit identity and autonomy through socio-
political discourse and the legitimization of indigenous, non-state collective
authority within nation state systems.
