This proposal will analyze the structure of moduli spaces, i.e., versions of
parameter spaces, in the context of superstrings propagating on Calabi-Yau
manifolds. Three moduli spaces will be considered: the space of N=(2,2)
superconformal field theories, which relates directly to the moduli space of the
Calabi Yau threefolds; the space of N=(0,2) superconformal field theories, which
extends this notion to something closer to real physics and is associated with
the moduli spaces of vector bundles; and D-branes on a fixed Calabi Yau manifold
which is associated to the moduli space of stable objects in the derived
category. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Superstring theory is a model of fundamental
physics expected to yield a unified description of fundamental particle physics
and the structure of spacetime. While this theory has yet to make contact with
experimental physics, its impact and success in field of mathematics in areas
such as algebraic geometry is beyond doubt. The proposed research intends to
both build on established links between methods of theoretical physics and
geometry, and pursue as yet unexplored connections. The main notion explored in
this proposal is the idea of a set of all possible mathematically consistent
theories. This notion can be pursued in the language of either theoretical
physics or mathematics. Comparisons between these languages then often yields
new ideas and results.
