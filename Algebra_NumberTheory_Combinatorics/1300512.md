This proposal brings together a set of problems aimed at integrating three
seemingly different areas in combinatorial representation theory: centralizer
algebras, Kronecker products and subalgebras of the symmetric group algebra. A
fundamental open problem in combinatorial representation theory is to describe
the multiplicities in the decomposition of the tensor product of two irreducible
representations of the symmetric group. These multiplicities are called the
Kronecker coefficients. The problem of finding a combinatorial interpretation
for these coefficients has been open for nearly a hundred years and is one of
the main problems in combinatorial representation theory. In a new development
the PI and collaborators have established a new connection of this problem to
the partition algebra, a centralizer algebra of the symmetric group. The PI will
use this new connection to study several outstanding open problems related to
the Kronecker coefficients. The PI will also continue her contributions to
combinatorial algebras, which are algebras that can be described via
combinatorial methods, e.g., the descent and peak algebras. The significance of
the descent algebras arise from their applications to noncommutative and quasi-
symmetric functions, and from their connections to the ring of representations
of the symmetric group. In this project, the PI proposes to investigate new
combinatorial algebras and to use centralizer algebras to better understand the
existing combinatorial algebras.

This research is in the general area of algebraic combinatorics. Algebraic
objects are often complex and difficult to understand. Combinatorics help make
abstract algebraic objects more concrete so that they become more accessible and
can be more easily used in other fields. This is achieved through efficient
algorithms and elementary models which give insight into the properties of
algebraic objects. The proposed projects tackle deep and important problems that
will advance the understanding of many fields, including quantum information
theory, complexity theory, and algorithms. The results will have applications
that would span many fields from physics and chemistry to computer science. In
addition, the proposed research is of broad interest in mathematics to those
studying symmetric functions, Lie theory, quantum groups, algebraic geometry,
low dimensional topology and mathematical physics.
