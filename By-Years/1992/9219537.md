This research will map the orientation and extent of anisotropy in both the
suboceanic and subcontinental upper mantle. The analysis will be done by means
of differences between azimuthal velocity variations of the two quasi-shear
phases produced by shear wave incidence on an anisotropic medium. The primary
dataset will be intermediate-period and broadband records from global digital
catalogs and digitized long-period records from the WWSSN. Preliminary analysis
of S and SS phases that traverse the North Atlantic shows potential examples of
shear-wave splitting that support the presence of upper mantle anisotropy.
