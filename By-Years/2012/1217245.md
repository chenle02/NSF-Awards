The central theme of this project is research into properties and applications
of polar codes, a new method of coding information for transmission over noisy
channels that for the first time realizes the full potential of Shannon's
theorems that relate to data rate and transmission reliability. Polar codes have
been shown to advance a range of classical and new information-theoretic
problems that rely on efficient encoding of the data. This project addresses
properties of polar codes in nonbinary communication channels, the design of
optimal polarizing transformations, and applications to unequal error
protection, hierarchical source coding, broadcast channels, signal design, and
other problems of importance for network communication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
analysis of polar codes and their applications in this project relies on the
concept of ordered distances that have been shown to control the reliability of
transmitted symbols on nonbinary channels. Ordered distances contribute new
ideas to the study of linear codes and related concepts such as multipartite and
hierarchical secret sharing schemes. The project draws on these ideas to study
new algebraic polarization transformations as well as the advances in the theory
of linear code-based constructions for a number of models of practical
communication systems.
