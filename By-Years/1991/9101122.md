This grant will enable the American Association for the Advancement of Science
to confront one area in the impending crisis in the science and engineering
workforce through a long-term project to explore barriers for students with
disabilities in engineering education. The project will work with deans and
faculties of schools of engineering to develop strategies for recruitment and
retention and to identify assistive technology and other support services that
give easier access to the educational process. Six schools of engineering will
be selected as sites for model projects in recruitment and retention of students
with disabilities. A parallel effort will assess methods of date collection on
disabled students and develop survey questions that can be directed at
engineering schools. Successful strategies will be disseminated through a
variety of networks. At the end of the five year project, it is anticipated that
many of the strategies will be institutionalized in schools of engineering and,
data on retention of students with disabilities will be included in all human
resources studies.
