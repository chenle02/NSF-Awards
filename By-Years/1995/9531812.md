CTS - 9531812 Gregory Payne University of Maryland, Baltimore County ABSTRACT
The project is and attempt to combine ion-pair extraction with adsorption as a
means to lower the costs of recovering polar organics form aqueous solution.
Separation selectivities may be improved significantly be y exploiting specific
interaction mechanisms and coupling multiple interactions. The proposed work
involves the use of quaternary ammonium extractants for the ion-pair extraction
of organic acids, and combing of ion-pair extraction with adsorption onto the
polar sites of an acrylic ester sorbent. The hydrophobic and electrostatic
interactions associated with ion-pair extraction will be coupled to polar
adsorptive interactions. The goals are to quantify the role of each interaction
mechanism and to assess the separations potential of coupling interactions for
model systems. Enhancing product purity, minimizing waste and increasing energy
efficiency provide strong motivation for this project. The results may lead to
improved separation techniques for manufacturing commodity chemicals and
biomolecules.
