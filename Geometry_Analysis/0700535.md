Dr. Jie Qing proposes to study various problems in conformal geometry. Recent
development in the study of the scattering matrix in providing rather global way
to understand the holography principle in physics seems very fascinating and
promising. Dr. Jie Qing proposes in this project to investigate several aspects
of the holography principle, particularly the so-called AdS/CFT correspondence,
related to conformal geometry. These provide great sources to find good global
conformal invariants in conformal geometry and is believed to be rather
comprehensive than ever.

The proposed research is to study the holography principles that relate quantum
gravitation theory and some conformal field theory. It has become a part the
field where mathematicians and physicists can interact very well. One broader
impact of this proposal is that advancements in this field of research will
greatly improve our understanding of the nature in theory. The other broader
impact of this proposal is to the education. The proposed research project
incorporates research activities as a part of the undergraduate and graduate
education programs in the department of mathematics at UC Santa Cruz.
