This award supports the study of homological aspects of the representation
theory of algebras. In particular, the principal investigator will study the
cohomology ring of group rings, of finite dimensional algebras and of graded
algebras. He will also study the structure of Hopf algebras and the homological
properties of the quotients of the letter-place algebras which arise in the
invariant theory of the symmetric groups. This project also involves the
continued development a symbolic algebra package for noncommutative rings which
will be used extensively for this research project. This project is in the
general area of noncommutative algebra and the computer-aided computational
aspects of this field. There is a growing interest in using computers to answer
theoretical questions in algebra and conversely, algebra is quite useful for the
development of algorithms. This project makes serious use of both the theory and
practice of symbolic calculations to solve real problems in noncommutative
algebra.
