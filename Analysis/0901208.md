This proposal describes research plans that are aimed at answering an array of
questions in ergodic theory, harmonic analysis and arithmetic combinatorics that
are of great interest in modern analysis. The main common feature of all these
problems resides in their multilinear nature. Of particular interest when
dealing with a multilinear operator acting on some product of Lebesgue spaces is
to understand the range of indices for which it is well behaved. In this
proposal the focus is mainly on almost everywhere convergence, and thus
inherently on the boundedness of the associated maximal operators. A famous
unresolved problem regards pointwise convergence for the bilinear ergodic
averages associated with commuting transformations. The analysis of this
question revealed deep connections with a two dimensional version of the
bilinear Hilbert transform and with Carleson's theorem on the pointwise
convergence of Fourier series. Another interesting circle of questions arises in
the analysis of bilinear polynomial averages. Recent progress from arithmetic
combinatorics, combined with multi-scale time-frequency techniques is likely to
shed light on all these issues.

This proposed research is at the cutting edge of what is now being done in
dynamical systems, harmonic analysis and arithmetic combinatorics. It is
expected that the resolution of the questions advanced in this proposal will
further the mathematical community's understanding of the connections between
these areas, in particular between processes in harmonic analysis and their
analogues in ergodic theory. The nature of this research makes it also likely
for our investigation to shed yet more light on some of the tools that are used
in other areas of science, such as signal processing. The research project that
is proposed in this grant will lead to interactions between the PI and
mathematicians from other universities with whom part of the investigation might
be conducted.
