This award will support the construction of a pulse-accelerated flow
spectrophotometer for use in the study of rapid light-induced electron transfer
reactions. This type of instrumentation allows the recording of spectra for
species with lifetimes as short as 1/100,000-th of a second and the measurement
of rates of reactions which occur over such a short time span, but is not yet
commercially available. Nearly all light-driven energy conversion processes rely
at some point on electron transfer reactions, including photosynthesis. One of
the most promising schemes for the use of synthetic substances for light-driven
energy conversion involves the use of molecules containing two metals. The
absorption of light causes an electron to be transferred between the metal atoms
to create a high energy molecule from which electrical or chemical energy may be
extracted as the electron returns to its preferred location. Two new approaches
are being used in this project for the direct assessment of thermal
intramolecular electron transfer rates. The first of these makes use of
preferential solvation to interconvert mixed-valence redox isomers of
unsymmetrical binuclear metal complexes. Pulse accelerated flow
spectrophotometry is being used to time-resolve the redox isomerization process.
The second approach is based on light-induced (pulsed laser) metal-to-metal
charge transfer in the near IR to create high energy isomers, again in mixed-
valence complexes. Relaxation by electron transfer to create low energy isomers
can be followed in the visible by transient absorbance spectroscopy. This
project is supported in part by a Presidential Young Investigator award.
