Coral reefs maintain the highest biological diversity in the ocean and are also
among the most threatened ecosystems on earth. This award provides funding for a
new Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program at the Central
Caribbean Marine Institute (CCMI) located on Little Cayman Islands. The CCMI REU
program will provide a unique opportunity for 24 undergraduate students over
three years to explore fundamental ecological processes critical to maintaining
coral reef biodiversity and resilience. Participating students will have a rare
opportunity to conduct research on a small remote Caribbean island with low
local development pressure. Coral reefs at this site are recovering from the
1998 El Nino event during which high sea surface temperatures killed corals on a
global scale. The processes that are driving this recovery are still unknown.
Therefore, this REU affords rich and timely opportunities to closely examine
ecosystem stress and recovery from a number of perspectives. The
multidisciplinary team of scientific mentors included in this REU are
researching topics aimed at understanding global and local threats from climate
change and ocean acidification (OA), and physical, chemical, and ecological
disturbances on coral reefs. Experiments and field work examining fundamental
organismal, community and ecosystem functions will be integral to this research.
The research conducted by REU undergraduate participants will advance our
knowledge of the processes that drive coral reef resilience to disturbances on
multiple spatial and temporal scales. Co-funding for this award is provided by
the Directorate for Biological Sciences.
