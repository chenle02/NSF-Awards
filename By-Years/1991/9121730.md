This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in the
general area of spectrometry in the subfield of chemical instrumentation. Recent
years have seen significant advances in light detection technology and computer
processing power. Very sensitive two-dimensional array detectors, e.g. CCD
arrays, and fast computers capable of processing vast quantities of near real-
time data are available at moderate cost. The missing building block in the
design and development of a spectrometer that can take advantage of these
technologies is an optical system capable of two dimensional imaging of high
quality, particularly in a compact short focal-length configuration. Chromex has
developed a method of producing high quality aspheric optics, the essential
optical components for stigmatic imaging capability. This technology will be
applied in the investigation of a full-spectrum multiple-input stigmatic-
imaging spectrograph design. The spectrograph will be small (100mm focal length)
and extremely rugged. Fiber optic interfaces will be investigated that will
allow up to eight simultaneous inputs. The Phase I research established that the
concept is feasible. Further, the Phase I results showed that an imaging
spectrograph of this concept can be expected to provide a significant gain in
signal-to-noise over conventional designs. The research in this Phase II project
will result in a spectrograph with unprecedented capabilities. This research
will result in the development of a spectrometer with capabilities that are not
currently available. The ability to measure spectra from multiple in-situ
sources will provide an instrument useful in remote applications employing
multiple sensors such as process and combustion monitoring.
