With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
(CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at Florida Institute of Technology
will acquire a 300 MHz NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will enable researchers
to carry out research in a number of areas, including studies on a) the
structure of annulated and metal-complexed paracyclophanes; b) synthesis of a
new class of natural products (the isoprostanes); c) synthetic organic
chemistry; and d) polymer degradation and flammability.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of
the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the
structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to
characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the
dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-
art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier
research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic
organic chemistry and materials science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
