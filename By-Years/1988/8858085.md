This Presidential Young Investigator Award is for support of Masaru Tomita at
Carnegie Mellon University. Tomita's research centers on computer systems for
natural language processing, especially multi-lingual translation systems and
real time natural language processing systems. His goals include the development
of knowledge- based translation systems for English, Japanese, French, and
German. The significance of this research is that automatic processing of
natural language is a vital component in computer systems interface for the
future. Multilingual translation systems have fundamental theoretical and
economic importance. The Presidential Young Investigator Awards provide research
funding to attract and support young researchers of the highest quality in the
university environment.
