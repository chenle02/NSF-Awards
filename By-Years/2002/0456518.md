EAR-0310096&lt;br/&gt;Bonadonna&lt;br/&gt;Highly explosive basaltic eruptions
constitute an important hazard to society that is often underestimated. Some are
now recognized as extremely violent with destructive effects covering tens of
thousand of square kilometers. Examples include the 122 BC eruption of Etna
(Italy), the 1790 AD Keanakakoi eruption of Kilauea (Hawaii), the 1886 eruption
of Tarawera (New Zealand) and the Fontana Lapilli eruption of Masaya volcano
(Nicaragua) (&gt;20ka BP). The Fontana Lapilli eruption produced the largest
scoria-fall deposit known, and characterization of this deposit is crucial to
constraining the magnitude and intensity of such eruptions. This project will
(i) remap the tephra-fall deposit, (ii) investigate new techniques for
understanding grain-size distribution using exponential and power-law methods to
estimate deposit volume, (iii) infer the column height and (iv) simulate the
mechanisms of scoria-fall using a numerical model for tephra dispersal from
strong plumes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
