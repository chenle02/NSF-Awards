This award will support the travel costs of U.S. scientists to travel to
Weilburg, Germany to participate in the Workshop on Numerical Modeling of
Lithospheric and Mantle Dynamics. The mantle dynamics component of this workshop
is part of a series specifically aimed at detailed assessment of numerical
techniques in simulating mantle dynamics. For the first time this group is being
expanded to include scientists involved in the numerical simulation of
lithospheric processes.
