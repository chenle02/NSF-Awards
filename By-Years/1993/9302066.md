Information on water flow in coral reef environments has generally been done to
quantify mass transport across reefs or to identify important processes
generating nutrient flux from reefs. This project will investigate the effects
of water flow on several aspects of the feeding biology of corals. Field
measurements of feeding rates on four species of corals will be made with prey
sampling by an automated pump/sampler and field flume that allows concurrent
measurements of water flow and prey availability. Feeding experiments will be
manipulated by varying flow rate, prey type, and food availability and will be
conducted over several days with different flow conditions. Capture events and
prey type, and food availability and will be conducted over several days with
different flow conditions. Capture events and prey escape behavior will be
filmed using underwater video. Another important aspect of feeding biology in
coral reefs is the small scale water flow around corals in the field. This will
be accomplished with three self- contained underwater thermistors flowmeters
with 2 mm spatial resolution, based on the design of LaBarber and Vogel (1976).
The data collected will be used to characterize the general flow regime at the
site, providing new information about the flow environment of coral reefs in
Jamaica and other sites in the Caribbean.
