The object of this research is to find a suitable theory which can describe the
size distribution of raindrops as a function of time. The principle effects
which must be included are drop coalescence, breakup, evaporation, and
sedimentation. Particular emphasis will be devoted to the consequences of small
variations in the fragment distribution function; the ensuing analysis should
establish the robustness of the breakup formulation.
