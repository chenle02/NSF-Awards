The ARGO II fiber-optic near-bottom optical-acoustic system will be used to
survey the narrow axial zone of the ultrafast spreading East Pacific Rise at 17
degrees south. The purpose is to test the hypothesis that along-strike thermal
gradients set up the segmented pattern of magma supply exert primary control on
the distribution and types of hydrothermal vents and vent biota, as well as on
varioation in fine-scale volcanotectonic characteristics along the axial zone.
