9410078 Deshmukh This research addresses the problem of decision making
difficulty or complexity in a manufacturing system characterized by the
integration of several subsystems. The underlying premise to the proposed study
is that integration of multiple functions and elements in manufacturing
increases a system's complexity or the difficulty of making decisions regarding
the system. Specifically, the research will define complexity, establish metrics
for measuring complexity, study the relationship between design and control
parameters and complexity, and suggest methods for controlling complexity. The
outcome of the research will improve the understanding of the effects of
integration on decision making difficulty in manufacturing systems. Furthermore,
the quality of decisions made as the complexity of a system changes can be
analyzed and perhaps, have confidence levels attached to them. Improved
understanding of the effect of integration on manufacturing complexity can lead
to better modeling and analysis of manufacturing systems.
