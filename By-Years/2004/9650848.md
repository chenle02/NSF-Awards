This project is upgrading laboratories in the upper-division biology core
courses, chemistry, and the undergraduate student research program. These
objectives are being met with the acquisition of fluorescence detection
equipment that builds on and complements existing instrumentation. Laboratory
activities, both improved and added, include B-galactosidase expression, DNA
characterization, adenosine triphosphate measurement, cellular ion changes,
chlorophyll identification, quantitation of nucleic acids, protein chemistry,
enzyme kinetics, receptor assays, chemical experiments, and a number of
techniques for undergraduate research projects. Also, implementation of these
new laboratory experiences will expose students to sophisticated techniques that
are rapidly becoming contemporary in biology and chemistry.
