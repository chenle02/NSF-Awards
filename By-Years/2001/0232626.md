This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop technology
to prevent nozzle wear in abrasive water jets used for machining (e.g.
automotive/aerospace components). Nozzle wear limits the life and accuracy of
jet cutting and currently requires entrainment of abrasives downstream of the
nozzle in a larger mixing tube. The new method consists of nozzles made of a
porous material surrounded by reservoirs containing high viscosity lubricant,
and exposed to the pressure that drives the slurry in the nozzle. This method
extends the nozzle life and allows premixing of the particles prior to injection
(abrasive suspension jets), enabling operation at lower pressures, cutting of
harder materials and smaller jets (micro machining). The commercial potential of
using this diverse technology by both small machine shops to automotive and
aircraft industries is very appealing. Wear of the nozzle or mixing tube in
present systems is a major problem affecting all the applications of jet
cutting.
