This research provides performance metrics for cooperative research centers that
enhance translational research through partnerships formed by government,
industry and academia. Centers are part of complex ecosystems and vary greatly
in the type of science conducted, organizational structures and expected
outcomes. The ability to realize their objectives depends on transparent
measurement systems to assist in decision making in research translation.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research introduces a hierarchical decision model
that uses both quantitative and qualitative metrics. A generalizable model is
developed based upon program goals. The results are validated through
consultation with experts. The method is validated using data from the National
Science Foundation's industry/university cooperative research centers (IUCRC).
The methodology provides a basis for a generalizable model and measurement
system that compares performance of university science and engineering focused
research centers supported by industry and government.
