This award supports a new Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at
Boston University. The site will support eight undergraduate students per summer
for ten weeks of research in various topics in physics. The program aims to give
students at a critical point in their education meaningful research experiences
grounded in physics but with strong links to other physical sciences, including
electrical, mechanical, and computer engineering, materials science, and
chemistry. The specific components will include 1) research experience working
in groups with peers and senior scientists on specific projects; 2) instruction
in the culture, methods, and ethics of scientific research; and 3) preparation
for a future career in which they will be interacting with colleagues coming
from a wide range of backgrounds: intellectual, educational, geographical and
cultural. In addition, the program will be linked to BU's internal Undergraduate
Research Opportunities (UROP) program so that the REU students will be members
of a larger community of student researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The core of
the participants' experience will be mentored research within individual
research groups. The groups' interests span the range of research in academic
physics: from particle physics to biophysics to condensed matter and materials
physics to optical physics and photonics. The faculty leading these individual
research groups are distinguished scholars at various stages of their careers
but all have experience mentoring undergraduates. Carefully structured plenary
activities will complement the individual research experiences and provide the
students with an understanding of the need for teamwork and interdisciplinary
awareness in their future careers. This award is funded through The Division of
Physics and the Division of Materials Research in NSF's Mathematical and
Physical Sciences Directorate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
