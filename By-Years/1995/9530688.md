This project will analyze trace elements (Ba, Al, Ti, Fe and Mn) in particles
that settle through waters of the Southern Ocean. These trace elements are
hypothesized to be both tracers of ocean productivity and indicators of carbon
transfer from the upper ocean to the deep ocean and the sediments. Some
elements, particularly the ratio Al/Ti, may reflect productivity linked to
siliceous plankton. Sequential leaching combined with statistical analyses will
be used to identify the elements associated with different sediment components.
