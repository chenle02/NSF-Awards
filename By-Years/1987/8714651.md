The possibility of using electromagnetic radiation to produce localized heat
which can kill malignant tissue is well known. It is necessary to control the
heating so as not to injure healthy tissue near the malignant tissue. This can
be done by focusing the radiation using appropriate antenna. This proposal will
provide the necessary fundamental engineering research that will allow
optimization of the antenna placement.
