This research seeks to prepare novel main-chain and side-chain liquid
crystalline polymers and to incorporate these into diblock copolymers with one
conventional coil block. The synthetic approach will utilize anionic
polymerization techniques so as to produce well-defined model materials. Liquid
crystal block/coil block copolymers and their blends with liquid crystal
homopolymer and coil homopolymer as well as with small molecule chromophores and
mesogens will be characterized at several length scales using microscopy and
scattering techniques. In particular, their self- assembly into long-range
ordered arrays of microdomains will be examined in light of the influence of a
main-chain or side-chain liquid crystal block on the nature of the intermaterial
dividing surface. Biased self-assembly due to the presence of an applied field
during the microphase separation transition (e.g. electric, magnetic, and
hydrodynamic flow fields) will be undertaken so as to produce single-crystal-
texture samples for assessment as nonlinear optical materials. This is a
Materials Synthesis and Processing activity jointly carried out by Christopher
K. Ober of Cornell University and Edwin L. Thomas of Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.
