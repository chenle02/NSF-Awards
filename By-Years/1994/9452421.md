9452421 Chell The faculty in the Department of Mathematics at Carthage College
are enhancing the instruction in two entry-level mathematics offerings with the
addition of a collaborative learning/Macintosh laboratory. Classes in the
Calculus I-II sequence and the general education Applied Mathematics course are
held in the laboratory so that combined approaches to solving mathematical
problems may be used. The course materials call for simultaneously incorporating
collaborative methods, applying them to reality-based problems, and using
technological means for solution. The lab is available to student use outside of
the classtime for working on assigned team projects. The Applied Mathematics
course uses the Annenberg project For All Practical Purposes text. The
laboratory facilities allow the addition of: a statistics package and analysis
of large data sets, team projects which use technology to analyze the results of
students' own data collections, a geometry and a drawing package to create and
analyze symmetry and repeated patterns, and a spreadsheet for the conjecture and
analysis of growth functions. In addition to the syllabus additions, the
collaboration experience gives students the opportunity to take ownership of
their mathematics through group discussion and debate. The Calculus courses are
enhanced by the natural incorporation of symbolic computing as a daily activity
of the students in the course. The collaboration experience has the same goals
as in the Applied Mathematics course and, in addition, it allows students to
learn the syntax of the technology more efficiently than by individual pursuit.
Team projects follow the form of several successful pilot projects, including:
designing a space capsule with certain flotation properties; finding the effect
of putting a spin on a volleyball serve; determining schedules of dosages for
medicine; and analyzing the movement of recording tape over a tape hea d. The
laboratory/classroom is designed with careful attention to the learning process.
