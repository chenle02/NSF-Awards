In recent decades, formal methods have produced many successes in proving
properties of hardware and software artifacts. However, the lack of general
efficient methods to verify designs that involve nonlinear arithmetic --
arithmetic that involves integer multiplication -- has been a major impediment
to the effectiveness of verification methods in a broad array of applications.
Among many other applications, computations that depend on nonlinear arithmetic
are at the heart of CPU designs, cryptography, and structures for efficient
storage of data for easy retrieval. This project is focused on achieving
efficient verification of hardware and software designs that include nonlinear
arithmetic. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project explores methods for extending
the most widely effective class of current verification methods, which at their
heart use Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solvers, to handle designs that include
integer multiplication. The investigators have shown that certain properties of
integer multiplication circuits that have been conjectured to be representative
of the difficulty of verifying nonlinear arithmetic can be efficiently verified
in systems of inference that capture the capabilities of state-of-the-art SAT
solvers. This project leverages and extends these theoretical insights to
develop practical methods that will succeed in a broad range of verification
tasks for software and hardware artifacts that use nonlinear arithmetic. The
research results will be widely disseminated in open source tools for people to
use for verification leading to software and hardware with a higher level of
trustworthiness, including in safety-critical applications that people rely on
every day.
