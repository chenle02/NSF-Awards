9415263 Young This award supports a 12-month Japan Society for the Promotion of
Science Postdoctoral Fellowship for Dr. Timothy Young, Department of Physics and
Astronomy, University of Oklahoma at the University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan. Dr.
Young will work with Dr. Ken'ichi Nomoto in the Department of Astronomy on a
research project entitled, "A Parameter and Constraint Study of Type II
Supernova Light Curves and Abundance." A systematic parameter study of optical,
X-ray, and gamma-ray light curves and elemental abundance rations of Type II
supernova (SNe will be carrried out by the research team of Timothy Young and
Ken'ichi Nomoto. The optical light curve gives information about the progenitor
star and the explosion dynamics. For SNe 1987A and 1993J, X-ray and gamma-ray
light curves added additional constraints to fitting the optical light curves.
For this study a circumstellar medium will be added to the presupernova models
of Nomoto (1988). They will be exploded in a hydrodynamical code coupled with
the Monte Carlo analysis used by Kumagai et al. (1988) in order to calculate a
grid of light curves and abundance rations from numerous progenitor models. This
data will be used to predict SNe light curves to be observed by the satellites
Ginga and ASCA. Current ASCA observations of many galactic and LMC/SMC supernova
remnants (SNRs) will provide information on abundance ratios and mixing,
constraining progenitor models and explosion mechanisms. *** ***
