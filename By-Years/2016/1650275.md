This is a collaborative effort between scientists from 5 western universities
whose research is focused on the study of the emissions from western U.S.
wildfire plumes. A sampling strategy will be employed using a wide range of
instrumentation on the NSF/NCAR C-130 aircraft to study atmospheric chemical
reactions occurring in wildfire plumes. This field campaign is being conducted
in collaboration with related campaigns supported by other agencies: the FIREX
campaign by NOAA and the FIREChem mission by NASA. These campaigns are planned
to take place in the late summer of 2018. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Western
wildfire Experiment for Cloud chemistry, Aerosol absorption and Nitrogen (WE-
CAN) campaign addresses scientific questions related to fixed nitrogen,
absorbing aerosols, and cloud activation and chemistry in wildfire plumes. This
research focuses on the first day of plume evolution following initial
emissions. The chemistry and microphysics occurring during this time impacts the
partitioning of reactive nitrogen, alters cloud chemistry and nucleation, and
largely determines aerosol scattering and absorption.
