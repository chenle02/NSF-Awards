This project will start a long term collaboration between the mathematics
department and the biology department at the University of Colorado-Boulder.
There is a tremendous amount of physiological data on the Mouthner nerve cell
that has been collected in the past twenty five years. This project will start
the development of a sophisticated mathematical and computational model of this
cell that will incorporate the known data. New computational methods will be
developed for massively parallel computers to model the&lt;br/&gt;dynamics of
this nerve cell. It is intended that this project will start a significant
program in computational neuroscience that will become an option for the Ph.D.
program in neuroscience at the University of Colorado. In addition, the
undergraduate research program that this project grew from will continue to
engage undergraduates in research in computational neuroscience. This IGMS
project is jointly supported by the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities
(OMA) and the Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS).&lt;br/&gt;
