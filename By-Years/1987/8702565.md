John Fay will carry out research into recent developments relating theta
functions and Riemann surfaces. This is an area which has flourished because of
its connections with the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili hierarchy of differential
equations and with string theory. It also has great intrinsic interest for
mathematics since it will contribute towards a theory of higher rank vector
bundles on Riemann surfaces. The research will center on Ray-Singer analytic
torsion as defined on the moduli spaces of vector bundles on Riemann surfaces.
This will include study of three aspects. The first concerns the holomorphic
factorization and vanishing properties of torsion on the Jacobi variety. The
second involves investigation of the explicit dependence of torsion on the
moduli of the Riemann surface. The final aspect will be concerned with the
properties of the generalized Szego kernel and theta- functions defined by
torsion for rank-two bundles.
