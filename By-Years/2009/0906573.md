This research facilitates the collection and analysis of radium isotope ratios
in high temperature and pressure hydrothermal submarine vent fluids collected
from the seafloor. These measurements will allow the crustal residence times of
the fluids to be determined, providing important information on the time scales
of fluid movement and water-rock interaction in ridge axis crust. Rock and fluid
samples from four major hydrothermal systems (East Pacific Rise, Lau Spreading
Center, Juan de Fuca Ridge, and Mid-Atlantic Ridge) on the mid-ocean ridge will
be analyzed. Resulting data are critical for the synthesis and integration of
rock and biological data for the Ridge 2000 program which focuses on three of
the four specified targeted sites. Owing to the rapid decay of radium in
hydrothermal fluids, the research to be a time critical study. Broader impacts
of the work include augmenting the Ridge 2000 dataset and incorporation of
results into undergraduate courses in oceanography at the University of Miami.
