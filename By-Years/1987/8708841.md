This project deals with radiation enhanced sintering of ceramics. The approach
is to neutron irradiate the ceramic powders to increase the defect concentration
which in turn would lead to radiation enhanced diffusion (RED). Experiments will
be conducted on the as received and irradiated AlN and Al2O3 to measure
radiation enhanced sintering (RES) from shrinkage rates and microstructural
observations, and to study the underlying basic phenomenon of RED using the
radiotracer sectioning technique. The results will be analyzed to identify the
parameters more critical to RED and RES. Sintering is the critical step in the
processing of ceramic materials. The strength and toughness of ceramics depend
on this. The Principal Investigator proposes a novel method of improving the
sintering of pure covalent ceramics (e.g., nitrides and carbides).
