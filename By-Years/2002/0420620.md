With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at Haverford College will acquire a liquid
chromatograph/mass spectrometer (LC/MS). This equipment will enhance research in
a number of areas including the synthesis of a) natural products; b) natural and
unnatural food additives; c) natural and designed peptide sequences to
understand protein folding and function and to develop new biomaterials; and d)
transition metal complexes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Liquid chromatography with
mass spectrometric detection (LC/MS) is an extremely powerful technique used for
the separation and analysis of complex mixtures. This instrument will
substantially strengthen scientific research at Haverford College, a primarily
undergraduate institution. These studies will have a solid impact in synthetic
chemistry and biochemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
