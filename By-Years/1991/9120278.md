This action provides partial support for the purchase of a massively parallel
computer, Maspar MP-1, and necessary peripheral equipment. A joint effort
between Electrical and Computer Engineering Department and the Aerospace
Engineering Department will be initiated to investigate the ability to map
algorithms onto massively parallel computers and scaling of performance. The
three areas from which problems will be selected for experiments are: control
systems and signal processing, 3-D/4-D image processing, and computational fluid
mechanics and aeroacoustics.
