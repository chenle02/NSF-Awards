"Epitransitional" geomagnetic fields (i.e, those which immediately precede or
follow polarity reversals) probably reflect changes in normally stable core
processes. They are therefore more likely to exhibit repeatable behavior than
the fields resulting from the less stable, more disorderly processes predominant
during the midpoints of reversals. Distinctive epitransitional field behavior is
apparent in the Steens Mountain transition zone, which shows 1) field dispersion
being high before the reversals and normal afterwards and 2) field intensity
steady before the reversal and oscillating afterwards. Work supported by the
Research Corporation shows that the dispersion of field directions follows
exactly the same pattern before and after an R-N reversal recorded in basaltic
flows on Kauai, Hawaii. The key question is whether the behavior of field
intensity is also repeated. Construction of an apparatus for paleointensity
experiments (funded by a RUI Research Instrumentation grant) has exhausted
summer salary support from the Research Corporation grant. This award provides
support for the paleointensity experiments and thus allow completion of the
Kauai project. Undergraduate students will continue to be involved in every
aspect of the study.
