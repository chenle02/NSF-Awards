9708975 Chang Structural health monitoring is an emerging technology which is
based on the smart structures concept by combing sensing technology with a
knowledge of material/structural damage characteristics to monitor the condition
of structures in real time while in service. The Objective of the workshop are
to assess the current state-of-the-art technologies related to the field, to
identify key and emerging issues in research and development, and to promote
exchanges and cross- fertilization among many disciplines. The conclusion of the
workshop will result in proceedings containing the discussion and presentation
of the workshop as well as the formation of a technical committee consisting of
key personnel from governments, industry, and academe. The committee will be
responsible for developing appropriate guidelines and recommendations for
government agencies and industries to further pursue structural health
monitoring development.
