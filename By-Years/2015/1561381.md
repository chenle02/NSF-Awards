The term smart market refers to a market design in which clearing must be
implemented by solving an optimization problem satisfying technical constraints
that cannot otherwise be met via more traditional market structures (e.g.
bilateral trading). All trading in a smart market is intermediated by a market
manager in charge of clearing. Examples include electricity markets (where
network capacity constraints must be satisfied while taking into account power
flow) and spectrum auctions for allocating channels (where combinatorial
optimization is needed to identify an efficient allocation). This project
addresses the problem of designing smart markets when the solution of a non-
trivial computational model has to be consulted to determine the feasibility of
a given allocation profile. Since such a model is not transparent to the market
manager, it is often referred to as a "black-box" model. As an example, the
project will focus on the allocation of spectrum access under signaling
technologies other than frequency division, which is an instance of this problem
because a precise determination of communication capacity can only be obtained
by consulting black-box models that take into account the effects of
interference amongst users.

This project will focus on the design of smart markets to ensure the efficient
allocation of black-box capacity under incomplete information regarding the
users' willingness to pay for capacity. The designs considered are iterative in
nature. The idea is to allow (at each iteration) a form of self-scheduling by
users onto available resources followed by a black-box evaluation of excess
capacity, which in turn informs price updates. A key design novelty pertains to
the use of different time-scales for pricing (fast) vs. capacity allocation
(slow) adjustments. Personalized incentives for each user (in the forms of
additional payments or transfers) guarantee that it is a dominant strategy for
users to truthfully report their demand throughout the process. Several
additional research directions including noisy black-box model and non-convex
feasible regions will be considered. Additionally, the application of the smart
market designs to electricity markets with high levels of renewable capacity
will be considered. If successful, the project will contribute to ensuring that
the market dispatch of available resources meets a certain reliability target
with highly intermittent nature of renewable output.
