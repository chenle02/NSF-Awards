This purpose of this award is to plan for the Hardwood Tree Improvement and
Regeneration Center at Purdue University to become a part of a multi-university
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center with the Tree Genetic
Engineering Research Center at the Oregon State University. Under the planning
grant, the members of both centers will be consulted both in writing and in
person, about specific research projects. A joint planning workshop will be held
at Purdue University to finalize the research projects and organization and
management of the two multi-university Centers.
