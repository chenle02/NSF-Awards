This grant provides support for the acquisition of a high frequency measurement
system for magnetic nanostructure research and student training at New York
University. This new system will be used to study the dynamics of magnetic
nanostructures and to train students in advanced magnetic materials measurement
techniques. Microwave radiation will be applied to magnetic nanostructures, with
the aim of probing these systems at the natural frequencies of their dynamics,
such as the frequency of quantum tunneling of magnetization and magnetic
relaxation phenomena. This measurement system will also be used with
miniaturized high sensitivity Hall-effect magnetometers, so that sample
magnetization can be monitored during the application of radiation, allowing
unique experimental studies of the magnetic properties of materials. It will
greatly enhance interdisciplinary projects focused on understanding the quantum
properties of chemically synthesized nanometer-sized magnets. Understanding the
properties of magnetic nanostructures is a major scientific challenge with
important implications for the miniaturization of magnetic storage technology.

The equipment will significantly enhance the research and educational
opportunities at New York University and the research capabilities available to
a multi-university interdisciplinary scientific collaboration. Physics and
chemistry graduate students will use this instrument in their thesis research.
Undergraduates and high school students will also participate in the
characterization of magnetic nanostructures at this advanced experimental
facility
