9320570 Ramirez The research proposed in this application is the study of an
intravascular hybrid artificial pancreas (HAP). The HAP consists of a
cylindrical inert housing enclosing a single, tubular hollow fiber membrane in a
shell-and-tube mass exchanger configuration. Islets can be inoculated into the
annular space through a port in the housing. HAPs have been shown by other
groups to reverse experimental diabetes in animals, but have not undergone
clinical trials to date. Thus, scale-up criteria based on engineering principles
are currently lacking. The goal of this project is to attain a more fundamental
understanding of the factors which determine the efficiency and durability of
insulin release from islets seeded in a HAP device. Specific aims are to: (1)
quantify the flow and solute resistance in vitro provided by both the membrane
and the seeded islets, (2) quantify the effect of membrane protein "fouling" in
vitro on the dynamics of solute transport within the HAP, (3) determine the
effect of islet packing density on the performance of seeded HAPS, (4) determine
the glucose- induced insulin response of seeded HAPS perfused with media
containing different oxygen concentrations, (5) test for periods of up to 2
months the best HAP configurations in a small group of pancreatectomized rhesus
monkeys, and (6) develop comprehensive theoretical models for analysis of the
various transport experiments proposed. ***
