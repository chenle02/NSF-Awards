9528286 Grassman Notre Dame College: Connection to the Internet Notre Dame
College of Ohio requests support from NSF for connection to the Ohio Academic
Resources Network (OARnet). OARnet, a midlevel network in the state of Ohio,
will provide operations management and information services and it will give the
campus access to the Internet, a collection of interoperable networks that
connect most research and education organizations in the United States. The
campus needs the Internet connections to be able to access information resources
throughout the state, the nation and the world. The connection will benefit the
faculty, staff students of the Notre Dame College campus as well as the
community in general.
