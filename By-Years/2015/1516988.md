This research project concerns mathematical and algorithmic developments for
image analysis (image compression, and the like). To compress or analyze images,
it is useful to decompose them into elementary building blocks that are
especially effective - in other words, it pays to use mathematical decomposition
tools that achieve high accuracy with relatively few coefficients. For instance,
in the transition from the JPEG standard to JPEG2000, the wavelet transform
replaced the discrete cosine transform because it provided a sparser
representation for images and because its performance degrades more gracefully
when bandwidth is variable. This project aims to develop methods for improved
sparse representation of images.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Curvelets and shearlets
constitute a variant on the wavelet approach that can be shown, mathematically,
to lead to even sparser representations for images. So far, they have not lived
up to this promise in practice -- the only implementations in existence have a
high overhead and a large redundancy factor. The Principal Investigator and her
collaborators have identified several approaches that they expect will provide
better basis constructions, which in turn will give better implementations, with
great potential for applications. These will be developed in this project.
