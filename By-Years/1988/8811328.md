This proposal requests funds to obtain a superminicomputer. The research
programs of the principal user group are directed at structural studies of
macromolecules and macromolecular assemblies. The major techniques to be
employed center around x-ray crystallographic and NMR-spectroscopic data
collection, interpretation, and molecular modelling studies. Recent developments
have increased the experimental information to an unprecedented extent. First,
the availability of multi-wire area detectors has increased the rate and quality
of x-ray data collection by a factor of at least 10 to 100. Second,
crystallization of very large macromolecular complexes has been possible on a
few cases. Third, with recent advances on NMR techniques it is now possible to
obtain a number of approximate interproton distances for small to medium-size
macromolecular sufficient to define the structures in solution. Fourth, progress
has been made in the area of computer simulation of macromolecules. All of this
combined implies that the experimental data analysis and interpretation clearly
becomes a bottleneck for our studies, and thus requires another major
computational upgrade of our facilities.
