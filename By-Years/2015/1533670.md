The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP)
provides support for the design, implementation, and assessment of strategies
that can lead to comprehensive institutional efforts to increase the number of
students receiving undergraduate degrees in science, technology, engineering and
mathematics (STEM) and enhance the quality of their preparation by strengthening
STEM education and research. The project at Tougaloo College seeks to establish
the foundation for "Preparing Undergraduates in STEM Holistically (PUSH)". The
goal of the project is to establish a multi-layered approach that engages
faculty and students with the ultimate goal of developing a model for utilizing
a strong academic environment to strengthen STEM education at the
institution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific aims of the project are to:
increase student enrollment in STEM undergraduate majors, with a special
emphasis in the Physical Sciences; improve retention in core courses with
evidence-based teaching strategies and course redesign; and develop a dual-
degree engineering curriculum with partner schools Mississippi State University
and Brown University, leading to undergraduate and graduate degrees. The project
will be guided by an on-going evaluation.
