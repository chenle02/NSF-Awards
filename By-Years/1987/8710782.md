The PI proposes to study the history of the Asian monsoon by looking at geologic
parameters which are sensitive to the oceanographic effects of the monsoon such
as: regional gradients in the thermocline, sea-surface temperature, and
upwelling intensity. Foraminifera from sediment traps in the Arabian Sea will be
used to monitor the isotopic and faunal response of the foraminifera to the
monsoon-induced temperature changes. The isotopic and faunal signal in the
sediment trap results will be used to trace the geologic history of the monsoon
in sedimentary cores. The PIs will concentrate on geologic periods thought to
represent extremes in monsoon seasonality in order to monitor monsoonal history
on glacial-interglacial time scales.
