This award funds the first of a two year continuing grant. The PI has developed
an object recognition method based on hash tables for indexing and rapid
retrieval of encoded models. He proposed to perfect the method for flat (2D)
objects, implement it on a Connection Machine, and move to noisy data, texture,
and highly cluttered scenes; and also to generalize the method to 3D objects,
using the splash as the basic data representation. The goal of this research is
more efficient and robust object recognition.
