Abstract

Award: DMS-9972300 Principal Investigator: Yisong Yang

It is widely recognized that fundamental interactions are described by soliton-
like structures which are classical solutions of various field-theoretical
models. The PI's main objective in the proposed research is to understand four
closely related important types of solitons in field theories: electroweak
dyons, coexisting vortices and antivortices, Faddeev's knot-like solutions, and
the Born--Infeld solutions. Electroweak dyons are electrically and magnetically
charged localized solutions in the Weinberg--Salam unified theory for
electromagnetic and weak forces in particle physics and the existence problem is
a variational problem with indefinite action functional involving delicate
constraint invariants and subtle weak compactness issues. The coexisting
vortices and antivortices appear in a newly discovered field theory and the PI
proposes to develop a full existence analysis and study the topological and
analytic structures of the solutions. Stable knot-like structures are important
in describing several fundamental processes including particle interactions and
DNA chain interferences. The PI plans to study its mathematical existence theory
and dynamical properties. The Born--Infeld theory has received much attention
recently due to its relevance in some areas of superstrings and supersymmetry.
The PI will study classical solutions arising from the Born--Infeld theory and
their connections with geometry and physics.

These mathematical problems are not only interesting and challenging, but also
have important applications in a wide range of areas including superconductivity
and superfluids, particle physics, cosmology, and molecular biology. On the
educational side, the PI has already been involved in developing undergraduate
curriculum modules based upon applications of mathematics. The research
presented in this proposal will provide new ideas for demonstrating the vivid
interactions between mathematics and other areas of natural science.
