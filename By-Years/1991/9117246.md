Fractional crystallization is one of the most important yet most poorly
understood of all igneous petrologic processes. One key to understanding how
fractional crystallization operates is through the study of magmatic cumulates
generated during a composition gap-forming event. This study will include
detailed textural (Universal-Stage), geochemical, micro-probe and, most
significantly, ion-probe investigations of the Medicine Lake cumulates. Textural
studies will concentrate on the degree of preferred mineral orientation.
Geochemical studies will characterize the major and trace element variability in
both the cumulates and associated magmas. Micro-probe and ion-probe studies will
determine major and trace element zonation styles in individual cumulate
minerals, as well as the degree of sympathetic compositional variation among
neighboring cumulate minerals. Altogether, these complimentary lines of evidence
will be used to assess the physical nature of fractional crystallization at
Medicine Lake and, by inference, in other calc-alkaline magmatic systems of
similar style.
