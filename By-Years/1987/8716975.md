Image processing equipment will be provided for researchers at the University of
Pennsylvania in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.
This equipment is provided under the Instrumentation Grants for Research in
Computer and Information Science and Engineering program. The research for which
the equipment is to be used will be in the area(s) (1) design and implementation
of distributed real-time kernel for active sensing (2) real-time integration,
control and coordination of sensors (3) language constructs for distributed
real-time integration, control and coordination of sensors (4) language
constructs for distributed real-time programming, and real-time multiple image
fusion
