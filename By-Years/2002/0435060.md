Abstract: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wireless sensor networks (WSN) have two key
advantages over more traditional sensor networks: they can be quickly deployed,
and can provide fine-grained sensing. However, many of the proposed solutions
use simplifying assumptions about wireless communication and the environment.
While many of these current solutions work well in simulation, it is either
unknown how the solutions work in the real world or they can be shown to work
poorly in practice. Our objectives are to: (i) Assess how the theoretical
properties of wireless communication are exhibited in today's and tomorrow's
devices, (ii) Establish models of communication realities to feed back into
improved simulation tools, (iii) Invent new network protocols that work in real
world environments, and (iv) Synthesize novel solutions into a complete system-
wide protocol stack for real applications. Our work contributes to an
understanding of the limitations of current and future devices and creates
viable, deployable systems. New fundamental models are also derived from our
work. The expected results of our work are that realistic wireless sensor
networks can be deployed in agriculture, environmental science applications, and
for emergency response systems. These systems can provide true benefits to
society, e.g., more efficient production of food, environmental protection of
watershed areas, and saving lives in response to a natural disaster.
Dissemination of WSN software through SourceForge enables other groups to build
applications on top of our work. Dissemination of our simulation models provides
an amplification effect of our research. New courses make novel WSN technologies
accessible to graduate and undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt;
