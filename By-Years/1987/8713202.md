This conference provides an opportunity for interaction between experts in
several mathematical disciplines, including partial differential equations and
geometry. The emphasis is on geometric methods in the study of singularity
structure of solutions to PDE's. Young mathematicians will be especially
encouraged to attend. Partial differential equations is a mathematical topic of
interest in both mathematics itself and in other disciplines, especially
physics. Singularities of such equations reveal crucial facets of the physical
system that they model.
