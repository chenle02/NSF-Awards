9503228 Morford Microsoft is having success distributing a graphic based
operating system called Windows NT which runs on larger style personal
computers. This operating system is currently being used in many universities
and businesses and is inaccessible to visually impaired people. This lack of
access will hinder the educational and business opportunities for visually
impaired people. In this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project
Automated Functions, Inc. (AFI) is designing and developing software that uses
an innovative multiple task approach to attempt to accurately convert the
graphic based Windows NT two-dimensional screen data to the one-dimensional
medium of speech or Braille. AFI will use new data exchange functions in Windows
NT to try to increase the accuracy of the graphic to text conversion. Graphic
Access New Technology (GANT) will also be designed to be quickly updated for
different foreign languages. This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II
project is to make Windows NT accessible to visually impaired people. AFI is
expert in the design and development of adaptive aids to assist visually
impaired people. The GANT team is familiar with graphic based operating systems
and understands the needs of visually impaired people. A successful GANT system
will enable visually impaired people to use the same Windows NT system as their
sighted peers.
