This project will provide information on scientist, engineer, and technician
(SET) employment in industry. It will develop national estimates from the
ongoing Occupational Employment Statistics Survey of the Bureau of Labor
Statistics (BLS) which provides annual information on employment in detailed
occupations by industry. The OES is a Federal-State cooperative program in which
State Employment Security Agencies collect data following BLS specifications.
Data collection occurs on a three-year cycle, sequentially covering
manufacturing, nonmanufacturing, and trade and regulated (communications, public
utilities, and transportation) industries and colleges and universities. The OES
data help NSF meet its mandate under the National Science Foundation Act to
develop and maintain a data base of demographic, educational, and employment
information on SET. The OES surveys are a key part of the system for developing
such information. Thus, the survey data: a) help in developing an accurate
profile of U. S. SET personnel; b) are used in projecting supply and demand for
scientists and engineers; c) are used to develop current estimates of SET
employment in total and by detailed SET field and industry; and d) allow
identification of SET growth fields, and those in decline or otherwise changing.
