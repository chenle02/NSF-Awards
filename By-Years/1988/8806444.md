T. Goodwillie will work on algebraic K-theory and its relation with equivariant
stable homotopy theory. His previous work, using cyclic homology, was successful
in reducing relative Waldhausen K-theory over the rationals to previously known
theories. He will now attack a specific conjecture about relative Waldhausen
K-theory (not over the rationals), and also address some more loosely formulated
related questions. It is impressive how truly geometric are the underlying
questions which give rise to the elaborate algebraic theories being considered.
