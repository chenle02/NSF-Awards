This proposal requests funds to permit Dr. C. L. Liu, Department of Computer
Science, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, to pursue with Dr. Bobby
Nazief, Department of Computer Science, University of Indonesia, for a period of
24 months, a program of research in the area of computer aided design of very
large scale integrated (VLSI) circuits. In the area of physical design, the
collaborators will perform research on place and route problems that arise from
the introduction of new technology, for example, field programmable gate arrays,
multi-chip modules, and quickly customized logic. They also will collaborate in
studying a transformational approach to the data flow graph synthesis in the
area of high level synthesis of VLSI circuits. The research problem is of great
importance in computer science and has the potential for impacting favorably on
the semiconductor industry in the United States and in the developing
semiconductor industry in Indonesia. This research could assist in solving some
of today's design problems and produce new design tools for the future. Dr. Liu
is a senior researcher who has an excellent international reputation. Dr. Nazief
is a young researcher at the newly-established Inter- University Center for
Computer Science, University of Indonesia. This project is relevant to the
objectives of the Science in Developing Countries Program which seeks to
increase the level of cooperation between U.S. scientists and engineers and
their counterparts in developing countries through the exchange of scientific
information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through collaboration on problems
of mutual benefit. This project adds an international cooperative dimension to
the PI's research under NSF Grant No. MIP-
