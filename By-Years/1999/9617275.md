Understanding individual differences in behavior has always been troublesome for
many social science methodologies. Such differences often are well modeled by
latent class methodology viewed from the perspective of finite mixture theory.
One impediment to application of mixture models has been the general
inaccessibility of such models for the general research community. A more
serious conceptual problem, however, is that the form of component distributions
must be specified a priori, and there is typically no theory to guide this
selection, especially in exploratory settings where their use could be most
revealing. This research focuses on the development and extension of a binomial
mixture model as a solution to this problem. The investigator will conduct both
Monte Carlo and analytical work. The model has applications both in survey
research and in substantive areas such as developmental psychology.
