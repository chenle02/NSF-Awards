The NRC Study Group on Guidelines for Mathematics Assessment will undertake a
two-year project consisting of three interrelated components. The first is the
development of a set of conceptual guides and principles that will be helpful to
states and local education agencies, as well as private groups, as they create
assessment instruments and systems. The guides will set forth in some detail the
factors that such agencies must take into account: choices of content,
instrumentation, data analysis, data reporting, etc. The second is an
examination of technical measurement issues involved in alternative methods of
assessment. The third is a consideration of policy issues, including matters of
relative costs of various forms of assessment, the effects in changes in
assessment on curriculum and classroom practice, and issues of fairness and
bias.
