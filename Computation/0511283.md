Nonsmoothness is inherent in applications such as signal denoising and image
smoothing. For example, a signal may have jumps, and an image may have sharp
boundary lines. The proposed research will focus on the design, analysis,
implementation, and testing of efficient methods for solving structured
nonsmooth optimization problems arising in these and related applications such
as regression, and data mining/classification. In these problems, the objective
function is the sum of a smooth function and a nonsmooth, typically convex and
separable, function. This class of optimization problems includes box-
constrained problems and problems with 1-norm regularization. The solution
approaches will focus on derivative-based methods that distribute the
computation componentwise and are highly parallelizable. They will extend ideas
from unconstrained and box-constrained smooth optimization, such as SOR,
gradient-projection, parallel variable/gradient distribution, Gauss-Newton,
incremental gradient. The research will also study derivative-free methods,
direct search and/or model-based, for problems where derivative information is
unavailable.

The proposed research thus focusses on designing fast computer algorithms for
detecting and extracting underlying key features in noisy signals, images, and
large data sets. This is achieved by formulating a parametric model and
optimizing a weighted combination of: (1) goodness-of-fit of the model to the
data, and (2) sparsity of the model, over a (possibly high-dimensional)
parameter space. Optimization will be done using algorithms based on successive
approximations, which distribute the computation componentwise and are highly
parallelizable. The applications to signal denoising, image smoothing, and
feature extraction from (large) data sets may be pertinent to some areas of
national security.
