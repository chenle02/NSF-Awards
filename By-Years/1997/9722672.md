This grant will support work to develop a new type of particle detectors based
on thin films. When some particles hit a nucleus much of the energy released is
in the form of sound. These devices will be sensitive to this sound energy. They
will be used to search for Cold Dark Matter. It has long been speculated that
much of the mass of the universe is in this form which has not yet been
detected.
