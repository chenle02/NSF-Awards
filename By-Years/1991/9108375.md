Understanding factors that control production of supercooled liquid water in
mountainous terrain is not only an important fundamental research question, but
such knowledge is needed to advance techniques of enhancing winter-time
orographic precipitation. During the Austral winter of 1990, a joint experiment
was held with scientists from Australia and the University of Nevada with most
of the field costs covered by the Australian government. The research objectives
were to measure mesoscale water budgets near mountainous terrain during the
passage of extratropical cyclones and to understand how this budget is affected
by mesoscale cloud structures. Under this renewal proposal, the Principal
Investigator will continue his analysis of data collected during this
experiment. His two research objectives are: to examine supercooled liquid water
and precipitation development within moving mesoscale precipitation features and
stationary orographic clouds associated with winter storms; and to estimate the
precipitation efficiency of mesoscale features and orographic clouds to learn
whether they contain excess supercooled liquid water which could be seeded for
potential precipitation enhancement.
