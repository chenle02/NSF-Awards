9310684 HEDGES Because of the monsoons-driven seasonality of primary production
in the Arabian Sea, the Arabian Sea Process Study affords an opportunity to
follow a variety of biomarker compounds from their point of origin in the photic
zone to their eventual burial and preservation in seafloor sediments. In this
project, the principal investigators will sample and characterize some 100
different particulate biochemical compounds -- lipids, pigments, amino acids,
and carbohydrates -- at their point of origin in the surface ocean, through
transformation in deeper water as they settle in particular form to the
seafloor, and in surficial and subsurface sediments. Analysis of data collected
during and between monsoon events will permit the investigators to characterize
the reactivity and transformations of these organic substances and to assess
their potential for sedimentary preservation as marine paleoenvironmental
indicators.
