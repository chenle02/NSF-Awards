The sage grouse is one of the more popular game birds in the western United
States and a major spectacle viewed by thousands of the public each spring. Its
management is one of the important duties of state fish and game departments.
Dr. Gibson and his colleagues have conducted basic research that has provided a
number of tools useful in this management. These useful findings have emerged
from research using the sage grouse as a model system to examine theoretical
questions about the mechanisms that determine biased mating success. Males of
lek-mating species exhibit conspicuous behaviors that attract females and
thereby secure reproductive opportunities for the males. Female sage grouse
choose a mate from a group (or lek) of communally displaying males. This study
will investigate experimentally the role played by the vocal courtship display
of male sage grouse. The effects of vocal signals on female choice will be
studied in the field by temporarily muting certain males and comparing their
subsequent mating success with that of males that have not been muted. The study
will test hypotheses derived from previous observational studies of this
species. The results will be directly relevant to the wider issue of the role
played by female mating preferences in the evolution of courtship behavior.
