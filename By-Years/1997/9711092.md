This award supports a three year project to promote greater industry cooperation
in architecting and managing the global Internet infrastructure. It addresses
global engineering concerns that are highly dependent upon cross-ISP
coordination, particularly those requiring measurement of Internet metrics. It
addresses ISPs' emerging need for technical meahnaisms to facilitate service
guarantees and financial settlements between providers. Specifically, the CAIDA
endeavors to: identify, develop and deploy measurement tools across the
Internet; work with commercial providers to provide them with a neutral,
confidential vehicle for data sharing and analysis; provide networking
researchers and the general Internet community with current data on Internet
traffic flow patterns; assist in the introduction/deployment of emerging
Internet technologies such as multicast, Ipv6, web caching, bandwidth
reservation protocols, etc; and enhance communications between commercial
Internet service providers and the broader Internet communities. The goal is to
have both government and industry participate in the project's creation and
operation. The project is envisioned as a supporting framework for active tasks
to be defined by researchers in conjunction with CAIDA members. Tasks will be
defined through proposals by CAIDA researchers to one or more CAIDA sponsoring
members; jointly proposed by CAIDA researchers and CAIDA sponsoring members; or
solicited by one or more sponsoring members of CAIDA. It is expected that the
government's role in funding the project will diminish as industry support
increases.
