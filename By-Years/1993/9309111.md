This project studies graph embeddings and network emulations, two areas which
have proven to be quite useful in the theoretical analysis of parallel
architectures. The goals of the research include increasing understanding of the
relative computational strengths of different interconnection network structures
by proving new embedding and emulation results, and also studying more closely
the relationship between graph embeddings and other more general notions of
network emulation. In addition, problems in the related area of efficient
mapping of parallel algorithms to parallel architectures, are studied.
