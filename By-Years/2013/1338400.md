In this project the PI will focus on developing a quantitative mathematical
model that describes the physics of cytoskeletal deformation coupled to
cytosolic fluid flow during cell crawling and then testing this model using
nematode sperm as a model system. The project consists of three parts. The first
part will use a linear, two-phase, steady state model for the depolymerization-
driven motility of nematode sperm as a foundation for construction of a full
nonlinear, moving boundary model that describes force generation and flow in
these crawling cells. This model will include the permeability of the cell
membrane to fluid flow, which is often neglected in models for cell motility.
The second aim of the project is to do quantitative experiments to test specific
predictions of the model. Using DIC microscopy and a cell tracking algorithm
developed in the Wolgemuth lab, experiments will be done to explore how the
speed of C. elegans sperm depends on shape and substrate adhesion. In addition,
fluorescent beads embedded in elastic substrates will be used to measure the
local traction forces generated by the cell. Particle Imaging Velocimetry
techniques will be used to measure the cytoskeletal velocities inside the cell.
The third aim will test the recently proposed hypothesis that cell blebbing (a
process by which hydrostatic pressure differences drive the cytosolic fluid flow
to rip the membrane away from the cytoskeleton) may provide some of the
protrusive force at the leading edge of crawling cells. To test this hypothesis
the PI will develop a new mathematical description of the behavior of the
cytoskeleton and cytosol at the leading edge of the cell. Students involved in
this research will work at the interface of theory and experiments. The results
of this research will be broadly disseminated by publication in
interdisciplinary journals and presentations at major international conferences.
