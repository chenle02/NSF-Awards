AST-0431503/Cornell: Giovanelli&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Grant for
Exploratory Research will support preliminary work on establishing the world's
largest far infrared/submillimeter telescope. The work will encompass the
verification of computational fluid dynamic simulations that suggest that
layering of water vapor in the atmosphere is strongly dependent on local
topography. Atmospheric water vapor content and layering, in turn, are factors
in determining the quality of an observing site, which is a major consideration
for astronomical instrumentation.&lt;br/&gt;
