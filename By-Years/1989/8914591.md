Dr. Arthur Upgren will continue a program of measuring parallaxes and proper
motions of stars with the 61-cm telescope of the Van Vleck Observatory. He will
obtain high precision parallaxes and photometry of stars of the lower main
sequence as well as of subdwarf stars. These stars are among the oldest in our
Galaxy, but their parallaxes and distances are not well known. It is expected
that Dr. Upgren's observations will allow calibration of the distance scale of
these old stars with much greater precision than is now available. Graduate and
undergraduate students will be involved in all aspects of the program.
Trigonometric parallaxes of nearby stars are fewer in number and lower in
precision than is generally perceived. Beyond the Solar System, the distances to
even the nearest stars are surprisingly poorly known. All but a few percent of
published parallaxes are of stars so distant that the parallax method is
inapplicable. Most parallax determinations are more than twenty years old and
thus have errors much larger than those possible in recent years, even with
conventional equipment. Dr. Upgren's program has made use of the increases made
possible in precision in obtaining parallaxes and proper motions since 1967. His
is one of the two most extensive such programs now active.
