Making has been described as the next generation of innovation and do-it-
yourself. Makers are an emergent group of imaginative inventors who value
tinkering, hacking, re-making, and creating of technical artifacts. Makerspaces
are places where these Makers gather in communities to learn from each other and
create. There are some who believe that the Maker Movement can potentially lead
to a resurgence of manufacturing job skills development as well as reshape
engineering education. The Making community is diverse, encompassing informal
learning in museum/library settings; Making in community spaces; university
Makerspaces; engineering and science researchers who engage in Making; and
education researchers who engage in Making. In order to reap the benefits of
Making for the US manufacturing industry, it is necessary to understand the
benefits of Making and how to advance the Maker Movement. This project will
provide the initial baseline data needed to identify future directions in
Making.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to develop, launch, and
analyze a survey on Making activities across the US. In an effort to leverage
the knowledge acquired by those already active in the Maker Movement it is
imperative that the various stakeholders learn from each other. The proposed
survey will be used to gather information from the broad Maker Community to
understand what Making means. Based on findings from the survey, a written
report will be created and widely shared that highlights the state of the Maker
Movement and how diverse Maker segments believe the Maker Movement can be best
supported. This report will document how engineering schools and others are
using Makerspaces and the perceived value of housing a Makerspace (e.g.,
pedagogical value, contribution to diversity, and contribution to retention.
Findings from the Maker Survey report will serve as a potential baseline for new
research inquiries into the Maker Movement and additional data collection and
analysis.
