This award supports the principal investigator's research in graph theory, and
specifically flows, coloring, and connectivity in graphs. This area is closely
related to computer science, operations research, data mining, and the
neurosciences, where graphs are abstract mathematical notions used to model
networks, such as communication and transportation networks, social networks,
surveillance data, pathways in bioinformatics, and neural-networks. Various
graph coloring problems have been considered as effective models for radio
channel assignment/distribution, and flow problems originally arise in
optimizing traffic or network. This project is concerned with structural
problems in networks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Integer flow theory, introduced by
Tutte as a dual of the graph/map coloring problem, is the major subject of this
proposed project. Recently, the principal investigator (collaborating with
Lovasz, Thomassen and Wu) successfully proved that every 6-edge-connected graph
admits a nowhere-zero 3-flow, and (collaborating with Thomassen and the team at
WVU) discovered a relation between strongly connected orientations and circular
flow indices. The principal investigator will continue his research work in this
direction by determining the flow indices for graphs with various connectivity,
investigating flows of graphs embedded on non-orientable surfaces, studying
modulo orientations of less connected graphs for better solutions to Tutte's
flow conjectures.
