9406106 Cameron This award provides 75 % of the funding necessary to modernize a
used electron microprobe recently acquired by the Earth Sciences Department at
the University of California in Santa Cruz. The institution is committed to
providing the remaining 25 % funding required. The upgrade to the electron
microprobe instrument will include PC-based automation of x-ray spectrometers
and sample stage control as well as improvements to the energy dispersive x-ray
analysis system, image analysis system, and back-scattered electron detector and
imaging system. The improved microprobe system will provide accurate micro-
analysis capabilities, with micrometer-scale spatial resolution, for a number of
earth science researchers at UC- Santa Cruz. ***
