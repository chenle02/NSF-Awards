9613342 Lynd The proposed research will address conversion of waste paper sludge
to ethanol and recyclable minerals. Potential benefits derived include:
diverting a significant industrial waste into a useful product; improving both
the cost effectiveness and environmental impact of paper recycling; raising the
cost-effectiveness of ethanol production and mineral recovery from paper sludge
relative to either of these endeavors undertaken alone; improving the technical
feasibility of recovering and reusing minerals from paper sludge; providing a
entry point and proving ground for the emergent biomass ethanol industry.
Research is proposed that builds upon an extensive data base on paper sludge
composition and convertibility to ethanol assembled by the P.I. Proposed tasks
will characterize, improve and evaluate: --continuous simultaneous
saccharification and fermentation (SSF) for conversion of pretreated and non-
pretreated paper sludges to ethanol. --use of Trichoderma reesei for the
production of cellulase from paper-sludge for use in an SSF system. --use of
thermophilic bacteria for continuous conversion of paper sludge to ethanol.
--liquid hot water (LHW) pretreatment as a means to increase the fraction of
paper sludges that exhibit high conversion to ethanol and --Perform measurements
on mineral residues pursuant to evaluating their amenability to recycling.
