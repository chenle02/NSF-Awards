Dr. John Fitzpatrick is the Director of the Archbold Biological Station in
south-central Florida. Dr. Fitzpatrick requests support for acquisition of a
Geographic Information System for spatial research on diverse habitats and
scales of study. This system would allow investigators to superimpose their data
on diverse base-maps, such as maps of soil type, vegetation, and recency of fire
disturbance. The addition of a Geographic Information System to the facilities
at the Archbold Biological Station will generate new and innovative research
programs. Examples of these studies are habitat choice by bird populations,
distribution and impact of lightning-induced wildfires, spatial distribution of
rare plant species, conservation and land management of patchy habitats, and co-
existence of cattle ranching and native habitats. This facility will
significantly enhance the capabilities of this productive field station.
