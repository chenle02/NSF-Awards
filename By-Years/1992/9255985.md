The University of Virginia will initiate a four-week, residential, Early Alert
Initiative project in mathematical modeling for 40 students entering the 7th,
8th, and 9th grades. This summer year program will emphasize the application of
general principles of mathematical modeling in various science applications from
mathematics, physics, and physical sciences. Participants will be exposed to a
variety of scientists and mathematicians using mathematical modeling in their
work in order to stimulate student interest in science disciplines as possible
and realistic career choices and careers.
