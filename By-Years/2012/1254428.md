Whether aerosols are internally (multicomponent) or externally (one component)
mixed impacts aerosol-cloud interactions. The approach of this CAREER project
centers on developing innovative modeling tools for quantifying the impact of
per-particle (single) aerosol microphysical and chemical properties on aerosol-
cloud interactions, on the micro to global scale. The work is motivated by
growing observational evidence that shows tremendous variations in the chemistry
and dynamics at a single-particle level. At present, however, the impacts of
these variations are largely unquantified since in current regional or global
models this complexity is not well-represented. This contributes to the large
uncertainties in assessing the impact of aerosols on climate, limiting us from
predicting the future impacts of air pollution on climate change.

A comprehensive education and outreach plan that focuses on enhancing "climate
literacy" along with the the recruitment of students into the STEM fields is
integrated with this research. The educational program targets students and
teachers at the middle-school level, students at the undergraduate and graduate
levels, and the wider community.
