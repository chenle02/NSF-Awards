This project addresses the lessons learned from the 17 October 1989 Northern
California (Loma Prieta) earthquake. Local soil/geologic conditions can modify
incoming earthquake strong-motions wave trains, causing them to be more
damaging. It is well accepted that this effect occurred during the Loma Prieta
earthquake. Much can be learned about site-specific seismic response using the
wealth of strong-motion data recorded during this earthquake. But in order to
understand the observed seismic response, a necessary first step is to define
the area's stratigraphy as precisely as possible. This is the objective of this
research program. This project seeks to obtain and to analyze all available data
on the stratigraphy of the Pleistocene fill, the depth to the basement rock, and
to tabulate all measured physical properties of the Pleistocene units for
correlation with expectable ranges in velocity propagation. The aim is to
prepare precise stratigraphic fence diagrams, unit isopach maps, and to tabulate
physical properties and downhole testing data for each geologic unit penetrated.
These data form a first step for other studies, such as in defining the seismic
response for the Oakland-Alameda Bay Bridge area.
