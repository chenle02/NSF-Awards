ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OCE-0451873 Reid&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is
proposed to produce a monograph of combined analysis of the circulation in the
Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Ocean basins, from hydrographic data, following
prior work on the individual circulations of the North Atlantic (1994), Pacific
(1997) and Indian (2003) ocean basins which have been heavily cited. The
proposed project would integrate this earlier work, and potentially emphasize
processes that were not considered in detail in the previous work such as
interbasin exchange and the Arctic ocean. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts:
an undergraduate student will be involved and trained in hydrographic
techniques. a resource to the community of physical, chemical, and biological
oceanographers valuable for many years to come will be produced.
