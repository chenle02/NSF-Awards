9634865 Realff The textile industry in the U.S. has shifted to demand activated
manufacturing in response to customer requirements for shorter lead times and
wider ranges of products. This project will develop a design methodology to
configure textile processing machines into systems that can respond to these new
demands, as well as make the best use of capital investment. There are two parts
to the proposed technical approach: system design and performance analysis.
System design uses mixed integer linear or non-linear programming to choose and
configure candidate system elements from standard machines that are available.
For performance analysis, discrete event simulation will assess the predicted
performance and cost of a textile processing system. The approach will lead to
the lowest cost feasible system by making choices like: direct or sectional
warping of yarn onto beams, size of a yarn creel, modular or conventional loom,
etc. Such a design methodology for equipment configuration is an issue in many
types of manufacturing systems, in addition to textiles. In all cases, the issue
of quickly reorganizing a manufacturing system to meet changing demands is
interesting, realistic, and has a high potential pay-off.
