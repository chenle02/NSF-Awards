This SBIR Phase II project deals with improved MPEG-based video compression
techniques and their implementation for very high-resolution video applications
found in the emerging electronic cinema industry. The electronic cinema is a
motion picture theater in which conventional film projection is replaced by a
high-resolution video system. The system employs highly compressed video
transmitted by satellite to the theater, which contains a digital video
recorder, real-time decompression hardware, and an advanced light-valve
projector. The principal investigator is developing a complete set of improved
compression algorithms and implementing them in a mixed hardware-software
laboratory prototype.
