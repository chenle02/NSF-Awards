ABSTRACT: CMS-9616013, Glenn Rix, Georgia Tech The response of particulate
materials such as soils to dynamic loads is characterized by the velocity and
attenuation spectra over a range of frequencies. Prior research on the near-
surface characterization of soil deposits has emphasized the study of velocity,
due in part to difficulties in measuring attenuation in the laboratory and
field. However attenuation data can be uniquely used to more fully characterize
the response of near-surface soils to dynamic loads. The particulate nature of
soil and the attenuation due to geometric spreading and wave-phenomena add to
the complexity of evaluating the loss mechanisms for material attenuation in
soil. The objectives of this research program are to enhance the understanding
of loss mechanisms in near-surface soils and to develop robust assessment
procedures. The problem is approached from two extreme scales: the clarification
of underlying physical processes at the microscale and the development of
adequate methods for field (i.e., macroscale) measurement. These are initial
steps toward developing laboratory and field measurement procedures which
reflect a detailed understanding of the loss mechanisms. Research tasks include
the study of energy losses in double layers (micro-level simulations and
experimental studies), reassessment of hysteretic losses at low strain in light
of new phenomenological hypotheses (experimental studies), and development of
active and passive field testing procedures (analytical, model, and field
studies). Specialized devices, new laboratory and field measurement procedures,
and unique simulation software and algorithms are used. An improved
understanding of loss mechanisms and the development of new methods of
assessment will enhance the ability to characterize near-surface materials
(e.g., aging, chemical effects, saturation), and improve the wave-based
monitoring of geoprocesses (e.g., inversion of state of stress in situ, assess
ment of the spatial evolution of liquefaction, and response of systems to
dynamic excitation). The improved understanding of material loss mechanisms and
advances in field assessment methods will also benefit site characterization for
earthquake hazard mitigation.
