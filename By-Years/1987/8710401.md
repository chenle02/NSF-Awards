This proposal requests funds to establish a Center for Frequency and Time Domain
Fluorescence Spectroscopy at the University of Maryland, School of Medicine. The
primary research instrument of the center will be a frequency-domain instrument
for fluorescence spectroscopy and state-of-the-art time-correlated photon
counting. Initially the center will function as a shared-use facility for four
scientists but will evolve into a regional resource. The new frequency domain
instrument will be only the second of its kind and the first to be made
available to other users. Dr. Lakowicz, the principal investigator, is a leader
in the development of phase methods and has demonstrated his ability to get
results from complex state-of-the-art instrumentation. Support is recommended.
