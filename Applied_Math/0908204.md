This project investigates the geometric and algebraic foundations of continuous
families of infinitesimally noncommuting flows. It combines a functional
analytic operator calculus known as chronological calculus together with methods
from algebraic combinatorics. The first of two parts of this project focuses on
smooth systems governed by nonlinear ordinary differential equations. Utilizing
novel combinatorial structures such as Zinbiel and dendriform algebras, it
unifies and systematizes solution techniques for a number of classical problems
that include state-space realization of systems, applications to path planning,
control of quantum systems, and geometric integration algorithms in scientific
computing. The second part is motivated by a practical control problem from
semiconductor manufacturing and aims to extend proven approaches and
methodologies to infinite dimensional systems that are governed by nonlinear
systems of hyperbolic conservation laws.

This project studies the common mathematical structures underlying a
distinguishing feature of many dynamical systems of practical importance: flows
that do not commute. This research has broad applications. These include:
Control designs exploit this feature to steer systems to any desired states by
judiciously choosing the order in which control actions are taken. In splitting
methods of scientific computing the lack of commutativity of the pieces is a
complication that needs to managed. For quantum mechanical systems the lack of
commutativity is in many ways the very essence of their nature. Beyond the
immediate contributions of theoretical insights, improved control designs and
high performance computing algorithms, this project improves the education and
technological infrastructure both horizontally and vertically: It connects
combinatorics, control, and computation, with each other and with applications
in molecular physics, biomedical and manufacturing systems. It trains graduate
students, provide undergraduates with meaningful first-hand research
experiences, and it collaborates with existing initiatives to train participants
from traditionally underrepresented groups.
