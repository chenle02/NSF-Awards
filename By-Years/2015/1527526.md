The problem of insecure computing environments has large impacts on society:
security breaches lead to violations of privacy, financial frauds, espionage,
sabotage, lost productivity, and more. These, in turn, result in vast economic
damage. A major reason for the severity of these consequences is that many
systems run on top of an insecure operating system kernel. The Linux kernel, a
de facto industry standard for embedded, mobile, cloud, and supercomputing
environments, is often a target for security attacks. By providing a secure,
verified kernel, the project has the potential to mitigate many of the worst
problems associated with insecure software, thereby benefiting society and
reducing economic damage. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will verify the
security of a commodity operating system kernel (in particular, linux). The
essence of the approach is to factor the source code of a commodity kernel into
separated modules with no shared state, and to express this decomposition in an
interface "glue" language, Deker. The methodology uses an interface language to
explicitly restructure the kernel with the consequence that the verification
task is made modular. Aside from the verification and security related research,
there is a novel communication/protection mechanism for better performance on
multicore computations. The project will develop software under an open source
license, and distribute and advertise it widely in the Linux and operating
system research communities. The system will form a solid foundation for future
research in this area by lowering the amount of development required to enter
the field. Finally, innovative research, which is critical for advancing
science, requires a diverse research team. Hence, the plan is to involve
traditionally underrepresented students in the security and verification
communities.
