The School of Sciences at Saint Mary's College of California is implementing a
program designed to address the nation's need for science, technology,
engineering and mathematics (STEM) professionals. Mentored Access to Programs in
Science (MAPS) is providing full-tuition scholarships and robust student support
and mentoring services to 24 academically talented, financially needy students
in biochemistry, chemistry, mathematics or physics undergraduate programs. MAPS
Scholars also receive career placement services to better prepare them to enter
the STEM workforce or attend graduate school in STEM disciplines upon
graduation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several support mechanisms are provided to
foster student success. Freshman MAPS Scholars live in the dedicated Science
Living and Learning Community (Sci-LLC) and take part in the First Year Advising
Cohort (FYAC). Each student is assigned a faculty mentor in his/her selected
discipline, have access to live-in tutors and participate in both social and
academic community-building activities. In the sophomore year, students become
part of the Science Academic Cohort (Sci-AC) and again have the opportunity to
participate in a variety of community-building activities. In the junior and
senior years, MAPS scholars are assisted by the Career Gateway and Career Center
programs in exploring and applying for positions as research assistants, science
tutors, interns and entry-level STEM employees. Collectively, these personalized
support services, combined with the financial support from the S-STEM
scholarship, provide MAPS Scholars with the best preparation possible to ensure
their success as STEM professionals. The Science Academic Cohort and Career
Gateway programs are being piloted as a part of the MAPS project. If successful,
they will be extended to all STEM students at Saint Mary's and disseminated
nationally. In an effort to achieve the societal goal of adding diversity to the
STEM workforce, emphasis is placed on recruiting students from groups that are
typically underrepresented in STEM disciplines.
