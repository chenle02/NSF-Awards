The fast multigrid methods developed and studied in this work are expected to
have a broader impact on the numerical solutions of a large class of practical
problems. Important applications include: vector (Hodge) Laplacian, Maxwell
equations, Stokes equations, Oseen and Navier-Stokes equations, and
Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) etc. MHD, in particular, has important applications
in the development of fusion technology and casting processes. In these
applications, since no experimentation is nowadays possible, the numerical
simulation of the corresponding partial differential equations is indispensable.
These simulations are very challenging, requiring large computational resources.
The multigrid solvers developed in this project offer the potential for
increasingly accurate models to be solved. In addition, our improvements in
algorithm developments will have impact on many other areas, such as image
processing, and computer graphics.

This project is divided into two parts: algorithmic development and theoretical
analysis. For the algorithmic development, multigrid solvers will be developed
for mixed finite element discretization based on Finite Element Exterior
Calculus (FEEC). In our study, effective smoothers, which are the key of
multigrid methods, will be developed by using existing effective preconditioners
or splitting schemes. One such example is a distributive smoother proposed in
this project which is highly related to the well-known projection methods used
in computational fluid dynamic. In addition to the algorithmic development, a
more completed convergence theory of multigrid methods for saddle point problems
will be developed. This theory aims to relax the strong regularity assumption in
existing work. Consequently our theory can be applied to more realistic problems
especially for solutions with singularities. Our theoretical investigation will
also provide insight for the algorithmic development, e.g., the construction of
approximated distributive smoothers and Schwarz smoothers, and optimal choice of
relaxation parameters used in several smoothers.
