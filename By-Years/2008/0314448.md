SUMMARY &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gordon Research Conference on Laser
Diagnostics for Combustion, first held in 1981, has served as the off-the-record
forum for scientists from all over the world interested in using laser light to
understand combustion problems. Each meeting has been a workshop, and
interdisciplinary discussions of major research issues are a highlight of the
meeting. The Gordon Research Conference (GRC) brings together approximately 135
scientists for a week of intense interaction and scientific discussion. The
meeting program is advertised in the publication Science, and the attendees are
chosen by the meeting chair from the pool of applicants; past GRC meetings on
Laser Diagnostics for Combustion have attracted over 200 well-qualified
applicants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2003 Program features updates on the
latest advances in laser-based diagnostics and sensor activities important in
combustion emissions from land-based propulsion systems. Revolutionary
technology in X-Ray and far-infrared sources and applications are also featured
in 2003 - potentially enabling breakthrough sensor technology for important
National Security applications beyond those strictly related to combustion. This
is the only scientific forum with an interdisciplinary focus on laser-based
diagnostics of combustion. Therefore it is important to insure that young and
emerging US scientists have access to this meeting. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
