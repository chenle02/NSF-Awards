This effort is to drop expendable probes to measure the velocity gradient in
the upper ocean at sufficiently high resolution to describe the shear field
responsible for the generation of ocean mixing and turbulence. The work will be
done of an Australian vessel in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. The results
will be related to the evolving theories relating shear on small scales to the
level of dissipation and therefore, mixing.
