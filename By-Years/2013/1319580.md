Verification is currently a major bottleneck in the design of the hardware and
software systems society depends on. Design errors can lead to recalls, software
crashes, cyber attacks, and even the loss of life. A fundamental approach for
identifying and fixing design errors is to use formal verification, which checks
whether a set of system properties holds across all possible system behaviors.
Unfortunately, current algorithms suffer from poor scalability and cannot be
directly applied to modern designs. This drawback is currently addressed with
the use of manual abstractions that in essence hide irrelevant implementation
details, thereby reducing the size of formulas to be analyzed. Besides the
manual effort involved, another disadvantage of this approach is that it is very
hard to guarantee that an abstraction is correct. The goal of the proposed
research is to develop efficient methods for algorithmically building provably
correct abstractions, thereby drastically improving the scalability of formal
verification algorithms.

Our approach to finding correct abstractions is based on the following three
ideas. First, building an abstraction that is correct in a small subspace of the
search space is easy. Second, one can stitch together abstractions found for
subspaces to produce an abstraction for the entire subspace explored so far.
Third, abstractions built for explored subspaces may hold in many subspaces that
have not been visited yet. This re-usability of abstractions makes our approach
extremely powerful in identifying irrelevant parts of formulas. From a
theoretical point of view, the proposed research will lead to a better
understanding of abstractions and to the development of new formal verification
algorithms. From a practical point of view, it will result in the creation of
various kinds of tools including SAT-solvers and model checkers that will boost
the scalability of formal verification.
