The Long Island University will initiate a six-week, commuter, Young Scholars
project in molecular biology for 10 students in grades 11-12. The Young Scholars
Program at Long Island University (Techniques in Molecular Biology) is designed
to expose students to the methodology used in molecular biology. The course
emphasizes student participation in basic experiments, including isolation of
chromosomal and plasmid DNA, DNA cloning, restriction enzyme digestion of DNA,
etc. Laboratory experiments are supplemented with lectures about the methodology
employed, data analysis, and selected topics in molecular biology (e.g.,
structure of macromolecules, gene regulation, etc.). The course also includes
guest speakers on ethics, as well as off-site visits to other research
institutions. Follow-up activities include monthly meetings and visits to
participants' high schools.
