The Biotechnology Research Learning Collaborative (BRLC), involving Barry
University and Altor BioScience, is developing new instructional materials and
promoting professional development among postsecondary biotechnology
instructors, lab managers, and tutors. BRLC is creating a series of laboratory-
based, industry-applicable, small-scale research projects appropriate for two-
year college students. Project faculty are testing the learning effectiveness of
these research projects within college credit courses over a three-year period.
An external evaluator is assessing the research-based learning activities for
pedagogical content, industry applications, replication, student retention, and
student learning. BRLC personnel are compiling the individual lab-based research
projects and evaluation findings into a publication for college biotechnology
instructors and lab managers. The project targets sixty minority and women
college students as participants in the original lab-based research projects.
