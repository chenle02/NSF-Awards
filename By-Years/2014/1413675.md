The goal of this RUI (Research at Undergraduate Institutions) project is to
assemble a data set of galaxy spectra to better determine the primordial
abundance of helium relative to hydrogen. The improved calibration of the helium
abundance will place significant constraints on models for the creation of the
light elements in the early universe. Broader impacts of the work include
training of STEM undergraduate students in scientific research. Activities will
include student summer seminar talks that will reach other STEM students, and
parents.

The program will utilize spectra of low metallicity HII galaxies from the Sloan
digital Sky Survey, together with an integrated, self-consistent model for HII
region emission. The project aims to reduce uncertainties and improve accuracy
relative to current estimates of the primordial helium abundance.
