This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project addresses scaled up
production of high quality carbon nanotube (CNT) field emitters, which are
promising electron sources that can potentially overcome the limitations of
thermionic source based devices. The current commercially available CNTs have
limitations in terms of field emission performance, thermal stability and cost.
Xintek and its collaborators at Duke University developed a proprietary few
walled carbon nanotubes (FWNTs) which is shown to possess superior field
emission performance compared to other commercially available CNTs.

Upon the successful completion of the Phase II project, the low cost high
quality field emission FWNTs will be produced to deliver improved field emission
performance for a broad range of applications including but not limited to field
emission displays, X-ray sources, vacuum electronic devices, accelerator
electron guns, and high current electron beam processing facilities.
