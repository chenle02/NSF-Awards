9312249 Isayev The main objective of the project is to develop basic knowledge
for a new science-based technology of continuous devulcanization of vulcanized
elastomers. It is well known that vulcanized elastomers having a three-
dimensional network cannot flow under the effect of heat and/or pressure. It has
been discovered that through the application of certain levels of ultrasolic
amplitudes in special devices in the presence of pressure and optionally heat,
the three-dimensional network of vulcanized elastomer can be broken down within
a short period of time on the order of one second or less. As a most desirable
consequence, ultrasonically treated vulcanized rubber becomes soft, thereby
enabling this material to be reprocessed, shaped, and revulcanized in a manner
similar to that employed with unvulcanized elastomer. The study outlines series
of experiments enabling us to (i) identify an aptitude of polysulfidic,
monosulfidic, and carbon- carbon crosslinks to ultrasonic devulcanization; (ii)
to establish optimal conditions for the devulcanization process; (iii) to
evaluate the rheological properties of devulcanized rubbers; and (iv) to measure
the mechanical performance of revulcanized rubber products made of devulcanized
rubber. The recycling of vulcanized elastomers (primarily used tires) has become
a major environmental and social issue. The development of a novel technique for
the reclaiming of rubber will have a significant impact on the further expansion
of a recycling technology base through the optimization of the process and new
discoveries.
