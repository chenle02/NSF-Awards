The Principal Investigators (PIs) will develop a novel laser based sensor for
the detection of gas phase elemental mercury, Hg(0),and reactive gaseous mercury
(RGM). The instrument will be based on a single 50 Hz, Nd-Yag laser that will be
used to pump two compact dye lasers. Preliminary efforts by the PIs have shown
this technology to be feasible. Upon completion, the instrument will be capable
of measuring gaseous elemental mercury with a temporal resolution and precision
that will allow for Hg(0) flux measurements to be made using the eddy
correlation technique. The instrument, when configured for in-situ sampling for
measurement of Hg(0) will achieve detection limits which match those of current
instrumentation but in a significantly shorter time period. This improvement in
temporal resolution and the detection approach offer significant advantages over
current approaches for measurement of Hg(0) on aircraft platforms. The same
instrument can be reconfigured to operate with presampling on denuders for the
sampling of RGM. It will be possible to significantly reduce sampling time
compared with current approaches and offer the possibility of temporal
resolution necessary to obtain well resolved diurnal profiles of RGM. It also
shows promise for the speciation of RGM using programmable thermal
decomposition/desorption from denuders.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This
instrumentation will be used primarily for research and research training but it
will be integrated into educational activities and it will improve exposure to,
and increase access and use of, state-of-the-art laser systems by scientists,
graduate and undergraduate students at the University of Miami. The ability to
accurately measure the chemical speciation and deposition rates of elemental and
reactive gaseous mercury has major implications for regulatory policy and the
implementation of the U.S. Clean Air Mercury Rule.
