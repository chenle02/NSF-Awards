Neural plasticity is an important process of change that occurs in the central
nervous system. An interdisciplinary meeting, under the auspices of the Gordon
Research Conferences, has been planned to assemble neuroscience investigators
who share a common interest in neural plasticity. The central theme of this
conference will be the modification of the structure, chemistry and function of
the nervous system. Emphasis will be placed upon the need to examine plasticity
at different levels, including the molecular, cellular and systems levels. In
addition, the integration of computational approaches in studying neural
plasticity will be discussed. This meeting will provide investigators with the
opportunity to share ideas and experimental techniques in this area of study.
