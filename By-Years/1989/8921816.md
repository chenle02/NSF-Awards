The primary objective of this U.S.-Hungary research project between Dr. Kenneth
Kustin of Brandeis University and Dr. Miklos Orban of Eotvos University is to
examine oscillating reactions involving transition metals, nitrogen, halogens,
acid-base reactions, non- aqueous reactions and reactions in which there are
sizeable pH changes. Related mechanistic investigations to be performed by the
researchers are aimed at expanding the range of systems for which chemical
oscillation can be understood at a molecular level. Progress should yield data
applicable to the study of other non- oscillatory systems involving similar
chemistry. More broadly, results will contribute to the emerging topic of
stochastic behavior, the phenomenon tied to questions of convection and mixing
interaction with nonlinear chemical kinetics. This project fulfills the program
objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the
United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool
research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
