This project addresses Bayesian nonparametric procedures which incorporate
information about the mean and about the tail behavior of the sampling
distribution. Extensions to non-random samples from finite populations may be
developed, drawing on a Bayesian theory of randomization. Extensions for
censored data in the presence of covariates should also follow. Foundational
issues for Bayesian theory of statistical inference revolve around assembling
past information or prior opinion with new information or data and then
presenting the amalgamated view. The inclusion of subjective views with
information from observations has important implications for the applications of
Bayesian inference and for effective statistically-based prediction and
decisions. This research examines both fundamental mathematical issues and their
applications to specific scientific questions.
