Computing systems are embedded throughout our environment -
in&lt;br/&gt;applications including "smart" appliances, environmental
control&lt;br/&gt;systems, traffic and weather monitoring systems, and
medical&lt;br/&gt;monitoring. Current techniques for controlling these devices
employ&lt;br/&gt;fixed algorithms for sensory processing and for taking
subsequent&lt;br/&gt;action. However, as these devices increase in their
complexity,&lt;br/&gt;computing power, and sensory capabilities, it becomes
possible to&lt;br/&gt;design systems that can automatically adapt their behavior
to the&lt;br/&gt;specific environment and task in which they are
embedded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduate students involved in this
multidisciplinary REU Site&lt;br/&gt;will investigate the use of machine
learning techniques in the&lt;br/&gt;development of a variety of embedded
systems. Application areas of&lt;br/&gt;focus include robot control; assistive,
wearable computing systems;&lt;br/&gt;computer intrusion detection; and on-line
weather prediction.&lt;br/&gt;Students will receive training in a variety of
areas, including&lt;br/&gt;embedded system design, empirical methods for system
evaluation,&lt;br/&gt;statistical machine learning techniques (including
supervised and&lt;br/&gt;reinforcement learning, Bayesian methods, genetic
algorithms and data&lt;br/&gt;mining), sensor processing, control, embedded
interfaces, technical&lt;br/&gt;writing and oral presentation.&lt;br/&gt;
