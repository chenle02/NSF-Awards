This research is investigating specification and design support for software
evolution by applying hierarchical abstractions based on intent rather than the
aggregation and information-hiding abstractions commonly used in software
engineering. Cognitive psychologists have shown that intent abstraction is
consistent with human problem-solving processes. The hypothesis being evaluated
in this research is that new types of specifications and designs based on this
concept can assist in understanding existing software, capture the most
important design rationale information in an efficient and economical way, and
support the process of identifying and analyzing required changes to minimize
the introduction of errors during maintenance. To evaluate these hypotheses,
protocol analysis techniques are being used to explore the processes involved in
software evolution tasks, and other empirical studies are being used to evaluate
the impact of this new form of specification and design on these processes. ***
