The open science movement is gaining momentum across the academic landscape.
Since the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (NAS)
published the Open Science by Design: Realizing a Vision for 21st Century
Research report in 2018, many institutions, organizations, and faculty have
begun assessing their current practices and infrastructure to support a more
open research ecosystem. To fully realize the vision for open science and
scholarship, stakeholders need to adopt key infrastructure, standards, and
practices necessary to facilitate responsible data practices. Drawing
inspiration from sources such as the May 2019 NSF Dear Colleague Letter (DCL)
the organizers propose an expert convening to discuss persistent identifiers
(PIDs) for datasets and creating machine readable data management plans (DMPs).
The conference is organized by California Digital Library (CDL) and Association
of Research Libraries (ARL), in partnership with the Association of American
Universities (AAU) and the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities
(APLU). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will engage approximately 40
experts in a multi-day workshop in Washington DC winter of 2019 with the goal to
identify and determine:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. What barriers remain to
implementing the widely recognized good practices in the NSF DCL&lt;br/&gt;2.
What kinds of model workflows might address those barriers, while minimizing
faculty burden&lt;br/&gt;3. What implementation of the NSF DCL means for
institutional data governance (e.g. sharing DMPs across campus units, between
institutions, and publicly)&lt;br/&gt;4. Findings to bring back to policymakers,
funding agencies, and other similar institutions&lt;br/&gt;5. Recommendations of
effective practices for grants offices, including guidance to their
researchers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
