The Twenty-sixth Summer Conference on Topology and its Applications will be held
at the City College of New York, CUNY, on July 26-29, 2011. The conference
series covers many areas in topology. This year's special sessions are in:
Dynamics and Applications, Set-Theoretic Topology, Topological Groups and
Semigroups, Asymmetric Topology, and Topological Methods in Functional Analysis.
Each session has an associated plenary speaker. More details and instructions on
how to contribute talks can be found at:

With the invention of calculus came the need to understand limits, continuity,
and shapes more general than classical geometric ones. The resulting branch of
mathematics is topology, and among its more recent catch phrases is "chaos
theory" (related to "dynamics", which studies the results of applying continuous
functions repeatedly). In addition to a dynamics session there will be sessions
in set-theoretic topology which considers spaces where limits and continuity can
be defined, in topological groups and functional analysis which discuss uses of
the interplay between topology and algebra. The remaining session is in
asymmetric topology, a topic that has become useful in computer logic and the
sorts of representations of infinite spaces by those where only a finite number
of points can be used, such as with television and computer screens.
