9410647 Russell, Bruce W. This research will evaluate simple changes to shear
reinforcement details that are likely to ensure safety against shear/bond
failures; specifically, longitudinal mild shear reinforcement will be placed
within the end regions of a beam's web to prevent propagation of the web shear
cracks. Compression field theory will demonstrate that the longitudinal
reinforcement completes a "tuss" within a beam's web, increasing shear stiffness
and controlling propagation of web shear cracks. Ten pretensioned I-shaped
composite high strength girders will be cast and tested under static and fatigue
loading. Variables will include the amount of horizontal and vertical shear
reinforcement. From these data, design criteria will be established to provide
practical guidelines for safe and economical detailing of end reinforcements.
