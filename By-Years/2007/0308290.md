0308290&lt;br/&gt;McDuff&lt;br/&gt;This award to University of Washington's
School of Oceanography provides instrumentation to significantly improve the
oceanographic research capabilities of the research vessel Thompson, operated by
UW as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research
fleet. The specific items supported with this award include spare parts for the
new intermediate-depth multibeam sonar system, a data storage and management
system for the shipboard LAN, a sub-meter precision GPS navigation acquisition
system and first year service subscription, and three oxygen sensors for use
with CTD and other instruments. These improvements will be of substantial
advantage to marine scientists using these three ships in their research during
2003 and future years.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
