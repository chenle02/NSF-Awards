This project involves several topics in optimal stochastic control and
nonlinear estimation. The main topic is risk sensitive optimal control. Risk
sensitive optimal control provides a link between stochastic and deterministic
(robust control) approaches to modelling disturbances in control systems. Two
player, zero-sum differential games arise naturally in the analysis. Risk
sensitive control also involves large deviations theory for stochastic
processes. The methods to be utilized include viscosity solution techniques for
nonlinear partial differential equations. Other classes of stochastic control
problems suggested by application in finance theory will be studied. In
nonlinear estimation, some problems of partially observed random fields arising
in image analysis applications, and hidden Markov models, will be investigated.
One of the main issues in mathematical control theory and in control
applications is the design of control strategies which are insensitive to
unfavorable disturbances which may occur within the control system. For plants
which can be modelled as linear control systems, there are several effective
strategies for obtaining good system performance in the presence of system
perturbations and a clear understanding of the connections between the main
methods. However many, if not most, practical control systems, such as those
required on high performance aircraft, are only poorly, or not at all, modelled
as linear control systems. This project seeks to develop methodologies and their
interconnections for robust control of nonlinear stochastic control systems
analogous to those for linear stochastic control systems.
