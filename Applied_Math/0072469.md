This project addresses a suite of structural optimization problems unified by
their mathematical formulation. The problems treated in this project come from
several application areas including the design of gradient coils used in
magnetic resonance imaging, catalysis design, the design of damage tolerant
bridges, and nonlinear optics. Presently there is no systematic design
methodology that addresses these problems. The first goal of this project is to
extend the mathematical theory of homogenization so that one can systematically
describe minimizing sequences of designs. The second goal is to use the
homogenization theory to develop numerical methods for the systematic solution
of these design problems.

This research project focuses on areas of technological interest that require
new mathematical and computational techniques for the simultaneous optimization
of material properties and structural form. The problems treated in this project
come from several application areas including the design of gradient coils used
in magnetic resonance imaging, catalysis design, the design of damage tolerant
bridges, and nonlinear optics. These problems, although diverse in nature, can
be formulated along similar mathematical lines. The goal of this project is to
develop a mathematical and computational tool box for the systematic solution of
problems requiring the simultaneous design of material and structure.
