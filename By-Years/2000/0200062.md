Exploratory studies will be conducted for the development of novel micro plasma
reactors that are less than a millimeter in size, for the deposition of metals,
dielectric materials, or polymers for microfabrication. An intense plasma ball
of less than a few hundred microns diameter can be generated under atmospheric
pressure between a microelectrode and a counter electrode under suitable
conditions. Such a plasma ball is self-sustaining and is of 'cold' type similar
to the high vacuum plasma sources used in microchip manufacturing. Based on this
micro plasma ball, a radically different method of microfabrication - plasma-
assisted net-shape deposition (PAND) - is proposed. With the PAND method, the
deposition will be carried out under atmospheric pressure to eliminate the
costly high vacuum equipment. Also, the net shape of the desired feature is
'printed' at the substrate surface directly thereby eliminating the time-
consuming and capital-intensive photolithography. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
proposed one-year project also addresses the fundamental mechanisms affecting
the design and operation of the PAND reactors. Since the experimental
characterization of the atmospheric pressure micro-plasma discharge is a
challenging task, comprehensive process modeling is proposed to understand the
inherent physics and chemistry of the system. Innovative modeling strategies
will be used to simulate the unique discharge ('cold' atmospheric pressure
micro-plasma) addressed here. A high-resolution discharge physics model will be
developed for the reactor to examine the effects of various process parameters
on the ionization and dissociation characteristics of the feed gases. The
results from numerical computations and laboratory measurements will help in
characterizing the 'cold' atmospheric pressure micro-plasma. &lt;br/&gt;
