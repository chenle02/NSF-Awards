This is a request to support US students and post-doctoral researcher
participation in the 9th International Symposium on Geochemistry of the Earth?s
Surface (GES-9) and in an International Critical Zone Student Symposium. GES-9
with about 150 international participants is a triennial meeting sponsored by
the International Association of GeoChemistry (IAGC) and will be held at the
University of Colorado, Boulder, June 3-7, 2011. The International Critical Zone
Student Symposium will take place June 1-2, 2011. The goal is to train students
to find the connections across spatial scales and disciplinary boundaries
through in-depth presentations by leading scientists, exposure to new field
sites, and discussions with colleagues around the world. All of these will
happen for students in the focused week of activities associated with
GES-9.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will directly support 15 young
researchers and help them establish community with other critical zone
researchers. A similar number of students from the SoilTrEC (Soil
Transformations in European Catchments) project in Europe will participate in
the event.
