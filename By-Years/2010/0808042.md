The PI intends to continue his research in combinatorial number theory,
exponential sums and spectral problems around expanders and Hecke operators.
Part of this is in an ongoing collaboration with A. Gamburd and P. Sarnak. A
related issue is Furstenberg's invariant measure problems and stiffness
conjectures for various group actions, which the PI plans to pursue jointly with
E. Lindenstrauss. The PI is also involved in other applications of developments
around additive combinatorics and exponential sums related to derandomization
issues and the theory of pseudo-random sequences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
proposal is a further development of a line of research that started five years
ago with the discovery of certain new and quite elementary combinatorial
principles around so-called 'sum-product phenomena'. Over the recent years its
importance became increasingly clear as it turned out to have a surprisingly
broad range of applications (from number theory to computer science) and lead to
progress on various problems that were stalled for a long time. Research around
expanders became really interdisciplinary and of interest to researchers in
various fields also outside mathematics. For instance new robust construction of
expanders play a role in connection with building expander-based computer
architectures via the process of nanoscale self-assembly.&lt;br/&gt;
