This proposal seeks funding to provide the overall management for a US JGOFS
Equatorial Pacific process study to be conducted during the fall of 1991 and
spring of 1992. In addition, the proposal seeks funding to provide certain
scientific services necessary for the completion of the project: ship use,
hydrography, nutrient analysis, analysis of doppler current meter data,
acquisition and archiving of satellite imagery, site mapping and sediment
coring. These services do not stand alone as scientific proposals and research,
but are necessary to investigators who have submitted scientific proposals and
have been identified as critical to the success of the overall experiment by the
US JGOFS Steering Committee. The US JGOFS Rational and Plan for Equatorial
Pacific Process Studies, which accompanies this proposal provides the overall
scientific rationale and justification for an equatorial Pacific process study;
it also describes the conceptual plan and experimental strategy that has been
endorsed by the US JGOFS Steering Committee and the scientists who want to take
part in the study.
