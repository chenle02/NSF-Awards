0427657&lt;br/&gt;Cunningham&lt;br/&gt;This project will take advantage of
recent advances in nanofabrication tools, novel materials, and mathematical
modeling methods to produce high sensitivity biosensors and arrays with
substantially higher performance and significantly greater application space
than first generation devices. This will allow array spatial resolution of less
than one micron, representing the capability to resolve the adsorption of
individual protein molecules to the sensor surface.
