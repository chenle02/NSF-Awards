The northern Alaskan landscape includes a diverse mosaic of ecosystem types
that differ greatly in their vegetation, their soils, and their element cycling
patterns. This investigation will evaluate some of the important controls and
implications of this biogeochemical diversity, using a toposequence of six
contrasting ecosystems in the Sagavanirktok River valley as the study site. The
first major goal of the project is to describe how individual ecosystems vary in
their contributions to the overall patterns of storage and turnover of nitrogen,
phosphorus and organic matter in the Arctic landscape as a whole. The approach
to this goal is budget-oriented, using a conceptual model of N and P cycling
along a toposequence to help compare and contrast the relative importance of
major processes in different ecosystems, and to sum up over the whole
toposequence. Particular emphasis is placed on the importance of element outputs
from one ecosystem to the productivity and nutrient dynamics of its neighbors.
The second goal is to understand how the biogeochemical effects of disturbance
are propagated, both within a single ecosystem type and along a heterogeneous
toposequence. A series of field and laboratory experiments will be combined with
simulation modeling and tracer studies. Substantial progress has been made
toward resolution of major questions in terms of acquisition of data. As a next
logical phase the project group will maintain experiments already in place while
concentrating on producing major first-order publications. The work is important
because the Alaskan Arctic is under heavy development pressure, yet the long-
term and cumulative impacts of this development are not well understood. Most
research so far has focused on single ecosystem types that occupy large areas
but are not necessarily representative of the range of biogeochemical diversity
on the North Slope, or of the ecosystem types most frequently disturbed.
Although it is known that disturbance effects spread slowly over the Arctic
landscape, very little is known about factors controlling their rate of spread
and ultimate extent. This research will result in increased understanding of
controls on rate of spread of disturbance in single tundra ecosystems and the
overall tundra landscape.
