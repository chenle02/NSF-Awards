9526278 Blumenfeld In this proposal, Professor Blumenfeld requests support for
participation of his group at Johns Hopkins in the NOMAD experiment at CERN.
This experiment is a search for neutrino oscillations in which a muon neutrino
converts to a tau neutrino. The experiment is sensitive in a mass region that is
important in cosmilogical models. ***
