9351814 Miles A gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) is being integrated
into the laboratory program in order to significantly enhance the quality of the
courses in general, organic, and analytical chemistry. The GC/MS is allowing the
teaching in a hands-on fashion of the principles of separation and
identification in the analysis of complex materials. It also is forming the
cornerstone in a new laboratory course in environmental chemistry which is being
developed. This new course is being offered in conjunction with our existing
lecture course as an elective, and as part of the environmental science minor
program. It is being taken by a wide range of science and non-science majors
interested in the environment. In this course the instrument is being used
extensively for analysis of real environmental samples collected at a wide
variety of locations around Pennsylvania. Finally, the instrument is finding
extensive use by student researchers in the chemistry department as well as in
the engineering, biology, physics, and geology departments. ***
