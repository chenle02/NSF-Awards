The aim of this project is the study of hyper-Kaehler manifolds. We wish to
prove finiteness of their deformation types, classify the fibrations which occur
and explore new examples. Another direction of this project is constructing
mirror dual Calabi-Yau manifolds. In attacking the problems we use the methods
of twistor bundles, Hilbert schemes and deformation theory.

Hyper-Kaehler manifolds are an important mathematical object both in complex
differential geometry and mathematical physics. Together with other basic
building blocks, which have been studied and understood quite well through the
years, these manifolds constitute "special holonomy manifolds". Our approach
uses special properties which arise in hyper-Kaehler geometry such as
"fibrations".
