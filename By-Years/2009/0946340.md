Law and courts scholars come from a variety of disciplinary backgrounds (e.g.,
criminology, political science, sociology) and are frequently unaware of
relevant knowledge or research in disciplines outside their own. This impedes a
broader understanding of phenomenon of interest to law and courts scholars and
fosters the generation of empirical datasets that should have broad appeal but
that are under-utilized. This proposed workshop is intended to contribute to the
remediation of this situation. The proposed workshop will consist of panels
organized around three objectives. The first panel will focus on the
identification of extant datasets and how such datasets can be profitably used
to advance multi-disciplinary research related to law and courts. The second
panel will focus on the integration of empirical data to address research
questions of interest to law and courts scholars, particularly questions that
can advance theoretical understanding. The third panel will focus on data
intended to measure key concepts (e.g., ideology of judges). It will bring
together senior scholars, junior scholars, and graduate students to foster
exchange and dialogue over the best way to leverage existing datasets, as well
as to identify new datasets that should be developed.
