0930028&lt;br/&gt;Amelung&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). Granted funds
will support upgrade of compute facilities at the Rosenstiel School of Marine
and Atmospheric Sciences. Three faculty members including Falk Amelung, Tim
Dixon and Shimon Wdowinski and their students will employ a multi node cluster
of Sun dual quadcore CPUs (ca. 288 cores) running LINUX for research on tectonic
and volcanic crustal deformation processes requiring parallel processing of
large GPS and interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) measurements. PI
research that will be facilitated by this upgrade has relevance to volcanic and
earthquake hazards mitigation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
