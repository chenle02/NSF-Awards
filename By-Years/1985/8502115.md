In this project, the scope of logical sensors will be extended to a form
operationally and methodologically more appropriate for distributed sensing and
control. Specific objectives include: the development of a methodology for the
specification of distributed sensing and control, in particular, one based on a
reasonably well understood underlying computational model (e.g., dataflow); and
the development of an operational environment for computing with respect to the
methodology. This will include the assessment of its suitability with regard to
performance and effectiveness in terms of physically distributed
implementations.
