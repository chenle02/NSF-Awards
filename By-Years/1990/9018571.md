This proposal is directed at evaluating whether a victorin-binding protein
(VBP) isolated from oat is the receptor for this toxin and is the molecular
determinant of susceptibility to the disease Victoria bight. Using purified VBP,
antibody thereto, and a full length cDNA already cloned, the functional role of
VBP will be examined in biochemical aspects, the binding domains examined,
sequence of VBP-cDNA determined, a determination of segregation of the gene
encoding VBP studied, and sequence heterogeneity in VBP of resistant and
susceptible phenotypes compared. This work is directed at a critical issue in
modern plant pathology, namely an understanding of the site and function of a
plant gene product which regulated the pathogenicity of a fungal pathogen that
causes the disease, Victoria bight, of oat.
