9451362 Lerman Columbia College is equipping a laboratory with computer
animation and video editing equipment necessary to train students in the
interdisciplinary field between science, visualization, and communication. These
students obtain a strong background in science, computer animation and video
production, enabling them to create and capture a visual perspective of science,
and to create video models showing scientific processes such as chemical
reactions, heat transfer, digestion, fission and fusion. These broadcast quality
videos are ideally suited for dissemination among science teachers at all
levels. The Institute for Science Education and Science Communication has been
working for three years in collaboration with Columbia College's Academic
Computing, Television, and Film/Video departments on the development of a
program in Science Visualization and Communication. Students concentrate in this
area under other majors. The development of this laboratory is a crucial step in
Columbia's development of this degree program. The program addresses the problem
stated by Nobel Laureate Roald Hoffmann on the difficulties in producing good
video programs in science because of the lack of a common language between
scientists and communicators.
