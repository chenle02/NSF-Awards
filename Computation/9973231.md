The investigator and associates develop large scale computational procedures
for optimal stochastic control problems. Massively parallel processor and
parallel algorithm advances are essential for managing massive computational and
memory demands, with particular emphasis on large scale applications in ground
water pollution remediation and manufacturing systems. Implementation of
advanced computational techniques, such as parallelization, graphical
visualization, and efficient data structures make possible the solution of
larger dimensional problems. The emphasis here is on formally justified and
useful computational methods rather than limited highly rigorous results. The
objective is to develop fast algorithms coupled with massively parallel
processing for the optimal feedback control of general continuous-time nonlinear
stochastic dynamical systems. These stochastic systems include both Gaussian and
distributed Poisson white noise, thus hybrid stochastic models. Advanced
computational treatment of these systems, especially with Poisson noise for
modeling disastrous events, is a particularly unique feature of this research.
The computational methods are tested on ground water pollution models and
multistage manufacturing systems, but are applicable to a wide variety of
applications, yielding a higher level of robustness for the computational
methods. The numerical approach directly treats the partial differential
equation of stochastic dynamic programming. New algorithms, including finite
element and random simulations, are developed to alleviate both memory and
computationally intensive demands from the "curse of dimensionality." The
investigator and associates develop optimal computational solutions to ground
water pollution and manufacturing problems perturbed by uncertainty. Ground
water and manufacturing problems are examples of grand and national challenge
problems, respectively. In the case of ground water the cause of uncertainty is
the unexpected introduction of pollution and varying environmental parameters,
while in the case of the manufacturing systems it is the failure and repair of
machines with fluctuating manufacturing parameters. The reason for seeking
optimal solutions is to minimize costs. Large scale computations are necessary
due to the complexity of the governing physical equations and essential
numerical approximations. Since the cleanup of polluted ground water sites can
cost billions where feasible, optimal solutions could save millions over
nonoptimal methods. Similar savings can be obtained for just-in-time
manufacturing systems that are managed to minimize costs, enhancing our globally
competitive capabilities. Advanced computing techniques are developed to get
optimal solutions using high performance computation with massively parallel
computers. Graphical visualization is important to make the immense output
usable to the environmental resource or manufacturing plant manager who would be
the prime user.
