9403358 Nanni A conference/workshop on Composite Materials for Construction will
be organized by a steering committee composed of seven experts. Selected
speakers will be asked to participate. The conference will include five sessions
addressing: non- prestressed reinforcement for concrete, prestressed
reinforcement for concrete and cables, repair and hybrid systems, structural
shapes, and laminates. The goal of the conference is to provide the basic
understanding and research needs in the engineering background for use of
advanced composites in construction. The basic research will facilitate their
introduction in the market place in a safe, efficient, and timely fashion. ***
