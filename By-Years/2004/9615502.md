This award is for support for a three year project to measure the vertical
strain rate as a function of depth at two sites on Siple Dome Antarctica. Ice
flow near a divide such as Siple Dome is unique in that it is predominantly
vertical. As a consequence, the component of ice deformation in the vertical
direction, the "vertical strain rate" is dominant. Its measurement is therefore
important for the calibration of dynamic models of ice flow. Two different,
relatively new, high resolution systems for its measurement in hot water drilled
holes will be employed. The ice flow model resulting from the measurements and
flow law determination will be used to interpret the shapes of radar internal
layering in terms of the dynamic history and accumulation patterns of Siple Dome
over the past 10,000 years. The resulting improved model will also be applied to
the interpretation of annual layers thicknesses (to produce annual accumulation
rates) and borehole temperatures from the ice core to be drilled at Siple Dome
during the 1997/98 field season. The results should permit an improved analysis
of the ice core, relative to what was possible at recent coring sites in central
Greenland. This is a collaborative project between the University of Alaska, the
University of California, San Diego and the University of Washington.
