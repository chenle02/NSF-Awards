National Science Foundation &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Student Travel Grant to
Attend IEEE Secon
2008&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose
of this grant is to support graduate students towards traveling and attending
the 5th IEEE SECON 2008 conference. IEEE SECON is a conference that serves as a
meeting point of researchers from academia and industry, as well as
practitioners in diverse fields of computer networking. Travel grant
opportunities will allow students to participate in this forum, and gain
valuable experiences by interacting with senior researchers in this field. Such
interactions can positively influence the quality of the students' individual
research, in turn shaping the future of wireless networking
technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
