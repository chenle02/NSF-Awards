This EAGER award focuses on exploring the feasibility of the implementation of a
new paradigm in the development of an integrative and interoperable data and
knowledge management system for the geosciences for a new NSF initiative called
EarthCube. Led by a team of experts in geoscience data management, this project
focuses on developing a loosely coupled web service approach to allow geoscience
data repositories to more effectively make their data holdings discoverable and
available to the public. One project goal will be to test the utility of the
RESTful (representative state transfer) approach. Its target will be more to
link together of disparate geoscience data types from widely distributed data
repositories so new types of data-enabled science can be realized. The project
engages data management groups from most of the major NSF-funded geoscience data
facilities as well as those from a variety of major European geoscience data
holdings. This interaction will not only allow broader testing of developed web
services, but will also provide a much needed forum to exchange ideas and
approaches allowing a better return on investment. One key aspect of this
project is the development of URL builders to help users formulate web service
requests. Broader impacts of the work include the development of new
infrastructure for science and engineering and the likelihood that what results
from this project will be applicable to fields outside of the geosciences. An
additional broader impact is an international component that engages Italian and
other European scientists and data networks as collaborators in the activity.
