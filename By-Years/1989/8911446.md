The development of accretionary prisms at convergent plate margins is one of
the focuses of current marine geological research. Of particular interest is the
compaction of sediments and the accompanying expulsion of water from the prism
that occurs over geologic time. This project will examine the role of interlayer
water of expandable clays (smectites) in the development of subduction zones.
The investigators propose to determine the oxygen and hydrogen isotope
fractionation between interlayer and bulk water in order to determine how much
of the porewater extruded from an accretionary prism originates as interlayer
water. As part of this research the oxygen and hydrogen isotope composition and
clay mineralogy of clays from the Barbados accretionary prism will be
determined.
