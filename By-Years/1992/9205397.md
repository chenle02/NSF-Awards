Small animals move their limbs at higher frequencies than animals and it costs
more energy per gram for a small animal to move a given distance than for than
for a large one. The questions we address in the grant is the muscular system
designed to permit much more energy for small animals to run than large ones? It
has been hypothesized that the underlying mechanisms lies in the properties of
the muscle fibers. The fibers of the small animals are thought to have maximum
velocity of shortening (Vmax) which enables them to shorten faster and generate
force and relax faster- -a necessity for the high frequencies aty which they
run. But there is a price: fibers with high V(max's) use far more energy to
generate force, thus potentially explaining why it is more costly for small
animals to run. With the new techniques that we have developed, we will test the
above hypothesis by measuring how V(max) and the energetic cost of generating
force of different fiber types scales with body size in mammals ranging from
mice to horses.
