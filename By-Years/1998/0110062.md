Professor Sandra Greer of the University of Maryland is funded by the
Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to perform experimental
measurements of the phase behaviors of polymers in solution. Many of the
proposed measurements will generate data that can be used to definitively test
recent theoretical proposals of liquid-liquid phase separation in polymer
systems. Methods include magnetic densimetry, rheometry, tensiometry and small
angle neutron scattering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The polyethylene oxide polymer
systems to be investigated have important applications in a broad range of
industries, and the characterization of PEO/solvent phases should be of direct
interest in many of these areas. &lt;br/&gt;
