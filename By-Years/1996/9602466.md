9602466 Elser This award supports U.S.-Japan collaborative research between Dr.
James Elser of the Department of Zoology at Arizona State University and Dr.
Jotaro Urabe of the Center for Ecological Research at Kyoto University. Dr.
Elser will be spending four months at Kyoto University in order to develop a new
perspective on ecological dynamics, ecological stoichiometry. Ecological
stoichiometry focuses on the relative elemental composition of participants in
ecological interactions in ecosystems. Research in this area has recently been
applied in novel ways to a variety of ecological phenomena in pelagic
ecosystems, such as effects of food-web structure on N and P availability in
lakes, links between consumer-driven N:P recycling and particulate N:P and
consumer N:P, stoichiometric constraints on animal growth and production,
contrasts between marine and freshwater ecosystems, and the evolutionary ecology
and cell biology of body elemental composition. Focus will be placed on
techniques and conceptual/theoretical frameworks for study of the ecological
stoichiometry of pelagic ecosystems. The visit will build on the model that
research cooperation rather than competition yields synergistic benefits that
serve to advance understanding at an accelerated rate. The U.S. researcher
brings to this collaboration his knowledge on large-scale field settings,
including whole- lake experimentation and patterns across large geochemical and
hydrodynamic gradients. This is complemented by expertise in the area of
laboratory plankton culture and physiological studies of growth by the Japanese
researcher. The project is expected to produce internationally comparable data
suitable for interpreting how stoichiometric processes regulate ecosystem
function across the world's lakes. This data will have direct application to
areas of domestic and international concern including fisheries decline,
eutrophication, loss of biodiversity and global climate change.
