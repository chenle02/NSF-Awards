This project adds a crucial laboratory component to two classes taught by
Department of Computer Science: Operating Systems and Networking and Data
Communications. These two courses have a common need for experimentation-based,
laboratory experience. The new laboratory has six workstations of various
configurations plus a file server. This lab exists on its own subnet, isolated
from the general purpose lab while retaining access to its printers and other
services. It is configured so that each machine has two disks. The second disk
on each machine is provided for experimentation--it can be manipulated and even
trashed without damaging the laboratory setup or the general purpose lab. The
system is as diverse as possible, with machines from four different classes of
workstation. Each class is configured differently, has different requirements,
and is used for different purposes. The networking media are different and
varied. Work is being done to support the automation of machine reinstallation.
Students are responsible for machine reinstallation. This project constructs a
laboratory environment to teach Operating Systems and Networking, produces a set
of laboratory manuals for each of these classes--both in electronic hypertext
and hardcopy forms--and produces a set of new software, developed to facilitate
the laboratory experiments.
