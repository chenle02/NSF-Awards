9412703 Justice Much of our understanding of how the brain controls behavior
depends upon our ability to accurately describe how cells within the brain
communicate with one another. Some general information on this process has been
obtained by removing brain tissue and analyzing it chemically, but this provides
no information on the dynamics of chemical signalling that actually takes place
during episodes of behavior. With this grant, Dr. Justice will refine techniques
for measuring the flux of chemical neurotransmitters within the brain during
bouts of natural behavior. Dr. Justice's group will concentrate upon the
dynamics of the neurotransmitter dopamine. This work will make it possible to
describe the chemical dynamics of the dopamine system (and also, to some extent,
serotonin and acetylcholine) in a precise way that is directly correlated with
organismic behavior. It should greatly stimulate our understanding of normal
brain function, the action of several classes of drugs on the brain, and the
processes associated with abnormal function of neurotransmitter systems. ***
