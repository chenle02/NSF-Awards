9414656 Sosa This award supports a three-month research visit by Professor
Horacio Sosa, Drexel University, to Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan, where he
will work with Professor Yasuhide Shindo in the Department of Materials
Processing. The research project will focus on the mechanical behavior of non-
traditional materials such as superconductors, piezoelectric ceramics, shape
memory alloys, and fiber optics. Applications of these materials are found in
ground and aerial vehicles, telecommunications, electronic packaging, and
medical instrumentation. This research visit will promote collaborative work
among U.S. and Japanese researchers interested in narrowing the gap that exists
among theory, experiment, and actual design and fabrication of devices and
structures. The laboratory at Tohoku University is widely recognized for work on
the mechanical behavior of materials subjected to strong magnetic and electric
fields. In addition to working at Tohoku, the PI will visit Japanese industries,
technical institutes, and research universities. The visit is expected to
promote not only further U.S.-Japan collaboration, but interaction with
researchers in other countries. ***
