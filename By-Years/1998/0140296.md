The structure and decay dynamics of highly excited states in molecules is a
research area that has provided a rich and diverse sampling of interesting and
important physics. Investigations of processes such as photoionization,
photodissociation, and photo-association have required more detailed and
accurate knowledge of the unique way molecular systems behave. In particular,
understanding the role of electronic and nuclear spin in molecular systems has
emerged as important in several areas, for example, high resolution
photoionization studies, chemical reaction dynamics and loss mechanisms in cold
molecule production in atomic traps. This has led to new theoretical efforts to
incorporate electronic and nuclear spin dynamics into the highly successful
theoretical approach of multichannel defect theory (MQDT). Fundamental questions
are being raised, including: 1) How does spin angular momentum coupling vary
with energy in molecular Rydberg states? 2) At what values of principal quantum
number and electronic angular momentum do different behaviors emerge for
different species? 3) Does nuclear spin affect either electronic or rotational
autoionization of Rydberg states into different ionic states? 4) Do spin
interactions play a role in the relative branching ratio between ionization and
dissociation in the decay of highly excited states? 5) What role does
internuclear separation play in these spin dynamics? &lt;br/&gt;This project
proposes to begin addressing these questions by investigating the structure and
dynamics of highly excited molecular states, including the effects of orbital
and rotational angular momentum and vibration on molecular spin interactions, by
using the novel approach of time-resolved, resonant four-wave mixing
spectroscopy. The goal is to perform high energy resolution measurements within
a given Rydberg series or a given vibrational progression in order to follow the
evolution of angular momentum coupling as a function of energy and internuclear
separation. By examining three fundamental systems with distinct molecular
structures; H2, N2 and the OH radical, prototypical interactions and dynamics
can be systematically investigated. This kind of data, taken together with MQDT
analyses, promises to provide new insights into the unique nuclear and
electronic angular momentum interactions that molecules
exhibit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
