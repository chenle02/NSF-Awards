This action funds Josh Egan of The University of Minnesota Conservation Biology
Program to conduct a research project in Biological sciences during the summer
of 2013 at National Chiayi University in Chiayi, Taiwan. The project title is
"The Evolution of Generalist Feeding Strategies in Marine Fishes." The host
scientist is Dr. Chien-Hsien Kuo.

The evolution of specialized trophic niches has been extensively researched.
This research has shown that trophic niche specialization is stimulated by
complex, stable, and productive habitats and promotes speciation and the
evolution of phenotypic diversity. In contrast, generalist trophic niches,
although recognized as common, have been the focus of few evolutionary studies.
This represents a significant gap in our understanding of the generation and
distribution of biodiversity. To address this gap, this research uses
phylogenetic comparative methods to test two fundamental hypotheses regarding
the evolution of generalist trophic niches: (1) the evolution of generalist
trophic niches is associated with transitions to habitats with temporally
variable food webs and (2) the evolution of generalist trophic niches is
associated with morphological and behavioral adaptation. The project uses the
clupeiform fishes as a study system to address these questions because this
order is diverse, widely distributed, and contains trophic generalists.

Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce. Furthermore, this research will advance our understanding
of evolutionary processes and species richness patterns, knowledge that is
increasingly used to inform biodiversity conservation and management efforts.
