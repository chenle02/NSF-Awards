PROPOSAL #0105558 WILLIAM MARSH RICE UNIVERSITY PI: JOHNSON, DON H.

The closely allied fields of signal processing and information theory have never
found common ground. Signal processing focuses on how signals can represent
information and how systems manipulate and change signal structure. Information
theory revolves around the structure of information that signals represent, but
ignores what information is meaningful to the receiver by concentrating on
efficient compression and communication. The research develops a new theory of
information processing that weds these two disciplines and has the dual goals of
understanding how effectively signals, no matter what their nature, can
represent information and of quantifying how well systems process information.
Because of the theory's generality, we analyze both communication systems, to
probe how effectively they convey information and meaning, and neural processing
systems, to understand how neural groups process and represent information.

We quantify how well signals represent information by computing an information-
theoretic distance (it obeys the Data Processing Theorem) between signals
associated with two instances of the encoded information. We assume that the
signals are stochastic, and the distance measures how different are the
probability distributions associated with the signals. We use the Kullback-
Leibler distance because it is related both to optimal classifier performance
via Stein's Lemma and to optimal least-squares estimator performance through the
Cramer-Rao bound. A larger distance thus corresponds to a more effective
representation of the information. The information processing ability of a
system is measured by the information transfer ratio, defined to be the ratio of
distances computed at the system's input and output. With this ratio, we
quantify how well an information processing system behaves as an information
filter.
