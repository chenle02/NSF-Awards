This project supports 60 scholarships for academically qualified, need-based
students to attend and graduate from Sweet Briar College (SBC) in a math,
computer science, or engineering major. SBC's CSEMS program targets need-based
groups in socio-economically underprivileged areas of Virginia to leverage SBC's
standard $7,500 Virginia Grant. Intellectual Merits: SBC is an ideal learning
environment to facilitate the success of disenfranchised women in CSEM fields.
It offers women a unique learning opportunity through small class sizes
(averaging 12 students), low student to faculty ratio (8:1), multiple CSEM
options including engineering, and a record of success in math and science
programs. Broader Impacts: This scholarship program increases the number of
women in CSEM fields by attracting qualified need-based women into an
encouraging and engaging learning environment. These scholarships open a
pipeline for continued recruitment of socio-economically underprivileged
students in Virginia to SBC beyond the NSF grant period.
