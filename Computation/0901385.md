This conference is on Interactions between Representation Theory, Quantum Field
Theory, Category Theory, Mathematical Physics, and Quantum Information Theory.
The conference will bring together experts in the areas of Topology, Hopf
Algebras, Quantum Topology, Category Theory, Representation Theory, Mathematical
Physics, and Quantum Information Theory. These fields are interrelated and have
motivated each others' development.

The conference will be of benefit to American mathematics, mathematical
researchers, and quantum computational researchers. Cross-disciplinary
interactions are widely recognized for their value in stimulating new ideas and
advances and will thus not only increase the knowledge of the participants, but
could result in the new invention and new discovery.
