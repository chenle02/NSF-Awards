This research involves the use of tellurium reagents for the production of
enatiomerically pure organic compounds. By combining tellurium methodology with
Sharpless kinetic resolutions or asymmetric epoxidations of allylic alcohols the
following will be able to be achieved: (1) the synthesis of optically active
secondary and tertiary allylic alcohols from achiral starting materials without
resolution, (2) the synthesis of secondary cis allylic alcohols from trans
compounds in high optical purity, (3) the conversion of racemic, secondary
allylic alcohols to either enantiomer in high yield and high optical purity
without the loss of material sustained in a kinetic resolution, (4) the
deoxygenation of acetates of glycidols with retention of the chirality at the
carbinol center, and (5) the transposition of double bond and alcohol
functionalities in both the free alcohol as well as in the sulfonate esters of
the allylic alcohols. Also, 2-substitued allylic alcohols whose accessibility by
other methods is difficult will be prepared and studied. %%% With this award the
Synthetic Organic Program of the Chemistry Division will support the research of
Dr. Donald C. Dittmer of the Department of Chemistry at Syracuse University. The
research is in the area of synthetic methodology and will utilize tellurium
reagents for the production of organic substrates in optically pure form. Using
a variety of approaches the work will allow the preparation of these optically
pure compounds from optically inactive starting materials. This process is
extremely important in modern synthetic chemistry because many of the target
molecules which have biological activity must be prepared optically active to
study their properties.
