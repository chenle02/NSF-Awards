The 2023 Campus Cyberinfrastructure PI Workshop builds upon the success of the
previous Campus Cyberinfrastructure Workshops providing an opportunity for
recipients of all active NSF Campus Cyberinfrastructure (CC*) awards to meet in-
person, exchange project findings, interact with national cyberinfrastructure
resources and experts as well as collaborate across project areas and project
regions. By again co-locating the CC* workshop with the Quilt Fall Member
Meeting, the broader programmatic scope encourages relationships between campus
cyberinfrastructure, science driven applications, and regional and national
cyberinfrastructure resources. The meeting schedule provides additional
opportunities for interaction between PIs as well as between the diverse groups
participating in the meetings. Included in the 2023 CC* PI Workshop is a set of
post-workshop tutorials focused on topics relevant to challenges facing CC*
project teams.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
