This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating microbial
electrochemical technology into an efficient wastewater treatment and energy
recovery system for food and beverage industry. The translated technology has
the following unique features: high pollution removal rate, small foot-print,
and high power density, that provides exemplary performance and cost savings,
when compared to the leading competing anaerobic digestion in this market space.
The project accomplishes this goal by determining the key design and operational
parameters through the evaluation of microbial electrochemical cells with real
waste streams, resulting in a fully functioning prototype reactor stack.

The partnership engages Waste2Watergy to provide guidance in practical
wastewater treatment and other aspects such as scale-up and commercialization,
as they pertain to the potential to translate the technology along a path that
may result in a competitive commercial reality. The potential economic impact is
expected to be a low-cost sustainable wastewater treatment and energy recovery
technology in the next 5 to 10 years, which will contribute to the U.S.
competitiveness in renewable energy generation and wastewater treatment. The
societal impact, long term, will be providing energy from a renewable source
while benefiting human health worldwide.
