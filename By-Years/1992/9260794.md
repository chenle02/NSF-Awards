Difficulties in programming autonomous robots continue to impede widespread
application of automation. High level programming capability that permits the
user to think in terms of the complete task as opposed to the individual
movements required o the robot does not yet exist. This research explores a
procedure through which a robot is programmed, in a user-friendly manner, as the
operator or programmer physically demonstrates several strategies for
accomplishing the task. After a small number of demonstrations, the robot
controller would then be capable of performing the task autonomously, driven by
its unique, internally developed program. In essence, the upgrade path from pure
teach pendant programming or master/slave operation occurs invisibly to the user
and does not require a conventional program to be written by the user for the
autonomous subtask.
