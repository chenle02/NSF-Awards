The main goal of this project is the development of a novel solid substrate
fermentation process for the bioconversion of agricultural residues into animal
feed. The novel technology consists of the sequential application of aerobic
fungal fermentation and anaerobic lactic acid fermentation or ensiling. The
fungal fermentation by a mixed culture of host fungi will produce an enzyme
complex well adapted for partially degrading the host plant cell wall into
fermentable sugars, which in turn will be used by the lactic acid bacteria for
efficient ensiling. During ensiling, the lactic acid preserves the substrate and
catalyzes the hydrolysis of lignocellulose by the fungal enzymes obtained in the
aerobic phase. This project will concentrate on elucidating the microbiological
and enzymatic interactions in this mixed culture fermentation process, which may
be an appropriate technology for the on-farm utilization of agricultural, range,
and forestry residues, and which may also contribute to the realization of
sustainable agriculture.
