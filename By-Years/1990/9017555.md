The type of computing environment dawning on the engineering campus is
significantly different from that which was available just a few years ago and
is radically different from the environment under which traditional mechanical
design education developed. %%% The aims of this research are the development of
a mathematical model for the mechanical design process and the development of
prototype teaching aid for a computer environment. Such a computer aid will
provide an interactive, self-paced problem drill environment. In addition, it
will provide an electronic workbench for problem solving. The major thrust of
the work will be the development of a quantitative theory for the design process
that will then allow the exploitation of the full power of a workstation
computer environment in mechanical engineering education. A general set of
software, hopefully applicable to other disciplines, will be tested through the
development of several sets of course materials for mechanical engineering
design courses. The study will conclude with an evaluation of the technical and
educational merits of such a system.
