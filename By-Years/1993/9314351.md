Targett 9314351 Polyphenolic compounds are known to act both feeding deterrents
and digestibility reducing substances in terrestrial and marine systems. In
vitro examinations of the mode of action of these compound have revealed that
their activity is dependent on the chemical environment (including pH, redox
potential, the presence of surfactants, and the presence of polyphenol ocidases)
in which they are acting, as well as the structure and concentration of the
compounds. Little work has been done examining the mode of action of
polyphenolics in vivo, particularly in the marine environment. To understand the
basis of the patterns responsible for the activity of marine polyphenolics, this
study proposes to examine temperate and tropical marine systems in which
selected combinations of plant characteristics and herbivore gut characteristics
are simultaneously evaluated. ***
