The research to be performed on this RIA award will evaluate the effect on the
matrix constraint - and thus on creep resistance - of diffusional relaxation and
interface slip along the matrix- reinforcement interface of intermetallic matrix
composites. Unit cell models will be used and solved by the finite element
method. AS coupled analysis of slip and diffusion, along with fiber cracking,
will also be performed to investigate the net effect of the reinforcement
size.//
