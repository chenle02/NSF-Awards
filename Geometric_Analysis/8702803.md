Burn's work displays an impressive variety of techniques and questions which
stem from meaningful physical applications. He has some fine publications alone
and in collaboration with some very able colleagues. Due to their efforts the
structural properties of Riemannian manifolds of the negative curvature sort are
remakably well understood and they are probing into the nature of physically
meaningful phenomena such as entropy. The two main objectives of the current
project are to extend recent results for manifolds with non-positive curvature
to manifolds with no conjugate points, and to further investigate manifolds with
non-positive curvature. Compact manifolds with non-positive curvature are
classified by their rank. The geodesic flow is ergodic if and only if the
manifold has rank 1, and higher rank examples are quotients of products of rank
1 examples and symmetric spaces. The main problem for manifolds with non-
positive curvature is to further understand the examples with rank 1. For
manifolds with no conjugate points, it is still unknown whether the analogue of
rank 1 will imply ergodicity of the geodesic flow, even in dimension 2.
