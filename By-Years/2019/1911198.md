Over cosmic time, galaxies grow by acquiring gas and turning it into stars.
Models of the growth of galaxies need to deal with the influence of star
formation and evolution on the rate at which gas is then cooled and turned into
more stars, in a process known as 'feedback'. This project will develop better
models on the role that high-energy particles known as cosmic rays play in
feedback. These models will then be made available to astrophysicists to better
model galaxy growth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will develop
'small-scale physics' models of how cosmic rays interact with cold and warm gas
in the circumgalactic medium. They will look at a number of interactions
involving cosmic rays, including turbulence, thermal instabilities, and cloud
entrainment. This physics will then be incorporated in MHD codes for modeling
feedback in galaxies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
