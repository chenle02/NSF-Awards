9704437 Sadofsky Recall Quillen's theorem that the formal group law over the
ring of complex cobordism classes of manifolds induced by the multiplication on
infinite complex projective space is isomorphic in a natural way to the Lazard's
universal formal group law. Complex cobordism occupies a central place in stable
homotopy theory, in part due to the Nilpotence and Periodicity theorems of
Hopkins, Devinatz and Smith. Quillen's theorem is of fundamental use, as it
allows one to use techniques from the study of formal groups to produce, and
calculate with, various cohomology theories based on complex cobordism. A
problem of longstanding importance in equivariant theory is to understand
complex cobordism classes of G-manifolds (where G is some Lie group). This
research will explore this question from the point of view of formal group laws.
The goal is to use the methods from Quillen's paper in the Advances to get a
handle on equivariant complex cobordism, and to link this with the notion of
equivariant formal group laws, preliminaries of which are set forth in Mike
Cole's University of Chicago thesis. When is the set of positions of some
mechanical system the boundary of the set of positions of some other mechanical
system? As a simple example, think of the circle around some point in the plane
as being the set of positions of a pendulum. This is the boundary of the set of
positions of a pendulum of the same length, but with a joint halfway along the
rod joining the bob to the center (said joint able to bend from 0 to 180
degrees). This set of positions describes a disk. This question has a very
beautiful and elegant answer in terms of the algebraic topology of the manifold,
given by the Fields medal winning work of Rene Thom in the 1950s. In certain
cases, the answer to this question turns out to be related to "formal group
laws," a class of algebraic rules for adding two quantities, with properties
similar to, but not identicial to ordinary add ition. This research is directed
at answering our original question when, in addition, it is required that the
set of positions of the mechanical system be the boundary of the set of
positions of some other mechanical system in a way that respects some symmetries
of the original system. Some of this is already known in principle in simple
cases, but formal group laws with additional symmetries will provide a framework
for the answer and may allow extensions beyond special cases. ***
