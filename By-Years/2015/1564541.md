This research project concerns mathematical analysis, in particular in
approximation theory, orthogonal polynomials, and potential theory. These are
parts of mathematics that originated well over a century ago and have provided
the foundations and the tools for widespread applications, from magnetic
resonance imaging scanners to airplane designs. One main focus of the work is to
understand complicated mathematical objects in terms of relatively transparent
and computable quantities. The project is a continuation of this classical area,
but with a new and fresh look at some of its questions, aimed at developing new
methods to solve some well-known open problems. Though it is basic research, the
results of the project are anticipated to be useful in other areas of
mathematics, physics, and engineering. It is expected that the project will
stimulate interest in undergraduates and enhance the research environment for
them. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are four main research areas that are
considered. The first is the approximative extensions of conformal maps/Green's
functions when conventional conformal extensions do not exist. These can be used
in lieu of conformal extensions when less smoothness than analyticity is
assumed. The second area concerns new types of polynomial inequalities to settle
the best constant problem in Bernstein- and Markov-type inequalities on sets
consisting of smooth Jordan curves and arcs, thereby closing a chapter in
approximation theory that is more than a century old. The third is the study of
Christoffel-Darboux kernels associated with general families of orthogonal
polynomials with a possible application to universality results in random matrix
theory. The fourth research area concerns the clarification and resolution of
Widom's conjecture on the norm of Chebyshev polynomials. Various polynomial
inequalities connect these fields and are expected to play a decisive role in
the solutions of the problems under study.
