9402804 Curry Funds are provided that would allow the Pis to continue their
study of reconstructing the thermocline at Little Bahamas bank for another year.
Two new cores will be added to the bathymetric transect at Bahamas, and the
sampling frequency for the deglacial interval in high sed rate cores will be
increased. The additional year will also allow the Pis to extend the partially
completed South Atlantic record. ***
