This three-year project develops 40 5th and 6th grade mentor teachers and 480
partner teachers from grades K-6 in prealgebra, geometry, and data analysis
content with inquiry-based methodology and alternative assessments throughout.
In this California State University- Northridge/Los Angeles Unified School
District partnership, special attention is given to skills in teaching minority
and limited-English students who comprise the majority of the local population.
Participants experience residential institutes, workshops, midweek seminars, and
teacher-leader inservice opportunities, using the "sandwich" model (NCTM, 1990
Yearbook) of classroom trials between the workshops and followup sessions.
