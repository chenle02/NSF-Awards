An NSF-CMBS Regional Conference, "The Mutually Beneficial Relationship of
Matrices and Graphs," will be held at Iowa State University July 12 - July 16,
2010. Richard Brualdi, the principal speaker, is one of the founders and
continuing leaders of the area of Combinatorial Matrix Theory, author of more
than 200 papers, and an award-winning teacher.

The conference will discuss the symbiotic relationship between matrices and
graphs and the significant role that they jointly play in pure and applied
mathematics, science, and technology. Topics to be discussed include eigenvalues
of matrices of graphs (adjacency matrix, Laplacian matrix, etc.), eigenvalues of
digraphs, tournaments, sign pattern matrices, the class A(R,S), matrix
polytopes, and total nonnegativity. The conference will equip beginning
researchers with the necessary background and involve them in research
collaborations in combinatorial matrix theory. Women, underrepresented
minorities, graduate students, post-doctoral associates, junior faculty, and
faculty at undergraduate colleges will be specifically recruited to participate.
