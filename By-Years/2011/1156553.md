This award supports the continuation of the existing physics Research Experience
for Undergraduates (REU) site at Cornell Laboratory for Accelerator Based
Sciences (CLASSE). Supported by the National Science Foundation, the Laboratory
has an international reputation for research, with a unique constellation of
programs including accelerator physics, synchrotron radiation research, and
microwave superconductivity. The student participants have a ten week research
experience during the summer at the Laboratory, and have full access to the
resources of the Laboratory and University. The undergraduate researchers in
this program work closely with Laboratory experienced physicists and they use
group housing together with many other REU groups on campus. The students
participate in joint activities that include lectures with an overview of wide
topics in the accelerator physics, X-ray science, take part with a bigger body
of REU groups on campus in fun-talks and hands-on activities that introduce
various frontiers of physics research, as well as events geared towards teaching
the students about social and ethics issues in scientific research and conduct.
