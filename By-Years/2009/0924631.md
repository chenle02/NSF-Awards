This project aims at studying the algebraic K-theory of, and algebraic cycles
on, algebraic varieties, using geometric, topological and algebraic methods. The
investigator proposes to further apply the descent methods developed in earlier
work in order to better understand the K-theory and Hochschild homology of
singularities. This work is related to well-known conjectures in the homology
theory of commutative algebras, as for example Bergers conjecture that curves
with torsion free differentials are smooth. In a separate project, the
investigator plans to study new height-type functions on algebraic cycles in
hopes of making progress on question of divisibility of cycles modulo algebraic
equivalence.

This project studies invariants of algebraic varieties, that is, objects that
can be realized as sets of solutions of polynomial equations. In particular, it
is proposed to study singularities (a black hole is an example of a singularity)
via an invariant called K-theory that encodes the behavior of very large
matrices of polynomial functions on the singularity; and to study the behavior
of families of formal sums of subvarieties (the sets of solutions of even more
equations).
