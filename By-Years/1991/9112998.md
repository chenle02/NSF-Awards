This project is designed to promote understanding and consensus on how rights in
primary scholarly communication should be managed in the emerging digital
network environment. The project is occasioned by the rapid growth of computer
networking and new forms of scholarly communication and publishing. The project
begins with further development of a background paper for understanding control
issues at different stages of the dissemination process. The investigators have
secured the cooperation of the Coalition for Networked Information, to assist
with computer conferences and a workshop in which scientists, engineers, and
other scholars who use computer networks will respond to the background
document. This process will also provide an occasion for identifying authors or
sources for relevant papers examining issues along the continuum of scholarly
communication, from research collaboration to site licensing. The goal is to
provide a coherent and accurate overview of the issues and institutions involved
in computer networking and publication. Project results are expected to include
journal articles, a monograph, and ongoing discussions and communications
involving relevant professional associations and academic and commercial
institutions. The investigators also expect to prepare additional proposals for
further research on these issues, and for the development of policy models for
the consideration of societies, funding agencies, and publishers. The topic of
this proposal is of highest priority for Ethics and Values Studies. The
qualifications and track record of these investigators are excellent. The
project provides an important effort to identify and classify issues of rights
in scholarly communication associated with new developments in networked
environments. Results will be useful for a wide range of individuals and groups.
The revised budget is modest. The proposal is recommended for support.
