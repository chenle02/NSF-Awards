This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to make
new blood vessels by using a synthesized human protein as a guide for growing
human cells into tissues. The guide will be molded into a tubular shape. The
protein, a water soluble form of human elastin can be produced by fermentation
and will be purified, mixed with a catalyst and cast into tubular shaped molds
made of glass or plastic. After the protein has set up in the tubular mold, it
will be removed, tested for its strength and ability to stretch, and mixed with
human epithelial cells in tissue culture media. The cells will be allowed to
grow on and within the solidified protein to form a combination of a strong,
elastic vessel surrounded by layers of human cells.

The broader impacts of this research are the availability of new and better
performing blood vessel material for dialysis patients. Dialysis patients
experience problems with damage to their blood vessels during the dialysis
procedure. These complications currently cost a total of $1.5 billion extra.
Reducing the costs, pain and complications by using a new vascular material
represents a large benefit to patients and physicians.
