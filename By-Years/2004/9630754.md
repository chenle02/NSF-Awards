This research focuses on social networks, which are designed to study the
relationships among individuals or other social entities. Applications of the
research are numerous, and include clinical and community psychology, social
psychology, organizational studies, and anthropology. A four year program of
research will be undertaken by the investigator and his collaborators to study
social network methodology and applications. Much of this research makes use of
a new family of statistical models for social networks, based on spatial
interaction models. There are five major areas of research proposed: (1)
Multivariate generalizations of this new family of models; (2) Additional work
on the statistical properties of the family; (3). Continued work on a merger of
algebraic and statistical models; (4) New approaches to the analysis of
longitudinal networks; and (5) New applications of the statistical methodology,
particularly to cognitive social structures and epidemics. This research program
will generate and improve tools for a more rigorous empirical analysis of social
and behavioral research, and should provide statistical results of interest to
methodologists.
