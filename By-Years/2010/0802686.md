The principal investigator is working on the following three
problems:&lt;br/&gt;(A) He is attempting to describe integral models for Shimura
varieties at primes of non-smooth reduction. In particular, he studies ``local
models" for Shimura varieties and their relation with affine flag varieties for
infinite dimensional groups and with deformation spaces of Galois
representations. The motivation is to obtain information that can be used in the
calculation of the Hasse-Weil zeta function of these varieties and in other
number theoretic applications.&lt;br/&gt;(B) He is developing refined and
functorial versions of the Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorem that would allow
for the calculation of torsion information.&lt;br/&gt;(C) He is studying the
representations that appear in the cohomology of arithmetic varieties with a
finite group action.&lt;br/&gt;In particular, he continues his work on
developing fixed point formulas for calculating invariants of such (integral)
representations using two interconnected themes: the theory of cubic structures
and the theory of central extensions of algebraic loop
groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator's research is in the field of
arithmetic algebraic geometry, a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of
mathematics: the geometry of figures that can be defined by the simplest
equations, namely polynomials, and the study of numbers. This combination has
proved extraordinarily fruitful - having solved problems that withstood
generations (such as ``Fermat's last theorem"). The investigator's work mainly
concentrates on the study of certain polynomial equations that have many
symmetries. There are connections with physics, the construction of error
correcting codes and cryptography.
