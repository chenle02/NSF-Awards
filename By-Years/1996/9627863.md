9627863 Evans The PI proposes to perform deformation experiments on single- and
two-phase calcite- quartz aggregates under varying loading conditions, to
characterize the resulting microstructures, and to formulate flow laws
(transient and steady-state) for the aggregates using several theoretical models
in order to provide a reliable methodology for extrapolations. The comparison of
theoretical and experimental results should establish guidelines for future
studies on the deformation behavior of polyphase rocks in the crust and mantle,
and could aid in understanding a wide range of geological processes including
the distribution and focal mechanisms of earthquakes, lithospheric deformation
and mantle convection. ***
