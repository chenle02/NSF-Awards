This project is creating three new films to be distributed in the DVD format on
1) MEMS-Microelectromechanical Systems, 2) Nanotech I: An Introduction, and 3)
Nanotech II: Manufacturing Processes. These new films continue the Silicon Run
Series of nine films that have been used successfully in technician education.
They enable students and faculty to get a view inside the manufacturing
processes and basic science behind the exciting new products in the nano-world.
The films educate and motivate students by giving them the big picture
underlying their academic studies. The project is distributing free copies of
the DVDs to community colleges serving as test sites and institutions on NSF's
list of minority serving institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
