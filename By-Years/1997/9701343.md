This is a proposal to assemble a data set that can be used to investigate the
precise timing of substorms. The PI will initiate a GEM campaign called the
Substorm Precision Timing Campaign and be responsible for developing the
campaign, advertising it to the NSF community, building the data base,
stimulating research on the data base, conducting meetings at GEM workshops,
organizing symposia to discuss results of the campaign, and directing efforts to
obtain publication of the results.
