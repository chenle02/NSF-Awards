9351293 Edwards A long-term goal of Texas Southern University's Department of
Biology is to develop and maintain a modern and well equipped molecular biology
teaching laboratory that provides state-of- the-art training opportunities for
undergraduate students who intend to pursue careers in health science fields,
including teaching, research, and medicine. This application requests funds to
purchase micro and high-speed centrifuges, equipment for organelle isolation and
genome analysis for teaching a laboratory course in "Experimentation in
Recombinant DNA Technology, Genome Analysis, and Cell Mapping" to supplement and
clarify the theory taught in Cell and Molecular Biology courses. The laboratory
experience is mandatory in preparing minority students for graduate and
professional schools, and for careers in college and precollege teaching. The
new equipment will allow students to develop experience in the preparation of
plasmids and plasmid DNA, fractionation of subcellular organelles and
preparation of genomic and Lambda DNA; to amplify DNA molecules for sequencing
and cloning in plasmid vectors, and produce libraries of genomic DNA; to isolate
Restriction Enzyme digests, separate DNA fragments, isolate chromosome-size DNA
molecules, sequence cloned DNA fragments and DNA isolated directly from agarose
gels. Not only is this equipment essential for teaching the proposed laboratory
course, it will also provide a facility for training other undergraduate
students in state-of-the-art methods in biochemical and molecular biology
procedures. ***
