This is a workshop to assist the U.S. Intelligent Manufacturing Systems (IMS)
steering and technical committees to inform the academic community of the IMS
opportunities and to assist the development of industrial partnerships. This
puts the NSF in a position to determine its role as a source of Federal support
for university participation in future national and international IMS
collaborations. Specifically, this workshop seeks to enhance the understanding
of Request for Expression of Interest (REI) respondents about the IMS program,
encourage the development of industry-government-academia teams, facilitate
collaboration among U.S. participants, and assist collaborative efforts in fully
understanding program requirements under the Terms of Reference and Modalities
of Operation for the various IMS "test cases".
