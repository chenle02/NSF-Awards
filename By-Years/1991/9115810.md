This proposal is submitted for consideration in the FY-92 instrumentation
competition conducted by the Division of Social and Economic Science of the
National Science Foundation. Applied economics research within the Department of
Economics at MIT, particularly in the areas of monetary and fiscal policy,
financial economics, labor economics, and economic planning in developing
countries, requires computational support for processing and statistical
analysis of large data sets, as well as related forecasting and simulation
activities. This proposal will provide scientific workstations for applied
economics faculty, and their research assistants, with sufficient storage and
computational capacity to carry out this research program. In the past, the
research program has been limited to projects that could be performed on
personal computers, or which have large extramural budgets for mainframe
computing. The workstations provided under this proposal will expand
substantially the flexibility of the research program, provide research
assistants earlier access to the analysis of large data sets, and permit studies
that previously could not be done with available resources. The MIT Economics
Department is among the best in the country. The type of research which it
proposes accords with core objectives of NSF's Division of Social and Economic
Science and its potential contribution to the education and development of human
resources is outstanding.
