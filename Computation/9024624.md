This project centers around an analysis of the algebraic properties of the
solutions of linear differential equations with polynomial coefficients and the
development of algorithms based upon this analysis that can be used to construct
improved interpolation schemes. In particular, the principal investigator will
use the theory of galois groups to solve linear differential equations in terms
of special functions. He will study also the algebraic structure of these
special functions with a view to improving algorithms for integration of the
differential equation in finite terms. And finally he will employ techniques
from the algebraic theory of differential equations to develop improved
interpolation formulas for sparse polynomials and rational functions.
