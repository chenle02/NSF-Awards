Chemistry (12) We are incorporating molecular modeling activities and
experiments throughout the undergraduate chemistry and biochemistry curriculum
to enhance student learning. We are adapting the Hope College's molecular
modeling and computational chemistry model for our courses by implementing
several published modeling activities and also developing our own open-ended
exercises to integrate into the Principles of Chemistry course, honors General
Chemistry course and the Physical Chemistry sequence. We anticipate a four-fold
program enhancement. First, the project is a strategic way to more effectively
and meaningfully engage students in our introductory chemistry course. Second,
molecular modeling enhances students' conceptual and visual understanding of the
molecules that are at the heart of chemistry. Third, molecular modeling can
improve student outcomes throughout the curriculum by providing a progression in
the sophistication of computational chemistry as a thread and pedagogical
resource. A fourth goal is providing majors with a realistic understanding of
the underlying computational theory. The use of a Linux-based cluster acting as
a Web server for a variety of Web-based molecular modeling tools in the project
provides a unique opportunity to address these goals. Two summer faculty
development workshops are conducted to add quality, quantity, and breadth to the
project implementation. Further, specific curricular enhancements are also
planned in the form of offering a new molecular modeling course. We expect that
this project will enhance the chemical education of our students in the life
sciences, many of whom will pursue graduate study. As well, we expect that
exposure to computational chemistry will be particularly important for students,
given its ubiquitous use in academic and industrial research in chemistry,
biochemistry, and molecular biology.
