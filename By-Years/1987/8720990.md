The hydrofracturing method of in situ stress measurements has evolved in the
last fifteen years into an indispensable tool in geophysical research. For
example, a major objective of the first deep scientific drilling in the U.S. at
Cajon Pass, California, is to measure the state of stress, primarily by
hydrofracturing, in the vicinity of the San Andreas fault. Despite the general
reliability of hydrofracturing, uncertainties in its interpretation still exist
and cases where the method is only partially successful or totally unsuccessful
are now surfacing. There are at least three major sources of difficulties in
hydrofracturing data interpretation: 1) reading the correct pressures from field
records, 2) using the correct model for calculating the in situ stresses and 3)
evaluating the effect of preexisting fractures on hydrofrac pressures and
directions. The research will resolve some of these difficulties through
laboratory testing and data analysis. In addition, experimental verification of
suggested innovative improvements of the method has been carried out. Such
confirmation of one or more of these alternate techniques would enable their use
in either complementing replacing conventional hydrofracturing.
