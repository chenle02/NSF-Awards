This project will investigate the accretion of the Earth and the seperation of
the Earth's core and crust from the mantle by analyzing geochemically well-
characterized samples from different geochemical reservoirs. Neutron activation
analysis will be used for the moderately siderophile and chalcophile trace
elements Mo, W, As, and Sb. The abundances of highly siderophile elements in the
mantle are not consistent with equilibrium between the core and mantle, as would
be expected assuming completely homogenous accretion of the Earth. The varying
depletions relative to elements with different affinities for Fe-metal or
sulfide provide clues to the events involving accretion and metal segregation in
the mantle, including the possibility of late veneers that accreted on the Earth
after core formation, or the possibility of metal retention in the mantle during
core formation. Determining the abundances and depletion of these elements in
samples of different geological ages will also address the timing of core
formation in the Earth, beacuse the possibility of continued core formation
through a substantial portion of geologic time has been invoked to explain some
of the recent lead isotope results for samples from the mantle.
