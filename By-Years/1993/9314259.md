9314259 Webb Webb Research Corporation is a small business that specializes in
design and construction of profilers and neutrally buoyant floats for ocean
science investigations. The company will design, con- struct, and field test six
prototypes of a derivative Autonomous Lagrangian Circulation Explorer (ALACE-B).
The primary focus will be the development of a new CO2-based buoyancy generation
engine that will be simpler and lighter than previously employed mechan- isms
for controlling the drifter's depth. ALACE drifters are neutrally buoyant
instruments that drift at a precise pressure gradient within the ocean. They
have the capability of carrying a variety of scientific sensors. By changing
buoyancy, they can ascend to the surface to telemeter data ashore, then change
buoyancy again to sink to their predetermined depth to make more measurements.
ALACE-B is designed to operate in the upper 400 meters of the oceans and make up
to 200 vertical excursions. Isopyncal drifters, such as ALACE, comprise an
important asset to the ocean science research community, and the ALACE-B will
provide a new low-cost, upper-ocean capability that meets the scientific
requirements of a variety of planned research topics.
