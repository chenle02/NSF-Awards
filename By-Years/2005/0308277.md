This project aims at reconciling the benefits that personalization of web-based
systems has demonstrably brought about with current privacy concerns of Internet
users and with upcoming privacy regulation and legislation. The project will
analyze and systemize these impacts, and &lt;br/&gt;develop principled solutions
as to how privacy requirements and benefits through personalization can be
reconciled. Specifically, an architecture for personalized systems will be
developed that can be dynamically configured, so that the personalization
methods in use are always in agreement with the current individual privacy
preferences as well as the privacy policies and legislation that apply to the
given user and the site of the application. Privacy will -- for the first time
-- become a design requirement in the development of personalized software
systems. The results of the project will benefit researchers in the area of
privacy-enhancing technology, and developers of personalized websites who need
to respect user privacy. The project outcomes will be published at academic
venues, and disseminated to industry and the general public. The project will
also contribute to the integration of research and teaching through the
employment of undergraduate and graduate students, and through the inclusion of
privacy issues into academic syllabi.&lt;br/&gt;
