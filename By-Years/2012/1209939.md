This action funds Lu Yao of University of Chicago to conduct a research project,
entitled "Chinese fossils and the evolution of Old World Monkeys," during the
summer of 2012 at the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology
in Beijing, China. The host scientist is Dr. Wei Dong.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project lies in morphological analyses of
the jaws and teeth of early Pleistocene Old World Monkey fossils from the
Tuozidong site in China in order to gain new insights into adaptive radiation of
the genus Macaca and evolution of Old World monkeys in general.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
