This research has been designed to study techniques for using EMG signals to
control functional electrical stimulation signals which activate lower limb
motor activity in paraplegics. The ultimate objective of the research is to
permit paraplegics to stand and walk, unbraced, with the aid of a walker.
Mapping of optimal placement of FES stimulation electrodes and of recording EMG
electrodes are major tasks in this research. EMG time-series signatures are also
being analyzed to provide maximal individualized control of the FES signals.
