The emissions and subsequent reactions in the troposphere of organic compounds
from vegetation is an important contribution to chemical cycles that lead to the
formation of ozone and other oxidants and of acidic species. Knowledge of the
emission rates of these biogenic compounds is crucial to understanding the role
of these compounds in the atmosphere and to assessing the effectiveness of
control strategies based on reduction of emissions from anthropogenic sources of
volatile organic compounds and oxides of nitrogen. Of these biogenic compounds,
isoprene is one of the most prevalent emissions from vegetation. This project
involves a closure field study of isoprene at a site in a deciduous forest of
central Pennsylvania. Isoprene and its immediate oxidation products will be
monitored so that diurnal concentration patterns of these species can be
established. Diffusion rates of gases in and above the forest canopy for typical
summertime meteorological conditions will be determined by tracer releases.
Vertical profiles of the concentrations of isoprene and important photochemical
reactants and of other environmental parameters will be measured from towers and
tethered balloons in order to obtain a mass balance of isoprene over the
forested area. The results of this study will provide an improved understanding
of the fate of isoprene in the atmosphere and how this natural hydrocarbon
affects key intermediates that control the levels of several chemically and
radiatively important species in the troposphere.
