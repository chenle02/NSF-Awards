9353928 Ingargiola The goal of this faculty enhancement workshop is to provide
instructors in two and four year colleges an exposure to the resources available
to teach the undergraduate introductory course in Artificial Intelligence. The
workshop will run for six days during June 1994 followed by two one-day
"reflection" workshops in November 1994 and April 1995. The major topics
addressed are (1) What resources are available and how they can be obtained, (2)
How to integrate classroom lectures with laboratory sessions and assignments
using available laboratory materials and network facilities, (3) How to adapt or
extend the available pedagogic material, (4) How to improve learning and
cooperation between instructors and their students, (5) How to establish and
maintain cooperative arrangements between instructors at different institutions,
and (6) Ideas on how to assess the effectiveness of various pedagogic methods
for using the resources. A Teaching Portfolio will be developed that includes
material distributed by the instructors, materials created by the participants
for their own courses, and suggestions by participants for further exploration.
