This project supports the dissertation research of an anthropology student from
the University of Michigan. The project is to study the effects of wage labor by
junior males on patterns of authority and conflict among the pastoral Samburu of
Kenya. It will address issues concerning how authority is structured in
households in traditional societies where the economic basis of income is
changing from a traditional pastoral to a wage labor economy. Both quantitative
survey methods and qualitative methods of interviews and participant observation
will be used. This research is important because patterns of authority have been
changing in traditional societies in response to changes in income
opportunities. Increased understanding of the household dynamics of these
changes can help planners accommodate the problems which such shifts in
authority entail.
