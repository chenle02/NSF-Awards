9406144 Knobloch This is a proposal to study the formation and stability
properties of patterns occurring in physical systems. Because such patterns
often exhibit a high degree of symmetry the techniques employed in the study are
designed to take full advantage of such symmetries. In practical applications
these symmetries are usually not exact. Therefore a particular emphasis of the
proposed work is to study the effects of small symmetry-breaking
``imperfections'' in the system. The proposed work is thus designed to make
symmetry-based techniques applicable to realistic systems. The proposal focuses
on the effects of distant endwalls on patterns in the form of propagating waves,
patterns of oscillations in acoustically excited spherical bubbles and the
formation of three-dimensional patterns in morphogenesis. This is a proposal to
study bifurcations and pattern formation in systems with symmetry. Such systems
occur naturally in a variety of applications. The proposal focuses on pattern
formation near onset. In this regime the process is described by amplitude
equations. In symmetric systems these must respect the assumed symmetries. The
resulting equations enable one to compute not only the possible patterns but
also their relative stability. The proposal focuses on extending this approach
to three-dimensional patterns (such as those created by the Turing instability
or the modes of oscillation of an acoustically excited bubble). In addition in
order to make the technique applicable to realistic systems in which the assumed
symmetries are usually only approximate the proposal emphasizes the study of
small externally imposed symmetry-breaking imperfections. Such imperfections may
have important qualitative consequences and may be responsible for the
introduction of chaotic dynamics into systems that would otherwise be
nonchaotic. ***
