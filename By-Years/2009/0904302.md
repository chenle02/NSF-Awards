This award will support continued work based on the recent discovery that
coherent rotational wavepackets in oxygen and nitrogen molecules in air can
exert surprisingly strong control over high power femtosecond laser
filamentation. The wavepackets manifest themselves in air as refractive index
lenslets that propagate as quantum echo wakes following the filamenting laser
pulse at its group velocity. A secondary pulse injected into these wakes,
depending on the injection delay, can either be trapped and steered or scattered
out of the beam axis. These results promise to allow much higher filament laser
power, greatly extended filament lengths, increased electron density, and
enhanced filament continuity, all essential for applications of femtosecond
filaments, including terahertz generation, remote ionization, nonlinear light
generation and atmospheric monitoring, and channels for electrical discharges.
The proposed experiments represent a novel direction in plasma physics of some
intellectual merit: the interaction of quantum coherent ensembles with plasmas.
&lt;br/&gt;The award will also support another set of experiments in laser-
nanoparticle interactions. The goal is to control the nanoplasma dynamics with
the strong laser ponderomotive force, the high field analogue of inertial
confinement.&lt;br/&gt;This highly interdisciplinary experimental and
theoretical work provides an excellent training experience for graduate and
undergraduate students. The physical ideas underlying the experiments, and the
diagnostic techniques developed to measure ultrafast processes under extreme
conditions, have a broad science and technology impact, from national defense to
industry.&lt;br/&gt;
