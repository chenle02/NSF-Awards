teleconference will include specialists/practitioners in the field of rural
education, who will be present in the studio audience or will be linked in real
time to the studio by video interface. The conference will focus on
recommendations designed to inform the development of a proposed Rural Systemic
Initiative by the National Science Foundation. Copies of the teleconference will
be supplied to NSF on VHS format. ***
