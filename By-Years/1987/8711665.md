The research deals with the drying and curing mechanisms, ultimately in complex
bicontinuous materials like sol-gel and certain polymer blends. An objective is
a mathematical mechanistic description that accounts for stress states that
arise, and what determines defect formation. Drying rates and moisture or
solvent distributions are observed experimentally. Moisture distributions are
measured. Stresses are measured. After the work on mathematical theory and
testing, the results are applied to design, optimization, and control drying and
curing processes for coatings. Finally simplification of the theory results in
more easily applied design equations. This project is one supported under the
Creativity Awards for Undergraduate Engineering Students.
