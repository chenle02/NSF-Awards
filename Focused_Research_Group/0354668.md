Title: Eigenfunctions of the Laplacian

ABSTRACT

This proposal is concerned with estimates of solutions of wave equations on
(both compact and non-compact) Riemannian manifolds, possibly with boundary. We
are interested in how the geometry, the boundary and the regularity of the
metric influence certain basic estimates. Problems of this kind arise both in
the study of local and global existence of solutions of nonlinear wave equations
and in the study of eigenfunctions of Laplacians in quantum chaos. Although
these topics are widely separated in their physical origins, the relevant
mathematics is closely related and the techniques and insights in the two areas
cross fertilize in a fruitful way. Each of the PIs is an expert one of these
areas. By pooling our knowledge through a FRG grant we shall be able to make
significant progress in these fields as well as possibly in related ones such as
general relativity theory.

Eigenfunctions are the building blocks of functions. Understanding their basic
size and concentration properties helps us solve new differential equations. In
the other direction, techniques from the study of nonlinear wave equations have
recently been used to prove new results about eigenfunctions. This proposal is
about continuing this cross-fertilization of related fields.
