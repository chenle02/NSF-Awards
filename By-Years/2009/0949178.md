This proposal seeks NSF support for a Indo-U.S. Workshop on Parallelism and the
Future of High-Performance Computing that will take place on January 7 and 8,
2010, just before the PPoPP and HPCA Symposia, in Bangalore. Funds are requested
to partially cover travel expenses for up to 20 senior US-based researchers and
20 students. In addition to the proposed US participants the workshop attendees
will include prominent Indian researchers listed in the proposal. Most of the
U.S. workshop team members will be invited speakers and panelists.

The objective of this workshop is to initiate interactions between Indian
students, senior researchers, and developers and their US counterparts in the
area of parallel programming and computing in order to improve mutual
understanding and create opportunities for collaborations. The proposed workshop
is expected to result in innovative research directions, due to the
participation of the experts in the field. Research ideas resulting from the
discussions can have far reaching impact in the way HPC systems are used
worldwide. In the future, international collaborations might produce joint
research proposal(s) to funding agencies in India and/or the U.S.
