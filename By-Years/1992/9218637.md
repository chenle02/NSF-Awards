This award supports a paleobotanical study of existing samples from late
Paleozoic and Mesozoic sedimentary rock formations in the Central Transantarctic
Mountains. The project encompasses investigations of fossil forests,
permineralized peat deposits, compression/impression floras, and palynomorphs
(pollen). This project is a portion of a continuing effort to elucidate the
paleobiology and biostratigraphy of the late Paleozoic and early Mesozoic of
Antarctic. This paleobotanical work forms the cornerstone of paleoenvironmental
reconstructions for the time of formation of the rocks and provides an important
method of testing paleoclimatic models for the region.
