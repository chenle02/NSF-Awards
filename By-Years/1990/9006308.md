This project deals with a selection of theoretical and numerical aspects for
certain classes of parabolic partial differential equations. Determination of
surface temperature and heat flux from a finite set of interior temperature
measurements, stable under noisy data will be investigated. Theoretical and
numerical analysis of methods involving eigenfunction expansions of initial data
and Whittaker Cardinal expansions of initial and boundary data will be studied.
In this part of the work, the investigator will employ more standard
regularization techniques for recovering the Fourier coefficients of initial
data. However, the stability of the numerical inversion based on Whittaker
Cardinal expansions is novel. In this approach, the problem of choosing a
regularizing parameter as in standard approaches no longer exists. However, the
"regularizing" necessary for this method takes the form of an appropriate choice
of the number of spatial sensors and the sampling time, both of which have been
completely determined in recent work for special cases. A further regularization
is obtained by a suitable apriori restriction of the class of initial data
appropriate to Sinc Expansions.
