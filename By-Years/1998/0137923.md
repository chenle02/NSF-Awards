Partial funding is provided for the purchase of a mass spectrometer at Texas
A&amp;M University to meet the requirements of paleoceanographic and
paleoenvironmental research and teaching. Bulk of the funding for the instrument
(70%) is already available and additional funds have been committed by the
institution to pay for uninterruptible power supply system. The purchase of the
instrument will benefit NSF funded research in paleoceanography and
paleoclimatology.&lt;br/&gt;
