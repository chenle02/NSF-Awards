9305840 Lurie This research will develop a direct approach to the relaxation of
nonselfadjoint problems of optimal design. The associated min-max problems are
investigated applying the notion of quasi-saddle behavior of integrand as the
necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of min-max. We also develop
an alternative approach to the problem reducing it to a standard minimization
after the Legendre transform is applied to the adjoint field. %%% The goal of
the research is to develop a methodology for the determination of optimal
structural characteristics of elastic bodies designed for work in a variety of
external conditions (load, static and dynamic response, loss of stability,) or
under the action of combined physical fields (stresses and temperature, electric
and magnetic fields, etc.) The analytic results will be implemented in a new
numerical technique to compute optimal designs using advanced composites. This
technique will give truly optimal designs as compared to existing methods. ***
