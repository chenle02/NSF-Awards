The presence of a nontrivial symmetry group can profoundly affect the dynamics
of a physical system. In particular, it has been recently appreciated that the
instabilities or bifurcations observed in such systems typically exhibit highly
nongeneric features when symmetry breaking occurs. This project is to study the
nonlinear mathematical models with detailed investigation of specific physical
systems. Particular emphasis is placed on the symmetry groups 0(2) and S0(2)
because of their relevance to applications, and on the dynamics arising from
multiple instabilities of mode interactions. The technique to be applied are
those of equivariant bifurcation theory, center manifold reduction, and normal
form analysis. The goal is to obtain an understanding of symmetry breaking
transitions between pre- chaotic states as well as the impact of symmetry on the
transition to chaos. For specific fluid systems with circular symmetry one
expects to obtain results which may be tested in numerical and laboratory
experiments.
