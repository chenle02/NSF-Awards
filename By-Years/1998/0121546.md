Through this Information Technology Research award, electrical engineers,
computer scientists, and meteorologists at Colorado State University are
developing a networked radar environment that will link multiple sensors in a
distributed information environment and provide internet-based access to fused
multi-dimensional data gathered from different radars and other meteorological
sensors. It is an interdisciplinary project involving research in networking,
radar technology, data fusion, and radar meteorology. Tasks include research on
data fusion from multiple sensors with widely differing spatial and temporal
scales and bandwidths, and novel methods of assuring data quality and data
dissemination using principles of meta-data. The project will be centered on the
CSU-CHILL national radar facility, a polarimetric Doppler radar operated by
Colorado State University through a cooperative agreement with the National
Science Foundation. Other data to be employed in the networking experiments are
from NEXRAD radars at the National Weather Service offices in Denver and
Cheyenne, the CSU Pawnee radar, located 48 km north of the CHILL radar, from
satellite data, and from a surface network of rain gauges and other instruments.
Several other universities will participate as remote test sites by using the
networked environment created by this project. The experiment provides unique
educational opportunities in networking research, radar science and technology,
data fusion, neuro fuzzy systems, cloud and precipitation physics, and severe
storm research.
