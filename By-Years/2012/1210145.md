This action funds Kevin Hung Pham of the University of Texas at Arlington to
conduct a research project, entitled "Investigating the role of a fluctuating
solar wind and the effects of the polarity of the solar wind's magnetic field on
geomagnetic storms," during the summer of 2012 at the National Central
University in Jhongli City, Taiwan. The host scientist is Lin-Ni Hau.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project lies in a better understanding of
the space weather around Earth. Space weather can have a great impact on the
people and technology, in space and on Earth. The research seeks to determine
which polarity of the solar wind's magnetic field causes a more severe
geomagnetic storm and whether a fluctuating solar wind has a significant
contribution to geomagnetic storms. It is crucial to understand what conditions
lead to severe space weather such as geomagnetic storms which can cause power
grid failures, navigational difficulties, and other serious disruptions.

The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-
hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science,
science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
