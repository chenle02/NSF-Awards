The Boehls Butte anorthosite is exposed within the broad border zone of the
northern Idaho batholith and has experienced multiple episodes of fluid-rock
interaction, including magmatic, regional metamorphic and meteoric-hydrothermal
events. This study will examine the stable isotopic and geochemical effects of
superimposed fluid-rock interaction on the anorthosite and metasediments at its
contact. The objectives of this study are (1) to differentiate the isotopic and
geochemical effects of post-metamorphic and synmetamorphic fluid-rock
interaction, (2) to constrain the relative contributions of igneous, metamorphic
and hydrothermal processes to the development of unique mineralogies and
isotopic compositions in the anorthosite and (3) to determine the extent to
which regional metamorphism was accompanied by, or merely overprinted by,
hydrothermal fluid convection associatated with batholith intrusion. Fluid-rock
interaction will be characterized by a combine study of stable isotopes, fluid
inclusions, mineral-fluid equilibria and trace element geochemistry. The results
will constrain the depth, magnitude and timing of convective fluid flow through
metamorphic rocks in the border zone of the batholith, constraining the efficacy
of deep-seated fluid convection as a dynamic process in regional metamorphism.
