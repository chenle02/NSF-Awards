Eukaryotic cilia and flagella are found widely in plants, animals and protozoa.
The structure and basic mechanism of function of eukaryotic cilia and flagella
is common among these wide variety of organisms. This proposal is aimed toward
understanding the mechanism and regulation of eukaryotic flagellar movement. The
specific aim is to determine how the dynein mechanochemical cycle regulates
movement. The approach taken is to develop the use of compounds with specific
effect on dynein kinetics to study their effect on movement. One compound
already identified for this study is the two-substituted ATP analog, 2- C1 ATP.
In contrast to previously studied ATP analogs, 2-C1 ATP is a surprisingly good
substrate for dynein ATPase activity and supports axonemal movement. This and
other analogs will be used to determine how effects on dynein affect axonemal
movement by studying their effect on steps in the dynein-microtubule ATPase
cycle and dynein-mediated microtuble sliding. This approach will allow
elucidation of which step in the dynein mechanochemical cycle may be associated
with paramenters of movement. Ciliary and flagellar motility is a fundamental
kind of motility which is critical to the lives of all kinds of eukaryotic
organisms. The simple protists, and spermatozoa, are propelled by this
mechanism. In higher animals, cilia are used move mucus to better understand the
molecular aspects of this remarkable biological function.
