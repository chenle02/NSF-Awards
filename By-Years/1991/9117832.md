The distribution, abundance, feeding habits and growth rates of fish early life
stages within Gerlache Strait, Antarctica will be examined in relation to
physical and biological processes. This project is part of the interdisciplinary
program RACER (Research on Antarctic Ecosystem Rates). Samples were collected
during one month long cruises during October-November 1989 (spring), and
December 1991-January 1992 (summer) and April-May 1992 (early winter). Young
fish assemblages were sampled with vertically and horizontally stratified
zooplankton tows and oblique tows. Laboratory work will include stomach content
analysis and growth rate determination using otolith daily growth rings. This
project is the first detailed description of larval fish assemblages in
nearshore Antarctic Peninsula waters. It will permit evaluation of the
importance of the highly productive coastal area relative to offshore waters in
supporting ichthyoplankton assemblages and mechanisms affecting larval
dispersal. It will add information on higher trophic levels in this highly
productive regions of the coastal ecosystem. It will also provide basic
biological information on the young stages of commercially and ecologically
important fish stocks.
