9314090 O'Grady This is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research in support of the
Intelligent Manufacturing Systems (IMS) Initiative. In an unprecedented world
wide effort, numerous commercial organizations and universities have joined
together under the aegis of the IMS test case for concurrent engineering to
conduct a one year feasibility study. This grant provides partial support for a
student to work in this effort. This support is important in that it provides
student involvement in a project that may be the forerunner of a new paradigm
for the way research is to be performed.
