SBR-9529104 Howard This award supports international travel for five
geomorphologists to attend the 1995 Binghamton Geomorphology Symposium. This
year's symposium is has the theme of biogeomorphology in continental and in
freshwater-aquatic systems. The symposium assesses the progress made in the
interdisciplinary area of biogeomorphology (study of the interaction of
geomorphic, hydrological, and ecological phenomena) in the 35 years since the
publication of the seminal article in the field. The field has developed
somewhat differently within and outside the United States, so that the
participation of key foreign researchers is of great value. Topics of the
symposium include interactions between geomorphic and ecological processes,
vegetation's effects on runoff, influences of animals on soil and sedimentation,
and the effects of vegetation on geomorphic processes in a wide variety of
climatic regimes.
