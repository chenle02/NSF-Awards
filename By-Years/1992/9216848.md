This is a cooperative agreement to fund a multidisciplinary effort linking
research in computer science, behavioral science, and upper atmospheric and
space science to build a prototype system for a distributed but shared working
environment: the vision of a collaboratory. This effort conceives, develops,
deploys, tests, evaluates, and integrates a high performance group centered
computing environment into the collaborative experimental and modeling
activities ongoing in the upper atmospheric research community. The upper
atmospheric researchers here are a collaborating group engaged in observational
activities using a variety of instruments located at the Sondre Stromfjord,
Greenland upper atmospheric research facility. Many of these activities are
directed at rare or intermittent phenomena requiring real time control of
instruments by the scientists observing the changing conditions. This is
presently accomplished by visits to the remote facility. To prototype test and
evaluate the distributed tools for collaboration, research under this agreement
will develop a user- oriented, rapid prototyping testbed built around the Sondre
Stromfjord facility and its user community. Testing and evaluation of the
prototype tools will involve measurements of human behavior. This research will
add to the understanding of effective use of collaboration tools by performing
studies of use and effectiveness of these tools among the testbed users. The
Sondre Stromfjord researchers expect to obtain greater efficiency in joint
experimental operations, analysis, and discovery by guiding the requirements for
the collaboration environment which they will utilize to support their
research.//
