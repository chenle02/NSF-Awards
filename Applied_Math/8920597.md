In 1937, Fisher wrote a classic paper on the spread of an advantageous gene in
a population living in a homogeneous one- dimensional habitat. Fisher's model is
highly idealized. For example, he assumed that the fitnesses of the individuals
and the population size are constant. This makes the model difficult to apply.
The principal investigator will to study this model without such assumptions,
thus making the model more realistic. This poses many challenging mathematical
problems which the principal investigator intends to surmount using topological
methods such as degree theory, shooting arguments and Conley's index theory.
Results obtained will clearly illustrate the impact of applied mathematics on
biological sciences, in particular the effects of nonlinearities in natural
selection.
