This project is aimed at how to create and use elementary mathematics diagnostic
tools in classroom contexts. An established diagnostic framework, the Diagnostic
Test of Arithmetic Skills, that enables teachers to assess students' procedural
and conceptual approaches to mathematical problem-
solving.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific goals of the project are
to:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Revise, modify, and update the Diagnostic Test of
Arithmetic Skills to bring it into alignment with the most current research on
mathematics teaching and learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Build a mathematics
diagnostic application focused on multiplication, a content areas that is
pedagogically and conceptually complex&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Identify the
required professional development supports, and build prototype materials for
the multiplication application&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conduct research studies on
the reliability of the diagnostic tool and on whether the use of the tool
affects teachers' thinking about mathematics and instruction.&lt;br/&gt;
