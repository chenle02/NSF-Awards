9619821 Warder ABSTRACT The purpose of this project is to provide research
experiences in bioengineering for 12 undergraduate students at The University of
Memphis (UM). At least half of the students will be selected from institutions
other than UM, with several recruited from HCBU institutions such as Tennessee
State, Rust College (Mississippi), and Clafin College (South Carolina), and
other undergraduate schools in the State. Each student will undertake a specific
research project, and a faculty advisor (participating in the REU program) will
work with the student to develop his/her research skills. An essential element
of the program will be its emphasis on professional development of the students
(e.g., paper writing and technical presentations). The purpose is to infuse
bright undergraduate students with an enthusiasm towards graduate level
education and research careers. The University of Memphis has made substantial
institutional commitments to the program. These include waiver of tuition and
fees for the student participants, waiver of all overhead costs, and stipends
for two minority students (in addition to those supported by the NSF funds). ***
