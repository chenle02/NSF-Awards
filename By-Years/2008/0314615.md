This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
supports research by Dr. Charles H. Winter at Wayne State University to develop
and evaluate precursors for the growth of thin metal nitride and oxide films by
Atomic Layer Deposition and related layer-by-layer film growth techniques. As
the microelectronics industry moves to progressively smaller sizes, traditional
materials may no longer provide the required properties in future devices. This
research aims at producing thin films of new metal nitride barrier materials
(TaN, WNx) and new metal oxide insulators through the study of volatile tantalum
complexes and the synthesis, structure, and properties of tungsten(VI)
complexes. Substitutents in these compounds will be manipulated to achieve the
thermal stability and reactivity toward ammonia, hydrazine derivatives, and
other nitrogen source compounds required for nitride Atomic Layer Deposition
film growth. Volatile zirconium, halfnium and lanthanide metal amidinate
compounds will also be explored to achieve the thermal stability and reactivity
toward water, oxygen, ozone, and other source compounds required for oxide
Atomic Layer Deposition film growth. Information from the deposition experiments
will be used to design improved second and third generation precursors that
maximize materials properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Successful execution of this
research leads toward a range of optimized Atomic Layer Deposition precursors to
provide important types of metal nitride and oxide thin films. The growth of
very thin layers of nitride barrier materials and high dielectric oxides by
Atomic Layer Deposition techniques is a central challenge that must be solved to
maintain the pace of future miniaturization in microelectronics devices. A
central feature of the proposed research is the collaboration with Professor
Niinisto at the University of Helsinki to perform Atomic Layer Deposition film
growth studies. The proposed pairing of synthetic inorganic and film growth
groups will accelerate the development of Atomic Layer Deposition precursors and
film growth procedures. Students will benefit from working in an
interdisciplinary environment that includes synthetic inorganic chemistry, film
growth and characterization, international experience, and industrial
internships. The scope of the proposed research requires the development of
excellent communication skills to prosper in academic, industrial, and
international settings. The students will experience a diverse educational
environment, and will emerge with very broad scientific skills and perspective
that will prepare them well for their independent careers. &lt;br/&gt;
