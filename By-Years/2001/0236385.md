MohanKumar, Sheba 0236385&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of this project is to
study how immune products that increase during stressful situations or
inflammation affect reproductive hormones. The primary focus is on the
reproductive hormone called luteinizing hormone (LH) , which is secreted by the
anterior pituitary. This hormone stimulates the development of ovarian follicles
and ovulation and helps in maintaining regular reproductive cycles. The
secretion of this hormone is controlled by luteinizing hormone releasing hormone
(LHRH) that is secreted by a group of neurons in the hypothalamus, which are
influenced by a variety of neurotransmitters in the brain. Of these
neurotranmitters, norepinephrine is believed to be stimulatory to LHRH secretion
while gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) is believed to be inhibitory. Immune
products are known to inhibit the secretion of LH, but the mechanism by which
they do so is not clear. These immune products could affect two different
classes of neurotransmitters to produce this effect. They could decrease the
secretion of norepinephrine and stimulate the secretion of GABA, thereby
decreasing LHRH production and subsequent luteinizing hormone secretion. The
proposed studies will determine how these two neurotransmitters interact with
each other to affect luteinizing hormone. These experiments will offer research
opportunities for minority graduate and undergraduate students who will use
state-of-the-art techniques such as push-pull perfusion in combination with high
performance liquid chromatography, radioimmunoassay, in situ hybridization to
accomplish their research goals.&lt;br/&gt;
