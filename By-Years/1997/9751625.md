This project provides scientific and computing equipment to be used by
undergraduates to perform laboratory experiments and student research in seven
biology, five chemistry, and three mathematics courses. A computer learning
center for mathematics and science provides for (1) expanded use of computers
for instruction in mathematics and science courses; (2) the modification of
existing laboratory experiments and the introduction of new laboratory
experiments involving computerized data acquisition and analysis; and (3)
enhanced student access to computers, facilitating computer-based assignments
and follow-ups to laboratories. Mathematical and scientific concepts are
strongly linked through the more extensive studies that may be accomplished with
the aid of computers. Strengthening interdisciplinary learning is a major goal
of the investigators involved. Mathematics is developing course materials using
examples from the sciences. The sciences are introducing more sophisticated
mathematical modeling and data analysis into their laboratories to achieve this
goal. The requested equipment can have a significant impact on students from a
variety of disciplines that include both basic mathematics and science, as well
as secondary education and allied health majors. *
