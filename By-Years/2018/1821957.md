Electronic systems are creating a renewed innovation cycle in many industries,
including automobiles and manufacturing. These systems, which are at the heart
of innovation in areas such as autonomous systems, often incorporate Machine
Learning (ML) components to make decisions. Since safety, reliability, and
predictability are paramount in these systems, this award funds a workshop to
explore safe, reliable, and predictable applications of machine learning methods
and systems, the performance of which often depends on factors that are not
within the full control of the user or the system designer. These latter factors
could range from uncertainties in training data, to lack of robust algorithms,
to probabilistic aspects of inference mechanism etc. The organizing committee,
as well as the participants are composed of individuals from academia, industry
and the government, include diverse participation from minority, women and
underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Examples of technical aspects to
be discussed at the workshop include, but are not limited to: (1) survey of
relevant machine learning techniques, (2) data analytics currently used by
electronic design automation, and problems in which similar paradigms are used,
and (3) robustness, test, validation and verification in the context of ML. The
outcomes of the workshop will be reported publicly and shared widely with the
research community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
