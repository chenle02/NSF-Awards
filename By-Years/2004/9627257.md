*** 9627257 Maragakis The objective of this project is the establishment of a
"Bridge Research and Information Center". The primary goals of this center will
be the following: 1. To establish complete collection of information on past;
current and future research on a wide variety of topics on bridge engineering.
2. To use the latest computer technology for the processing and storage of the
information and its dissemination to bridge researchers, engineers, consultants,
companies as well as institutions, libraries and other similar organizations all
over the world. 3. To provide on-line video access of highlights of major tests
and experimental data. 4. To continuously expand the center activities and to
respond to users; requests by making adjustments and modifications to serve
their needs. The center will also conduct the yearly workshops for bridge
engineering through the UJNR panel on wind and seismic effects.***
