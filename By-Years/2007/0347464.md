Using force and tactile (haptic) feedback, humans are able to accomplish complex
exploration and manipulation tasks in unstructured environments, even when other
sensory modes are limited. However, we cannot reach environments that are remote
in space and/or scale, such as outer space, under bodies of water, and inside
the human body. The proposed research activity will harness the extraordinary
ability of human exploration through novel telemanipulation systems. The
intellectual merit is that controls, human factors, and modeling techniques will
be used to develop versatile, practical telemanipulators that provide
appropriate haptic feedback to the operator and automatically generate detailed
haptic models of explored environments. A set of crucial telemanipulation issues
will be addressed: (1) sensor/actuator asymmetry, which is necessary for
practical implementation in many applications, (2) the roles of level and
degrees of freedom of haptic feedback during teleoperated haptic exploration,
and (3) the design and control of virtual fixtures that assist in teleoperated
exploration, while not interfering with the operator's perception of the remote
environment. The broader impacts of this work are safety for humans working in
hazardous environments and improved health care through robot-assisted surgery.
Specific education goals are to create haptic laboratories and public displays
that use the sense of touch to improve scientific understanding and interest in
technology
