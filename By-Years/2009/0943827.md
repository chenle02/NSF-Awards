ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;10 July 2009&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:
0943827&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Columbia University, LDEO&lt;br/&gt;PI: A.
Walsh&lt;br/&gt;Co-PI: D. Goldberg, P. Ljunggren&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law
111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal requests numerous Shipboard Scientific
Support (SSSE) items for the vessels operated by the Lamont-Doherty Earth
Observatory (LDEO); namely the R/V MARCUS LANGSETH. The requests specifically
include items that have been recommended from past NSF inspections, Navy
INSURV's, or Post-Cruise Assessments (PCA's) and have been otherwise deferred by
the operators due to cost. All of the items requested will either improve
safety, enhance science support capability, or extend vessel service life. Due
to the nature and timing of these requests, the vendor quotation standards
normally required by the SSSE Program were waived out of necessity with many of
the figures provided as estimates for budgetary purposes and based mainly on
past experience of the vessel operators for similar work.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The LANGSETH supports federally funded
scientific research throughout the world's oceans to expand human knowledge of
the ocean environment and is the only 3D seismic vessel in the academic fleet.
During operations, the vessels routinely expose graduate and undergraduate
students to seagoing oceanography through real-time satellite connectivity from
ship to shore, and open house events. The LANGSETH is scheduled to complete over
260 NSF sponsored days in 2009.
