The principle investigator (PI) proposes a program of basic research in
information theory. The topics include: 1. information capacity of the
mismatched Gaussian channel with feedback; 2. coding capacity of the mismatched
Gaussian channel and development of coding-decoding algorithms; 3. information
capacity and coding capacity of non-Gaussian channels; 4. information and coding
capacity of partially-known channels, and development of coding-decoding
algorithms; and 5 modeling and analysis of channels subject to jamming. The work
proposed is for channels of a general nature. However, the emphasis is on
channels with memory.
