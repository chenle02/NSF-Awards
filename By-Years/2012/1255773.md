This is a short term (less than one-year) effort to develop and implement an
accurate operational attitude determination algorithm for the NSF Dynamic
Ionosphere CubeSat Experiment (DICE) space weather mission. It will support the
development of required software modules as well as continued operation of the
two DICE satellites. Completion of the software modules will result in corrected
calibrated electron density and temperature data from the Langmuir Probes
onboard the satellites. More importantly, it will also enable an operational
capability to retrieve the satellite attitude information so that both
satellites can be reliably steered into the appropriate orientation for the
E-field booms to be successfully deployed. This, in turn, will enable E-field
measurements to be obtained, and the full science mission to be
completed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tasks will be carried out as a collaborative
effort between scientists and engineers at Utah State University (USU),
Atmospheric &amp; Space Tech Research Associates, and Embry-Riddle Aeronautical
University (ERAU). The project will promote education and learning by involving
students at USU and ERAU in both the satellite operations and data analysis
tasks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dynamic Ionosphere Cubesat Experiment (DICE) is
one of the first NSF Cubesat missions to be selected and flown. The DICE project
consists of two CubeSats, weighing less than 2.2 kg each, which were launched
into a highly eccentric low Earth orbit on October 28, 2011. Together the DICE
CubeSats measure gradients of electric fields and electron densities in the
ionosphere. The main science goal of the DICE project is to study the causes of
storm enhanced densities (SED), which is a major space weather disturbance and
concern.
