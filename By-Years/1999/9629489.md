9629489 Lozier This project is a CAREER program in which the PI will integrate
research and teaching in her overall career development. Under the educational
component, the PI will develop a new undergraduate course in physical
oceanography designed for science majors. With the aim of teaching how the study
of physical oceanography relates to our natural environment, the course would
fill a serious void in current undergraduate education. In addition, the PI will
develop an extensive outreach program for advanced high school students. Under
the research component, the PI will study the structure, extent and role of
recirculations below the main thermocline in the North Atlantic, motivated by a
new, high-resolution climatology developed in large part by her. With initial
focus on the North Atlantic, extensions will be made into the South Atlantic as
the data become available. A forward model will be used in the later stages of
the study to begin to assimilate the data into a theoretical framework.
