This researcch project will use fluorescent tagging techniques to follow the
fates of cells in the anterior neural plate and ridge of Xenopus laevis. In a
previous study, the investigators found that the dyes Hoechst and DiI could
successfully be used as autonomous markers for small groups of cells in the
neural plate. With these dyes they were able to construct a detailed fate map of
the neural plate. Three aspects of this fate map will receive detailed attention
in the planned research: 1) The cellular movements associated with the most
anterior plate and ridge will be charted; 2) The ancestry of the anterior
pituitary will be clarified; and 3) The regulatory capacities of the anterior
neural plate and ridge will receive detailed examination.
