9528544 DePaolo This award is part of a multi-disciplinary project to drill a
4.5 km hole into the eastern flank of Mauna Kea volcano in Hawaii. The primary
purpose of the drill hole is to acquire a continuous physical and geochemical
record of the growth of a major intraplate hotspot volcano. The PIs are most
interested in using this record to constrain the dynamics and nature of mantle
plumes and other mantle processes; in addition, the sample set provided by the
borehole will also be very valuable to other communities of investigators such
as volcanology and paleomagnetism, and the study of the fluids flowing from the
borehole will provide information about shield-volcano hydrogeology. ***
