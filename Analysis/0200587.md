ABSTRACT:

The core of this proposal is to systematically study certain interactions
between holomorphic function spaces and operator theory. These holomorphic
spaces include Dirichlet spaces, potential capacity related scale space which
covers Bloch space and BMOA, and the analytic Morrey spaces. The operators are
multipliers, bilinear forms, such as Hankel operators and Toeplitz operators,
and commutators. The study involves the following objects: the orthogonal
projection, the point evaluation operator, mean value operator, the differential
operator such as d-bar, Laplacian and Dirac operators, Clifford analysis, atomic
decomposition, approximation numbers, predual, intermediate spaces, Carleson
measures and potential capacity. Techniques in harmonic analysis, complex
analysis and operator theory will bebe used and developed in this study.

Beside its own charm in pure mathematical research, the interaction between
holomorphic function spaces and operator theory has many applications in several
fields of applied sciences. Automatic control, navigation and system design in
engineering are examples of the applications. Operator theory has its roots in
the rigorization of quantum mechanics and it is now widely used in control
theory.
