This proposal requests funding to assist approximately 5 US-based graduate
students and junior faculty to attend the 18th annual New Security Paradigms
Workshop (NSPW) to be held in Oxford, UK, September 8-11, 2009. This is a unique
meeting that combines scientific talks interleaved with vivid discussions, whose
goal is to explore paradigm shifts that disrupt the status quo in security
research.

NPSW is thought provoking, research stimulating, and is a highly valuable and
unique experience to it participants. The support requested in this proposal
will enable the participation of students and junior faculty who would otherwise
be unable to attend NPSW.
