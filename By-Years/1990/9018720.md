The production of humoral immune responses is dependent on antibody-producing
B-cells which develop from precusor stem cells that are present in the bone
marrow. Antigen-independent B-cell differentiation involves a series of
developmental stages (generally designated as pre-B cell stages) during which a
sequential and ordered recombination of antibody genes occurs. Although the
stages of pre-B cell differentiation have been fairly well characterized, the
control signals that regulate the progressive steps of pre-B cell maturation are
not yet understood. We have previously proposed that DNA recombination might
play a role in the initiation of lambda gene recombination in maturing pre-B
cells. We now propose to directly test this hypothesis by producing mice
carrying a mutation that prevents the recombination of RS DNA. We will determine
the physiological effect of this RS mutation on B-cell maturation. The results
from this project have the potential to have a major impact upon our
understanding of the events which occur in the formation of active antibodies in
mammals.
