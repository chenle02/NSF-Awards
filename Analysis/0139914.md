The investigator and his colleagues undertake a coordinated effort to bring to
bear ideas from analysis, geometry, and statistics on the problem of analysing
spectroscopic data in high dimensions. A major challenge confronting the
analytical chemist involves the organization and manipulation of massive amounts
of data, both measured and computed. Recent work indicates that special
geometric structures allow for efficient transcription and modeling of the
relation between spectral measurements and material composition. The
investigators develop tools to identify such structures and to automate the
process of analysis and feature extraction. In particular, the investigators
concentrate on near-infrared spectra of blood, with the goal being to estimate
concentrations of various blood analytes from noninvasive spectrometric
measurements. The multidisciplinary team undertakes a coherent approach in which
various aspects of chemical analysis, blood pathology, and sensor engineering
interact with mathematical analytic tools. They adapt and extend computational
software to the particular geometry of chemical spectra, for which the data
manifolds need to be parametrized by the concentrations of various constituent
materials. To achieve such parametrizations, they exploit mathematical tools for
local multiscale descriptions of data together with clustering techniques that
occur naturally in the context of data analysis for expression profiles of gene
arrays. Shining a light on the skin allows one to get spectral data about the
blood beneath the skin and its chemical components. Hence noninvasive blood
analysis is possible, if only one could make sense of the data. The investigator
and his colleagues apply a range of mathematical and statistical ideas to build
tools that can make sense of such data. There are important medical payoffs
because of the role blood chemistry plays in health. Moreover, the underlying
mathematical problem, to find efficient ways to make sense of enormous volumes
of high-dimensional data, arises across science and engineering, so the
potential impact of the project is even wider. The project provides
interdisciplinary research and training opportunities for students and postdocs.
