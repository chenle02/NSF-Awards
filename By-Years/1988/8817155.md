Isotopic compositions are in widespread use to establish paleoceanographic
conditions and geochemical stratigraphy even though there is scant evaluation of
phosphate in modern oceans as a reliable indicator of temperature based on
oxygen isotopes or Sr ocean chemistry based on 87Sr86Sr ratios. This study will
test the usefulness of oxygen isotopic composition and 87Sr/86Sr ratio of shark
teeth to provide a direct measure of temperature and related climate of ancient
biogenic phosphate. Principal Investigators will evaluate isotope equilibria
between shark tooth apatite and ocean water. Modern species of sharks from well-
known habitats will be used to determine the relationship of isotopic
composition and ocean water and determine the effect of habitat on the isotope
composition of apatite in modern sharks. Accompanying determinations of the
distribution of strontium, oxygen, and carbon isotopes in shark teeth and
measurements of the isotopic composition of separated dentine and enameloid will
document ecologic and diagenetic processes that effect the isotopic composition
of shark teeth apatite. This research will evaluate the utility of fossil
shark's teeth as indicators of past environments and oceans.
