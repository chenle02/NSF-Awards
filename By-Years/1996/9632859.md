9632850 Tsai Steel reinforcing bars for concrete suffer from limited resistance
to corrosion, costly field assembly and lack of ductility under severe
earthquake. Composite materials have outstanding corrosion and fatigue
resistance and a weight 1/5 of steel. Graphite fiber/organic matrix
unidirectional composite materials have outstanding longitudinal stiffness over
20,000ksi and tensile strength over 200ksi, and when properly designed can
compete directly with steel rebars. It is therefore the goal of this proposal to
demonstrate and develop: A novel manufacturing method of composite grid
reinforcement. Rapid factory/field assembly of reinforcing system. Grid
reinforced containment skin for columns. Test data on columns subjected to
static, dynamic and cyclic loads.
