9703921 Kirsch WGBH is requesting $100,000 for a two-day conference for 75
outreach professionals from public television, museums and science-technology
centers, and community-youth organizations. The conference will be developed in
collaboration with the American Association for the Advancement of Science. The
conference will provide professional development for outreach staff in key
organizations that conduct local and national outreach project in informal and
formal education. Participants will have the opportunity to: * learn how they
can extend the impact of major outreach projects by establishing local
coalitions that build on the strengths and resources of public television,
science centers, youth-serving organizations, and other agencies focused on
science education. * find out how outreach is carried out by organizations
outside their fields of expertise in order to identify new approaches and
strategies that they can adapt for their own projects, and * develop a plan of
action for implementing an outreach initiative that takes advantage of the
skills they have gained from the workshop and will benefit their communities.
Beth Kirsch, Director of Educational Outreach for WGBH, will be PI. She will
work closely with Judy Kass, Director of Outreach Programs at the AAAS, and Joan
McIntosh, an independent consultant and trainer, to develop and manage the
conference.
