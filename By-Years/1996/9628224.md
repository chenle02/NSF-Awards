9628224 Frisch This grant aims at the preparation of novel interpenetrating
polymer networks (IPN's) including hybrid porous inorganic material containing
ones (whose pores contain polymer chains of unusual properties) as well as full
and pseudo (or semi) IPN's functionalized with non-linear optical (NLO)
chromophores. The latter IPN materials offer great promise for long lived second
harmonic generating films. Other K3C60 containing blends of linear polymers are
superconducting and will be further investigated. In collaboration with a number
of other investigator groups, these new materials will be studied using SAXS
with synchrotron radiation, dielectric and ultrasonic measurements as well as
the more usual electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and
mechanical property measurements. The ultimate use of these materials depends on
whether they have undergone a phase transition, e.g. IPN's are often microphase
separated (particularly if mechanically stressed), or whether they exhibit a
triphasic collapse in the ease of IPN gels. Further polymer ordering transitions
such as the microphase separation transition in diblock copolymers confined
between walls and the nematic and discoidal ordering with hard disc molecules
will be studied using exact models. %%% This project falls into the general area
of synthesis, and properties of polymer blends and networks. Besides
contributing to the preparation of novel materials with special uses such as
toughened membranes, NLO devices, separation membranes, and new catalyst
supports, the proposed work should help elucidate some interesting features of
polymer phase transitions. ***
