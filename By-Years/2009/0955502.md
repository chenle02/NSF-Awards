Baron Peters of the University of California, Santa Barbara is supported by a
CAREER award from the Theory, Models and Computational Methods Program in the
Chemistry Division to develop molecular simulation strategies for understanding
molecular level properties of critical nuclei for nucleation from solution.
Nucleation is the process by which the first microscopic embryo of a new phase
is formed to initiate a phase transition. Understanding the factors that
influence nucleation rates and the features of a nucleus that determine whether
it is stable or unstable is a major challenge for experiments and for
simulations. The PI uses path sampling, atomistic simulations, lattice models
and coarse grained dynamics to understand various aspects of the critical
nucleus structure and interfacial energy contributions at the nanoscale. This
work extends simulations of nucleation beyond spherical particles and implicit
solvents. These efforts combine state-of-the-art methods for rare events with
rigorous methods to control the chemical potential (supersaturation) in the
condensed phase.

Familiar examples of nucleation are the formation of carbon dioxide bubbles in
an opened soda or ice crystals in a bottle of water placed in the freezer.
Actually these visible droplets, bubbles, or crystals of the new phase are
actually later stages in the phase transformation. Microscopic nuclei with just
a few molecules may form and re-dissolve many times before finally giving birth
to a stable nucleus that can eventually grow to a visible size. In some cases,
like the example of bottled water in the freezer, hours or weeks may pass before
the first stable nucleus forms. New simulation methods designed specifically for
nucleation from solution provide mechanistic insights to guide the
crystallization and synthesis of materials with controlled crystal structures,
shapes, and properties. The insights gained from this work facilitate the
preparation of pharmaceuticals, the synthesis of electronic and catalytic
materials, and purification by crystallization.
