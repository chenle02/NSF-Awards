EIA-0113919&lt;br/&gt;Klaus Sutner&lt;br/&gt;Carnegie Mellon
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: ITR/IM(EHR) Course Capsules: Persistent,
Personalized Courseware&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will design and
implement a system that will store, organize, index and make searchable course
content, and preserve that content reliably over long periods of time. The
specific plans include the systemic use of emerging XML standards to design a
course model that supports both content and presentation markup. Course Capsules
will not only archive the university generated course materials, but also the
creative work of the students. Content markup will allow the Capsules to respond
intelligently to requests by a user, and provide each student with a
personalized depot of knowledge that remains available even after graduation.
For the faculty, Capsules will form a trusted repository of course material and
will encourage sharing and reuse. The archive in conjunction with extensive use
tracking will provide a sound basis for ongoing review and improvement of
curricula.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
