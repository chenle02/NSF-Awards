Proposal: 9357094 PI: Colon Professor Colon of the University of Puerto Rico
will investigate long-distance electron transfer reactions; he will do so with
support in the form of an NSF Young Investigator Award from the Inorganic,
Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program. One avenue of attack will be
through photophysical studies of myoglobin bearing redox-active coordination
complexes at various surface sites. The specific objective will be to evaluate
lambda, the reorganizational energy, and to assess the distance dependence of
lambda. Another very different approach will be to examine electron transfer
within the medium of layered synthetic materials. These materials will be based
on zirconium phosphonates, which will be intercalated with redox donors and
acceptors. By this technique it should be possible to systematically control the
D-A distance, as well as to achieve vectorial photoinduced electron transfer.
%%% There is no doubt that the chemical process of transferring an electron from
one molecular site to another can occur over distances long on the molecular
scale. These processes, in fact, are essential in living organisms. Experiments
will be conducted both to probe the underlying factors that drive (or limit)
this phenomenon, and also to develop simple materials where this process can
occur in such a way as to mimic biological photosynthesis. This work should help
to establish the theory of long-range electron transfer as well as to apply it
in a potentially useful way.
