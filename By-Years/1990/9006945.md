The principal investigator will continue his research on several topics in the
dynamics of continua. In particular, he will study continuum and kinetic
theories of material motion undergoing phase transitions, initial value problems
for the Riemann problem for systems of hyperbolic conservation laws, and
distributed-parameter control systems. The tools used will be various techniques
from the qualitative theory of partial differential equations and from nonlinear
analysis. Many natural phenomena involve the transition of a material from one
phase to another. As an example, think of what happens to the ice cubes in your
drink. The principal investigator will apply modern methods of nonlinear
analysis to study the dynamical behavior of materials undergoing phase
transitions and also ways to control the instabilities that often result when
materials are stressed.
