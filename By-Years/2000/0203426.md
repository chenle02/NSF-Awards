ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;0203113/0203426&lt;br/&gt;Burer, Samuel&lt;br/&gt;Iowa
State&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a semidefinite programming (SDP) problem, a linear
function of a symmetric matrix variable X is minimized subject to linear
equality constraints on X and the essential constraint that X be positive
semidefinite. Many mathematical optimization problems can be cast as SDP
problems including linear programs, convex quadratic problems with convex
quadratic inequality constraints, matrix norm minimization problems, and a
variety of maximum and minimum eigenvalue problems. In addition, SDP has many
applications in combinatorial optimization, engineering, statistics, and robust
optimization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today, there are numerous algorithms and
codes available for solving SDPs, and these methods can be loosely grouped into
two classes: second-order interior-point (IP) methods and first-order nonlinear
programming (NLP) methods. The choice of which class to use for a particular
application is determined primarily by&lt;br/&gt;problem size --- second-order
IP methods are more efficient on small- to medium-scale problems while first-
order NLP methods are better for large-scale problems.&lt;br/&gt;
