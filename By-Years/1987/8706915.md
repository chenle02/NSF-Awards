Rapid changes in ambient temperature (thermal shock) induce stress in a
material., For brittle components, these thermal stresses can result in
microcracking or mechanical failure. The objective of this research is to use
elasticity measurements to assess damage due to the multiple (repeated) thermal
shocking of ceramics, using both liquids and gases (including air) as quenching
media. Unlike fracture testing, these nondestructive elasticity measurements
allow one to monitor the evolution of thermal shock damage due to repeated
thermal cycling. The significantly higher precision of the elasticity
measurements compared to fracture measurements will allow accurate determination
of the successive degradation of the ceramic upon thermal cycling, especially at
the initially low levels of thermal shock damage.
