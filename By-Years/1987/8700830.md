The purpose of the research is to investigate the complete failure of structures
composed of materials which fail by progressive distributed damage and cracking
as found in materials such as concrete, wood, and rocks. The proposed theory is
an extension of the nonlocal continuum approach in such a way that the nonlocal
concept is applied only to those variables which cause strain-softening, so that
the response is local when the damage does not grow. The proposed research
includes verification of the proposed theory by numerical analysis as well as
experimental results.
