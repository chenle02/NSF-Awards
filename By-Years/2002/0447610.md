0447610&lt;br/&gt;Weir&lt;br/&gt;The Delaware EPSCoR Research Infrastructure
Improvement Grant (RII) encompasses research, outreach, ethics and public policy
and economic development in the area of Complex Environmental Systems and
Ecosystem Health. The project will: integrate research and education; increase
participation of women and underrepresented groups and underserved rural
populations in STEM disciplines; focus on undergraduate research and career
opportunities; and, catalyze STEM career interest in middle school and faculty
development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is a partnership with the
University of Delaware, Delaware State University, Wesley College, Delaware
Technical and Community College, state government and the private sector. The
work at the research institutions will synergize capability in plant, soil,
marine sciences, bio-nanotechnology and environmental ecology. Delaware
Technical Community College will be engaged in developing a new biotechnology
degree program to serve the southern section of the state. All institutions will
be involved in outreach and mentoring activities to K-12, undergraduate, and
graduate students and faculty.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The institutions and
research focus areas will be aided by core instrumentation centers in the state
and include support for a statewide Ethics and Public Policy component. The
Ethics and Public Policy component will serve as a forum to spread knowledge and
create understanding of the key ethical and policy issues that are developing
around the rapid advances in the physical and biological sciences.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The EPSCoR RII is a critical part of Delaware's strategy
to develop the life sciences as a major economic sector in the
state.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
