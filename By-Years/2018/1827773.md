The broader impact/commercial potential of this PFI project is to improve
treatment of hydrocephalus. Since the 1950s, the gold standard of care has been
to implant a tube, called a shunt, that drains excess fluid surrounding the
brain elsewhere in the body where it can be safely absorbed. While this
treatment is effective, the shunts fail at high rates and most commonly because
of clogging. Because there are no clear patient symptoms and medical imaging
technologies do not have sufficient resolution, patients live in fear that their
headache may be an early sign of failure and must live close to a major medical
center. A major reason why shunt technology has not advanced in many decades is
that there are no sensors that can determine when and why shunts fail. In the
near term, this innovation in miniaturized sensing technology will enable
definitive diagnosis of shunt failure and in the long term, provide valuable
data that can inform the design of failure-resistant shunts. The potential
societal impacts are reduced emergency room visits and improved quality of life
for patients and family members. The potential commercial impacts are new
products for hydrocephalus and other medical conditions.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will enable a major
improvement in hydrocephalus care since the introduction of shunts in the 1950s.
Hydrocephalus patients suffer from an imbalance in the production of fluid
surrounding the brain and spinal cord and its absorption by the body. A shunt
implanted in the brain diverts fluid elsewhere in the body where it can be
safely absorbed. The portion of the shunt implanted in the brain clogs at high
rates leading to vague patient symptoms at first but that become progressively
worse. A major obstacle is the inability to determine that a shunt is about to
fail without surgery. This can be solved by integrating wireless sensors into
the shunt that warn of failure. New advancements have enabled extremely small
sensors that can monitor treatment directly in the shunt. The goal of this
project is to integrate different sensor types that provide complementary
information in a smart shunt, develop a simulated benchtop model of a
hydrocephalic patient, and demonstrate that the smart shunt can provide accurate
information on the proper function or failure of the shunt. The realistic
benchtop model of the patient is critical to optimize sensors prior to future
pre-clinical testing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
