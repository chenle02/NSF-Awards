EAGER: Proof of concept: U-Th Dating of Lake-level History at Mono Basin,
CA&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI(s): Sidney Hemming, Scott Stine, and Xianfeng
Wang&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION: Columbia
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs are attempting a unique and novel way to
characterize lake-level fluctuation and paleoclimate records from Mono Lake
using newly refined C-14, U/Th and 40Ar/39Ar methods. These methods bring
together an interdisciplinary team that will address this high risk problem. By
documenting and characterizing this hydrographically closed basin, a greater
understanding of regional climate variations can be made and this new approach
can be used in characterizing other similar basins in space and time. In
addition, Mono Lake is a sensitive environment and plays a critical role in the
hydrology of the Imperial and Central Valley of California, which is an
economically important area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is appropriate
for an EAGER because it 1) uses a new and refined technique to date these
sediments, 2) is high risk because it is uncertain that this might be
achievable, 3) brings together an interdisciplinary team to address this problem
and 4) if successful, can be used for other systems like this one and be broadly
applied to our understanding of the climate history in this region.
