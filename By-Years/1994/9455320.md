Networked Financial Simulation Using LambdaMOO Technology Given recent advances
in network and MUD (Multi-User Domain) technology, it is now possible to build a
networked simulation of the international financial system containing within it
several simulated national financial systems. We propose to build that
simulation, and to call it Money MOO. Few current financial or economic
simulations illustrate interactions inside the financial system as a whole.
Fewer still combine national and international financial systems to illustrate
their interconnectedness. Although the economic system itself is dependent on
interactions among individuals and institutions, currently available simulations
do not typically base their outcomes on that reality. Instead, most existing
financial simulation software is designed to be used by an individual student
working in isolation, not cooperating or interacting with other students. Our
proposed simulation, Money MOO, will have the following characteristics: a. The
simulation will be interactive and its outcomes will depend on the combined
decisions of the student-players. b. The simulation will be made freely
available to all educational institutions through the Internet. c. The
simulation will be fun to play. It will be a version of the most popular
networked interactive game format which exists, the Internet MUD. This networked
simulation tool will permit courses such as Introductory Macroeconomics, Money
and Banking, and Financial Institutions and Markets to be taught much more
effectively than they can be if the only available tools are textbooks and
single-user simulations.
