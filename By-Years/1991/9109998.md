Dr. Cordero is undertaking a new interpretation of the theory and conceptual
problems of quantum mechanics (QM). His study emphasizes the role played by
credible low-level theories as guides and constraints in the revision of
standard QM. The project concentrates on the following elements: 1) The claim
that standard QM is incomplete and needs to be revised rather than
reinterpreted. 2) Problems with approaches that do not modify the time-dependent
part of QM. theory as a major step forward, its critique and prospects. 4)
Concepts of explanation deployed in the advancement of QM. 5) Partial theories
of spontaneous state reduction induced from the practices of scientists working
on specific problems. 6) The use of such theories as a source for non-ad-hoc
revisions of QM. 7) Incorporation of partial theories in a generalization of the
GRW theory. 8) The paradoxes generated by collapse variants and their prospects
of resolution. 9) Measurement theory within stochastic revisions of QM. 10) The
concepts of 'system,' 'dynamical property,' 'possibility,' 'actuality,' and
'causal efficacy' in a coherent stochastic single-case QM.
