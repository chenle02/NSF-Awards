EEC-9711733 Jose Roesset This award provides funding to the Engineering Research
Center at Texas A&amp;M University/University of Texas at Austin entitled
"Offshore Technology Research Center" to develop a multimedia electronic
textbook on Ocean Wave Theory and Applications. This courseware can be used as a
complement to undergraduate, graduate, and continuing education courses in
ocean, coastal, civil, environmental, and marine engineering or as a stand alone
book. This educational material will be developed in both CD-ROM and World Wide
Web format. The goal of this textbook is to provide students with an
understanding of the basics of ocean wave theory and current experimental and
computational techniques for assessing and predicting the effect of the ocean on
its surroundings. This textbook will include topics on wave kinematics, wave
dispersion and refraction, linear and nonlinear free surface dynamics, wave
forces on bodies of arbitrary shape, diffraction and radiation by fixed or
moving bodies, ocean wave statistics and their simulation as stochastic
processes, and experimental demonstrations from the Center's wave basin
research. Students will be able to solve an unlimited number of ocean wave
problems with different parameters to observe the relative importance of
different physical variables, validity of various approximations, and the
behavior of solutions.
