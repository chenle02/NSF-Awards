The goal of this research is to determine how much molecular variability exists
at a gene coding for the structure of an esterase enzyme, EST 6, in Drosophila
melanogaster and to understand the meaning of this molecular variation.
Esterases are particularly interesting genes to study because they are
representative of a class of highly variable loci found in many organisms
including humans. The general objective of the work is to assess the hypothesis
which argues that changes in the expression of genes are more significant in
evolution than changes in the regions of genes which code for the structure of
proteins. Dr. Richmond will identify elements responsible for the regulation of
the Est- 6 gene and a similar gene, Est-P. He hopes to associate variation which
controls expression with variation which controls the structure of two related
esterases. Studies of molecular variation in Est-6 genes from different
geographic populations of Drosophila melanogaster will help to identify the
molecular basis for geographic variation. Finally, Dr. Richmond hopes to obtain
molecular clones for the Est-6 genes from two other Drosophila species related
to Drosophila melanogaster to determine what changes have occurred in these
genes during the process of speciation. Recombinant DNA technologies will be
used to clone and manipulate esterase gene sequences. Factors regulating the
expression of esterases will be investigated by using transposable-element
mediated transformation of Drosophila embryos with cloned esterase genes.
Procedures for the amplification of specific genes from total genomic DNA will
be used to obtain DNA for direct nucleotide sequencing. Reliable data on the
nature and extent of genetic variation will permit inferences on how the forces
of evolution act to mold variation at the molecular level into adapted
phenotypes. This work will also contribute to an understanding of the mechanisms
of gene regulation and how the evolution of regulation occurs.
