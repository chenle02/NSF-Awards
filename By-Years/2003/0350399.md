The proposal focuses on problems in Combinatorial Algebra related to
The&lt;br/&gt;Burnside Problem and to Lie algebras of finite growth. The three
main&lt;br/&gt;problems are (i) the version of the restricted Burnside problem
with&lt;br/&gt;periodic primitive elements, (ii) tau-property of Golod -
Shafarevich&lt;br/&gt;groups and (iii) classification of conformal algebras of
Gelfand-Kirillov&lt;br/&gt;dimension one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; These problems
are motivated by deep applications in Geometry, Topology&lt;br/&gt;and
Mathematical Physics.&lt;br/&gt;
