This project focuses on developing effective and efficient methods for detection
of vulnerable devices in an IoT network, as well as mitigation techniques, as a
reaction to identified vulnerabilities. The vision for the scientific impact of
this project is a comprehensive set of tools for securing networked IoT devices
throughout their lifecycle, coupled with the requirement to co-exist with
inherently vulnerable or legacy devices. The project aims to achieve this vision
by focusing on three phases of an IoT device's lifecycle:

1. Birth: identify vulnerable devices when they are first introduced into an IoT
network. 2. Life: verify the configuration and operation of devices during their
normal operation and updating firmware even in resource-constrained devices. 3.
Repurposing: infer changes in device ownership (including disposal) and perform
secure deletion of sensitive data whenever ownership change is confirmed.

All of the above will be achieved with a strong emphasis on assuring that new
security techniques are meaningful and usable by a wide range of users.

Research outcomes of this project are expected to benefit society in addressing
important IoT security problems before manufacturers saturate the market with
ostensibly useful and innovative gadgets that lack sufficient security features,
thus being vulnerable to attacks and malware infestations, which can turn them
into rogue agents. PhD students involved in the project will benefit from unique
opportunities for developing valuable research skills in the important emerging
area of IoT security, as well as collaborating with international partners, thus
exposing them to new research perspectives. One aspect of anticipated impact is
in training the next generation of information security experts who, beyond
understanding and appreciating security and privacy concerns in IoT, are also
sufficiently skilled to address them. Another aspect of this project's impact
will be achieved by transferring our results into prototypes, which can be
turned into products and services.
