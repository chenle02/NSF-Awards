9423424 VESSEY A central question in ecology is: what factors affect population
size? Most previous models incorporated only density-dependent factors because
density-independent factors are difficult to analyze statistically and
manipulate experimentally. However, because real environments vary, population
models should include stochastic environmental factors to describe population
dynamics accurately. The objectives of this study are to explain and predict
population fluctuations based on stochastic environmental conditions, using
statistical techniques previously unused in an ecological context. The effect of
weather on Peromyscus densities in one- and two-species communities will be
modeled using data sets of twenty and fifteen years, respectively. Population
densities will be forecasted, and simulations will determine the effect of
different weather regimes on densities. Inclusion of stochastic weather in
population models will lead to better explanation and forecasting of population
fluctuations.
