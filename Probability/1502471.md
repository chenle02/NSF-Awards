This proposal is to support a conference on Probability Theory and Combinatorial
Optimization that will take place at Duke University on March 14-15, 2015. The
conference covers topics such as random structures and algorithms, random graphs
and networks, probabilistic combinatorial optimization, and concentration
inequalities.

The conference brings together a diverse set of speakers and participants in
probability theory and combinatorial optimization, and it is devoted to discuss
how to make progress on some of the most important questions in the field. The
conference tentatively features eleven talks delivered by exceptional scholars
alongside with a number of short presentations delivered by graduate students,
postdocs, and other young researchers. The conference seeks to facilitate the
interaction between the new generations of mathematicians and the key figures of
the field. The conference organizers are committed to trying to help advance the
careers of graduate students, postdocs, women, minorities and other young
researchers in the field. Priority for financial support will be given to
several members of such groups.
