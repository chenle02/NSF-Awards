Chavez 9308057 This applicant will study the regulation of polypeptide hormone
release from storage sites within the cells where they are synthesized. Although
much is known about the extracellular factors involved in signalling for release
of the hormones, little has been done to elaborate the sequence of events inside
the cell. Specifically, the applicant will focus on the role of two rab proteins
that have been implicated in regulating release of adrenocorticotrophic hormone
from dense granules in the secretory cell. This work will be conducted in the
laboratory of Dr. Hsiao-Ping H. Moore at the University of California at
Berkeley. ***
