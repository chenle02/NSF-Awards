This study will answer some of the following questions: 1) In the materials
where confining potentials result in a quasi-two dimensional electronic system,
how do the carriers behave? 2) What parameters are a function of the
dimensionality, what are specific to the materials? 3) How do carriers behave in
the presense of incoherent scattering potentials? 4) What modifications are
present due to coherent potentials? Different materials structures will also be
studied.
