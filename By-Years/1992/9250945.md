Five workstations (Mac II-si, MacLab and electrophysiology instrumentation) are
used by students in three interrelated courses: for Introductory Biology (2
semesters, 175 students/semester), Comparative Physiology (offered alternate
years, 15 students) and Neurobiology and Behavior (offered alternate years, 15
students) in student research. Student computer use is phased in, beginning with
analysis of simulated data in lower division classes and leading to pooling and
analysis of class data in more advanced classes. The focus is on understanding
muscle activity, nerve physiology and graphical data analysis.
