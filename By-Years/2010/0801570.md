Validation and Verification (V&amp;V) are essential parts for reliable solution
of large complex problems in many fields of engineering and science. They
address the reliability of the selected mathematical models and their numerical
treatment for prediction of physical and medical phenomena of interest in the
view of the available experimental data and uncertainties. Such predictions are
the basis for important engineering, scientific, public health, etc. decisions.
Although few workshops on this general topic have taken place in last few years
the proposed workshop will concentrate on specific problems in engineering (tail
hook of the Navy airplane) and medicine (spread &amp; control of spatial
diseases such as influenza). It will show the entire process of the modeling,
validation, verification and prediction and its theoretical basis. The workshop
will bring together engineers, experimentalists, mathematicians, statisticians
and public health surveillance experts to discuss together the fundamental
problem of V&amp;V in the relation to the specific problems and in general,
especially for the large scale computational science problem. Good procedures
for V&amp;V are crucial for extreme scale computational
simulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
