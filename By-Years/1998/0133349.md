Heterosis, or hybrid vigor, is a condition where more heterozygous individuals
physiologically outperform more homozygous individuals. Although heterosis has
often been reported for marine bivalves, as well as other taxa, the
physiological and genetic bases of heterosis are still poorly understood. The
proposed research will use a combination of quantitative and molecular genetic
approaches to examine the physiological and genetic underpinnings of heterosis
in the dwarf surf clam, Mulinia lateralis. The specific goals of this work are
1) to determine the genetic and physiological basis of growth rate variation, 2)
to estimate the degree to which the physiological components of growth are
genetically correlated, 3) to determine whether levels of heterozygosity are
significantly associated with physiological performance under both stressful and
non-stressful conditions, and 4) to determine the importance of inbreeding to
any association between heterozygosity and physiological performance in M.
lateralis. Three separate educational activities will be integrated with these
research goals. First, M. lateralis will be used as a teaching model for a
laboratory section to accompany the graduate level course in quantitative
genetics currently taught at the University of Maine. Second, an internship will
be established that will enable high school teachers and students to directly
participate in the proposed research and gain hands-on training in molecular
biology, bivalve husbandry, and quantitative genetics. Third, a summer content
institute in genetics for secondary science teachers will be developed. This
institute is intended to help teachers keep pace with the rapid advances in
genetic research and effectively communicate these advances to their students.
Along with the summer genetics institute, a series of pilot projects will be
established in local schools exploring the most effective way to use M.
lateralis as a model for demonstrating bivalve physiology, ecology, and genetics
in a manner consistent with state and national standards.
