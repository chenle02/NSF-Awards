9618787 Jacobs Spectrum-slicing provides an attractive low-cost alternative to
the use of multiple coherent lasers for wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM)
applications by utilizing spectral slices of a single broadband noise source for
the different data channels. This two-year research program is for the analysis,
design, and performance evaluation of optical fiber spectrum-sliced WDM systems.
