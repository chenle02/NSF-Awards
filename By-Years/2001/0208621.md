With the enormous stream of electronic data being continually
generated,&lt;br/&gt;it is imperative to use unsupervised methods to organize
and explore&lt;br/&gt;the data. The enormous quantity of data precludes the use
of supervised&lt;br/&gt;methods. The goal of this project is to develop
unsupervised methods&lt;br/&gt;capable of organizing and annotating large
datasets of unknown structure,&lt;br/&gt;facilitating further exploration and
analysis of the data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the recent advent of general
purpose, scalable, unsupervised&lt;br/&gt;clustering methods such as Principal
Direction Divisive Partitioning&lt;br/&gt;(PDDP), whole new vistas open up in
the uses and applications of&lt;br/&gt;unsupervised methods. This particular
method yields additional&lt;br/&gt;by-products for free: a hierarchical
structure, and identification of&lt;br/&gt;the most distinctive attributes.
These by-products are just the items&lt;br/&gt;needed to impose a structure on a
dataset and annotate the computed&lt;br/&gt;structure at various levels of
detail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This naturally leads to this project: to develop
scalable general&lt;br/&gt;purpose clustering methods, to extract the
information needed to&lt;br/&gt;annotate the datasets so users can effectively
navigate through the&lt;br/&gt;data, and to perform the associated statistical
and theoretical analyses.&lt;br/&gt;The methods will be validated on a wide
variety of domains, including the&lt;br/&gt;WWW, specialized legal and/or
medical databases, astronomical catalogs,&lt;br/&gt;and
genomics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
