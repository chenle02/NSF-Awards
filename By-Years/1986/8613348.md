Research and development related to composite steel-and-concrete economy and
efficiency of structures, to implement new construction techniques, to
incorporate new and improved materials, and to devise methods to rehabilitate
and strengthen existing structures all contribute to advancing the state-of-the-
art in this field. Researchers and practitioners in the field of composite
construction need to meet periodically to exchange information related to these
topics. Such exchanges would avoid duplication of research efforts, provide
transfer of technology and spur new developments. An international conference on
composite construction is proposed to satisfy these objectives. The conference
will cover all phases of design, construction and research related to steel-and-
concrete composite members. Both new construction and rehabilitation and
strengthening of existing structures will be discussed. Researchers and
practitioners from around the world will be invited to participate, with total
attendance limited to approximately 100. The primary objectives of the
conference are as follows: 1. To exchange information in the field of composite
construction; 2. To provide technology transfer between researchers and
practitioners; 3. To promote the use of research in the development of design
procedures; and 4. To identify research needs related to composite construction.
The conference will be held June 7-l2, 1987, in Henniker, NH at a site normally
used for Engineering Foundation Conferences. The partial support budget
requested is appropriate. The Principal Investigators are capable and the
institutional resources are appropriate. An award is recommended.
