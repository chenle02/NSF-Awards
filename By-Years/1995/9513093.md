9513093 Ishii This award supports the participation of 12 U.S. scientists in a
U.S.-Japan seminar on Two-Phase flow Dynamics, to be held in Fukuoka, Japan,
from July 7-13, 1996. The co- organizers are Professor Mamoru Ishii of Purdue
University and Professor Tohru Fukano of Kyushu University. The main objective
of this seminar is to bring together highly qualified researchers with common
interests for intensive and detailed exchanges of information about their
current and future research in the field of two-phase flow. Collectively, the
research pursued by the seminar participants has the potential to: improve
instrumentation methods, develop reliable constitutive relations, and obtain a
better understanding of detailed two-phase flow phenomena. The major objectives
of the seminar are to: 1) develop general directions for research; 2) focus
future research with regard to the recent significant developments in
instrumentation technology; and 3) discuss best approaches for the fully three-
dimensional two-phase flow model. The seminar should contribute greatly to the
sustained rapid progress in two-phase flow dynamics during the coming decade.
