This project upgrades the Materials Testing Laboratory at Waterbury State
Technical College to allow students to explore the strengths and weaknesses of
the various electronic instruments which they will encounter in engineering
practice. The major items of equipment include a 60000 lb. Tensile Test machine,
transducers, signal processing and computer interface hardware. The institution
is providing matching funds in an amount equal to or greater than the funds
provided by the Foundation.
