The 4th Northeast Probability Seminar will be held on November 16-17, 2006 in
New York City at Columbia University. This conference intends to draw
researchers and graduate students in the Northeast and provide a forum for young
investigators to interact sceintifically with specialists. The sicentific
emphasis will be on Brownian motion, local times, Markov chains and processes,
