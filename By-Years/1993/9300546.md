The University of Texas at Arlington's Department of Electrical Engineering is
conducting a Research Experiences for Undergraduates program. The program will
be the participation of undergraduate scholars in research projects and the
significant interaction between faculty and students. There will be an academic
year component, open to all qualified scholars, and a summer component, designed
to emphasize the participation of underrepresented minorities. The scholars will
be expected to exhibit qualities such as creativity, productivity, effective
communication, and independence upon completion of their training in the
program. Students will participate in the complete research process. They will
select a research topic with their faculty mentor, write a research proposal,
perform a literature search, attend and participate in an Ethics Forum, conduct
the research, analyze data, write progress and final reports, present the work
orally, and evaluate the experience.
