Nothing is more central to macroeconomics than the attempt to understand
business cycles. A large fraction of all macroeconomic research in recent years
has been devoted to exploring the implications of models in which all households
and firms form expectations about the future rationally and act in the pursuit
of well-defined objectives, and comparing these implications to observed facts
about business cycles. The contribution of this project comes from developing
and studying analytically business cycle models that are more consistent
qualitatively and quantitatively with observed facts about business cycles. More
specifically, the project extends and solves analytically a central set of
business cycle models based on Professor Edward Prescott's Real Business Cycle
Model. The following elements are added to this model: distortionary taxation,
more than one production sector, changes in the composition of government
spending, more than one type of labor, time-nonseparabilities in the utility,
and sluggish price adjustment. These elements capture important aspects of
economic reality missing in other models of business cycles.
