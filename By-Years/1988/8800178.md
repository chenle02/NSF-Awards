Dr. Bruce Kirchoff of the University of North Carolina at Greensboro is
studying the development of inflorescences and flowers in selected species of
the plant group Zingiberales, which includes bananas, gingers, and other
tropical taxa. The analytical component of the project, using light and electron
microscopy, encompasses detailed determination of the timing and sequence of
initiation and maturation of cellular primordia giving rise to floral parts
(sepals, petals, stamens, carpels), their relative degrees of fusion, and their
arrangements in compound branching structures (inflorescences) which are complex
in this group of plants. The goal is to map these developmental events against
what is known about the evolutionary history of Zingiberales in order to
determine trends of floral evolution, assessing those patterns that have evolved
repeatedly as opposed to those that are unique. Such insight will provide an
understanding of the mechanisms of morphological change in shape and size in
plants.
