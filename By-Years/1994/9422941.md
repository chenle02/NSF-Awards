9422941 Rajan The aim of this research is to elucidate the relationship between
grain boundary crystallography and grain boundary wetting in mineral systems.
The specific experimental focus is determination of the crystallography
characteristics and orientation relationships of grains that have their mutual
boundary wetted and comparison to these boundaries that are not wetted. The
methodology to be utilized involves examination of grain orientation and grain
boundary misorientation data (obtained by SEM and TEM) coupled with Rodrigues-
Frank representations of the data. This approach will develop characterization
techniques that capture localized information in a statistically meaningful
manner. Wetting properties are of interest to Earth scientists because they
affect grain boundary transport, a fundamental process by which bulk transport
of chemical species through rocks containing static fluids occurs. In addition,
melt films along grain boundaries affect seismic velocities and attenuation
within the solid Earth and rheological properties of materials in seismic zones.
