*** 9760934 Harvey This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
proposes a novel radiochemical sensor that combines extraction chromatography
with an aqueous flow-cell radiation sensor. The sensor will allow for
quantification of a radioactive isotope or group of radioactive isotopes in
surface water, groundwater and drinking water at much lower levels for alpha-
and/or beta-emitting radionuclides. This increased sensitivity over conventional
on-line sensors will greatly enhance the tools used by scientists and engineers
for environmental monitoring Monitoring of radioactivity is important in
environmental science applications. Traditional radiochemical techniques are
time consuming and expensive. The sensor offers the possibility of near real-
time quantification of radioactive contamination at a lower cost and higher
sensitivity than currently available techniques. Monitoring of radioactive
effluent from hospitals, research institutes and/or production facilities is
just one potential application. ***
