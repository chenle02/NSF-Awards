This research focuses on reducing time and cost taken to convert a flexible
manufacturing system (FMS) design into an operational system. Software for FMS
control has been often identified as the main contributing factor to lack of
flexibility, and high cost of implementation. Specific topics to be addressed
during the first year include; understanding the implications of the control
architecture on the elements of control (planning, scheduling and control),
development of a systems theoretic model of FMS control, and identifying generic
and specific elements in the system models. The objectives of the research are
to develop a generic, product independent methodology and tools for the design
and development of FMS control software. The methodology should provide for the
rapid prototyping, evaluation, and subsequent implementation in a computer-
integrated manufacturing system.
