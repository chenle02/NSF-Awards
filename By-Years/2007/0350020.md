The American Society for Microbiology will convene a group of approximately 60
expert scientists for a colloquium November 6-9, 2003, in Key Largo, Florida, to
look at pathogen genome sequencing-related issues in the context of the total
set of fully sequenced genomes to date. The scope of the colloquium will include
viruses, bacteria, and fungi responsible for pathogenesis in plants, animals,
and humans. The colloquium will begin with an initial overview session including
one or two case studies highlighting the value of genome sequence information,
leading into a discussion of lessons and a formal set of ideas about where the
field should go. Smaller working groups of participants will then meet to
discuss questions that the steering committee has developed ahead of time. Some
of the issues to be discussed include the current status of genome sequencing
efforts on pathogens and closely related species, identifying specific criteria
that define a pathogen, and new technologies to enhance the collection of
sequence data. On the final day of the colloquium, all the working groups will
reconvene in a general session to share their group reports, to discuss any
issues raised, and to develop their recommendations for future scientific
efforts. A professional science writer, working closely with the steering
committee, will develop a draft report for review by the colloquium
participants. It will provide a background briefing based on the colloquium
presentations and a set of recommendations for further scientific endeavors in
the field. The report will be developed in print and electronic formats.
