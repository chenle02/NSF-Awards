Dmitrii Makarov of the University of Texas at Austin is supported by an award
from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in the
Chemistry Division to study the interplay between chemical and mechanical forces
in biological and artificial molecules. Makarov and coworkers develop
theoretical and computational tools for predicting whether (and how) pulling or
squeezing molecules accelerates or suppresses chemical processes. Biological
molecular machines use the energy of chemical reactions to perform a myriad of
mechanical tasks, through which they, for example, transport cargo across cells,
make human hearts beat, defend cells against diseases, and make new molecules.
Conversely, chemists have recently learned how to induce unusual chemical
transformations by pulling or pushing on molecules, opening up the possibility
of designing smart materials that change their properties when subjected to
mechanical forces. Toward understanding and utilizing these phenomena, Makarov
and his research group also develop techniques allowing experimenters to monitor
molecular motion by measuring the tiny mechanical forces they create. Graduate
and undergraduate students are involved in this research project.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research supported by this grant includes two major
components. First, methods are being developed for the efficient computation of
the rates of mechanochemical transformations. The specific challenges are to
predict how reaction mechanisms change in response to mechanical perturbations
and to search for novel mechanosensitive molecules ("mechanophores") that allow,
for example, breaking strong chemical bonds with weak forces, mechanically-
induced strengthening of bonds, and mechanically-activated release of small
molecules. Second, the Makarov group is developing theoretical tools for the
analysis of single-molecule force spectroscopy measurements, with a focus on
theoretical characterization of experimentally-observed transition-path
ensembles in biomolecular folding.
