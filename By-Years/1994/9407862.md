9407862 Hoeschele The overall objective of this award is to implement exact
Marginal Likelihood based estimation of covariance components for continuous and
discontinuous variables arising frequently in genetic and other studies, and to
test and implement Bayesian methodology for the statistical identification and
mapping of quantitative trait loci using molecular marker maps, with particular
consideration given to the development of efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo
algorithms. The tests developed will be applied to human and animal genetic data
sets. This award is being supported by the Statistics and Probability Program
and the Computational Biology Activity.
