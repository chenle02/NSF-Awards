The Graduate Student Combinatorics Conference (GSCC) is a weekend-long
conference organized and attended by graduate students in combinatorics and
related fields. The fourth annual GSCC will be held at the University of
California, Davis, on April 12-13, 2008.

Students all across North America will participate in an intensive weekend of
student talks and meetings about current mathematical research in discrete
mathematics. Student talks will be complemented by two keynote addresses given
by Arun Ram of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ron Graham of the
University of California, San Diego. The GSCC reaches a broad range of students
in part due to the special nature of the field of combinatorics, which spans
both pure and applied mathematics. Pure research topics include algebra,
computational biology and string algorithms, enumerative combinatorics, poset
and graph theory, probabilistic combinatorics, and topological and geometric
combinatorics.

Combinatorics-related research leads to advances in all parts of science,
including computer science, biological systems, and theoretical physics. For
example, recent advances in combinatorics have resulted in both approximation
algorithms and randomized algorithms for computational problems which had no
previously known practical solutions.

There are two main ways the GSCC facilitates advances in combinatorics and its
applications. One way is by giving graduate students the opportunity to present
their research to peers from other universities, the first such opportunity for
many students. This develops students' ability to give interesting and cutting-
edge research talks. The other way is by fostering professional relationships
which carry on into post-graduate careers, bolstering communication and peer
mentorship at all levels. The GSCC is an invaluable tool for students who study
combinatorics at all levels in their graduate careers. It vertically integrates
students finishing their dissertations in combinatorics with students who are
new to the field. It also alerts students to the current work being done by
researchers, all in an accessible environment.
