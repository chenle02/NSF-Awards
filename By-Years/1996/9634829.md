9634927 Leckie This project is to study the fundamental aspects of joints in
metal (MMC) and ceramic (CMC) matrix composite structures. The research
philosophy emphasizes the understanding of the underlying mechanics and its
relationship to microstructure and processing. The research approach is based on
the design, manufacturing, characterization and analysis of relatively simple
joint geometries which allow the study of individual features of the physical
problem and its underlying mechanisms, e.g. the strength of the interfaces
defined by the fiber ends and the associated debond process. The MMC research
will focus on aluminum alloys reinforced with polycrystalline alumina fibers
while the CMC joints will be fabricated by vacuum infiltration of multi-alumina
slurries into polycrystalline alumina fiber cloth arranged in layers with
prescribed discontinuities. The microstructure and delamination resistance of
these joints can be modified by suitable control of the sintering temperature
and other manufacturing parameters. The emphasis will be identifying the
relevant mechanisms and their relationship to processing via microstructure and
defects. ***
