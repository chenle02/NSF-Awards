The addition of a two-color laser anemometer will provide an instantaneous
vectorial measurement of velocity in experiments where single velocity
components are inadequate to describe the phenomenon of interest. Such are
acoustically-driven pulsed combustion, "momentumless" wakes of symmetrical
objects and the intensification of fly ash agglomeration by acoustic fields. The
relevance of this research to industrial design goals is substantial. Better
control of combustion, especially in unsteady flows, will yield better
efficiency in propulsion or heating devices, with an enhanced capability to
condense dangerous or troublesome by-products (fly ash). Funding of $57,150 is
recommended, to be cost-shared by an additional $57,150 from Pennsylvania State
University.
