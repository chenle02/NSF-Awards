9320153 Katz Under and SGER award an attempt will be made to solve the problem
of nozzle wear in abrasive slurry jet cutting operations by lubricating the
interior nozzle surface from a pressurized reservoir located on the outside of
the porous nozzle material. A two dimensional apparatus will be constructed to
allow detailed observation of individual particle movements as an aid in
determining optimal process and design parameters. ***
