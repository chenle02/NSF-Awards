This project provides advanced Computer Science undergraduates with laboratory
experiences needed to broaden their knowledge of the principles of software
engineering and "programming-in-the-large" which they previously acquired only
through class lectures and assigned reading. This permits students to relate a
sound theoretical understanding of software engineering techniques to laboratory
assignments. Funds have been provided to enhance and expand the current
university-wide network of DEC machines so that students enrolled in Software
Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, and other upper level courses have access
to the automated resources necessary for the practical investigation of topics
such as prototyping, the development and use of automated front-end life cycle
tools, object oriented design, and module reusability. Further, students gain
hands-on familiarity with the software development techniques and tools that
they will use after they graduate. The equipment permits students, through
previously acquired software, to undertake and complete reasonably realistic
projects more easily and efficiently, thus allowing them to concentrate on broad
general aspects of software development. The award is being matched by an equal
amount from the principal investigator's institution.
