9634889 Kao Wire sawing is a technology that has been used for may years to cut
stone and wood, but today is used to slice the silicon wafers used in
photovoltaic cells and semiconductors. These saws use multiple wires and an
abrasive slurry to produce thin (on the order of 300-400 micron), relatively
large diameter (200-300 millimeter) wafers from silicon ingots with excellent
surface finish. This Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry
cooperative research project between the State University of New York at Stony
Brook and GT Equipment Technologies, Inc. will develop models for the wire
sawing process to design and build the next generation of wire saw capable of
producing wafers less than 300 microns thick with kerf losses of between 150-200
microns. The technical approach will be to develop a mechanics and dynamic model
of the sawing process that can be used to design a stiffness and tension control
strategy for improving slicing accuracy. Experiments and unique speckle laser
measurement techniques will be used to validate the model and control prior to
the industrial partner's design of a prototype. This project will provide a
fundamental model for this important process in electronics manufacture, leading
to improved quality and productivity when fabricating wafers from silicon
ingots. An integrated design and control approach for this equipment promises to
reduce waste through both kerf losses and defective products, giving a
technological lead to equipment manufactures competing in global markets.
