String theory is a very rich subject, with a history full of surprises. Born as
a model of the strong nuclear force, it was recognized in the mid-1970s as a
theory of quantum gravity, and in the mid-1980s as a candidate unified theory of
all particle interactions. In the last decade, it has partly gone back to its
original roots, giving insights into the the strong interactions. This project
has a dual research goal: (i) to investigate conceptual and fundamental aspects
of string theory, and its relations to mathematics; and (ii) to use string
theory as a language and a tool, especially to obtain insights into the dynamics
of ordinary quantum field theories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is also
envisioned to have significant broader impacts. The PI intends to develop and
teach graduate classes, deliver special lectures, and organize weekly graduate
seminars. The research to be performed as part of this project is also
envisioned to be instrumental in the training of thesis students and Stony Brook
postdocs, who will be directly involved as collaborators.
