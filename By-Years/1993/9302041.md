This is the first year of a three-year continuing award. The research addresses
recovering the 3D shape of an object from its 2D image contour. Existing 3D
shape recovery algorithms tend to rely on parametric models to uniquely
constrain the underlying 3D surface. Often, real-world scenes are too general to
describe using parametric models. This researcher has discovered that certain
non-parametric shape models allow a much greater flexibilty while at the same
time providing constraints that can be used in the shape recovery process. Using
planar symmetry as a model, the PI has constructed a symmetry analyzer, SYMAN,
that finds axes of symmetry from contour. In addition, he has developed
algorithms that use symmetry and orthogonality as object-based heuristics to
constrain or recover 3D shape from image contour. With this award, the research
is extended to mathematical study of the surface and projective properties of
curved symmetric surfaces as well as their application to the shape recovery
problem, and use of "crystallographic" methods to describe and recover shape by
viewing classes of shapes with similar structure as being equivalent, so that
all "octally symmetric" objects (e.g., spheres, cubes, superquadrics) might be
considered equivalent.
