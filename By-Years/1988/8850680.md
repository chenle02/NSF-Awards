This model project is designed to raise the aspirations and preparation levels
of young women in the middle and junior high school grades, which represents a
strategic point in the academic development of women, to increase their
awareness of the wide range of science and technology related career
opportunities open to them provided they prepare themselves academically. These
objectives are being realized by putting these students in direct and continuing
contact with role models, both college students and professionals. The schedule
of project activities includes three one-day programs at Georgia Tech, two for
public schools and one for private schools. Approximately 300 students and 30
sponsors (teachers, counselors, parents) attend each session. Twenty to thirty
women in various science and technology related careers, together with twenty
college science students, interact with each group of students. Graduate
students or faculty will provide laboratory demonstrations involving science or
engineering projects. A follow-upn newsletter that will urge a response will be
sent to each student in order that the impact of the program will be enhanced.
The evaluation component of the project includes in depth surveys of students
and counselors to determine changes in the types of curricula pursued, and
changes in career plans as a result of participation. Future plans include the
development of programs of longer duration in which young women would be in
residence on the campus for several days. The network of presenters will be
expanded to include faculty at neighboring institutions, such as the
Communicable Disease Center.
