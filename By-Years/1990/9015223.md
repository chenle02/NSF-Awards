The investigator proposes to study the industrial applicability of his ongoing
research in the area of statistical quality control. He plans to put a case for
the usage of combined Shewhart cumulative score charts as a viable process
control tool. He argues that his procedures are easy to understand and that
properties of these procedures are easier evaluated than the cusum type schemes.
He has shown that the combined Shewhart cumulative quality control procedure, in
theory, is more sensitive to shifts in the process mean and/or variability than
both the standard Shewhart and the improved Shewhart schemes. It has also been
shown to compare favorably with the standard cusum type charts. The PI proposes
to implement his procedures and compare their performance against the Shewhart
and cusum type charts using real data. He intends to identify local companies
and academic institutions where these procedures can be implemented.
