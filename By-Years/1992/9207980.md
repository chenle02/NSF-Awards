This project concerns new business incubators. A new business incubator is a
mechanism or facility for inducing conditions which will assist in the process
of developing new businesses aspiring to bring to market a new or competitive
product or service, and aspiring to create some form of organization that will
support its business activities. It is proposed to study incubation processes in
greater detail than heretofore which should aid in the development of
fundamental organizational schemes for how such facilities can successfully add
new projects or start-up firms to its overall effort or mixture of supported
projects. This should lead to better understanding of the process and
articulation of successful diversification strategies.
