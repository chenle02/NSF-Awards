This project will develop a principled theory of how to quantify correlations
between multiple parties sharing a joint quantum state. This theory will be
applied to answer questions about quantum communication networks and the physics
of quantum systems with novel quantum correlations that have noise-resistant
properties. Tackling questions in the theory of quantum networks will lead to
better strategies for transmitting and storing quantum states in a distributed
network of nodes with limited and noisy communication links. Such a network
could, in turn, be used for secure communication of classical data, distributed
sensing with enhanced precision, and improved communication rates for classical
data. The theory of novel noise-resistant quantum correlations could point us
toward new materials with remarkable properties, perhaps even natural memory
devices for quantum states. Perhaps most importantly, this project will answer
fundamental questions about the nature of correlations between multiple quantum
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theory of multiparty correlations will be
developed based on the idea that, whatever a correlation is, a local action by a
single party cannot increase the amount of correlation in a multiparty system.
Using the theory of linear programming, this project will classify all such
correlation measures based on entropies. This focus on entropy-based correlation
measures makes the theory particularly well-suited to problems in noisy network
communication and the classification of topological order in condensed matter
systems. Specific problems to be tackled include finding the best rates of
communication in a quantum network with two senders and one receiver,
distributed data compression in a quantum network, and quantifying topological
order in spatial dimension greater than two.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
