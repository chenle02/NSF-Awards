The National Science Foundation manages the U.S. Antarctic Program, the nation's
program of scientific research on the southernmost continent. This project has
the potential to create an appreciation in a wide audience of the ways in which
research supported by the U.S. Antarctic Program uses the unique features of
Antarctica as a "global natural laboratory" for a wide variety of sciences to
benefit all of humanity. It also will illustrate in non-technical media how
researchers use the unique features of the landscape to better understand the
physical processes at work in Antarctica and how those processes affect the
ecosystems of the continent, as well as Antarctica's role in the global
ecosystem.

The artist's works--photographs and three-dimensional sculptures--are designed
to show interactions between the ice and the landscape, and how each shapes the
other. These are interactions that are generally otherwise unobserved by lay
people. She will also make innovative use of digital technologies, such as 3-D
printing, to capture aspects of the experience. The overall thrust of the
project will focus on these landscape interactions as well as, to a lesser
extent, on the role of the Antarctic in the global climate system.

Not only are the media in which the artist works at the cutting edge of new
technologies, but she actively engages them to cultivate in a wide range of
audiences, including traditionally under-served audiences such as students in
the Baltimore City Schools, a very large urban district, an appreciation of the
value of both science and art and how those disciplines can share intellectual
intersections.

The National Science Foundation provides access to US Antarctic Program
activities in Antarctica but does not provide funding for this work.
