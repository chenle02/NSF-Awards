Abstract

Award: DMS-0072397 Principal Investigator: John M. Lee

The Pacific Northwest Geometry Seminar for 2000 to 2003 provides opportunities
for communication between researchers and dissemination of results and problems
in areas such as differential geometry, algebraic geometry, mathematical
physics, topology, partial differential equations, complex analysis, and
geometric representation theory. Universities based in the northwestern United
States and British Columbia sponsor these biannual conferences, and local
participants are augmented by speakers from outside the region.

Modern geometry involves techniques and ideas drawn from all of mathematics and
much of physics. Notions distinctive to the field include curvature, which
deduces from measurements of length and angle the extent to which a geometric
space differs from the simplest, flattest models; symplectic structures, which
are the geometric underpinnings for the Hamiltonian formulation of mechanics,
and our understanding of their geometry has been opened up dramatically by ideas
borrowed from physics and complex analysis; and symmetry, since spaces with
large groups of symmetries often give our best access to algebraic aspects of
those symmetry groups, and since geometry and analysis at the space level can
yield linear representations of a group or explain properties of these
representations.
