This project will involve the study of various variational problems in
dynamical systems and partial differential equations. The basic problems studied
include (a) three and n-body type problems, (b) the Weinstein conjecture, which
concerns periodic orbits on odd-dimensional compact manifolds, (c) the existence
of solutions to superlinear elliptic problems, and (d) elliptic variational
problems involving the critical Sobolev exponent, including problems on
contractible domains and curvature problems. In addition to making contributions
in the areas of partial differential equations and differential geometry, this
work can be applied to dynamical systems and potential theory.
