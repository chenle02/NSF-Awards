Sedimentary and volcaniclastic strata of the Oligocene Creede Formation (San
Juan Mountains, Colorado) encountered in research and exploration cores will be
examined in order to evaluate environments of sedimentation and controls on
diagenesis in an intracaldera environment. The project will complement ongoing
surface study of depositional environments and diagenesis of the Creede
Formation. Depositional environments will be identified based on criteria
established from outcrop study, and a sample suite based on sedimentary facies
will be collected. Petrologic and mineralogic examination will also be used to
identify the sequence of diagenetic events. Stratigraphic correlation of core
and surface sections will provide a framework for interpreting cross-moat
changes in depositional patterns and diagenesis. The results will provide (1) a
more complete model for sedimentation in an intracaldera environment, (2) a
better understanding of the complex diagenetic system that operated following
Creede deposition, (3) constraints for modeling the structural and depositional
evolution of caldera moat basins, and (4) a sedimentologic framework for testing
the hypothesis that Creede sediments played a major role in the evolution of
fluids responsible for Creede district mineralization.
