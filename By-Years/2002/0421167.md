0421167&lt;br/&gt;D'Hondt&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation award to
University of Rhode Island provides funds to build and instrument a portable
field laboratory for research and research training focused on subseafloor life.
The laboratory will be designed to be carried on research vessels or used on
land to study estuarine regimes. It will be fully outfitted for 1)
microbiological and biogeochemical sampling of diverse subsurface environments,
2) on-site analyses of biologically significant transient properties, and 3) on-
site analyses of chemical and physical properties that will be used to guide
microbiological and biogeochemical sampling strategies. It will be used to
sample subsurface life from diverse marine environments, including estuaries and
coastal sediments, shallow sediments of the deep ocean, and ocean crustal
aquifers. Samples and analyses taken with the proposed field laboratory will
allow URI scientists and the broader scientific community to document the nature
of life in diverse subseafloor environments. The broader impact of the
acquisition includes a strong education and outreach development at URI, and it
should lead to a better understanding of subsurface biota, and possibly help
understand the origin of life on earth. URI is providing 30% of the project cost
from non-federal funds. This proposal is supported by the Division of Ocean
Sciences at NSF.&lt;br/&gt; ***&lt;br/&gt;
