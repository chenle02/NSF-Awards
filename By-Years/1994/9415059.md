Serving students from the rural and urban areas of Washington State, Central
Washington University is a regional university located near Seattle in a
sparsely populated part of the state, east of the Cascade Mountain range. Recent
and anticipated revitalization of the Geology Department at Central Washington
University has generated a need for an enhanced geologic research facility that
accommodates modern approaches to conducting scientific inquiry and that
immerses students in the research experience. To achieve this goal, the NSF will
assist the department by providing partial support for the modernization of Lind
Hall, the facility that houses geological research activities. The 1947
structure is sound and the space currently devoted to the department is used to
conduct geological research including: Petrology, Structure, Tectonics,
Geographic information Systems, Stratigraphy, Neotectonics, U-Pb geochronology,
and Glaciology. In addition to providing designated laboratory space for faculty
and student researchers, the renovation project will provide new capabilities
such as rock crushing and mineral separation capacity and appropriate storage
areas for heavy liquids and high concentration acids. The project will further
support departmental and institutional efforts in the development of the
university's strategic plan of establishing a Master's Degree program to be
offered by the Geology Department.*** | H H + (á▀áG À F G ( n H H + ( d ' ` ╔ --
