The primary goal of this project is to test the idea that macroevolutionary
parameters might be fairly general among larger groups. Bellerophontiform
molluscs share numerous shell characters with contemporaneous gastropods even
though bellerophonts are bilaterally symmetrical whereas early gastropods are
asymmetrical. Workers consider many of these features to have similar biological
implications for both bellerophonts and asymmetrical gastropods. If so, then PI
expects to see similar rates of change in those characters as well as similar
driven trends (i.e., biased productions of particular character states). He will
evaluate alternative hypotheses using likelihood approaches designed by the
author to simultaneously test phylogenetic and character evolution parameters.
In doing so, tests will assess whether character parameters for bellerophonts
are significantly different than for asymmetrical gastropods and, if so, in what
ways. A secondary goal of the study is to test basic ideas about bellerophont
relationships, such as whether they are monophyletic or polyphyletic, and ideas
about how closely related bellerophonts are to asymmetrical snails.
