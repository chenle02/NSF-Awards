Dr. Darryl Williams, Department of Chemistry, Wayne State University, is
supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program of the
Chemistry Division under a Research Planning Grant to develop high oxidation
state organometallic compounds as chromophores. Compounds containing tantalum
and tungsten bound to nitrido, alkylidyne, imido, oxo, and cyclopentadienyl
ligands will be synthesized, and the reactivity of their electronic excited
states will be explored. The goal is to examine the factors which determine the
strength of the metal-ligand multiple bond and the relationship of absorption
and emission data to this interaction. Ultimately, this informaton will be used
to control and design luminescent compounds using these linkages. These planning
activities will advance Dr. William's career by providing a basis for preparing
a competitive NSF research proposal subsequent to the completion of this
Research Planning Grant. Compounds containing the metals tantalum and tungsten
will be prepared in which multiple bonds can be formed to oxygen, nitrogen and
carbon atoms. These compounds have luminescent properties which can be
manipulated by the substituents bound to the metal and to the multiply bonded
atoms. The electronic structure and excited state reactivities of a series of
these compounds will be investigated. The potential advantage of these systems
over those currently available is a higher degree of control over the
luminescent properties.
