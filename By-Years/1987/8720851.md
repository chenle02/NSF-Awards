The 5.1 m&lt;b,Lg&gt; southeastern Illinois earthquake of June 10, 1987
triggered 62 blast monitors in the coal mines and limestone and western
Kentucky. The resulting set of particle velocity records is the largest sample
of free-field ground motions of any earthquake in the central or eastern United
States. Corrections for site and source effects in the ground motion traces are
shown to reduce the variability in resulting data set. Site effects are based on
shallow geotechnical investigations conducted to determine P- and S-wave
velocities of the overburden as a function of depth, depth to bedrock, and
bedrock topography. Source effects are based on the focal mechanism, focal
depth, and type of faulting associated with the June 10th earthquake. The
resulting site and source corrected free-field particle velocity records, used
in conjunction with random vibration analysis and theoretical considerations,
yeild an improved model for predicting seismically induced ground motions in the
central United States that has appreciably less variability then existing
models.
