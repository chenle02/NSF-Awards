Since the second half of the 20th century, ecology, the study of organisms and
their environments, has been central to global political crises over whether and
how to manage species, material waste, carbon emissions, and access to natural
resources. Field sciences like ecology have shaped and continue to shape our
understandings of other species, human nature, and the physical world. This
historical&lt;br/&gt;study of the development of ecological science in the US
will address how wilderness areas, originally set aside for aesthetic and
cultural reasons, were re-negotiated into ecosystem protection areas and how
understandings of what an ecosystem is and how it functions effect the
management of endangered and invasive species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the
most useful functions of the history of science, and science and
technology&lt;br/&gt;studies, is to make clearer the hidden assumptions that
inevitably accompany the construction of frameworks for understanding the
natural world. This project is will provide that kind of utility. Results will
be published and made available on Cornells eCommons, and shared with the public
via a Scientific American blog.
