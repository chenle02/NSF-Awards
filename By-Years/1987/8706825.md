There has been increasing discussion as to the lowest sensitivity possible in
optical communications systems and in optical systems which involve the
transmission of information from one place to another. This is a question which
has become more crucial as lightwave systems have evolved to a stage for which
more sophisticated developments can be considered. Additionally, it has been
demonstrated that it is possible to generate optical beams with characteristics
significantly different from those of conventional lasers. This research deals
with a study of the issues associated with such recent developments.
