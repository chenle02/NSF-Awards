Patterson, Joseph AST 96-18545 Dr. Patterson continues the measurement of
periodicities in cataclysmic binary systems through an extensive observational
program. Photometric monitoring of cataclysmic variables to determine rotational
ephemerides and to characterize the phenomenon of superhumps is basic to
understanding the accretion processes and the long-term effect of accretion on
periods and spin rates. Patterson and his collaborators have established a
network of small telescopes for photometry and enlisted the observing support of
amateurs world-wide who provide monitoring of many systems in close
collaboration with professional astronomers. ***
