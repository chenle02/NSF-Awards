A key element needed in robust control and adaptive control is a reasonable
uncertainty bound. An inadequate uncertainty bound description will cause
analysis to be either overly conservative or dangerously optimistic. Despite
this widely appreciated fact, the problem of the quantification of uncertainty
has received scant attention. The research intends to develop a new methodology
for obtaining an estimate of the true plant as well as a frequency upper bound
on the uncertainty. A starting point is the adaptive quantification of
uncertainties by rational approximation which combines identification,
interpolation and approximation nicely. Preliminary results show that the
methods proposed provide realistic bounds for the uncertainty. This encourages
us to believe that there is considerable potential for further exploration. The
expected strategies for conducting this research are outlined. The potential
benefits and the implications of the expected results are believed to be wide-
ranging and include new insights into the understanding and treatment of the
effects of the uncertainty, integration of robust control and adaptive control,
new method for fault detection and so on.
