A wide variety of important applications rely upon our ability to quickly and
accurately understand the physical world using a meager supply of event-based
data. Such data arise when indirect observations of a physical phenomenon are
collected by measuring discrete events (such as photons hitting a detector,
sequence motifs appearing in a genome, packets traveling through an Internet
router, neurons firing, or people interacting in a social network). The
challenge here is to use extremely small numbers of random events to perform
inference on the underlying high-dimensional phenomenon (e.g., the distribution
of tissue in the body or the distribution of traffic in a network). In this
case, conventional models of sensing and noise do not apply, and robust
inference requires the development of both novel theoretical analyses and new
computational methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Point processes model random
processes in which a realization consists of a collection of isolated events
distributed across space or time. This research program is aimed at the
development of new theory and methods for exploiting low-dimensional or sparse
models of high-dimensional signal structure using scarce point process
realizations. The theoretical results facilitate characterization of fundamental
performance limits, such as bounds on the error of physically realizable models
of inverse problems in photon-limited imaging and the performance gap between
online and batch processing of streaming data. Furthermore, the methods
themselves are practical and resource-efficient in a broad range of contexts,
and being used by astronomers, microscopists, social scientists, and
geneticists.&lt;br/&gt;Underlying these methods are techniques at the
intersection of statistical signal processing, learning theory, sparse coding,
nonlinear approximation theory, optical engineering, and optimization theory.
