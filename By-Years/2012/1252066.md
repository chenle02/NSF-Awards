Our physical world presents an incredibly rich set of observation modalities.
Recent advances in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) enable the continuous
monitoring of various physical phenomena at unprecedented high spatial densities
and long time durations and, hence, open new exciting opportunities for numerous
scientific endeavors. Since sensor nodes are unattended and battery-powered,
network monitoring/inference from indirect measurements at the sink(s) and
energy conservation are critical in the deployment of large-scale environmental
WSNs. Therefore, a viable framework for energy-efficient network monitoring and
data collection is fundamentally important to significantly improve WSN
management/operations and reduce its deployment costs.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is devoted to a fundamental investigation of
energy-efficient network monitoring/inference and data collections in large-
scale WSNs, based on the recent breakthrough of compressed sensing (CS) through
an integrated theoretical and empirical approach. This research plan aims to
develop a novel and rigorous framework of topology inference for real-world WSNs
operated in highly noisy communication environments. This proposed exploratory
research is different from current approaches, which may create a new paradigm
of optimal design, development, and management/operations for large-scale WSNs
to significantly extend their lifetime. This, in turn, would lead to a
substantial reduction of the current prohibitive cost of WSN deployment, and
thus could be high-reward for the deployment of large-scale monitoring WSNs for
scientific, civic, national security, and military purposes in the near future.
The proposed education plan creates a new interdisciplinary educational practice
for both undergraduate and graduate students through hands-on experience with
our extended WSN testbed. The outreach plan includes summer camps for school
students using an extended WSN testbed. &lt;br/&gt;
