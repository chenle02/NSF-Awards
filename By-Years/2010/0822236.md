A unique feature of the nervous system is the vast number of cell-cell
connections called synapses. At synapses, nerve cells communicate with each
other and with other target cells. At chemical synapses, and upon activation,
nerve cells release transmitter from small synaptic vesicles (SVs) and then
recycle these vesicles for reuse. Hence, SV recycling plays a major role in
neuronal function. Clathrin and its associated molecules are critical players in
vesicle recycling. However, the molecular mechanisms by which SVs are recycled
are not fully understood. This project is directed towards understanding how SV
proteins are recruited and recycled into newly formed vesicles. Genetic and
biochemical studies from Dr. Zhang's laboratory and others suggest that the
clathrin-accessory protein AP180 regulates both the rate and the fidelity of
clathrin-mediated recycling of SVs. This project will test the hypothesis that
AP180 also plays a role in helping retrieve vesicle proteins during vesicle
recycling. They will be examining whether and how the composition of SVs is
altered in mutant fruit flies (Drosophila) deficient of AP180 and also will
investigate the mode by which AP180 might interact with vesicular proteins.
These studies are expected to advance the understanding of SV recycling and
nerve cell function. This project also closely integrates research with
education, training, and outreach to local communities. He has trained and
mentored undergraduates, graduates, and postdoctoral fellows, including women
and students from underrepresented groups. Eleven undergraduates were co-authors
with him on a prior NSF-sponsored project, including one as first author. During
this funding period, he will continue his educational efforts in student
mentoring and course development. In addition, he will be reach out to local
schools and train elementary science teachers through a summer program organized
by the Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural History at OU.
