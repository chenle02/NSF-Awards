The purpose of this U.S.-Poland cooperative project between Dr. Gary H. Meisters
of the University of Nebraska and Dr. Czeslaw Olech of the Mathematics Institute
of the Polish Academy of Sciences is to study globally one-to-one maps (global
inverse function theorems) and their relations to nonlinear differential
equations. This basic research collaboration continues a productive professional
interaction between the researchers and ensures direct and continued access to
the excellent work in this area being done by Polish mathematicians. The project
fulfills the NSF U.S.-Eastern Europe Cooperative Science Program's objective of
advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States
and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool resources in areas
of strong mutual interest and competence.
