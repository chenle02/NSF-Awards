The Department of Mathematics of the University of Connecticut will purchase
equipment which will be dedicated to the support of research in the mathematical
sciences. The equipment will be used for several research projects, including in
particular: . Structured equations, iterations and applications to physics. .
Geometric problems arising in combinatorial notions of dimension and in the
mostly graphical questions in mathematical physics, analysis and number theory
which relate to hyperbolic manifolds. . Nonlinear problems in partial
differential equations arising generally from engineering applications and their
numerical computation and their visualization. . Sampling problems arising in
statistics, tomography and wavelet theory. . Algorithmic computational problems
in low- dimensional topology including normal surface decompositions and
automatic structures on braid groups.
