The principal investigator will continue his research in Teichmuller theory and
spectral geometry. He will consider three new topics: degeneration of the
spectrum, special values of Rankin-Selberg L-functions, and a mapping class
group invariant Poisson kernel for the Teichmuller space. This award will
support research in the general area of differential geometry and global
analysis. Differential geometry is the study of the relationship between the
geometry of a space and analytic concepts defined on the space. Global analysis
is the study of the overall geometric and topological properties of a space by
piecing together local information. Applications of these areas of mathematics
in other sciences include the structure of complicated molecules, liquid-gas
boundaries, and the large scale structure of the universe.
