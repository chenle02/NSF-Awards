This EAGER project, supported by the Energy, Power and Adaptive Systems program
in ECCS aims to develop a highly novel, bio-inspired, thin and flat solar
concentrator (TFSC). This imaging optic is stationary and thus reduces the need
for a tracker in solar energy applications. For example, it can be used in
utility-scale solar farms or integrated with house-building and household items
to bring solar energy conversion closer to everyday life. Since solar tracking
is precluded in such stationary applications, the acceptance angle becomes an
important issue. To achieve a wide acceptance angle in a TFSC without
sacrificing its collection efficiency, ease of fabrication, or compactness, we
plan to borrow useful concepts from nature.
