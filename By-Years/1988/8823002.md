This proposal examines how changes in product liability law over time influence
patterns of innovation in industries. The project outlines an interesting mix of
theory (relating to the role of incentives in regulation) and empirically-based
application (using a large data base on insurance practices), and builds on
earlier work of the researchers that has had an important influence on the
development of regulatory policies. The primary hypotheses of the project are
well-defined and deal with the effects of product liability costs and management
decisions on research and development expenditures and new product
introductions. The selected data sets are appropriate to the study of these
issues and will allow for detailed analyses relating to the effects of
regulatory policies on industries of specified sizes and types. Results of the
research will lead to better models of the firm, emphasizing the influence of
the real- world legal environment, and a better understanding of the criteria by
which to assess legislation dealing with innovation and product development.
