Professors Rosenthal and Odell will work on a variety of problems in the theory
of Banach spaces. One central problem concerns identifying the complemented
subspaces of the space of absolutely integrable functions on an interval. This
is related to the structure of Banach spaces and convex sets failing the Radon-
Nikodym property. The question of the existence of subspaces isomorphic to the
space of null or absolutely summable sequences in a hereditarily non-reflexive
Banach space will be pursued. The approach Rosenthal and Odell will use involves
analysis of the structure of spaces of Baire functions. Their recently invented
notion of governance of a class of Banach spaces by a function will also play an
important role. The theory of Banach spaces is about analysis in infinitely many
dimensions. For each finite dimension n, there is only one n-dimensional space,
in most respects as well understood in general as in the familiar cases when n
is 1, 2, or 3. These are used to keep track of situations in which there are
only finitely many degrees of freedom. When the number of degrees of freedom
becomes infinite, as would for instance be necessary to describe the
configuration of a piece of string, there are many possible reasonable choices
for the ambient space in which to perform analysis. The work supported by this
award is largely concerned with the ways in which these spaces fit into another,
a line of investigation that lays bare a good deal of their structure.
