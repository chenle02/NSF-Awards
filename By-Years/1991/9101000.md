This award will support the study of the structure of various classes of finite
and countable rank torsion-free abelian groups. Classes of Butler groups will be
classified up to (quasi or near)-isomorphism by invariants in the tradition of
Baer and Ulm invariants. Various applications to other areas of algebra, such as
representations of finite posets and finitely generated modules over multiple
pullback rings will also be considered. This project is in the general area of
abelian group theory and is concerned with the classification of abelian groups.
Although the classification of finite abelian groups has been well understood
for a century, the classification of infinite abelian groups remains elusive.
This research involves this old problem of classification of the infinite
abelian groups approached by new tools from logic and analysis.
