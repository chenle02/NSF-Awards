Continued studies of cosmogenic 3He in surface rocks are planned for the purpose
of determining the exposure history of minerals to cosmic radiation. The
previous 18 months work has documented that cosmogenic 3He can be used to date
glacial events, volcanic eruptions, flood events, and can better constrain the
erosion and transport history of mineral grains in the surface environment. Our
studies will concentrate on constraining the production rate of cosmogenic
helium as a function of time, altitude, and latitude. Furthermore, we will
continue our studies on dating geomorphic events and on the erosion and
transport processes of minerals in eolian, riverine, and beach deposits.
