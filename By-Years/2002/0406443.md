AST-0406443&lt;br/&gt;Rose&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will carry out a
comprehensive program to measure radial trends in the mean age and chemical
composition of the stellar populations in early-type galaxies. These gradients,
combined with previously determined ages and metallicities, will supply a
fundamental observational database for the star formation histories of present-
epoch early-type galaxies. This information can then be compared with rapidly
developing numerical models for the evolution of galaxies, so that this program
will have broad implications for the evolution of structure in the
universe&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team will be working intensively with
early career undergraduate students during the summers, and the large database
of stellar spectra will be widely distributed for use in population synthesis
work. It should have a significant impact on the broader community, and serve a
useful function as an educational tool.
