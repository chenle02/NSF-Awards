This award will provide partial support for the U.S. Panel on Wind and Seismic
Effects which was created in 1968. Fifteen agencies are on the Panel,
participating in nine task committees which focus on such topics as earthquake
hazards reduction, buried pipelines and telecommunications systems. Results of
task committee workshops and conferences are disseminated at the annual meetings
which alternate between the U.S. and Japan and in published proceedings. The
National Institute of Standards and Technology (formerly NBS) provides the
Secretariat for the U.S. Panel.
