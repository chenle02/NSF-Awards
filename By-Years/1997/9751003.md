The inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) is being
used in course throughout the chemistry curriculum to stimulate interest in
science, to explore different approached to experimental design, and to answer
scientific questions of interest to students. ICP-OES is a technique in which an
argon stream is caused to absorb energy from a radio-frequency source. This
energy converts the argon into a high temperature plasma into which samples are
introduced. The sample atoms absorb energy from the plasma and move to excited
states. These atoms then return to their ground states by emission of radiation
by emission of characteristic lines of radiation. The theory behind this
technique is presented early in the introductory chemistry course. Students at
all levels work in teams under the supervision of a faculty mentor to develop
model projects for study. These projects involve collection and preparation of
environmental samples for determination of specific elements selected by the
team. In the introductory laboratory, students submit samples and receive data
for interpretation and analysis. In more advanced laboratories, students use the
instrument to explore limits of detection of elements in the environment and
also become familiar with the EPA procedures for analysis. One specific activity
involves the collection of all documentation required for EPA certification of
an ICP-OES method. Advanced students run the samples collected by students in
the introductory courses and then serve as consultants to the introductory
students in the analysis of their data. This project emphasizes a team based
approach to the use of ICP-OES in solving problems requiring both qualitative
and quantitative information. *
