The Lamont Doherty ocean-bottom seismometer fleet, a part of the US national
ocean bottom seismometer instrument pool, will reach 60 instruments by early
2003. This funding provides for upgrades for the 21 aging, first generation
instruments designed in 1986. These upgrades will make the new and old
instruments identical in performance and data format. These upgrades will
improve reliability, increase the dynamic range, covert the instruments to
PASSCAL standard sampling rates, replace faulty older generation releases, add
radio and strobe recovery aids, and replace broad band hydrophone systems with
hybrid differential pressure gauge/hydrophone pressure sensors.
