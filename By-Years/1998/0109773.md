This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project involves a novel
technique to fabricate full-color organic light emitting diode (OLED) displays
in a cost-effective manner. The proposed scanning localized evaporation
methodology (SLEM) circumvents the need for using elaborate substrate patterning
and large vacuum chambers (to attain film uniformity), currently employed to
manufacture OLED flat-panel displays (FPDs).

The benefits of SLEM over current fabrication methodologies stem from its
parallel processing of various layers, as opposed to sequential techniques.
Dedicating a SLEM head to a particular material, multiple evaporating heads are
integrated into a unit that yields full-color OLED displays in a single pass.
Current projections indicate that using this technique, deposition time for
growing all layers for a 3"x4" OLED display (consisting of an array of 270 360
pixels) is estimated to be in the range of 3 to 7 minutes. Considering the
wastage in material supplies and equipment infrastructure needed for
conventional OLED processing, dedicated SLEM units would provide significant
cost advantages in manufacturing OLED displays for various applications. SLEM
represents a natural evolution of thermal evaporation that incorporates many
features of ink-jet printing. This will naturally allow the production of
inexpensive, larger and flexible OLED displays to claim a significant share of
the FPD market.
