The Montana State University will initiate a two-week, residential, Young
Scholars project in engineering for 30 students in grades 8-9. This project
connects high-ability/high-potential junior high students with a
science/engineering university for science-related career exploration
activities. The project begins with a two-week, summer, residential camp of lab
and field experiences, followed by a structured computer-network set of
activities designed to connect students in their local setting with each other,
as well as with university scientists and career counselors throughout the
academic year. Two other weekend meetings are held during the academic year to
expose the students to the two other science/math/engineering universities in
the State of Montana.
