The purpose of this project is to collect the data necessary for a study of
bargaining and negotiation in multilateral international agreements. The PI will
identify and collect data on all multilateral agreements in the international
system from 1920 to the present. The project will then use these data to then
test a number of hypotheses derived from theories of international cooperation
and bargaining, including expectations relating to the incidence and duration of
such agreements, the nature and extent of international bargaining over those
agreements, and the role of NGOs in the agreement process. The results of the
study will be a clearer understanding of the process by which multilateral
agreements are made, implemented, and enforced.
