Processes of colloid coagulation, polymer gelation and degradation, aerosol
formation, Ostwald ripening in metals, even galaxy clustering all involve a
series of irreversible processes including aggregation, fragmentation, feed,
removal, and exchange. In the past, most of these processes have been studied in
the narrow confines of a particular application. In the present work, they are
studied in their most general form, so that the overall nature and behavior of
the kinetics can be understood. Modern ideas of scaling theory (also called
similarity solutions or self-preserving spectra) are applied, as is the concept
of fractals to the geometry of the clusters. The interest in these problems has
expanded with recent computer studies of cluster aggregation. Here computer
simulation is used to advance the theoretical understanding of these
irreversible processes. New specific explicit solutions for the time-- dependent
kinetics, with applications to a wide variety of fields, are given. Kinetic
trandition phenomena, such as gelation and shattering, are explored.
