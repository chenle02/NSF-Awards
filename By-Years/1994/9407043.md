9407043 Spaepen This award will enable Alison Shull, a Ph.D. graduate student
at Harvard University, to conduct collaborative research with Dr. Hirofumi
Shimizu for three and a half months at the Semiconductor Device Development
Center, Hitachi, Ltd., in Tokyo, Japan. By characterizing the surfaces of
silicon and silicon substrates before and after metal deposition, the team will
analyze the surface flaws, metal contamination, and oxidation induced defects in
silicon wafers. Today, the electronic industry is demanding clean silicon wafer
surfaces to produce ultra large scale integrated circuits. Metal impurities can
degrade various characteristics of the silicon integrated circuit components,
and as the device geometries are reduced, they become more sensitive to
contaminants and defects. Prior to the vapor deposition of metal, the team will
utilize Dr. Shimizu's expertise in non-destructive diagnostics of metal
contaminants using a scanning photon microscope (SPM) as well as other
instruments at Hitachi to characterize the surface of silicon wafers. The team
will then utilize Ms. Shull's technique of measuring interfacial stress with a
laser scanning curvature measurement device to study the effect the contaminants
and defects have on the vapor deposition of copper and silver multilayers.
Similarly, the team will also study the effect of a silicon oxide layer in
preventing crystallization of amorphous thin films of metals and silicon. Shull
will provide samples of thin film amorphous silica, both with and without an
oxide capping layer, which have been subjected to various high vacuum thermal
anneals. The team will utilize the SPM to analyze the silicon/metal interfaces
and the silicon/silicon oxide thin film/metal thin film layered structure. The
efforts of Shimizu and Shull will further the fundamental understanding of the
behavior of metal impurities in ultra thin films enhancing the research and
development of thin film, multilaye r and surface coating technologies. ***
