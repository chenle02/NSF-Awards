The inherent complexity of computational and data manipulation problems is
investigated. Specific topics studied include Boolean circuit and communication
complexity, decision tree models, and the complexity of data structures. A
concentrated effort is made at resolving some of the long standing open
problems. Techniques from combinatorics, probability theory, and topology
provides the main mathematical tools for the project.
