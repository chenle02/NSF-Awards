The eastern North Pacific, just west of the Sierra Madre Mountains, experiences
a high incidence of tropical cyclone formation. The initial location of the
storms and the prevailing low-level wind direction suggest that the terrain may
play a role in the cyclogenesis. Observations also suggest that secondary
circulations generated as mature tropical cyclones make landfall on the east
coast of Mexico may contribute to cyclogenesis in the region as well. Previous
theoretical studies indicate that the interaction of easterly zonal flows with
the terrain may generate easterly waves which serve as the initial circulations
that trigger tropical cyclone formation in the eastern Pacific. The principal
investigator will conduct further studies, principally modeling studies, using a
hierarchy of models to better diagnose the evolution of the circulation systems.
