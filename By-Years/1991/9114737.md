The objective of this research is to analyze, design, construct and test a
precision, magnetically-suspended, six degrees-of-freedom motion control stage
with 1 Angstrom resolution (0.004 micrometer) in a 100 micrometer cube of
accessible travel. The suspended platen will be floated in oil to support its
weight and provide mechanical damping and high-frequency coupling. Advances will
be made in sensors, actuators, precision control algorithms and mechanical
design. The research techniques can be scaled, in principle, to larger travels
and lessor degrees of freedom, as necessary from the application perspective.
This development will enable the enhancement of the performance of many nano-
precision devices, in applications such as scanned probe microscopy, X-ray and
optical photolithography, diamond tool machining and probing and analysis of
integrated circuit devices. These processes are of considerable utility in the
manufacturing of a variety of devices and products that are vital to the economy
of the nation.
