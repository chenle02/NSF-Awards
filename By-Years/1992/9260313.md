Radial gradient index (GRIN) lenses have a refractive index profile which
varies radially outward from the optical axis. High numerical aperture GRIN
Lenses use glasses containing thallium oxide. The refractive index gradient is
produced by ion exchange of potassium, K+, from a molten salt bath, for
thallium, Tl+ in the glass. Thallium is highly toxic making its use prohibitive
in a manufacturing environment in the United States. Of the single valent ions
only silver and thallium provide a large enough index change to produce high
numerical aperture GRIN lenses when exchanged with alkali ions. We propose to
use a silver containing glass and exchange of sodium for silver to produce the
gradient.l. His work will address the problem of optimizing the composition of a
silver containing glass ion exchange. The glass must have relatively high ionic
mobility, be chemically resistant to the salt bath, and produce a good
refractive index profile to provide high quality imaging. A series of silver
containing glasses will be melted and their conductivity and chemical resistance
measured. Ion exchange experiments will be performed in the successful candidate
glasses and the refractive index profile will be measured and analyzed.
