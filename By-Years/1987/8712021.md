This project is concerned with the research and development of the large-scale
modeling and computational problems associated with seismic applications. A
research team of geophysicists, physicists, engineers, mathematicians and
computational scientists will address this complex application area. The
research will emphasize development and analysis of efficient numerical
algorithms and codes for the extremely large-scale problems arising in both
forward and inverse seismic modeling.
