This action is to support a conference on the Basal Forebrain, a topic of great
significance and widespread interest to workers in diverse areas of brain
research. The basal forebrain has only recently become an area of study and
information, yet it appears to relate to such important brain functions as
learning, memory, and motivation, to dementia, and possibly drug abuse. Better
understanding of any of these aspects of brain function could be important in
the solution of certain societal problems. This conference brings together
workers with expertise in different areas, but with a converging interest in the
basal forebrain, which has the potential for providing new insights and
stimulating new ideas which could impact significantly on knowledge of basic
functions and integrative processes in the nervous system.
