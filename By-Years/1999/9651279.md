Acquisition of an ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer (uv-vis) is having a
significant impact on the undergraduate chemistry curricula. Educational
opportunities are being significantly enhanced in 11 existing courses, including
Quantitative Analysis, Instrumental Analysis, Organic Chemistry, Biochemistry,
Physical Chemistry for the Life Sciences, Physical Chemistry, Advanced
Inorganic, Advanced Biochemistry, Advanced Organic, Organic Spectroscopy, and
Elements of Research. The combination of fast spectral acquisition, fast data
evaluation, and report generation provides a powerful and productive system.
Collecting data at simultaneous wavelengths for kinetic experiments, variable
temperature control, and the capability of a broader wavelength range can lead
to the incorporation of new experiments in the laboratory and ultimately
strengthen the curriculum. The instrument can be used in workshops that include
high school students and teachers and college students and instructors from
nearby community colleges.
