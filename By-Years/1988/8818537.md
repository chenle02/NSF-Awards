The objectives of the Conference are to strengthen the bond between theory and
applications by providing basic research papers and applications papers, and the
cooperation between researchers from various parts of the world including the
United States. Other conferences of this type tend to attract authors from the
contiguous areas to the location of the conference. This conference expects to
attract researchers from wider areas and provide a forum for the exchange of
research ideas among US and non-US researchers. In addition this Conference
expects to bring the theory closer to practice by exposing the applications
oriented engineers from the Industrial Electronics Society to the basic research
oriented members of the Control Systems Society.
