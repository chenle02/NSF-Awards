1159579&lt;br/&gt;McGrath&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This NSF award by the Chemical
and Biological Separations program supports work by Professors James McGrath and
Philippe M Fauchet focused on development and application of porous
nanocrystalline silicon (pnc-Si). Pnc-Si is a silicon-based nanoporous membrane
that is more than 1000 times thinner than conventional membrane materials used
in filtration and separation processes. The thinness of the membrane endows it
with extraordinary permeability and enables high resolution separations in both
convective and diffusive transport. Combined with the manufacturability afforded
by the silicon manufacturing process, pnc-Si membranes represent an important
new membrane platform with a wide range of uses in sensors, lab-on-a-chip
systems, and biomedical devices. The work under this funding will elucidate the
basic relationships between membrane structure and performance in separation
processes. Manufacturing methods will tune pore sizes and other membrane
properties so that the membranes are optimized for particular separations
involving proteins, DNA, and nanoparticles. The ultimate goal of the proposal is
an analytical and/or computational model that can predict sieving performance
based on the physiochemical properties of the membrane, the solute, and the
method of filtration. The results will allow the rational use pnc-Si and other
ultrathin membranes for new devices such as miniaturized pathogen detectors and
wearable hemodialysis systems.
