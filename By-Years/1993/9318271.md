9318271 Bultman This project investigates the interactions between ovipositing
Phorbia flies and the ascomycete fungal host on which their larvae feed.
Preliminary data suggest that the fly provides spore dispersal service to the
fungus and that the relationship between the two organisms is mutualistic and
possibly coevolved. The project investigates the similarities between this
system and tightly coevolved plant-pollinator mutualisms. %%% There is general
agreement among ecologists that mutualisms are very important in ecosystem
function, but that they are understudied and poorly understood relative to other
biotic interactions. This research is important in that it will describe a
potentially new and widespread mutualistic relationship, and give us better
insight into the conditions that lead to the origins of mutualisms. The results
of this research may be of application in studies of the health and function of
ecosystems. ***
