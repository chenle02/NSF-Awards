9619832 The goal of the research is to develop the notion of "staged
computation." Intuitively, the idea is to execute programs and use the results
of early computations to optimize later computations. This is accomplished by
making use of both partial evaluation and run-time code generation. The research
investigates to what extent staged computation can be exploited to improve the
adaptability and safety of software while achieving good performance. The focus
of the work is the design of an expressive type system for staged computation at
the source level, a typed intermediate language within a compiler, and code
generation technology to take advantage of explicit computation stages. The
starting point for the investigation is the ML language. The proposed research
is expected to lead to new compiler technology that will support, in an
integrated way, a significantly larger class of optimizations than is currently
possible, including both link-time and run-time optimization of code. ***
