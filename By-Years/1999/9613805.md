Efficient solution to optimization problems is of great interest and importance
in practice and theory. Unfortunately, many important optimization problems turn
out to be NP-hard, which implies that they do not have efficient solutions based
on current computer techniques. However, this does not obviate the need for
solving these problems. Approximation algorithms and heuristic algorithms for
these optimization problems have been studied. Recent progress in computational
optimization has greatly advanced the understanding of the approximability of
optimization problems. In particular, recent study of the SATISFIABILITY problem
(SAT) and the MAXIMUM SATISFIABILITY problem (MAXSAT) has played an important
role in recent advances in computational optimization. Motivated by such an
exciting progress in the area, Dr. Jianer Chen from the Department of Computer
Science at Texas A&amp;M University (TAMU) of the United States of America and
Dr. Guillermo Morales-Luna from the Computer Science Section at the Mexican
Research and Advanced Studies Center of National Polythecnic Insitute
(CINVESTAV_IPN) of Mexico have formed a research team for performing the
U.S.-Mexico collaborative research. The primary objectives of this collaboration
are: to establish a long term cooperation among the theoretical computer science
groups in the computer sciences departments of TAMU and CINVESTAV-IPN; to
strengthen the graduate program in Computer Science in CINVESTAV-IPN, and to
increase the international competence and accomplishments of the theoretical
computer science research group at TAMU; to develop new techniques for designing
better approximation algorithms and to develop new methods for analyzing
existing approximation algorithms; and to develop a computational environment
for testing and experimenting with approximation algorithms, in particular,
approximation algorithms for MAXSAT, with special care to examine the efficiency
and approximation factors of the tested algorithms .
