9628154 Yuen The PIs propose to use fluid dynamical modeling techniques to study
the role of viscous heating in magmatic systems and will study these effects in
the generation of melts in mantle plumes and in the formation and ascent of
granitic diapirs. They hypothesize that viscous dissipation will prove important
for understanding both processes. ***
