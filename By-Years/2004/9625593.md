9625593 Holbrook This Americas Program award will support Dr. Noel M. Holbrook,
Harvard College, Cambridge, to visit Caracas, Venezuela to plan a research
proposal in collaboration with Dr. Ernesto Medina, Instituto Venezolano de
Investigaciones Cientificas (IVIC), Caracas, Venezuela. The objective of the
visit is to plan the development of a collaborative study of tropical plant
physiology and plant environmental biology using hemiepiphytic plants as a model
system. Hemiepihytes are plants that spend a portion of their life without
access to the water and nutrients held in the soil, and part of their life with
root connection to the ground. Venezuela is an appropriate study location
because of the diversity of hemiepiphytic species found there and the wide range
of habitats in which they naturally occur. The purpose of the visit is to select
the field areas that will provide the necessary combination of access ,
protection from human disturbance, and marked seasonality in rainfall for the
proposed study. ***
