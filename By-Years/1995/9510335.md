9510335 Litvin This project, part of the Research in Undergraduate Institutions
program, contributes to the area of two dimensional crystallography and its
applications. The investigator will identify and determine the symmetry of
domain twins and walls, for both ferroelastic and magnetic materials. He will
make use of Volume E of the International Tables of Crystallography, of which he
was a recent co author. These boundaries have an important influence on the
physical properties of multi-domain ferroelastic and magnetic materials. %%%
This theoretical research, under the Research in Undergraduate Institutions
program, takes place at the Burks Campus of Pennsylvania State University. It
falls in the area of crystallography, which involves the study of symmetries in
solids. In particular, this project deals with those regions inside ferroelastic
and magnetic materials where two individual perfect crystalline domains meet.
These boundaries have an important influence on the physical properties in
multi-domain materials. ***
