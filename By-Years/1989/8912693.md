This action is to support a symposium which concentrates on the anatomy of the
forebrain and the associated behaviors. Topics on which there will be
concentration include: 1) the motor cortex and movement performance; 2)
plasticity in the motor cortex; 3) the forebrain and pain perception; 4) the
thalamus and behavior; 4) eye movement control; and 5) the limbic system and
motor behaviors. This is an international conference and brings together
scientists from around the world to discuss these diverse topics. The cross-
disciplinary nature of this conference should provide new approaches to studies
on brain and behavior.
