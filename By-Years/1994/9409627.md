The PI proposes to investigate the way in which people assign confidence to
their beliefs and estimates. One hypothesis is that noise, i.e., error variance
within the confidence judgment, may result in systematic overconfidence. This
problem would be most pronounced as a person attempted to answer difficult
questions, a finding which has previously been found in the literature. A new
study is proposed to test this hypothesis. The PI also will investigate the role
of practice in order to determine if greater experience within a topic domain
enhances one's ability to assign more appropriate confidence levels to answers
within that domain. Finally, the investigator will attempt to determine if
accuracy and confidence are influenced by the same types of feedback.
