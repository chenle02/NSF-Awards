This proposal supports a theory day to be held at New Mexico State University
on March 16, 1992. The PI is a visiting faculty member in the Department of
Computer Science at New Mexico State University and is also serving as chair of
the program committee for the 7th Annual Structure in Complexity Theory
Conference. The theory day at NMSU is to be held in conjunction with the program
committee meeting to be held the weekend of March 14, 1992. It will make an
important contribution to the intellectual climate of the department and
university, it will stimulate awareness of research activities of colleagues in
the region and perhaps foster the initiation of research collaborations, it can
serve as the catalyst for the formation of a regional theory group, and it will
provide important support and promotion for the structures community.
