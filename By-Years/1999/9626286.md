9626286 Williams The objective of this project is to develop a new instrument
based upon the integration of Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM) and a modified
Electrostatic Force Microscope (EFM). The new instrument called the Scanning
Tunneling Charge Transfer Microscope (STCTM) will operate in an ultra-high
vacuum chamber, and will provide a means to transfer single electrons to and
from atomic scale surface structure with atomic spatial resolution. It will
provide the ability to measure the electronic response of the surface to the
transferred charge. Ultrasmall currents should also be measurable by the
proposed scanning probe tips. The proposed work will significantly extend the
capabilities of existing atomic scale characterization methods. The combination
of ultrasmall charge/current detection and atomic spatial resolution provides a
powerful tool for examining conducting and insulating nanostructure. These
measurement capabilities should have a profound impact on materials research,
especially in the area of nanostructured materials and devices. ***
