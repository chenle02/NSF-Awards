This research involves a broad investigation of membrane fouling by
macromolecules. Principal factors causing fouling include concentration
polarization, plugging, adsorption of macromolecules on the surfaces in the
membrane, and macromolecular/aggregate deposition on the upper surface of the
membrane with emphasis in this study on the latter two. Fouling of several
varieties of membranes with different pore sizes and geometries and with
different chemical natures (e.g. PTFE, PES, ceramic) will be investigated for a
series of well-characterized proteins over a wide range of conditions. A primary
goal of the work is to develop a better understanding of intermolecular
interactions which lead to aggregate formation and its role in protein fouling.
Other experiments are directed to the evaluation of various cleaning procedures.
Fouling adversely affects the length of service of membranes in the
biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries.
