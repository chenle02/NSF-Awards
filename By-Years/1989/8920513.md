Travel support is provided to outstanding undergraduate and graduate students
to attend the meeting of the Society for Research on Biological Rhythms.
Biological rhythms regulate the function of living systems at virtually every
level of organization, from molecular to organismal in animals throughout the
Animal Kingdom. In non-human animals, biological timing serves as a wake-up
clock and organizer of daily routine. While the pacemaker is believed to be
located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus, one event of this
meeting is to debate the existence of other pacemakers. In humans, sleep and
wakefulness, cognitive and motor performance, body temperature, blood pressure,
serum hormone levels, and urinary metabolism all vary rhythmically. Alternations
in human ultradian, circadian and seasonal rhythms are important in a number of
clinical conditions as well as in coping with jet-lag and shift-work activities.
This meeting reflects the broad coverage of rhythmic phenomena in living systems
by bringing together scientists with expertise in a number of areas. The span of
research will range from molecular genetics, biochemistry and cell biology to
neurobiology, neuroendocrinology, ecology and clinical human applications.
Symposia, workshops, slide presentations and posters will provide a means for
extensive communication among the scientists and students. The goals are to
facilitate an exchange of scientific information which will lead to important
insights and stimulate new ideas that could have a major impact on the area of
biological rhythms. Moreover, the scientific program is directed towards
encouraging graduate and undergraduate student participation to help promote
their training as prospective scientists in biological sciences.
