This project, administered by the Association for Women in Mathematics,
provides travel support for women to attend research conferences in the
mathematical sciences. The project would allow partial travel support for
approximately 80 travel awards over a three year period. This travel support
would enhance the research activities of the awardees and would provide
increased visibility for women in the mathematical sciences which may help in
addressing the problem of under-representation in the discipline.
