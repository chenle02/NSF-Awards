9409496 Plank The main goal of this project is the evaluate several techniques
for providing efficient check-pointing in parallel processing systems. Check-
pointing is the act of saving the execution state of a program with the purpose
of restoring the system to a stable state after a failure. The major obstacle to
providing general purpose fault-tolerance for parallel programs is the overhead
incurred by check-pointing. In an attempt to improve the performance of check-
pointing, this project explores diskless check-pointing, user controlled check-
pointing and meshing of check-pointing with log-structured file systems. The
impact of these approaches and their subsequent implementations will be
investigated. ***
