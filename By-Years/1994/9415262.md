9415262 Su This award supports a 12-month Japan Society for the Promotion of
Science Postdoctoral Fellowship for Dr. Sophia Su at the University of Kyoto,
Japan. Dr. Su will work with Dr. Mitsuhiro Yanagida, Department of Biophysics,
on a research project entitled, "Japan JSPS Program: Identification and
Characterization of Genes Required for the GO/G1 Transition in Fission Yeast
Schizosaccharomyces pombe." Fission yeast is a unicellular eukaryotic cell which
is an excellent model to study cell division cycle control and mitosis. Dr. Su
and Dr. Yanagida will use the S. pombe as a model system to study the growth and
differentiation of cells after they have been subjected to a nutrient or serum-
starved conditions. The team will identify genes that are expressed and operated
during the transition from nonproliferative (G0) to proliferative (G1) cell
states. The team will isolate the regulatory gene products that may be necessary
for leaving the G0 state and promoting initial DNA synthesis and cytoskeletal
changes of the G1 state. These gene products may reveal universal roles in
regulating cellular growth and cellular differentiation for yeast, may be
similar to the regulation of cell proliferation of mammals and might have
important implications for using yeast as a model for cancer research. ***
