This project deals with the study of surface damage accumulation during fatigue
of oxide dispersion strengthened nickel which has been surface modified by ion
beam mixing of aluminum. The work is intended to advance the understanding of
the mechanisms by which novel surface modifications can influence cyclic
deformation phenomena associated with fatigue crack initiation and thus prolong
fatigue life. Results will be compared with those recently obtained in a study
of pure nickel with similar surface modifications in which it was found that the
behavior of the surface layer was controlled mainly by bulk plastic strain
localization events. The research will focus on an alloy which is chemically
similar to pure nickel (since the dispersoid phase is inert), but which will
display different behavior with respect to slip band extrusion, cyclic
hardening, and plastic strain localization behavior. Specimens will be prepared
using an established technique of vacuum evaporation of multiple layers of Ni
and Al followed by high energy inert ion irradiation, resulting in a
supersaturated solid solution of Al in Ni in a surface layer about 100 nm thick.
These will be subjected to plastic strain controlled fatigue while monitoring
the accumulation of surface damage by scanning electron microscopy and optical
interferometry. Slip homogeneity and the spatial distribution and the detailed
local morphology of slip bands features will be analyzed and compared to the
behavior of unmodified nickel in both the pure and dispersion strengthened
forms.
