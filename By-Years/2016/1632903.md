ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;A non-technical description of the project, which explains
the project's significance and importance&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The formation of
soil and its removal from the landscape are two of the most important geological
processes that intersect with the livelihood and well-being of human
populations. Soil is needed for agriculture, and the characteristics of this
material affect the availability of groundwater and the ecological balance of
different landscapes. Erosion can be very damaging and the rate at which
material is transported to streams will have an impact on flooding. This project
will examine the rate at which soil is produced and eroded in order to better
assess the controls on the distribution of this very important natural
resource.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A technical description of the
project&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Soil thickness is a fundamentally important
characteristic of the Earth's surface that plays an essential role in hydrology,
ecology, biogeochemistry, erosion, and transport processes. The prevailing
theory predicts that mean soil thickness decreases with increasing catchment-
mean erosion rate and that soil-mantled landscapes give way to rocky ones when
this erosion rate exceeds the climate- and lithology-controlled maximum soil
production rate. However, initial observations indicate that soil thickness is
much more variable across otherwise similar landscapes than can be explained by
this theory. This project will use a combination of in situ and detrital
cosmogenic radionuclide analyses and digital elevation models across a suite of
carefully selected field sites to quantify the fundamental influences on soil
thickness in geologically active regions.
