This award for research at an undergraduate institution will support the
development and testing of methods to create recurrent reinforcement learning
neural networks that can solve challenging problems related to time series
generation and analysis. There are two main attributes of improvisation that
make it an excellent research area for machine learning. First, it is a
procedure in which one makes up a solution to a problem in real-time, using
available materials and knowledge, and in response to environmental effects.
Second, it requires variety, modifying the solution from one time to another,
even under the same conditions. Yet the overall result must be cohesive from
beginning to end. Thus, improvisation is a significant challenge for computer
science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will extend the range of problems
that can be solved, through a fusion of two separate methods. The first is
recurrent neural networks, that are nonlinear neural networks in which the
outputs of parts of the network are fed back to provide input to some or all
parts of the network. They are emerging as feedback systems that can learn to
model non-Markov processes, can learn to predict values in a time series, and
can learn to generate actions or control signals that depend on past behavior.
The second method is reinforcement learning, an area of machine learning that
has taken on an important role in computationally solving problems that are
characterized by sparse feedback as to whether a proposed solution is correct,
given a situation or state. Human beings have a much greater ability than
machines currently do to improvise in uncertain environments, and the ability to
extemporize would be a very important asset for intelligent software
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to supporting promising research, this
award will encourage broader participation of women in science, by involving
women in research and by helping to enable progress in computer science at a
college for women.&lt;br/&gt;
