This grant is to support experiments in turbulent flow. The experiments are
designed to permit a directo test of the basis underlying the Large-Eddy-
Simulation scheme for numerically simulating turbulent flows. Flow in the wake
behind a circular cylinder, and turbulent flow behind a grid, will be
investigated. Filtering of the data will be utilized to models for the small
scales. The data will be examined for clues leading to improved for sub-grid
turbulence. Large-Eddy-Simulation is increasingly utilized in the numerical
simulation of complex turbulent flows. Clarification of its validity, and
improvements in the subgrid models, will lead to improved accuracy in the
modeling of these flows important to various engineering systems.
