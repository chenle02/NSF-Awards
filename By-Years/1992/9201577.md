These investigators will purchase a computer workstation, peripheral equipment,
and software. The equipment will be used for modeling studies and molecular
dynamics calculations applied to proteins and nucleic acids, for DNA sequence
searches, and for molecular mechanics calculations on small molecules. Enzymes
to be studied include glutathione S-transferase, epoxide hydrolase, 4-
chlorobenzoate dehalogenase, staphylococcal nuclease, and mandelate racemase.
