Published reports on software-development costs and our interactions with many
companies reveal that testing and debugging consume too much of the development
costs. Furthermore, the ubiquitous nature of software requires that it be high
quality. Thus, there is an urgent need for technology that companies can use to
improve the process to reduce the cost of these activities and improve the
quality of the software. The technology that this team will explore for
commercialization consists of rigorous techniques that are highly automated, and
have the potential to improve reliability and adaptability of today's large,
complex software systems at a reduced cost. These techniques have provided the
foundations in testing and debugging on which many additional techniques have
been developed. The techniques have been implemented in prototype tools that
have been used for experimentation that shows their effectiveness and efficiency
in improving the quality of the software and reducing the cost of achieving it.
However, no commercial tools or systems currently provide this advanced
technology. The team's project has the potential to provide such tools and
systems.

The technology the team plans to commercialize will improve the efficiency and
effectiveness of software development by addressing the process of testing and
debugging. Not only will the technology result in higher-quality software for
those companies who use it, but it will provide savings in the costs of the
software development. Because the technology can be used for testing and
debugging at all levels of development (e.g., individual, team, and system), on
systems written in different programming languages and on non-code components
(e.g., databases), by companies that develop software for their own use or to
sell, and by companies of all sizes, the commercialization of the technology can
have a significant impact on industry. If successful in commercializing the
technology, the tools and systems being built will ultimately improve software
quality and, thus, has the potential to have a significant societal benefit. The
project will prepare students and faculty who participate in the important area
of entrepreneurship, which will help them transition the technology developed to
industry.
