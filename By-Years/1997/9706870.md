9706870 Parvin This project explores the magnetic behavior of carbon-
encapsulated magnetic particles. The research involves synthesis, purification,
magnetic extraction, and structural and magnetic characterization of the
particles. The magnetic particles (carbon-coated alloys of iron-transition
metals, cobalt-transition metals, nickel-transition metals and iron-rich rare
earths)are synthesized in a modified low carbon:metal ratio fullerene arc
chamber in which the formation of carbides are minimized. Characterization of
the particles includes particle size distribution analysis and composition,
structural analysis using transmission electron microscopy and X-ray
diffraction, and Mossbauer spectroscopy. Hysteritic and temperature-dependent
magnetic response is measured over a wide range of magnetic fields and
temperatures. It is a collaborative project between San Jose State University
(particle characterization) and Northwestern University (particle synthesis).
%%% Carbon-encapsulated magnetic particles are of interest because they combine
corrosion protection from the carbon coating and possible unique magnetic
properties based on the type of metal alloy encapsulated. ***
