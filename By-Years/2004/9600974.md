9600974 Naegele Understanding the cellular and molecular processes that lead to
the formation of precise connections in the nervous system is one of the major
tasks of neuroscience. This proposal is directed to one key aspect of the
general problem: the role of neuronal activity, competition and cell-cell
competition in the embryonic brain. Remodelling of the initial connections made
in the embryo is an important part of the process by which the functioning brain
circuits are refined during development. Few studies have addressed the role of
the immune system in these processes. This proposal seeks to explore the role of
special cells, the microglia that typically act as scavengers , attacking
diseased or damaged cells. The working hypothesis for this proposal is that the
microglia and associated immune system molecules may play a part in the
refinement of neural connections during development. This research program, as a
Career award, will involve undergraduate participation in the laboratory.
