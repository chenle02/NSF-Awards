This award supports research in elementary particle physics by Dr. Nicholas J.
Hadley, a Presidential Young Investigator. Dr. Hadley is working on two
projects: (a) an experimental search for rare K meson decays at Brookhaven
National Laboratory; and (b) the "D0" Experiment at the Fermilab Collider. Both
of these experiments are studies of the nature of fundamental forces. They probe
the constituents of matter at extremely small distances. These constituents and
their interactions affect the evolution of the universe and determine the
microscopic structure of matter. The Brookhaven experiment will study a decay
process which is sensitive to the existence of new, very massive particles. The
Fermilab experiment will make measurements which test and refine the current
"standard model" of fundamental forces.
