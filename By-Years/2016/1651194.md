The 20th Quantum Information Processing Workshop (QIP 2017) will be held at the
Westin Hotel in downtown Seattle, on 14-20 January 2017. QIP is the premier
annual conference in the field, and is expected to bring together over 400 of
the leading researchers in theoretical aspects of quantum information and
computation. &lt;br/&gt;QIP seeks to increase student participation in the
field. It is proposed to offer approximately 20 US-based students and
postdoctoral fellows NSF-sponsored travel grants to attend the conference.
