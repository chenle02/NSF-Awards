This grant supports upgrade of an existing energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS)
mated to a scanning electron microscope (SEM) at California State University,
San Bernardino (CSUSB). Improved capability for microspatial chemical analysis
will support PI research and student research training including: 1) studies of
the origin of placer gold deposits; 2) assessment of the distribution of lead
and zinc impacted soils adjoining abandoned highways in California; 3)
chemostratigraphy of volcanic deposits; and 4) archaeological artifact
provenance. CSUSB is a Hispanic Serving Institution.
