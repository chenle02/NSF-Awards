&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this unsolicited proposal is to create a
collaborative effort between Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology (RHIT) and the
NSF Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Safety, Security and
Rescue Research Center (SSR-RC) at the University of Denver (DU). This work
seeks to capitalize on the faculty, undergraduate and graduate student resources
at this primarily undergraduate engineering institution, RHIT, and the research
equipment and resources available at DU. The SSR-RC provides integrative
robotics and artificial intelligence solutions in robotics for activities
conducted by emergency response personnel. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
intellectual merits of this work lie in the fact that the utility of an unmanned
air vehicle (UAV) is extensive in military and civil applications. The design of
a robust UAV with vertical take-off and landing will allow for surveillance and
maneuverability in narrow spaces. In addition, UAVs rarely include a
manipulator; thus, the inclusion of one through this work will allow for more
flexibility with respect to the UAV interacting with its environment. The
funding of this project will illustrate a practical integration of research and
education at two very different types of institutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
broader impacts of the proposed work are primarily related to the inclusion of
faculty, undergraduate and graduate students at RHIT into the high-level
research available through the laboratory at DU. The relationship is expected to
enhance the infrastructure for research and education at both of these schools.
If the hexacopter proves to be a viable resource, then it will affect
populations far beyond academia. In addition, since the students will need to
consider the novice end user in their design, it will require them to have an
awareness of societal needs and capabilities.
