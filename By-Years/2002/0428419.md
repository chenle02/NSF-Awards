Abstract&lt;br/&gt;0428419&lt;br/&gt;James Lee&lt;br/&gt;George Washington
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The need of ever decreasing feature size on
sensors and the need of sensor applications in extreme conditions have posed
severe requirements on sensor materials, leading to the need for new materials.
Development of such materials is an extraordinary challenge. Response to this
challenge can be significantly aided by accurately predicting material behavior
at nano/micro scale and under extreme conditions. The objective of this research
is to provide a theoretical and computational basis for sensor developments,
with the emphasis on nano/micro sensor materials in extreme conditions. It
consists of two parts: (1) developing a multiscale field theory that exactly
represents atomic N-body dynamics and can work as an alternative to, but
computationally more efficient than atomic-level molecular dynamics simulation
in studying statistical and high temperature properties of materials; (2)
performing multiscale modeling to understand, predict and optimize complex
material behavior of nano/micro sensors in extreme conditions.
