This is a Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site grant. The award permits
undergraduate students to participate in a research program in the materials
field under the supervision of faculty members actively engaged in research. The
Cornell program emphasizes significant recruitment and participation of
minorities and females, as well as representation from universities nationwide.
The program lasts ten weeks in the summer, and includes instruction in the use
of libraries, search of electronic data bases, research in teams composed of
undergraduates, graduate students, post-docs, and faculty members, planning of
experiments, use of instrumentation for research on polymer-based fibers, data
analysis, oral presentation of results in a university-wide seminar. Research
undertaken includes fiber chemistry, biomedical textiles, high performance
fibers, composite materials, liquid crystal polymers, and dye chemistry. Funding
is provided for six students. The program enhances current research activities
as well as adding to the number of scientifically trained individuals. It is
hoped that this hands-on experience will serve as a stimulus to attract and
retain highly-gifted students into careers in teaching and research.
