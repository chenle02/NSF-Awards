Professor David Oxtoby is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to perform theoretical studies of the liquid
state. His research is directed toward the fundamental properties that underlie
the phase transitions between gas, liquid, and crystalline states of matter.
Major emphasis is placed on studying the dynamics of these state changes, the
rates of nucleation and the rates of crystal growth. Oxtoby will employ modern
statistical mechanics methods which he has developed, especially density
functional methods, to study these problems. Applications include the
condensation of liquids from the vapor, the crystallization of colloidal fluids,
and the rapid solidification of metal alloys. %%% Nucleation is a very important
physical process which has important implications in such diverse areas as
atmospheric chemistry and metallurgy. The dynamics of phase changes depend
critically on the nucleation process. Professor Oxtoby has pioneered the
development of a theoretical technique known as density functional theory which
he is using to study gas phase to liquid phase nucleation, and liquid phase to
solid phase nucleation.
