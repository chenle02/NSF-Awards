Determination is an event which programs the future developmental fate of a
cell or a group of cells. It is often a stable state but not necessarily an
irreversible condition. In general terms, a cell or group of cells is determined
when it exhibits the same developmental fate whether grown in situ, in
isolation, or at a new place in or on the organism. Determination has been
extensively documented and studied primarily in animals. In plant development,
determination is often an obscure component because many plant cells are
totipotent and can express this totipotency as a result of manipulation. Dr.
McDaniel has identified a situation in plant development, floral development in
day- neutral and photoperiodic tobaccos, in which determination is stable enough
to permit investigation. The proposed study has three major goals: 1. Establish
when the meristem of the terminal bud in day-neutral and in short-day tobaccos
become determined for floral development, 2. Establish the developmental fate of
cells in the meristem of florally- determined terminal and axillary buds of day-
neutral tobacco, and 3. Establish in day-neutral tobacco the source(s) of the
signal(s) which induces floral determination. Whole plant manipulations,
histological analysis, tissue culture, and clonal analysis will be employed.
Understanding determination is critical for any in-depth, comprehensive
understanding of development in multicellular organisms. Determination has been
extensively studied in animals. In plants this problem has received only minimal
attention. Dr. McDaniel is attempting to address this problem using floral
determination in tobacco.
