&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this proposal is to renew and expand the Center for
Center for Safety, Security and Rescue Research (SSR-RC) as an NSF
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center. This proposal is based upon
UMN's successful completion of five years of operation of the SSR-RC; and the
commitment by companies to join a research site at the University of Denver. UMN
will be the lead research site for SSR-RC with the University of Pennsylvania
(joined the Center a few years ago) and the University of Denver as research
partners. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This proposal covers the renewal for the
second-five years of UMN and the expansion to include UD. The proposed Center
will provide integrative robotics, sensing, and artificial intelligence
solutions in robotics for activities conducted by the police, FBI, FEMA,
transportation safety, and emergency response to mass casualty-related events.
The Center is built upon the knowledge and expertise of multi-disciplinary
researchers in computer science, engineering, human factors, and psychology at
the three institutions. The renewed and expanded Center will be successful
because it builds on existing strengths developed during the first five years of
operation. The Center will also educate and train researchers for industry and
government. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the proposed center is
to radically improve homeland defense in all dimensions. The proposed Center
will encourage collaboration, and will nurture an emerging field of research and
the associated industries, thus helping to establish the challenges of the field
and acceptable research and evaluation methodologies. SSR-RC will expose
students and faculty to state-of-the-art research projects of value to the
industry, and plans to attract large companies to the SSR domains and energize
innovative start-up companies. Students will have opportunities for industrial
internships with members. Faculty in the SSR-RC will continue to aggressively
recruit women and minority graduate students through the various I/UCRC
supplemental programs, and to host annual summer camps for middle-schoolers from
under-represented groups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
