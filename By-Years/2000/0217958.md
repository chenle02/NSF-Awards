A team of researchers from Cornell University (in close collaboration with a
group from the University of Michigan) will develop advanced sources of
ultrashort light pulses. The researchers will exploit a new degree of freedom
that has recently been demonstrated for short-pulse generation: control of the
sign and magnitude of effective cubic nonlinearities. Because cubic nonlinear
processes underlie virtually all aspects of modern ultrashort-pulse generation,
this is a substantial new capability. &lt;br/&gt;Ultrahigh-intensity lasers
capable of producing petawatt (1015 W) power levels and intensities as high as
1015 W/cm2 will benefit from new capabilities in pulse compression, pulse
cleaning, and compensation of self-focusing and excessive nonlinear phase
shifts. The new ability to control nonlinear phase shifts is referred to as
nonlinearity management. &lt;br/&gt;The new approach to control and generation
of intense ultrashort pulses is flexible and applicable to a variety of
functions. The proposed research is certain to produce new information and
understanding of ultrashort light pulses. Substantial impact is expected through
the new instruments that will be developed. New ultrahigh-intensity lasers are
expected to enable a wide variety of scientific studies. &lt;br/&gt;Students
participating in the proposed effort will be involved in a highly collaborative
effort, with aspects ranging from optical engineering to fundamental
science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
