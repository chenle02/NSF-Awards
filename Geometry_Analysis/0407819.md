0407819 Hsu The Principal Investigator (PI) of this proposal plans to study
various analytic and stochastic properties of path and loop spaces over a
Riemannian manifold. The goal is to break new ground in this area of mathematics
by proposing and solving new problems and, at the same time, devising a
substantial research program for further investigation. Path and loop spaces
over a Riemannian manifold are naturally equipped with the basic ingredients for
an analytic theory, namely, the Wiener measure and a differentiable structure.
These are important infinite dimensional mathematical and physical models. The
PI will study the following problems concerning these models: (1) Integration by
parts formula for manifolds with the Neumann boundary conditions (adiabatic
case); (2) Logarithmic Sobolev and related inequalities for simply-connected
manifolds; (3) Couplings of Brownian motions on manifolds, especially the
problem of maximal couplings; (4) Infinite dimensional mass transportation
problems related to the Wiener measure. The importance of mathematical objects,
such as path and loop spaces over Riemannian manifolds, has been recognized by
mathematicians and physicists for quite some time. The need for their study is
motivated by a variety of problems in applicable mathematics and theoretical and
applied physics. A better understanding of these models from the mathematical as
well as from the physical points of view will contribute to our current
knowledge in these two fields. The practical aspects of these investigations
will become significant in the future development of mathematical and physical
sciences.
