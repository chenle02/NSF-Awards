9401159 Turner This award provides support for extending and enhancing a
broadband multi- media network to support a set of closely related collaborative
research activities in the area of distributed imaging and visualization. The
network will utilize Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) technology for the fast
distribution of high-resolution images, visualizations, studio-quality video and
multi-rate data. The research topics fall into two categories: research on
enabling technologies such as scalable networks, host/network interfaces
supporting multimedia applications, design and analysis of large-scale
multimedia information servers, protocols and operating systems, scalable
parallel processing and declarative visualization. And secondly, research on the
application of these technologies to real distributed imaging and visualization
systems.
