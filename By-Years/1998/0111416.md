The Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program of the Division
of Chemistry, National Science Foundation, supports the research work of Dr.
Harry Gray (PI) and Dr. John Richards (co-PI) of the Beckman Institute at
Caltech to develop and apply innovative "intra-complex" electron transfer
reactions to examine reaction pathways of redox metalloenzymes, a host of
proteins that have significant biological relevance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With
this support, a new understanding of the chemistry of metalloenzymes will be
forthcoming. The results from the proposed fundamental study will significantly
add to the knowledge base that will cut across several disciplines, and will
impact markedly into biological and biochemical fields. Students and post-
doctoral associates will gain invaluable experience in a variety of experimental
techniques and learn insights into interdisciplinary methodologies.
