This research allows two anthropologists at the University of New Mexico to
test alternative models of male parenting in the contemporary U.S. This study
will test a specific evolutionary model of the determinants of male fertility
and parenting practices, designed to explain the number of children men have,
the economic and noneconomic resources men invest in their children, commonality
and conflict of interest between men and women in fertility, parenting and
mating decisions, and differential investment in offspring within sibships. The
predictions of alternative economic and evolutionary models will also be tested.
Data will be obtained through structured interviews with a representative sample
of 750 Anglo and Hispanic men over 50 years of age in Albuquerque, New Mexico. A
short interview will determine eligibility for the study, and a long interview
will obtain fertility, parenting and income data on three generations of
individuals. This research is important because increased understanding of
fertility and parenting in general will help us understand the causes of the
deomgraphic transition, and increased understanding of fertility in different
ethnic groups in the US can help planners design policies to satisfy the needs
of different populations.
