In this project the principal investigator will study systematically the zeros
of orthogonal Laurent polynomials (L- polynomials) related to strongly positive-
definite moment functionals. This study will parallel the study of the zeros of
classical orthogonal polynomials. In particular, the principal investigator will
look at the separation properties of the zeros and establish the connection
between the zeros and the spectrum of a natural representative of the
polynomials. She will also study the relationship between the zeros and the true
interval of orthogonality of the L-polynomials. The theory of classical
orthogonal polynomials is rich in mathematical content and in applications'
value to a host of problems in approximation theory, numerical analysis and
differential equations. In this the project the principal investigator will
attempt to construct an analogous theory for a class of generalized orthogonal
polynomials called Laurent polynomials. In particular, she will study the
properties of the zeros of such polynomials, in order to broaden the
mathematical theory of these objects and to explore exciting applications of
Laurent polynomials in approximation theory.//
