This award will support a detailed theoretical study of the mergers of dead
solar-type stars. Such mergers have recently been proposed as an important
channel for the production of supernovae explosions of the Ia type, which are
the most important probes of the expansion of the universe over cosmic time. The
research will use the CASTRO hydrodynamics code, and will model what happens
when two white dwarfs come into contact during the merger process. The
simulations will include a nuclear reaction network to determine whether it is
possible for an explosion to take place at the time of the merger. The mergers
will be modeled in the orbital (corotating) reference frame will minimize the
numerical error, maintaining angular momentum conservation throughout
coalescence. The simulation approach will be validated through rigorous testing
that will demonstrate the ability of the algorithm to maintain stable Newtonian
orbits. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award will also support the training of
students and early-career scientists in computational astrophysics. Codes from
this project will be widely distributed to the community. The project is also
expected to have a scientific impact by improving the understanding of supernova
progenitors.
