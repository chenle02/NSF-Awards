For the numerical approximation of partial differential equations (PDEs), a
balance is sought between the approximation properties (accuracy, consistency,
stability, etc.), the solution time (solver speed, implementation efficiency),
and robustness (scalability and applicability). To this end, the principle goal
in this proposal is to develop a high-order discretization framework amenable to
fast solution techniques in a multilevel setting. The application focus of the
proposal is motivated by two core problems: neutrophil chemotaxis in the blood
stream and cellular mechanics in microcirculation. Principally, these models are
governed by coupled anisotropic diffusion-convection-reaction equations and
coupled Stokes equations. The efficient and effective numerical solutions of
these complex equations is central to the proposed work. This includes the
development of an effective discontinuous least-squares spectral element method,
a comparison with popular strategies such as discontinuous Galerkin, and the
development of an integrated algebraic multigrid preconditioner for use with
high-order spectral elements in this situation. Ultimately, this work
establishes a theoretical and computation base for further research in
discontinuous least-squares methods and high-order preconditioning. Moreover, an
intrinsic element of this project is the integration of new methods in numerical
PDEs and iterative methods into the existing scientific computing curriculum to
help train future computational scientists.

As physical models grow in complexity and high-performance computing
environments grow in speed, so do the demands on the underlying mathematical
algorithms. The goal of this project is to make progress toward a more
generalized mathematical framework that encompasses more layers of the entire
simulation tool chain. Large-scale computational analysis is a critical
experimental component in many areas of the physical sciences and yet,
computational scientists are limited in their tool set. Olson proposes to
develop a multilevel approximation method for core applications, such as
cellular behavior in the blood stream, and to expand wider adaptation of new
methods in the field through outreach and education. The proposed research
methodology promotes conformity with the physics of the problem, allows for a
natural and extensible computational implementation, and yields an accurate and
efficient solution. This project will develop new steps for the multilevel
methodology, disseminate the computational tools to the broader scientific and
computing community, and train students and scientists on using these emerging
computational technologies.
