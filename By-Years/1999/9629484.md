9629484 McNutt This grant is to provide funds to hold a workshop that will
define the fundamental scientific questions in the "mid-plate" area of marine
geology and geophysics, where "mid-plate" is the part of the ocean basins
between the mid-ocean ridges and the margins. This workshop will prepare a white
paper that will be used as part of a larger marine geology and geophysics
planning effort. ***
