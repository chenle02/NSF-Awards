During the last twenty years statistical data and inference have played an
increasing role in establishing basic facts used in determining public policy,
e.g., estimating the prevalence of HIV infection, evaluating the risk of cancer
from occupational or environmental exposures, assessing changes in the income
distribution and in the legal environmental setting, especially in cases
concerning employment discrimination and school segregation. The purpose of the
project is to study statistical problems arising in these contexts and to
develop appropriate probability models and statistical methodology for their
solution. Robust methods which lead to statistically valid inferences when
several scientifically plausible models may underlie the data or when a few
observations may be erroneous are emphasized. Different approaches for assessing
the potential effect of an omitted factor and measurement errors on inferences
drawn from otherwise valid studies will be developed. The completion of this
project should establish the applicability of group testing to the
identification, quality control and confidential estimation of the prevalence of
a trait (such as the HIV virus) in a population or workforce. The successful
completion of the second task of the project, namely, the development of methods
for assessing the statistical bias resulting from omitted factors and
misclassification in surveys, could have a very important impact in the legal
and public policy setting as courts have claimed that even one error can justify
criticism of a statistical study. The principal investigator has already made
significant progress in unifying approaches used in various areas of application
and in assessing the seriousness of the possible error on the conclusions drawn
from a study.
