The Cultivating Diverse Talent in STEM partnership is developing the next
generation of "STEM innovators" by increasing the number and diversity of
exceptionally talented students who have access to interventions that accelerate
their learning. Specifically, this project is studying the potential of
innovative methods to identify gifted students in STEM, especially among
underserved Hispanic and Native American students in Arizona. This Prototype
project in the Identifying and Cultivating Exceptional Talent focal area
identifies students in their junior year and engages with them through their
senior year of high school.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Partnering with Sunnyside
Unified School District, Tuba City Unified School District, Greyhills Academy
High School, and Shonto Preparatory Technology High School, the University of
Arizona's BIO5 Institute and Colleges of Education, Pharmacy, and Science are
comparing methods to identify and nurture gifted students in STEM. Students who
have outstanding GPAs, convincing personal statements, and stellar teacher
recommendations (traditional method) are participating side-by-side with
students identified with an alternative method that assesses scientific
abilities through creative problem solving and concept
mapping.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students identified as exceptionally talented
through either method are being nurtured in a summer biomedical research program
and in school year activities in their schools and communities. To assess
students' success, the research team compares their attitudes, beliefs, and
behaviors prior to, throughout, and after participation in the program. The
project contributes knowledge to STEM education concerning how methods of
identifying exceptional talent limit or enhance access to opportunities that
nurture talent. It also provides insights into how students from different
backgrounds respond to research experiences in biology, toxicology, engineering,
and medicine.
