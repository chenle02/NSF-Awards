The investigator will develop field-deployable, inexpensive sensors to detect
deadly and pathogenic viruses, in general, and Zika virus as a specific example
to demonstrate feasibility. The proposed sensors will change their color when
they detect specific viruses without any need for recurring DNA sequencing and
amplification that requires time and are expensive for global deployment. Zika
virus is expected to re-emerge this summer in Latin America and affect our
cities such as Miami. The system can be adopted to detection of many other
viruses such as Ebola, Crimean Congo hemorrhage fever, and Lassa fever.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Polymerase chain reaction kits are currently
available to detect the ZIKV virus but are time consuming and cannot be deployed
in rural areas. The investigator is proposing to developing an aptamer hydrogel
with embedded complementary strands that attach to the surface proteins of the
ZIKV and absorbs them through its porous cavities causing the hydrogel to
undergo (100%) volume and (~30%) color change caused by its embedded 50 nm
diameter gold nano-particles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
