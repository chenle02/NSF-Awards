The proposal requests travel expenses for US researchers to participate in a
DELOS workshop on "Personalisation and Recommender Systems in Digital Libraries"
to be held at Dublin City University in Dublin, Ireland June 18-20, 2001. DELOS
is a major forum for and organizer of digital libraries research and planning
activities in Europe. It is funded by Information Societies Technologies (IST)
5th Framework Programme of the European Commission. This proposal seeks travel
support for six participants from the American research
community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop continues the planning and research
agenda put forward by the multi-year NSF-EU working groups' process jointly
sponsored by CISE/IIS, SBE/INT and the European Union. In the groups' final
report "An International Research Agenda for Digital Libraries", increased
levels of collaboration and interaction was seen as critical to building multi-
lingual, multi-national digital libraries.&lt;br/&gt;
