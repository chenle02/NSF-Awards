*** 96-61084 Sayanl This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I
project will investigate an optical correlator for tracking and identifying
objects in a cluttered or noisy field. Filter algorithms for improved signal to
noise and reduced rotation dependence will be developed and tested in the
optical correlator system with multiple in-class and out-of-class objects.
Commercial applications include manufacturing process control, automation
inspection, image analysis, and surveillance. ***
