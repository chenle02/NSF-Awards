The theme of Professor Zhu's mathematical research is to relate function theory
on certain higher-dimensional complex domains to the growth of certain operators
on spaces of functions analytic in these domains. The domains in question may be
thought of as solid objects whose points are located by several complex, rather
than real, numbers. Functions on the domain assign complex numbers to these
points, possibly in a rather noisy manner or, at the other extreme, with the
regularity and predictability of the analytic functions, which are given by
power series in the coordinates. The circumstance that intrigues mathematicians
is that essentially every function, no matter how noisy and badly behaved, has
an extremely well-behaved analytic part. This correspondence, which really has
to do with operators on spaces of functions, turns out to have important
applications in more or less concrete settings, for instance in the design of
feedback-stabilized control systems. The specific goals of the project relate to
the operators obtained by compressing or skew-compressing multiplication by a
function, called the symbol, to a distinguished space of analytic functions,
generally a Bergman space. Membership of the operator in various distinguished
classes (bounded, compact, Schatten classes) is to be characterized in terms of
properties of the symbol.
