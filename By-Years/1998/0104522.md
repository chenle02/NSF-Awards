Priority effects - influences of species already present in a community on the
successful colonization by later arriving species - are important during the
formation of ecological communities (community assembly). Because of increasing
habitat fragmentation, it is important to understand whether the influence of
priority effects can be generalized across locations. The proposed research
examines priority effects in a model system: insect and spider communities
inhabiting creosote bush in Arizona. Experiments will be conducted in two
habitat types (i.e., desert remnants and outlying desert areas) that previous
research found to differ in degree of fragmentation, diversity, recovery
following disturbance, and response to priority effects. Research will
investigate the influence of two predatory pioneer colonists on community
recovery and determine how long priority effects are detectable in community
assembly. This approach to community ecology will illustrate the importance of
initial conditions during species assembly that will be useful to restoration
ecologists working in fragmented habitats.
