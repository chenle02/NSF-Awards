The quality of engineering design is a critical factor in the competitive
success of industries. The new technology in computer-aided-design has improved
the support available to designers in some areas, but has made the lack of
fundamental understanding of engineering design more obvious and more critical.
A set of generalized tools and constructs will be developed for the design
process which can be specialized for any particular design domain. The research
will focus on the following areas: creating a design=
