Previous research led to the development of a piece of equipment, a transducer,
to directly measure dynamic force applied by gibbons and chimpanzees during
locomotion by brachiation. The transducer made it possible to determine that
gibbons use a unique mechanical strategy for conserving energy during high speed
brachiation. Coordinated exchange of two kinds of kinetic energy, translational
and rotational, is involved in this locomotor strategy. This newly discovered
mechanical exchange strategy appears to be a critical component of true
brachiation. The present project extends the previous research to quantify the
passive and active muscular factors that allow this critical energy exchange.
Using the same analytical techniques, the processes of acceleration and
deceleration in brachiation will also be studied. The white-handed gibbon will
be compared to the chimpanzee to determine the differences in detailed
functional capability and mechanical strategies employed by each species during
brachiation. The new understanding of the mechanical basis of brachiation that
will result from this project will permit the determination of the functional
limitations and critical design criteria that allow animals to utilize this mode
of locomotion. Comparison of the gibbon to the less specialized chimpanzee will
add detailed information on the factors responsible for the production of the
brachiation repertoire and its anatomical underpinnings. This is important for
the analysis of locomotion strategies in extant species, and also critical to
the evaluation of the functional capabilities of fossil remains.
