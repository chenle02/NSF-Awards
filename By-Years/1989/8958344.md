This multifaceted research project addresses issues in fluid dynamics, nonlinear
optics, coupled rigid body dynamics, and infinite dimensional dynamics. The
fluid dynamics work is related to transport and mixing phenomena which arise in
fluid flows due to chaotic advection. This effort will focus on two distinct
topics, specifically, feedback control of transport and mixing, and flows with
more general time dependence. The optics research deals with the polarization
dynamics of optical pulses propagating in nonlinear media. This work has
applications to fiber optical devices. The rigid body dynamics effort studies
the global dynamics of coupled rigid body dynamics systems with viscous damping
and external forcing. The intent of the final research topic is to bring the
geometrical theory of dynamical systems to bear on problems in infinite
dimensions.
