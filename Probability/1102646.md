This proposal deals with three topics in stochastic partial differential
equations (SPDE). The first question deals with uniqueness. Unless SPDE have
unique solutions, they are useless for modeling. Recent work by the proposer, L.
Mytnik, and E. Perkins settled a longstanding question about uniqueness of SPDE
related to the heat equation. Using these newly developed tools, the proposer
will attack uniqueness questions for other types of equations, and study
uniqueness among nonnegative solutions. The second question deals with traveling
waves, which occur widely in physical systems. Recently the proposer, L. Mytnik,
and J. Quastel have solved a problem raised by Brunet and Derrida, involving the
asymptotic speed of traveling waves when the noise term is small. The proposer
will would like to extend this analysis to other equations, and related particle
systems. The third topic involves stochastic wave equations. The most commonly
studied SPDE are variants of the heat equation, but others such as the
stochastic wave equation are receiving increasing attention. With D. Geba, the
proposer will like to study stochastic wave equations involving null forms.
Using some function spaces introduced by Bourgain, the proposer's goal is to
study short-time existence. The ideas developed should be relevant to other
classes of equations.

The field of SPDE is rapidly expanding. As technology moves towards the micro
level, the effect of random noise becomes more and more important. Since the
most important mathematical modeling tools we have are ordinary and partial
differential equations, the study of SPDE is becoming essential in many applied
fields. Even though SPDE is now several decades old, the area has only recently
received widespread attention. There is still a need for pioneering work to
establish a toolbox for the area. This proposal deals with three types of
problems in SPDE. The proposer believes that through the study of such specific
examples is the right way to generate methods and further our understanding, for
both theory and applications. In summary, the proposer believes that SPDE will
play an essential role in future applications of mathematics. He wishes to
develop the theory and help to train graduate students so that this area can
fulfill its potential.
