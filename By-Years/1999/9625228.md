9625228 Fischer This research proposal addresses a major bottleneck in the
transformation of design information to construction information: the lack of
computer-interpretable representations of construction methods that represent
the underlying assumptions behind a construction schedule, support the rapid
generation of construction schedules, and provide the information link between a
design and its construction plan. To support the rapid generation of schedules,
this research will develop and test strategies that support the generation of
schedules based on formal construction method models, and develop and test a
template that captures construction method information necessary to support the
schedule generation strategy. The educational objectives are to enable students
and practitioners to model underlying scheduling assumptions and not just the
schedule itself, and to teach students to model and consider the work of other
disciplines in the preparation of their discipline- specific schedules. ***
