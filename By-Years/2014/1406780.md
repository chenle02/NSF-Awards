Following up on a special issue of Science (August 2013) that identified several
Grand Challenges in Science Education, this project proposes a convocation to
more deeply explore those challenges that are particularly relevant for K-12
teachers and highlights the roles teachers can play on issues vital to the
improvement of K-12 STEM education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The convocation will:
(1) pull together the evidence base on whether involving teachers in education
policy and decision-making leads to improvements in policies; (2) identify the
models of teacher engagement at the national, state, and local levels that
currently exist; and (3) identify the kinds of communication efforts, resources
and other activities that are needed to help policymakers better understand the
role of teachers in these processes. The convocation addresses several important
and timely questions: (1) how to help teachers engage in important education
issues beyond their classrooms, and (2) what kinds of networks or mechanisms
might be identified to accomplish that
engagement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following the meeting, materials will be
developed that will be available both in hard copy and as PDF files from the
National Academies Press.
