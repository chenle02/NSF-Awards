9320149 COMAROFF, John COMAROFF, Jean This project will examine the various
forms of resistance that arose among black South Africans, and especially the
Southern Tswana peoples, in response to colonial overrule, 1830-1920; it will
also explore how these forms of resistance laid a basis for present-day
struggles toward democracy. The study, which will have a strongly comparative
focus, conceives of "resistance" as an ensemble of strategies, a continuum
ranging from everyday acts of refusal through dramas of alterity, carnivals of
terror, rebellions and social movements, to formal political organizations. In
exploring the conditions under which black South Africans have defied those who
rule them, and in describing the means by which they have done so, the study
seeks to answer a number of questions about the nature of resistance. In what
circumstances do disempowered peoples seek remedy and redress in the law? When
and why do they resort to other means, means either illegal or alegal? Do some
forms of insubordination encourage or preclude others? What is the role of
consciousness and intention in the motivation of protest--and in determining its
historical significance? Is it possible to move beyond a purely reactive view of
defiance to grasp the active cultural construction of its means and ends? How do
we understand the roles of social class, ethnicity, race, gender, and generation
in resistance? The investigation will involve the analysis of documentary
sources, supplemented by interviews, in Southern Africa and Britain. The product
will be a book, the third in a large-scale study of the social and political
effects of colonialism.
