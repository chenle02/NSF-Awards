9457305 Betti This project is a NSF Young Investigator Award. The subject of the
research is focused on bridge engineering analysis and design features,
including retrofitting concepts. Research will be directed towards analysis of
vibration control systems for long- span bridges, dynamic soil-structure,
interaction effects, non- destructive global testing, and evaluation. Techniques
for bridge damage detection and the analysis of corrosion processes. ***
