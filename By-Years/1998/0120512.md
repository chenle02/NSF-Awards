Numerical integrations will be performed to study the 2-day wave in a generally-
unstable mean flow. Modal period and structure and its amplification will be
calculated in the presence of zonal-mean structure representative of
observations. Those calculated features will then be compared with observed
space-time behavior of the 2-day wave. Finite amplitude considerations, leading
to transport and to interaction with other planetary waves, will be addressed in
fully-nonlinear integrations. Together with observed behavior, those
integrations will be used to evaluate the impact that 2-day wave nonlinearity
has on dynamical and chemical structure. The research outlined here promises a
unified understanding of the 2-day wave and its role in the general circulation
of the middle and upper atmosphere.
