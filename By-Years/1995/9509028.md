MCB 9509028 Gail Matters The project will initiate a study of blue-light
regulation of plant gene expression and begin to identify blue-light signal
transduction intermediates. The experimental system is based on the gene
encoding glutamate-1-semialdehyde aminotransferase, an enzyme which acts early
in the chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway. The project will identify promoter
regions involved in blue light regulated gene expression and may lead to further
studies on a factor(s) which interacts with these DNA sequences. In addition,
the project will examine potential blue light signaling compounds including
cAMP, cGMP, calcium, and calmodulin which are involved in signaling in higher
plants. %%% This project will identify mechanisms by which components within
cells interact in response to a stimulus such as exposure to light. ***
