The Tadjik Depression and the Pamir are tectonic features in Soviet central
Asia related to the northward penetration of the Pamir into the rest of Eurasia,
in front of India and at a rate of 20 to 30 mm/years. This is causing a westward
extrusion of material that, in turn, leads to east-west crustal shortening in
the Tadjik depression, accompanied by active seismicity and tilting. This
project allows international collaboration between U.S. Burtman, a Soviet Union
expert on the geology of central Asia, and this principal investigator for the
purpose of synthesizing the evidence for recent (late Cenozoic) deformation and
identifying the mechanics of how convergence in one area is transferred to
another area in these tectonic settings. This project is of considerable benefit
to both the Soviet Union and the United States, and is being jointly supported
by the Earth Sciences Division and INT.
