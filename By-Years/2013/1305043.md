The physical and dynamical processes that control, and at times constrain,
climate-hydrology connections over the Greater Horn of Africa (GHA) operate on
top of highly variable and constantly changing land use and vegetation cover
conditions. The central hypothesis of this project is that key mechanisms and
drivers of climate-hydrology-land use connections and associated hydro-climatic
variability and changes over the GHA can only be well understood through an
integrated process-based approach, employing a dynamically coupled climate-
hydrology modeling system. Under this support, multiple observation datasets
will be utilized to investigate historical climate events, especially droughts.
A comparison between an ensemble of coupled Weather Research and Forecasting
Model (WRF) simulations and a suite of Coordinated Regional Downscaling
Experiments (CORDEX) model simulations will be undertaken. The role of global
SST anomalies, change in Congo Air Mass, and changes in land use/cover
characteristics in extreme precipitation (droughts/floods) will be examined.
