Abstract Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital - Gilda Lugo Connection to NSFNET
Proposal No. NCR-9417153 This proposal for connecting the Santa Barbara Cottage
Hospital to the Internet will be introducing Internet as a new information
service and a major tool for enhancing communication. It will be used to
strengthen clinical programs and expand the hospital's effectiveness as a
Healthcare Center. A few of the programs strengthened by the Internet connection
include: physicians will be able to log information into clinical trials and
share more effectively in national trials; surgeons will have access to trauma
registries, medical images and worldwide consultation; administrators and
residents in the independent residency programs will have access to the AAMC
electronic residency application service; and the medical library will use
Internet for enhancing reference and document delivery services and
strengthening outreach. Access to the Internet will strengthen the ability of
Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital to function as a regional referral center and to
advance its role in education, research and the promotion of health.
