This project leverages advances in statistical learning theory, machine vision,
and massively parallel very-large-scale-integration technology to develop a
custom-trainable, versatile, self-contained, and mobile system for visually
impaired users. The system will aid the user in interacting freely with other
people and the environment, by rapidly detecting and localizing key visual
environmental cues and rapidly recognizing and identifying familiar people and
objects. At the core of the system is the "Kerneltron", a massively parallel
Support Vector "Machine" (SVM) in silicon. The SVM hardware will be trained on-
line by the end user to accommodate a variety of visual detection and
recognition tasks in everyday situations through presentation of examples. The
recognition core will be embedded in a portable prototype visual aid,
interfacing with a CCD camera front-end, and an audio synthesizer back-end.
Menu-driven keypad control will allow direct input and feedback from the user in
training and directing the system. The user interface will be based on
"OpenEyes", a wearable computer vision system for the blind. Proof of concept
demonstration of the hardware system and evaluation of the training and test
performance will be conducted with feedback from volunteer impaired
users.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
