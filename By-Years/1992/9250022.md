The Utah State Board of Education has approved the licensing of elementary
mathematics specialists and each institution in the state of Utah has been given
the opportunity to develop and submit a certification program for approval.
Weber State University seeks funds to develop this new program which will have
as its foundation the guidelines set forth in the Curriculum and Evaluation
Standards of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics and in the NCTM
Professional Standards for the Teaching of Mathematics. The program will be
developed in the mathematics department in collaboration with the College of
Education, and will include eight new courses: geometry, intuitive calculus,
probability and statistics, discrete mathematics, the use of technology, number
theory, problem solving, and a senior project. Technology will be integrated
throughout the program and modeled in the courses. An advisory group with
members from all the teacher preparation programs in the state will work with
Weber State University in the planning, implementation and dissemination.
Nationally recognized mathematics educator will serve as consultants and
advisors as well. The contribution of Weber State University accounts for 26% of
the funds requested from NSF.
