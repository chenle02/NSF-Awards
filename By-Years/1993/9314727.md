Benjamin Widom is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program to continue his work on the theory of fluids, phase
transitions and interfaces. Work is proposed in three specific areas of
research. In the first area of study, interfacial structure and interfacial
phase transitions will be studied in an effort to understand the nature of the
inhomogeneous region of contact between otherwise homogeneous fluid phases. In
these studies a theoretical model will be used which should illuminate the
connection, and resolve the differences, between two alternative and sometimes
discrepant points of view, that of free energy functional theory and that of an
interface displacement theory. The second area of study involves the coexistence
of periodically modulated (liquid crystal) phases, and the structure and
thermodynamics of the interface between such phases. A theoretical study will
trace the evolution of the scattering peak in the isotropic fluid in which there
is an incipient periodicity into a true delta function Bragg peak as the fluid
undergoes a second order transition to an ordered, liquid-crystalline state. The
third area of research involves the use of scaling theory to develop a model for
the electrophoresis of charged, long-chain polymers. The proposed study will
elucidate the interplay between the chain length of the polymer and the applied
electric field. In the everyday world, interfaces between fluid phases are
ubiquitous, yet very little is known about the details of the structure of the
interface or the processes which are going on at the interface. Widom's work
will provide molecular level insights on the spatial structure and
thermodynamics of those contact regions.
