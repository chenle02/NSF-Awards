Why do some new technologies "catch on" rapidly in one place but not another?
Economic and technological infrastructures of different localities may make a
difference, but the managerial behavior of the agents of innovation is also
relevant, as they contend with varying local social and political circumstances.
For a proper understanding of the development of new technologies in the United
States, it is critical that these differing factors be sorted out. Dr. Cooper is
studying in detail a specific case to help answer these questions. She is
examining the effect of American patent management on adoption of the eventually
predominant wood-planning machine during its patent period of 1828-1856, in five
different regions of the United States. She is gathering original Woodworth
planer patent assignment and litigation records to compare characteristics of
competing planing methods and the circumstances of early and peaceful adoption
with those of late and contentious adoption in New England, New York, Mid-
Atlantic, Mid-West and Southern regions. The reputedly "odious" behavior of
Woodworth planer assignees provoked a nationwide campaign to kill the twice-
extended patent. Dr. Cooper is analyzing the campaign's petitions to Congress in
order to identify the interest groups opposing and supporting the planer patent
in the various localities. Her study should improve our understanding of how the
patent system functioned in spreading innovations during the great period of
industrialization of production in the United States.
