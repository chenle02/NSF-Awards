Adams 9514678 Insect growth and development is associated with repeated shedding
of the old exoskeleton or cuticle in a process called ecdysis. The successful
performance of this complex behavior is crucial to the survival of developing
insects. It appears that a newly described novel endocrine system regulates
ecdysis in moths and may be important to this develomental process in all
insects. This novel endocrine system appears to produce multiple hormones. The
identification of these hormones is paramount to Dr. Adams' research endeavor.
Once these factors have been chemical identified, reagents will be prepared that
allow the localization and quantification of the hormones in the insect during
development. Finally, the site and mechanism of ecdysis-triggering hormone
action will be elucidated. This unique endocrine system provides opportunities
to study the hormonal regulation of development and behavior from the molecular
to the organismal level including information regarding the regulation of
hormone sythesis, release and physiological action. Furthermore, premature
administration of ecdysis-triggering hormone to early stages of larvae and pupae
is lethal, these hormones may prove to be of great commercial significance in
the biological control of insect pests.
