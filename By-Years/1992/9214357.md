The PIs will participate in the development of a new D-region measurement for
an existing, multipurpose radar system. This research instrumentation, called
the frequency-agile radar (FAR), is a recently developed system designed to
operate in a number of diagnostic modes. The new capability consists of a means
to obtain frequency-agile measurements of backscatter from the D-region.
Frequency-agile backscatter measurements will enable the PIs to characterize
(for the first time) the turbulence spectrum and its evolution as a function of
time. For this, SRI will develop a high-power, frequency-agile capability for
the FAR in the frequency range of 2 to 30 MHz. With other components to be
purchased, the PIs will participate in a number of new research areas.
