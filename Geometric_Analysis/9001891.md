The principal investigator will use his characterization of the Kobayashi
metric on smoothly bounded convex domains to study the asymptotic behavior of
this metric at a boundary. The ultimate goal is to solidify the relationship
between complex function theory on the domain and the geometry of the boundary.
In a second project he will study the global properties of contact structures on
manifolds of dimension three. Topological invariants of the contact structure
will be constructed analytically. Many of the most significant theorems in
geometric analysis relate geometric and topological invariants. One of the
earliest of these was the relationship between the total Gaussian curvature of a
smooth surface and its numbers of tubes and cross caps. In the present project,
the principal investigator will relate global Riemannian contact structures to
the base topology of the manifold.
