The objective of the proposed research is to establish a revolutionary new class
of vertical cavity photonic integrated circuits. The coupling between the
elements of a 2-dimensional array will be achieved by using defect engineering
within 2D photonic crystal lattices. Equally important, this research will
provide a new context to extend the understanding of microcavity physics as well
as the nano-fabrication techniques for novel optical materials. Therefore highly
dense, high performance 2D optical circuits for optical processing applications
or 2D optical interconnects (suitable for the chip level!) is a target of this
esearch. However, this research may also have major impact on high-performance
communication applications, such as for wavelength division multiplexing or
high-capacity photonic integrated circut for the next generation of
telecommunications.
