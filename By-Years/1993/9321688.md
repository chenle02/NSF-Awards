INT 93-21688 Hyden This dissertation enhancement grant supports a U.S. graduate
student enrolled at the University of Florida, Ms. Kimberly Lanegran, working
under the guidance of Dr. Goran Hyden, Professor of Political Science, to do
field research in South Africa. The project will study the role that South
Africa's Civic Association movement has played in hastening political reform and
nurturing norms of civic participation among previously disenfranchised black
South Africans. The research will focus case studies on three communities
(Lawaaikamp, Port Elizabeth, and Grahamstown) in the Eastern Cape, an area with
the longest history of politicization, which, however, has been relatively
neglected in research. The principal methods used will be interviews,
participant observation, and archival research. The candidate's research will be
linked to ongoing projects on Civic Associations that are being conducted at two
universities in other regions of the country. She will participate in workshops
organized by Dr. Tom Lodge at the University of Witwatersrand, in Johannesburg,
and will also be associated with Dr. Thomazile Botha's Local Government and
Planning Policy Research Project at the University of the Western Cape, in
Capetown. This study by a promising young researcher will be a valuable
contribution to comparative studies as well as to scholarship on South Africa.
It would illuminate the role that organizations of civil society play in the
emergence of democratic states in developing countries. The collaboration with
South African scholars will build professional relationships that can be expect
ed to endure throughout the individuals' careers. *** &amp; r t ! &amp; ! ! ! !
