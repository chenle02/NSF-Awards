Partial support is requested for the purchase of a visualization system,
consisting of (1) a copper vapor laser flash combined with a high speed ICCD
camera, and (ii) an infrared imaging system. The equipment will greatly improve
the PI's ability to study the basic mechanisms governing the interaction between
high powered laser beams and solid materials that are being processed (cutting,
drilling, shaping, welding, joining). A research program studying the cutting
and shaping of ceramics is under current NSF support, but the program suffers
from lack of diagnostic equipment. The requested high speed camera will permit
detection and quantification of debris in the plume, measurement of regression
of surface and re-deposition of debris, the onset and propagation of cracks and
formation and collapse of the keyhole. The infrared system will permit the
determination of temperature maps. Together, the equipment will constitute a
powerful tool for the study of laser-material interaction processes.
