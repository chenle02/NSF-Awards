Pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) is a critical conceptual tool for
distinguishing effective from ineffective teaching, but difficulty measuring it
has resulted in minimal application of the concept to enhance actual teaching
practice. This project will apply computerized lexical analysis techniques to
develop an efficient, valid and reliable measure of science teacher PCK - the
type of teacher knowledge that bridges content knowledge and how to effectively
teach the content in classrooms. This project will transform an instrument used
in multiple NSF STEM projects, but which is limited by being time and resource
intensive to score. Application of recent developments in lexical analysis will
allow measurement of PCK to be taken to scale with rapid feedback, and will be a
vital resource for STEM researchers, evaluators, PD providers, teacher
educators, and teachers themselves. This collaborative research project brings
together two teams with unique yet complementary expertise. BSCS researchers
have experience measuring PCK in multiple federal projects, and recently led an
international summit on STEM PCK. The Michigan State University Automated
Analysis of Constructed Response research group is working across STEM
disciplines to refine approaches to using lexical analysis for formative
educational purposes. Broader impacts of this project include developing a
measure that will be invaluable to multiple stakeholders in evaluating and
enhancing the understandings and abilities of K-12 science teachers. Enhancing
the capacity of K-12 teachers will help increase the numbers of underrepresented
students who pursue STEM careers, as well as expand the STEM workforce and
increase general scientific literacy.
