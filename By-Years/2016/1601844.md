Polynomials, and more generally rational functions (meaning ratios between two
polynomials), are used throughout science and engineering, since they are the
functions that are best understood. It turns out that most rational functions of
any given degree will behave similarly in almost every application. The goal of
this research project is to determine the special rational functions whose
behavior differs from this typical behavior. This will have important
applications in various areas of mathematics, as well as in science and
engineering. Much of the research will be carried out in collaboration with
junior mathematicians ranging from high school students to postdoctoral
researchers, thereby providing a rare opportunity for such junior mathematicians
to play a significant role in the proofs of important results. Several of these
junior mathematicians will be members of underrepresented
groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the proposed work is to determine all
possibilities for the essential geometric data describing the "shape" of the
function induced by a complex rational function, namely the monodromy group and
ramification type. This problem has been studied by Hurwitz, Ritt, Zariski,
Thompson, Guralnick, and other mathematicians, and it now seems possible to
solve it in case the rational function is not the composition of lower-degree
rational functions. A solution would resolve longstanding questions about
diophantine equations, dynamical systems, value distribution of meromorphic
functions, and several other topics.
