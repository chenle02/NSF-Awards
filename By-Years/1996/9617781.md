9617781 Jullig An international workshop on Constructive Programming will be
held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil to explore future directions in formal methods,
programming logics, and programming languages. The workshop will take place
November 4 to 8, 1996 and will combine 3 days of technical exchange with 2 days
of discussions to produce recommendations to the science funding agencies of the
U.S. and Brazil: NSF, CNPq, and FINEP. In recent years Brazilian researchers
have made significant contributions in constructive programming and related
areas, establishing a number of contacts with U.S. researchers. This workshop
will promote further collaborations and provide information and recommendations
for future research efforts and funding initiatives. ***
