Transport properties of disordered systems will be investigated. Three areas
will be considered--localization of classical waves, random walks on disordered
structures and the properties of random resistor networks. The primary tool in
carrying out this research is the renormalization group in several of its forms
although computer simulations and a variety of other theoretical methods will
also be employed. The research will relate to a variety of physical problems
including: the propagation of third sound on disordered substrates, relaxation
in glassy or frustrated systems such as spin glasses, and the conductivity and
breakdown properties of composite materials.
