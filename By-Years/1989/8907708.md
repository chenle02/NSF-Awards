Remote sensing and ground data from the largest storm in record and other storms
for the Southern California Bight will be combined with the chronicle of
coastline damages to better understand the processes involving hurricane-
generated waves and shoreline areas separated from deep ocean by islands. Radar
and satellite data will be used for the first time in the study of extreme wave-
land interactions. This knowledge will help in developing better mitigation
techniques and plans for coastline areas with off-shore islands.
