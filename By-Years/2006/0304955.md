3D shape matching, massive dataset visualization, and protein structure
prediction. The theoretical issues involve combinatorial geometry, algorithm
design and basic complexity theory. This effort is aimed at deriving new
computational methods for solving problems of a geometric or biological nature
that have resisted past investigations because of one two reasons: either the
input data is too massive to be processed directly and it can only be "sampled"
cleverly or the number of variables is itself so high that standard methods
suffer from an exponential blowup&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;in the time it takes to
run them. New dimension reduction techniques are needed to resolve this
bottleneck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
