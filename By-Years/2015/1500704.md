Analysis of operators and inherent phenomena of noncommutativity have been
developing in response to refinement of physical models of the world as well as
to advancement of other sciences and technology. This project is devoted to open
problems in operator theory that arise in mathematical physics, noncommutative
analysis and geometry, and the theory of single-variable and multivariate
operator functions. The project is also designed to strengthen connections
between several areas of mathematics, contribute to general education, and
enhance student research.

The proposed topics include establishing properties of operator functions with
noncommuting arguments that are similar to classical properties of the
respective scalar functions, understanding the impact of perturbations on
spectral subspaces of operators, and studying the structure of elements
belonging to operator algebras. The essence of the proposed research consists in
developing innovative methods for handling different effects of noncommutativity
that appear in the problems, and beyond. Such methods are expected to emerge
from subtle synthesis of various techniques in analysis and operator theory.
