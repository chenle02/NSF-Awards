Funds are provided for the purchase of a high temperature axialtorsion fatigue
system. This equipment will substantially enhance experimental efforts in a
multitude of research areas including; fatigue and fracture of composite
materials, life prediction, crack propagation and structural integrity of
propulsors. The complex state of stress that is created in this system is
important in evaluating the creep-fatigue response of many materials.
