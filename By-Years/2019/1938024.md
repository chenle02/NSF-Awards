My Science Tutor (MyST) is an intelligent virtual tutor for elementary school
students that has been developed over the last 10 years, with over 13,000 spoken
dialog sessions in 8 areas of science. Its goal is to assess student
understanding of concepts rather than facts, which is very important to prepare
students and the future workforce in STEM. This early-stage, exploratory EAGER
project seeks to determine whether the analysis of a new corpora of data could
advance the development and use of MyST so that teachers, curriculum developers
and researchers could more easily develop automated assessments for new science
topics.

The approach will apply recent advances in deep learning techniques to assess
students' conceptual understanding of science during spoken dialogs with the
virtual tutor. The project is motivated by the recent availability of a corpus
of examples suitable for training and testing the proposed system. Successful
outcomes of the proposed research will result in a novel, robust and portable
method for extracting semantic representations from student responses and
comparing these to reference statements to determine if conceptual relationships
are correctly expressed. The approach has the potential to remove the primary
impediments to developing dialog-based assessments: grammar development or
topic-specific training. This novel and untested approach is high-risk, but if
successful, would have high-payoff, by allowing tutorial developers to only need
to provide one example statement for each concept being discussed rather than
having to explicitly specify all allowable ways that it could be expressed
through development of grammars. This in turn could remove barriers to
widespread development of spoken dialog systems and develop automated
assessments for new topics using little or no training data.
