Mitochondria are the "power house" of the cell and are responsible for more than
80% of the energy our cells need to function. Their demonstrated role in human
disease, and their implied role in neurodegenerative conditions in advanced age
makes them particularly relevant given the demographic realities of our society.
The low variation within the mitochondrial DNA of most systems limits their
power to detect the role of mitochondria in determining host fitness.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drs Ballard and Katewa propose to study mitochondrial
metabolism in a model species with high mitochondrial DNA variation. The
proposal links population genetics theory with the modeling approach and
hypotheses developed by the aging community to study whether the mitochondrial
genotype, or mitonuclear interactions influence mitochondrial metabolism in the
fly Drosophila simulans. Completion of these studies will make significant
contributions to the understanding of the genetic and biochemical mechanisms
underlying mitochondrial influences on oxidative metabolism in animals,
including humans. The study will result in the mentoring of female undergraduate
and graduate students, and a postdoctoral researcher. Results from the studies
will be published in peer-reviewed journals, and additional relevant information
will be presented on the laboratory homepage.&lt;br/&gt;
