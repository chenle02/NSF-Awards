Dinoflagellates are distinctive among eucaryotes in several ways, one being
that their chromosomes are thought to be permanently condensed except during DNA
synthesis or fertilization. This investigation will employ molecular techniques
(chromosome isolation, restriction enzyme digestion of the chromosomes and
cloning of the released DNA fragments, Southern blot hybridization, in situ
hybridization, autoradiography) to demonstrate that genetically active DNA is
found in extrachromosomal filaments, not in the bulk or structural DNA. Once the
techniques are developed, dinoflagellates from different from different extremes
of a proposed evolutionary lineage will be examined and compared, as will the
resting cysts of these species. The similarities between vegetative cells and
cysts (which must retain low level metabolic activity while protecting their DNA
from degradation during prolonged dormancy) should provide valuable insights
into adaptive mechanisms that might relate to the unique chromosome structure of
modern dinoflagellates. This fellowship award will allow Dr. Anderson to
accomplish the research and training at the Laboratory Arago of the University
of Paris in France. The motivation for an extended stay at this lab is to learn
cell and molecular biological techniques from colleagues who have strong ongoing
programs focused on the dinoflagellates - an ecologically and evolutionarily
important class of marine algae that has been the focus of Dr. Anderson's
excellent research. The vehicle for this training and transfer of technology
will be a project examining the unique manner in which dinoflagellates package
and transcribe genetic information, both as vegetative cells and as resting
cysts. This project is of fundamental scientific importance on its own but also
to allow Dr. Anderson to learn new concepts and tools that can be incorporated
into his ongoing research program, which focuses on the physiological ecology of
toxic phytoplankton.
