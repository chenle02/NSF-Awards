This is a SBIR Phase I project. The goal of this research is to explore the use
of object-oriented database management systems (ODBMS) for storing biological
information and to demonstrate the potential benefits of ODBMS over existing
biological databases using the relational model. A prototype implementation in a
commercial ODBMS will be built to test performance using sample data from
existing databases, such as GDB, GenBank and GenInfo. The software developed for
the Phase I is expected to serve as an executable prototype specification for
SBIR Phase II development.
