Otterbein College will integrate computer modeling and computational methods
into the advanced courses of the physics curriculum and on-line data acquisition
and analysis into experimental laboratories. Integration of these techniques
with the advanced courses require on- site computer equipment for illustrative
demonstrations, computational experiments and problem solving, and the
acquisition and analysis of data. The equipment necessary to implement this
expansion of the physics curriculum consists of 1) a computer physics work
station and associated software; and, 2) an experimental physics laboratory work
station with interface devices suitable for the diversity of instruments found
in an advanced undergraduate laboratory. The acquaintance with current practices
of working physicists provided by the equipment requested will give students a
first-hand knowledge of all aspects of computer use as a physics research tool.
