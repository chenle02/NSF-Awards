PROPOSAL NO.: DMS - 9500924 PROPOSAL TITLE: Problems in Linear Analysis PI/PD:
Leiba Rodman CO-PI/PD: Hugo J. Woerdeman ABSTRACT The principal investigators
plan to study a variety of interconnected problems in a highly active area of
research in Mathematical Sciences that involves operator theory, matrix
analysis, and their applications in science and technology, using also closely
related areas of pure and applied mathematics: function theory, Fourier
analysis. In addition to continuing work on other topics, specific problems are
outlined in the following subjects which are the main focus of the research: 1.
Interpolation problems for matrix and operator valued functions; 2. Completions
of finite and infinite matrices and operators; 3. Riccati equations; 4. Krein
space operators; 5.Applications. The principal investigators strive to develop
new results that can be proved in an abstract mathematical context (e. g., in
terms of *-algebras), and that at the same time yield new and useful information
in various more specific settings. The principal investigators plan to relate
the newly obtained abstract results to the original areas of application.
Applications that are emphasized in the proposal include Advanced Manufacturing
(engineering control systems) and High Performance Computing and Communications
(tomography), which have been identified as two of the strategic areas with
impact on national need. Other areas of relevant application are: engineering
control systems, optics of polarized light, kinetic energy minimization in
quantum chemistry, diffraction of waves, signal processing, and pattern
recognition. Interactions with many researchers in different fields
(mathematics, computer science, engineering), various countries besides the U.
S. (Canada, The Netherlands, Italy, Israel, Norway, France, United Kingdom), and
scientists in industry and government (the National Institute of Health, NEC
Research Institute) are planned and form an integral part of this project.
