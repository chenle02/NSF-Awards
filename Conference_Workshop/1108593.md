This award supports travel for participants in the Workshop on Stochastic
Analysis in Finance and Insurance, held 17-20 May 2011 at the University of
Michigan, Ann Arbor. The workshop brings together researchers in stochastic
analysis and financial and insurance mathematics, in order to survey the state
of the art of stochastic analysis in finance and insurance, to exchange ideas,
and to forge new directions of research. The conference topics include optimal
stochastic control, stochastic portfolio theory, market microstructure and
interest-rate modeling, backward stochastic differential equations, stochastic
mortality risk, pricing/hedging equity-linked insurance products, optimal risk
sharing, contract design, and investment with annuities, and risk management for
insurance firms.

The workshop features twelve plenary talks by senior researchers and eight
invited talks by junior researchers. The meeting includes a panel discussion
focused on the current needs of financial and insurance mathematics, as well as
the relationship between the academic research and practical applications.
Panelists will identify open problems in the field and lead a discussion of open
problems and new directions for the field. The workshop will enhance
communication among junior and senior researchers in stochastic analysis in
finance and insurance. The conference encourages and supports participation by
graduate students, junior researchers, and members of under-represented groups.
