This awards helps support the 2011 Graduate Climate Conference workshop from
October 28-30, 2011 at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute. Specifically, the
award provides support to approximately ten students for travel, housing,
conference fees, and other costs incidental to participating in the two day
climate science conference.

This graduate student organized conference is now in its fifth year and is a
good venue for early career scientists to exchange ideas, formally and
informally, on climate research and to foster interdisciplinary interactions.
The general science topics planned for the meeting include paleoclimatology,
atmosphere/ocean dynamics, biogeochemical cycles, the cryosphere,
clouds/aerosols, climate forcing and feedbacks, and the biosphere. A unique
feature of this year's conference is the attendance of advanced undergraduate
science students. The abstract for all presentations made at the conference will
be published online at MIT and archived for two years.
