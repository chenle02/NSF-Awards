This project is a collaborative research effort between Northwestern University
(NWU) and the University of Wisconsin (UW) on the effect of material fracture
properties and fracture energy to the safety margins of a concrete dam. This
comprehensive laboratory test program and the associated finite element analysis
of test specimens with interelement cracks will fill a major knowledge gap
concerning evaluation of dam safety. Theoretical investigation and small scale
testing will be done at NWU and the large scale testing will be done at UW.
Throughout the project period researchers at both institutions will work as a
team towards theory development, fracture property determination, tests of
specimens, evaluation and analysis. This study will make significant
contributions to crack initiation and propagation in concrete dams and will
advance the basic understanding of the fracture processes and of dam behavior.
