This project investigates polynomials and the geometric shapes they define,
called algebraic varieties. The problems belong to the field of mathematics
called algebraic geometry. Algebraic geometry has many applications throughout
industry and national security, including to error-correcting codes, machine
learning, cryptography, computer aided design, and 3D printing. Some of these
applications are concerned with studying the sets where polynomials are zero
module certain prime numbers, the particular focus of this project. This project
is basic research into understanding the singularities of algebraic varieties
defined over finite fields, including criteria for understanding how far the
varieties are from being smooth, and techniques for circumventing the failure of
smoothness in some cases. The project includes research designed to be student-
ready to provide training for the next generation of mathematicians.

In more precise terms, the project investigates strong F-regularity in several
contexts in non-commutative algebra, combinatorics, and birational algebraic
geometry. It investigates whether or not, for a strongly F-regular local ring R
of prime characteristic, the algebra A of R-linear endomorphisms of F*R, where F
is the Frobenius map, is a non-commutative resolution of singularities in the
sense of Van den Bergh. In addition, a theory of derived functors of
differential operators will be investigated, with an eye toward using it to show
that rings of differential operators over fields of characteristic zero can be
reduced to characteristic p under some conditions. Finally, building on recent
work in valuation rings, the project aspires to show that certain section rings
of varieties are always finitely generated, an important step in the minimal
model program in characteristic p.
