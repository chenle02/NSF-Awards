This proposal explores transport phenomena and dynamics of solidification in
mushy zones of metal alloys. The approach employs both modelling and
experimentation on the flow of interdendritic liquid through solid networks.
Emphasized are high liquid fractions greater than 0.65% by volume and the
associated convective flow. The goals are to determine permeability and
correlate it with a microstructural length scale and the volume fraction liquid.
Permeability for columnar and equiaxed structures are determined by simulating
tortuous flow through actual dendritic networks that are documented by image
analysis of the cast structures. The modelling makes use of finite element
modelling codes. %%% This research provides an approach to obtaining
permeability values needed for the modelling of dendritic solidification
processes. Modelling is important for understanding solidification processes and
minimizing macrosegregation in castings.
