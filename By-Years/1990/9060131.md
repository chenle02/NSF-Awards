Timbers used in a marine environment are generally treated chemically to prevent
attack by marine borers. These techniques suffer from partial success and offer
environmental hazards. A novel composite material is proposed which promises to
significantly advance the state of the art for protecting wooden structures from
the ravages of marine borers, as well as fouling organisms in general. The new
system will provide for a significantly strengthened covalent bonding between
the cellulosic wooden substrate and a tough, polymeric protectant layer. The
proposed technology is also attractive since it involves only environmentally
compatible components, and will be easy to apply.
