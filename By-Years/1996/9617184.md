Allison 9617184 This effort will place a centerpiece display in the Science and
Technology wing of the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American
History (NMAH). It is in this section of the museum that the role of science-
based technology in the history of the United States is displayed and explained.
A Cray 2 supercomputer and a very large screen display of scientific
visualizations will be used as a "draw" for this area. This would he a lead-in
to the ongoing exhibit entitled "Information Age: People, Information, and
Technology". Much of the visually displayed material will be drawn from the
scientific results generated at the NSF supercomputer Centers. With the
expansion of the Centers Program to include all the expected that the efforts in
science and engineering results from an even wider array of sources will be able
to supply many topically up to date displays for the foreseeable future.
