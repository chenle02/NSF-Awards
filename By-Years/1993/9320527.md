9320527 Bergstrom Economists usually assume that people are completely selfish,
though when pressed, we are usually willing to admit that parents seem to love
their children and perhaps each other. This research develops evolutionary
models of human behavior to guide an understanding about the amount and type of
benevolence and conflict to be expected between siblings, between parents and
offspring and among other relatives. The research draws on the literature of
evolutionary biologists and cultural anthropologists to motivate the development
of the economic models. As has been observed by evolutionary biologists,
individuals whose genes tell them to be generous to their relatives are likely
to be beneficiaries of actions by relatives who share copies of the same genes.
The same kind of reasoning that applies to genetic evolution can be applied to
the evolution of culture and learned behavior. Much as we have biological
parents and biological siblings, we also have "cultural siblings"--those who
learned their behaviors from the same role models as ourselves.This research
project explores the logic of evolution as applied to genetically and culturally
determined behavior towards ones relatives and neighbors. The study pays
particular attention to the question of how much unselfish cooperation we would
expect to see, given the evolutionary history of our species. ***
