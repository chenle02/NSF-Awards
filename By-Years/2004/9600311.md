9600311 McFadden The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables U.S.
scientists and engineers to conduct three to twentyfour months of research
abroad. The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the
use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions
abroad. This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research visit for
Dr. Christopher F. McFadden to work with Professor Nicholas D. Spencer at the
Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, Switzerland. This project will
focus on investigating the ability of chiral adsorbed organic species to provoke
the formation of screw dislocations in a metal overlayer. The objective is to
characterize via various surface spectroscopies, the structure of metals
deposited onto chiral organic substrates. The hope is to produce heterogeneous
catalysis materials selective for the synthesis of chiral molecules. ***
