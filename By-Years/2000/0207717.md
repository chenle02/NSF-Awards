Understanding of orogenesis and its relations to mantle convection and plate
tectonics relies on integrated studies of the interrelations among processes of
deformation, metamorphism and magmatism. A well preserved portion of the
northern Appalachian orogen is providing an outstanding laboratory for a truly
integrative study of the evolution of mid-crustal processes that strongly
influence orogenesis. This project is employing structural, microstructural,
petrologic and thermobarometric analyses, and chemical and isotopic dating, to
temporally and spatially link deformation, metamorphism and magmatism during the
progressive growth of this orogenic belt. This information is being used to set
constraints and boundary conditions on coupled, 3-D thermal/mechanical models
that, in tandem with the geological observations, are being used used to gain
insights into the orogen's evolution and associated plate dynamics.
