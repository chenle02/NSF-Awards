9500338 Yanai This award provides support for a broad range of topics related to
the dynamics of large- scale atmospheric motions in the tropics, with particular
emphasis on the interannual and intraseasonal variabilities of those motions.
Three main topics will be examined in diagnostic studies are: (1) the effect of
processes such as snowmelt and moist and dry convection on the evolution of
sensible heating over the Tibetan Plateau and nearby land areas, (2) the
mechanisms responsible for the so-called 40-60 day (Madden-Julian) oscillation
in the tropics as well as for oscillations triggered by tropical-extratropical
interactions, and (3) the interaction of cumulus convection with large-scale
motions on intraseasonal time scales. The various projects will employ a variety
of data sets including analyses from the European Centre for Medium Range
Forecasts and observations from the recent Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere -
Coupled Ocean Atmosphere Response Experiment (TOGA-COARE). The principal
investigator, Dr. Yanai, is a well-respected diagnostician in the field of
atmospheric dynamics with a distinguished track record. This project is jointly
supported by the Climate Dynamics and Large-scale Dynamic Meteorology Programs.
