The diagenesis of deeply buried quartz arenite sandstones is important in the
evolution of sedimentary basins, including paleohydrology and thermal history
and the transition from high grade diagenesis to low grade matamorphism. The
primary aim of petrographic study will be to measure quantitatively cementation
by quartz and carbonate, pressure solution (geometry of grain contacts, timing
and extent of chemical compaction), and porosity loss as a function of pressure,
temperature and integrated time- temperature history. Samples will be examined
by petrographic microscopy, cathodo-luminescence and SEM, as well as by some
chemical and istotopic analyses. The diagenetic history will be reconstructed
and set in the context of burial and thermal history. Pressure solution will be
one of the main focuses, especially as it pertains to the transition between the
high grade diagenesis of deep burial and the low grade metamorphism of parts of
deformed mountain belts. Sandstones to be sampled include the Pennsylvanian of
the Green River basin, Pennsylvanian and Ordovician of the Anadarko basin, and
Cambrian of the Michigan and Illinois basins. Now uplifted undeformed and
deformed sections of the Pennsylvanian of Pennsylvania will be compared with the
Rhode Island Pennsylvanian and the Silurian Clough quartzite of New Hampshire.
The oldest sandstones will be of Proterozoic quartz arenites from a well-studied
section of Spitsbergen. This study has practical significance in the loss of
porosity of quartz arenites at great depths (4-9km), which influences the mass
transfer of fluids and thus production of oil and, especially, gas.
