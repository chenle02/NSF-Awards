Arkansas College has created a computing laboratory consisting of a network of
nine microcomputers located in the experimental physics laboratory, and the
created a new experimental physics curriculum for first and second-year science
majors. The goal of these laboratories is to teach experimental physics and
computer use in science concurrently by use of a thematic curriculum with
special emphasis on the study of oscillatory and resonant systems using computer
interfaced sensors. Most important physical laws apply to oscillators, so the
narrowing of breadth in the course is minimal, while the depth has been greatly
increased. The laboratory exercises used have been chosen in this way to focus
the students attention on confirmation, analysis, and interpretation of results;
therefore, we have eliminated many standard laboratory exercises which served
only to demonstrate the correctness of material covered in the lecture.The
motivation for this approach lies in the faculty's belief that teaching the
experimental method in science is a most important task, and therefore the
laboratory should not merely be used to support the teaching of theory. Students
must be able to observe and experience physical phenomena in a way that develops
and enhances both their senses of observation and their reasoning ability. The
students use the computers to collect and analyze data, perform error analysis
on the data, prepare graphical presentations of their results, compare their
results with software simulations of the experiments and with calculations based
on theory, and prepare their laboratory reports.
