The primary goal of this conference/workshop is to enable graduate students,
postdocs, early career scientists, and experts in other branches of astronomy to
learn about established and emerging techniques for single-dish radio astronomy
and their applications. The workshop program consists of an extensive series of
lectures given by experts in the field and hands-on experiences with the Green
Bank and Arecibo telescopes. In addition to covering the fundamentals of radio
astronomy and radio telescopes the school also encompasses topics of great
interest to early career scientists such as proposal writing, data analysis
techniques, and discussion of future instrumentation. The majority of the
requested funding will go towards Participant Support and will cover travel
costs for students to attend the meeting.
