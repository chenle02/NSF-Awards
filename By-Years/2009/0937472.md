The primary goal of this research is to explore new methodologies that support
building reliability into the design of software product families. This enables
a sufficient formal foundation to compare design alternatives early and
throughout the software development. There are several notable challenges, among
them the unsuitability of existing reliability modeling approaches for product
families due to their inability to handle architectural change and leverage
reuse effectively. The relationships and dependencies among products within the
family further complicate the matter. The project will: 1) Extend existing
(primarily) structural product line architecture modeling and analysis
approaches with rich behavioral constructs, and corresponding analyses; 2)
develop architecture-based approaches to reliability modeling of software
product families; 3) research the interactions between different products
reliabilities within a family of software products; 4) develop a decision
support system that embodies these principles to compare alternative design
choices based on their impact on the reliability of specific products, as well
as the reliability of other products within the family. Evaluation of the
methods will be performed in collaboration with NASA/JPL to demonstrate broader
impacts.
