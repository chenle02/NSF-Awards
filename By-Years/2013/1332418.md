Diagenetic processes in sedimentary deposits play a central role in the cycling
and burial of biogeochemically reactive elements. The activities of marine
benthos dramatically impact early diagenesis, altering material transport and
reaction distributions in surface sediments and sediment-water exchange on
scales of microns to centimeters. In this project, researchers at SUNY Stony
Brook will continue to develop and use innovative transparent sensor foils to
track in situ redox reactions associated with O2, Mn, N, Fe, S, and C, measure
exoenzyme activity, and quantify carbonate dissolution to advance predictive,
mechanistic-based understanding of biogenic effects on biogeochemical cycles.
Results from this study will advance fundamental understanding of biogeochemical
processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This project will provide
scientific training to high school, undergraduate, and graduate students,
including those from a diversity of underrepresented groups. Results from this
study will be shared with fellow scientists and the general public, increasing
knowledge about the seafloor processes.
