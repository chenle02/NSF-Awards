Abstract Bunimovich

The proposal deals with the properties of finite- and infinite-dimensional
dynamical systema. Both topological and ergodic properties are addressed. The
systems under study include nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equations,
lattice dynamical systems (in particular, coupled map lattices), lattice gas
cellular automata, billiards and the systems of interacting particles. The broad
approach will be used that combines methods of the ergodic theory, the theory of
nonuniformly hyperbolic dynamical systems and the theory of bifurcations.

Most of the questions that will be addressed in this proposal have their origin
in statistical physics, geometrical optics, hydrodynamics and biology and were
transformed into the mathematical form by the principal investigator with
collaborators. The new applications under study address the dynamical systems
which naturally appear in manufacturing, especially in the dynamics of
production lines. The application of ideas and methods of dynamical systems
allowed already to increase production rates of such lines e.g. in the apparel
industry. The major effort will be made now in the analysis of reentrant
manufacturing systems which deal e.g. with the production od the semiconductors.
