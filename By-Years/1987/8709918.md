High-field nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy enables chemists to
study the structure of molecules in a non-destructive manner. Instrumentation of
the type needed to make NMR measurements enhances the research environment of
the department involved. The Department of Chemistry at Furman University will
purchase a high-field NMR spectrometer with multinuclear broad band capabilities
with support from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program. The instrument
is needed by members of the Chemistry Department for research in the following
areas of chemistry: 1) metal olefin bonding 2) solid phase synthesis of
glycopeptides 3) uncatalyzed hydromagnesiation of carbon multiple bonds 4)
thermal and photochemical behavior of amino acid complexes of Cr(III) and
Rh(III) This NMR spectrometer will be a significant addition to the Department's
instrumentation capabilities, enhancing both current and future research
efforts. The instrument's acquisition will also have a dramatic impact on
Furman's continuing efforts to attract the very best students to careers in
chemistry (over the past five years, 48% of the Department's undergraduates have
gone on to chemistry graduate school, with 41 Furman students presently in Ph.D.
programs).
