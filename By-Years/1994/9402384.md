9402384 MARCUS This award supports the Engineering Research Center at the
University of Maryland and the Harvard University to focus on the integration
and control of complex engineering system for the next five years. The Center
will use and expand its well-established industrial collaboration programs to
facilitate the rapid transfer of developed system methodologies. This will be
achieved through three cross-disciplinary thrust areas: 1) intelligent control
systems which involves the design of robust control systems with many sensors
and many feedback loops using algorithm and tools for optimization-based design,
2) intelligent signal processing and communication system which involves the
modelling, design, and control of wireless and high- speed communication
networks, 3) system integration methodology which involves model complexity,
architectures for control, and communication systems. In addition, there are
three demonstration projects: (1) electromechanical motion control prototyping
project which will develop basic research and engineering innovation needed to
build high-performance, low-cost, motion control system, (2) wire- less
multimedia shop communication project which will develop the research and
technology for designing multimedia communication subsystems for manufacturing,
(3) virtual factories for electro- mechanical devices manufacturing project
which will develop an integrated tool kit for design, planning, and
manufacturing of electromechanical devices. This award provides support for the
ERC for three years. ***
