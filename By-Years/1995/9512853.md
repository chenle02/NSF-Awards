9512853 Galligan This Americas Program award will support collaborative research
between Dr. James Galligan, University of Connecticut, and Dr. Arkady Krokhin,
Universidad Autonoma de Puebla, Mexico. The objective is to provide a new and
basic approach to the fundamental problem of relating the interaction of
electrons to defects in metal crystals. The research will involve experiments
designed to measure and delineate the interaction of electrons with
dislocations. Theoretical analyses of the experimental results will follow. This
project will help to extend our understanding of how a material plastically
deforms, providing fundamental information on microscopic aspects of plasticity.
Experimental results will be obtained using a Superconducting Quantum
Interference Detector (SQUID) at the University of Connecticut to measure the
alteration of energy states of electrons. These results will then provide the
basis for calculations to be carried out by Dr. Krokhin's group in Mexico. *** .
