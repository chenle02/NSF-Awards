With this grant in the Theoretical and Computational Program of the Chemistry
Division, professor Hase will use computer simulation to study chemical dynamics
at a microscopic level. The results of these simulations will help
experimentalists estimate the rates of important chemical reactions. Different
methods will be tested for treating zero point energy in classical trajectory
simulations of polyatomic molecules. This will involve, in part, comparisons
with quantum dynamical calculations. The theory of unimolecular reaction
dynamics will be enhanced by investigating (1) the properties of wave functions
and rate constants associated with mode specific decomposition; (2) energy
partioning in dissociation products; and (3) the treatment of anharmonicity and
vibrational/rotational coupling for microcanonically excited molecules.
Microscopic properties of association reactions such as energy transfer pathways
and the role of angular momentum will be studied, and an accurate model will be
developed for the association rate constant. To bridge the gap between solution
and gas-phase chemical kinetics, the association of solvated reactants will be
studied. A study of phase space bottlenecks and central barrier recrossing will
be performed for SN2 nucleophilic substitution reactions.
