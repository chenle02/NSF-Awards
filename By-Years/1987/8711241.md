The pineal gland is a small organ in the brain which releases a chemical
(hormone) into the blood which in turn influences the reproductive system, i.e.,
sperm production in males and ovulation in females. The amount of hormones the
pineal gland produces depends on the day/night cycle; more darkness an animal or
human witnesses the larger quantity of the pineal hormone produced. The pineal
hormone of special interest in these studies is melatonin. Besides the
light/dark cycle, environmental temperature may also change either the quantity
of pineal melatonin. The purpose of the current studies is to examine how light
(and darkness) and temperature control melatonin actions on the reproductive
system. The experiments will utilize an animal, the Syrian hamster, whose pineal
is very sensitive to light/dark and temperature changes. Male and female
hamsters will be examined. Also, the pineal hormone melatonin will be injected
into hamsters kept under different environmental conditions and its actions will
be measured. Finally, the amount of melatonin produced in the pineal gland and
released into the blood will be determined. The results of these studies will
provide information on how the environment influences reproduction biological
rhythms and other functions in mammals including man.
