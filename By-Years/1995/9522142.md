9522142 Gann The Japanese building and construction industry is one that is
competitive with the U.S. industry, both in size and capability. The U.S. last
reviewed the status of the Japanese industry in 1990. The Japanese industry was
then seen as more progressive than that in the U.S. and likely to become even
more so in several ways. A team of experts from industry, academia, and research
laboratories will review innovative construction projects and construction-
related R&amp;D activities at government and company research institutes;
construction materials and new capabilities facilitated by new materials;
construction field operation &amp; automated equipment; building mechanical,
control and safety systems; types &amp; design of structural systems; computing
and information sharing in design and construction technologies related to
environmental protection and energy conservation. Within these areas, the report
will focus on the innovation process.
