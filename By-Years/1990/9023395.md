The goal of this research is to establish a new method for nonlinear compliance
control using neural nets to explore new possibilities in machine learning and
control for robots and telemanipulators. Here, compliance is treated as
nonlinear mapping from a measured force to a corrected motion and is represented
by a multi-layer neural network, as well as by Gaussian networks. The objectives
of the proposed research are three-fold. One is to develop a new method for
representing "compliance" to deal with highly nonlinear, such as by stiffness
and damping matrices. The second objective is to develop a learning methods for
the generation and teaching of compliance, or force feedback strategies. The
neural network approach allows us to teach a desired compliance from teaching
data acquired from a human operator. It does not need explicit feedback laws and
detailed task models such as those required for conventional analytic methods.
It is hoped that the new approach will also allow us to transfer human skill in
compliant motion control to robots and telemanipulators. The third objective of
the proposed project is to develop a real-time, neural net controller that is
involved directly in the feedback loop of robot control system. Efficient
methods must be developed to analyze and design the nonlinear feedback system in
order to accomplish smooth, stable responses. To achieve these goals, three
subprojects will be conducted. Their objectives are to: 1. Establish a
theoretical basis for the neural net representation of nonlinear compliance. 2.
Develop techniques for acquiring teaching data, Processing the data, and
training a neural network for learning a compliance, and 3. Develop a design
method for real time, neural net feedback control in order to accomplish
desirable dynamic response.
