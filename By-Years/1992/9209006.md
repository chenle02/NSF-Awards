Analytical and computational studies of the effect of the By-field on the
phenomena of cuurent disruption during substorms are proposed. Such a study is
warranted by observations of the presence of By in the quiescent as well as the
active magnetotail. Recently, we have shown that in the presence of By, the
electron tearing mode can be destabilized Ä±X. Wang, A. Bhattacharjee and A.T.Y.
Lui, J. Geophys. Res., 95, 15,047, 1990; attached as Appendix.!. We propose to
extend our present work by means of analytical theory as well as particle
simulation in the three- dimensional tail, and compare the predictions of theory
with the AMPTE/CCE database. The specific tasks proposed are: (i) Unified
analytical theory of electron and ion tearing in the presence of By, (ii)
Particle simulation in a three-dimensional plasma sheet, (iii) Analytical
nonlinear mode-coupling theory and predictions of particle acceleration, and
(iv) comparison of theory with observations from AMPTE/CCE.
