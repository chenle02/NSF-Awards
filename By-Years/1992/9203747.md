The theoretical objective of the research is to determine if bifurcations based
on continuum damage constitutive equations are good indicators of failure modes.
Both general and discontinuous bifurcations will be determined based on newly
formulated constitutive equations that allow for changes in the elasticity
tensor and are more appropriate for quasi-brittle materials that the usual
formulations of plasticity. The experimental phase will provide orientations and
widths of failure zones together with strain fields for specimens subjected to
both uniaxial compression and axial compression with lateral pressure. The use
of x-rays will provide whole-field data that cannot be obtained in any other
manner. Specimens will constructed so that their response will be two-
dimensional and, therefore, uniquely suitable for real-time x- ray displays. The
experimental data will provide both the insight and the verification necessary
to validate the underlying hypotheses used in the theoretical approach.
