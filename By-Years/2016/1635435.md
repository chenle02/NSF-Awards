Autonomously fabricating macro-scale polymeric objects by subjecting a preform
to a non-contact stimulus such as heat holds significant technological
implications. For instance, it offers the ability to transform a preform
(fabricated in simple, compact geometries) into target shapes on demand. It also
offers the ability to simultaneously transform a large number of parts into
target shapes by triggering them en masse using a globally applied stimulus.
Hence, mass manufacturability emerges without an additional overhead. This Grant
Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) award supports
fundamental research on the self-assembly of 3D structures based on designs
embedded at the molecular level in heat-responsive polymers. Research results
can help spawning new technologies in applications such as biomedicine, where
implants can be deployed into desired shapes and reshaped as-needed using an
external stimulus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first research objective is to
establish the relationship between the spatiotemporal evolution of strain fields
(leading to the creation of 3D helical structures) and controllable parameters
(nematic director orientation and temperature). To achieve this objective,
crosslinked, acrylate-based liquid crystalline polymers in twisted nematic
configurations will be synthesized. Freely suspended polymer samples will be
subjected to heat treatment with varying nematic director orientation (ranging
from 0 to 45Â° with respect to the mid-plane of samples) and temperature (ranging
from the glass transition temperature to close to the thermal decomposition
temperature). The evolution of strain fields in these samples will be measured
in situ using image analysis based characterization. The second research
objective is to establish the effect of the displacement (preimposed on the
sample) on the spatiotemporal evolution of torsional, bending strain fields
(underpinning the creation of 3D prismatic and hierarchically supercoiled
shapes). Various displacements (up to 20 percent of the length of the samples)
will be imposed to samples. Spatiotemporal evolution of torsional, bending
strain fields will be measured using imaging analysis based characterization.
