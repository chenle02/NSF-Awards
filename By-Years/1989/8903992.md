Taiwan represents an active arc-continent collision, and displays a number of
mesoscale-to microscale structures, incre- mental strain histories and changes
in rock volume within a slate belt that marks the transitional zone between the
foreland and hinterland parts of the collision. The Taiwan collision zone
propagates from north to south, providing a time-space equivalence that can be
used to document the evolution of specific structural events. The approach of
this collaborative project with 8904989 (Fisher at Penn State) is to examine
meso- and micro-structures, strain indicators and rock volume changes along
several cross-strike transects at different positions along the strike of the
mountain belt. Results of these integrated studies of the transition zone are
expected to improve understanding of collisional mountain belts, particularly
the transition between foreland and hinterland parts of such orogens.
