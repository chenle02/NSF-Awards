This grant provides partial support for a Summer School covering current
research focused on integrating expressive logical systems and powerful theorem-
proving assistants into the design, definition, and implementation of
programming languages. Speakers will present material covering foundational
theory, advanced techniques, and applications. The goal is to help graduate
students and researchers from academia or industry understand the critical
issues and open problems confronting the field. The broader impacts of the
summer school include building a community of researchers around these topics,
including expected international attendance. NSF funds provide support for US-
based students and emphasize participation from underrepresented groups.
