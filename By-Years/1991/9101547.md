A user mode research program will be carried out principally in electromagnetic
nuclear physics, but with some continued effort in hadronic probes as well. The
activities will include: (1) study of the nucleon electric and magnetic
polarizability, measurement of the delta resonance d-state, and probes of meson
exchange currents in the deuteron photodisintegration using polarized gamma rays
at BNL's LEGS facility; (2) nuclear structure studies using polarized deuterons
to isolate discrete isoscalar states and resonances at Saclay's Saturne
facility; (3) fundamental neutral pi and eta meson production at Saturne and
later at the Bonn electron accelerator; and for the future, (4) vector meson
electroproduction and decay using the CEBAF CLAS detector. For the latter
experiments, development work will be carried out on the data acquisition and
detector control software.
