This research is concerned with the representation theory of algebraic groups.
The principal investigator will study the structure of the indecomposable
rational injective modules for certain non-reduced subgroup schemes of a simply
connected semisimple algebraic group. In addition, the structure of the Jantzen
translations of these injective modules and the relationship between this
structure and the Hecke algebra of the affine Weyl group will be studied. This
project is concerned with the structure, cohomology and representations of
algebraic groups. These algebraic groups occur, for example, as groups of linear
transformations. This is an active area currently in mathematics. This project
will provide a key step in solving the Lusztig conjecture in characteristic p.
