AST-0805540&lt;br/&gt;Novak&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will study the
Martian atmosphere by (1) mapping ozone diurnally and latitudinally above and
below 20 km; (2) mapping HDO and H2O diurnally and latitudinally; and (3)
searching for trace species and undiscovered absorption (or emission) bands in
the one to five micron range. It will provide useful scientific information both
for modeling the Martian atmosphere and for future space missions. Current work
has measured ozone in the middle atmosphere (20-50 km) and this study will
complement those values by measuring the total column density of ozone, thus
giving insight into the vertical distribution of the gas. New Deuterium-to-
Hydrogen ratio (D/H) measurements will add a diurnal component to existing
values taken along the sub-Earth meridian of Mars. Data will come primarily from
CSHELL on the NASA IRTF, Phoenix on Gemini South and SOAR, and NIRSPEC on Keck
II.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An integral part of this research is to engage
undergraduate students, who reduce and analyze data, participate in observing
runs, and present their findings at meetings. The project will be conducted at
Iona College, an undergraduate institution, but with wider exposure through
collaborators at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. Talks given to meetings
on undergraduate education and to local community groups will incorporate the
results.
