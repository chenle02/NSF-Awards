This award provides support for the renovation of research space in the
Chemistry Building at the University of Iowa. Laboratories located on the 5th
floor of the southeast wing of the building, that were constructed in 1922, will
be renovated for students and four productive faculty members who have
established national and international reputations for excellence and innovation
in synthetic chemical research. Existing laboratories lack the essential
infrastructure required to conduct modern chemistry. There is currently no
provision for ventilation, central air-conditioning, or make-up air in any of
the rooms. All have poor lighting, and cannot house any research operation that
involves extensive use of volatile materials or any potentially toxic gases.
Targeted research space is devoid of the appropriate laboratory benches, sinks,
fume hoods, electrical service, and HVAC facilities. Moreover, the crowded
conditions under which these groups operate include numerous potential serious
safety hazards to research personnel. This project will correct these
deficiencies and make unsuitable space into a safe and conducive research
environment. Improvements will allow these scientists to expand their research
operations, and facilitate the accommodation of visiting scientists from
industry and academic institutions in the US and abroad. The upgraded facility
will contribute to the research and educational goals of the University of Iowa
by assisting the institution in its efforts to recruit future faculty hires.
