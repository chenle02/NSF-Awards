An award is made to the University of Louisville to develop a microfluidic
platform that can measure the electrical properties of biological nanoparticles
(proteins, viruses, exosomes, etc.) by monitoring their response when stimulated
by an electric field. This method also provides biologists with a new high-
throughput tool of characterizing and concentrating molecules without chemically
altering them. A student team of graduate and undergraduate students will design
and build the system using microfabrication techniques while also undergoing
entrepreneurial training through programs offered by the University of
Louisville. In addition, high school students will contribute towards the
project and will be recruited through the University of Louisvilleâ€™s Signature
Partnership with West Louisville Schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this
research project is to develop a specialized microfluidic platform to gain
fundamental insight into the field-induced response of biological nanoparticles.
The platform will enable the electrical characterization of nanoparticles and
its measurements will aid in the affirmation of emerging theories about the
electrokinetics of proteins and other molecules. Further, findings will enable
the development advanced schemes to manipulate nanoscale biomaterials resulting
in much faster and/or greater concentration of target species relative to
current methods that are otherwise limited by diffusion-based
transport.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
