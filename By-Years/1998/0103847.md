The twentieth century saw the rise and fall of Marxist practices. At the
beginning of the century, the international communist movement was a growing
social and political force inspired by emancipatory ideas, but by its end the
movement has virtually disappeared. Today, the movement is mostly talked about
in association with totalitarian and authoritarian regimes of the past. However,
at least two twentieth century communist parties can lay claim to more
democratic histories and hopeful futures: the South African Communist Party and
the Community Party of India in Kerala. Both parties represent exceptions to the
historical norms of twentieth century international communism. Yet, the two
parties also differ: in Kerala the party developed a participatory democratic
orientation, and in South Africa the party developed a representative democratic
orientation. Through the comparative method, this project examines why the two
parties diverged after having developed by the late 1950s broadly similar
democratic commitments and orientations. Based on interviews with party leaders,
activists, and members, and access to party papers, memos, correspondence, and
reports, the investigator identifies the conditions that facilitate the growth
and development of various types of democratic communism.
