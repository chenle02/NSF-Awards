9602257 Mendoza This award provides limited additional funds to an established
multidisciplinary Research Training Group (RTG) in Animal Behavior. First
established in 1992, the RTG has helped create a focus for research and
education at all post- secondary levels in the University of California at
Davis. The study of animal behavior provides new insights into the study of
animals as organisms. Increasingly, multidisciplinary approaches that recognize
the interaction of genetic, developmental, physiological and environmental
determinants are playing an important role in the analysis of behavior. The
group of participating faculty has grown to include 26 junior and senior
investigators from 10 departments of the University. The funds awarded will
provide short-term stipends for graduate students that permit summer fieldwork
and other summer research activities. In addition, funds will be used to bring
investigators from other research and academic institutions to the campus for an
intensive spring workshop that caps a year-long course in interdisciplinary
studies of animal behavior open to all students.. ***
