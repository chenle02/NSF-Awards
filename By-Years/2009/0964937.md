Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American
Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;The purpose
of this award is to construct new Ocean Bottom Seismometers to be deployed to
the Cascadia margin as part of a joint Earthscope/Margins program to understand
better the mechanisms and significance of normal earthquakes, slow earthquakes,
episodic tremor and slip and other seismic/geodetic phenomena.&lt;br/&gt;
