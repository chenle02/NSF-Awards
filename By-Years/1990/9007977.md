In this proposal the P.I. develops a mechanistic model of competition that
makes predictions about how resource use by plants influences both individual
competitive ability and the population-level outcome of competition along
productivity gradients. The model is based on separating two components of
competitive ability: ability to deplete resources and ability to tolerate
depleted resources. Using these two types of plant- resource interactions to
predict the outcome of net plant-plant interactions is complex because the
relative sizes of interacting plants determine whether good depletors or good
tolerators are the superior competitors and because depletion and tolerance
abilities are determined by different plant traits. The investigators develops
specific predictions about these relationships and describe experiments to test
them in a desert grassland community such models should have significant
implication for many plant communities, included those endangered worldwide.
