Abstract for award DMS-0401403 of Flach

The aim of the project is to explore the usefulness of Taylor-Wiles systems for
establishing cases of the Tamagawa number conjecture on special values of Hasse-
Weil L-functions. Following the initial breakthrough by Taylor and Wiles this
has been done in the case of the adjoint L-function of elliptic modular forms in
joint work with Diamond and Guo. The next cases we intend to look at are those
where the Taylor-Wiles method has been worked out but the relationship to values
of L-functions is still missing, notably Siegel modular forms of genus 2,
Hilbert modular forms and possibly unitary groups.

L-functions figure prominently in modern number theory, or even in all of pure
mathematics if one takes as a benchmark the seven Clay millenium problems, two
of which are directly concerned with L-functions. In high school algebra one
draws the solution set in the plane of an algebraic equation in two variables x
and y. One may also look at the solutions in rational numbers, integers or
integers modulo a prime number. L-functions are built from the number of
solutions modulo primes (of any set of equations in any number of variables) and
are expected to give information about solutions in rational numbers. Solving
equations in rational numbers is notoriously hard, whereas values of L-functions
are often very computable, so such a relationship lies very deep. The primordial
example is of course the conjecture of Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer, one of the
millenium problems. As often in mathematics, one generalizes a problem in order
to understand it better but the tradeoff is an increasingly abstract framework
("cohomology" in this case). On the positive side, other instances of the
generalized framework may actually be provable with current methods, and this is
what the project aims to explore. The aim is to prove new cases of the expected
special value formula for L-functions, using the relatively recent method of
Taylor-Wiles systems.
