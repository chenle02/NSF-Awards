Professor Nibler is supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program in
a continuing investigation of the structures, vibrational and thermodynamic
parameters, and energy dynamics of reactive and excited molecules and weakly-
bound complexes. The research centers on nonpolar systems small enough to serve
as good prototypes for theoretical modeling. Coherent Raman techniques are being
used to study samples, including simple molecular dimers, prepared and cooled in
free jet expansions. Similar detection techniques are used to detect molecular
fragments photolyzed by pulsed lasers in the gas phase or in frozen argon
matrices.
