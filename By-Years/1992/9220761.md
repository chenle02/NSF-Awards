Investigations that coordinate phylogenetic analyses with explorations of the
evolutionary processes are essential for understanding organismal diversity. The
proposed research, centered on the hydrangea family of plants, aims to resolve
phylogenetic relationships among major groups of flowering plants. This will be
accomplished by focusing on key taxa in conjunction with groups that are poorly
known and considered "anomalous" in the subclass Rosidae, many of which are
Asian in origin and poorly known in collections. Hydrangeaceae are positioned
near the divergence of the subclass Asteridae, and this investigation will
increase our understanding of evolutionary diversification preceding the origin
of subclass Asteridae with its great floral conservation. The proposed
investigation has three facets: 1. phylogenetic analysis using anatomical and
morphological features of plants of the hydrangea and dogwood groups positioned
taxonomically among Rosidae and near the origin of Asteridae; 2. phylogenetic
analysis within the Hydrangeaceae family to distinguish natural groups of
species and genera and to explore patterns of flower and fruit evolution in the
family; and 3. ontogenetic or developmental studies to determine roles of
various cellular processes in the evolution of different floral and fruit forms.
An explicit phylogenetic framework will help guide the choice of critical taxa
in making comparisons for the study of different developmental processes that
create flower and fruit diversity.
