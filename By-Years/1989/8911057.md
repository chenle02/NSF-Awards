This dissertation research project will allow a graduate student in cultural
anthropology to study refugees in Costa Rica. The tensions between documented
and undocumented refugees and the host community, on the local, regional and
national level, will be analyzed. The role of international foreign policy,
socio- economic status, and local socio-political structure will be analyzed to
explain variations in host-refugee relations. This research is important because
there are increasing numbers of refugees in the world, and understanding of the
dynamics of their relationship with their host communities is essential if
policy makers are to minimize problems.
