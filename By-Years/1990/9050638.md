Students in calculus and precalculus are concentrating on problem solving and
the understanding of concepts. These activities are enhanced by the use of a
computer laboratory equipped with IBM PS/2 computers running Derive. Students
studying geometry and statistics will use the laboratory in the future. The
institution will contribute an amount equal to the award.//
