Engineering - Other (59) Robotics and automation systems have been implemented
in U.S. manufacturing settings with significant reductions in cost and
improvements in competitiveness as a result. Through this project, undergraduate
industrial engineering courses are being modified to include modules on flexible
manufacturing through robotics and automation with coverage of topics such as
dynamics, manipulation, trajectory planning, and programming. Other subject
areas included in the courses are process planning, network communications,
scheduling, robotic programming, and concurrent engineering. The flexible
manufacturing system being developed through this project allows for various
laboratory machines to be integrated and utilized for the manufacture of
customized parts or for the design of reconfigurable scenarios. Hands-on
laboratory experiences are being developed and evaluated for learning
effectiveness through this project. Improvements in student learning and
motivation are being rigorously assessed through a variety of measures and
results of the project are being broadly disseminated.
