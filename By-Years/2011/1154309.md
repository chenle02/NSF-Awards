Craven Community College's S-STEM project [Scholars in Engineering and Science
(SEAS)] is awarding 16 one-year scholarships each year for five years to
financially needy, underrepresented students who demonstrate academic promise
and are interested in pursuing a STEM career. With sustained high academic
performance, students are eligible for a second year of SEAS scholarship
support. The SEAS program combines a rigorous classroom curriculum, a vibrant
student learning community, and readily utilized student support services to
improve student engagement, learning, persistence and opportunity for degree
completion. Scholarship recipients are participating in a weekly seminar course
each semester to facilitate cohort unity while also building a strong social
support system, and scholars are provided with information on STEM research
initiatives and careers through invited speaker presentations and career-related
topics and discussions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SEAS program participants are
engaged in the Engineering and Science Connections Mentor Program, and they are
paired with a local mentor in their chosen field of study. Students in the
second year of their program are given the opportunity to apply for an $800
enhancement grant to support independent research projects and to lend support
to them if attending a state or regional scientific conference. In order to
promote a seamless transfer of STEM students from the community college to a
four-year institution, Craven CC continues to pursue additional articulation and
bi-lateral agreements with transfer institutions for STEM programs. The SEAS
program is clearly impacting STEM education at Craven CC, while it also serves
as a prototype to other programs nationally.
