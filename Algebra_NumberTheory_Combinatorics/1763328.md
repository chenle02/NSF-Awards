Topological quantum field theory, the mathematics underlying quantum physics,
serves as a convenient organizational principle in understanding some basic
quantitative features of three- and four-dimensional geometric spaces, of which
our universe and space-time are fundamental examples. Since mid-1990s, various
mathematicians have conjectured that an explicit construction of certain four-
dimensional topological field theories (4d TQFTs) should exist, the discovery of
which will enhance our mathematical understanding of four-dimensional quantum
physics. The objective of this project is to develop an accessible approach
towards explicitly realizing such 4d TQFTs. The 4d TQFTs will admit
combinatorial descriptions and be computable in practice for applications. They
are related to, yet more subtle than, an earlier construction in dimension
three. The project naturally fits into a larger program of relating certain
three-dimensional field theories and four-dimensional ones by a process called
categorification, where "shadow" concepts in three dimensions are replaced by
richer structures in four dimensions. The higher structures obtained can be
utilized to resolve problems in lower dimensions. In addition, algebraic
structures will be developed along the the way that it will shed new light on
topics in classical algebraic studies.

In more detail, this is a project to investigate categorifications of quantum
groups at prime roots of unity, and their categorical representation theory.
This constitutes part of a long term program to categorify the Witten-
Reshetikhin-Turaev three-dimensional topological quantum field theory, producing
a four-dimensional theory. The existence of such liftings of topological quantum
field theories by categorification was conjectured by Crane and Frenkel in 1994.
A key ingredient in this program is to find a categorical enhancement of certain
link homology theories, such as Khovanov homology, at prime roots of unity. The
project will be carried out by further developing a recently introduced
generalized homological algebraic theory called "hopfological algebra."
Incorporating this newly developed hopfological theory into earlier works on
categorified representation theory of quantum group at a prime root of unity
will allow one to explicitly construct hopfological invariant for links and
3-manifolds, thereby explicitly lifting Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev's three-
dimensional topological quantum field theorys via categorification. In the
process, categorified representation theory of quantum groups a prime root of
unity will be investigated, together with their new hopofological features.
