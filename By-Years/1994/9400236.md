9400236 Staley This three-year award supports U.S.-Sweden cooperative research
in organic chemistry and dynamics between Stuart W. Staley of Carnegie-Mellon
University and Bertil Eliasson of the University of Umea in Sweden. The
objective of their research is to measure the electronic conductivities of
various organic structural units, which can be thought of as building blocks for
"organic wires". The U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in
the synthesis and preparation of bridged dicyclooctatetraenes compounds. This is
complemented by Swedish expertise in NMR spectroscopy. In the proposed project,
the U.S. group will prepare the compounds using advanced NMR techniques such as
triple resonance. Then Carnegie-Mellon graduate students will perform joint
experiments with the Swedish group using a state-of-the-art high-field NMR
spectrometer located at the University of Umea. The results of this study will
be relevant to a number of active research areas, including electron transfer,
conducting polymers, and molecular electronics. ***
