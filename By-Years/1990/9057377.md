Transmitter receptors exist as multiple receptor subtypes with different
binding affinities and different cellular and physiological responses to the
same transmitter. The expression and sensitivity of these receptor subtypes can
be independently regulated. Such multiplicity of receptor subtypes enables a
single transmitter to play a variety of physiological roles in the same tissue.
The investigator is employing molecular genetic, biochemical and
electrophysiological methods to analyze and manipulate cloned serotonin receptor
genes to determine how these receptors bind specific ligands and interact with
other cellular proteins. This award will enable the investigator to isolate
novel serotonin receptors and to characterize the cellular responses they elicit
as well as to determine which cells in the rat brain express them. In addition,
the regions of serotonin receptors responsible for ligand binding,
ligand.induced conformational changes in receptor structure, and G protein
interaction will be determined using mutational techniques. Differences in the
second messenger systems activated by different serotonin receptor subtypes will
also be explored.
