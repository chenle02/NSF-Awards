The project will investigate the formation and maintenance of a key component of
the tropical circulation that affects summer rainfall over continental United
States: tropical storms, or hurricanes, in the Atlantic. The genesis of Atlantic
hurricanes, which often make landfall over continental US, is in the African
easterly waves, and the project will advance understanding of the dynamical
factors controlling African easterly wave activity. The waves themselves are
posited to arise from hydrodynamic instability of the African easterly jet, and
Dr. Chen's research will examine the formation, maintenance, and variability of
this lower tropospheric jet using the modern reanalysis data sets, which provide
a wealth of information on circulation and diabatic heating. The diagnostic
research will provide a new assessment of the dynamic and thermodynamic
interactions involved in the formation and development of African easterly
waves, building on the pioneering analyses of Carlson, Burpee, and Reed that
date back a quarter century.
