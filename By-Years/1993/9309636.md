9309636 Eckstein The goals of this research project are: (1) to formulate and
estimate a behavioral model of school attainment and job search within a
sequential decision-making framework, (2) to estimate the monetary return to
education, and (3) to use the estimates of the decision model to simulate the
impact of policy interventions, such as minimum wages and legal restrictions on
school-leaving age, on school attainment and the school-to-job transition. The
research will employ recent methods of estimating dynamic stochastic discrete
choice models. The models will be estimated with a unique data set, the National
Longitudinal Surveys of Labor Market Experience 1979 youth cohort, which not
only contains longitudinal information on school enrollment and employment for
the cohort, but also has collected high school transcripts. This project is
important because it will advance our understanding of the schooling decision
and the transition process from school to work, and it will enhance our
understanding for the impact of public policy on the demand for schooling and on
the impact of schooling on future wages. ***
