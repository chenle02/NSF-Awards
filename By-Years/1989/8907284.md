The program of research at the George Washington University to be performed by
the Experimental Particle and Nuclear Physics Group consists of : i) coincidence
measurements which study the few-body interactions of light nuclei; ii)
completion of the analysis of our pion-nucleon data taken over the last decade;
iii) inclusive elastic scattering of pions from three-nucleon nuclei to study
model dependent theories, Coulomb effects and charge symmetry; and iv) a program
of state-of-the-art detector design, development, testing and construction. The
particular goal in part iv is to contribute in a significant way to the
construction of the Neutral Meson Spectrometer to be soon proposed by a
collaboration that includes GWU. A more long term goal is to develop the
detectors that will be used in the Tagged Photon System to be used in Area B at
CEBAF and more generally to contribute to the construction of the LAS at CEBAF.
