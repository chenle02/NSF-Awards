This project will support development and publication of a textbook entitled
"Seeing Clearly: The Measurement and Impacts of Atmospheric Turbulence and
Refractivity on the Propagation of Extraterrestrial Radiation." The text, with
chapter contributions from acknowledged leaders in an array of relevant fields,
will serve as a lasting resource for scientists and graduate-level students
seeking a fundamental understanding of the impacts of atmospheric turbulence on
Earth-based optical astronomy. It will draw upon input gained at the first
Symposium on Seeing (SOS) held in 2007.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual
merit of this effort derives from an enriched interdisciplinary exchange that
should support further advances in optimal development application of adaptive
optics based upon a fuller knowledge of turbulent behavior of the atmospheric
medium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts will come through education and
dissemination of key information needed to mitigate turbulence-generated
interference with clear astronomical measurements. Efforts to reach a diverse
readership will be enhanced development of a relatively low-cost web-based
version of the text whose availability will be broadly advertised across the
meteorological and astronomical communities.
