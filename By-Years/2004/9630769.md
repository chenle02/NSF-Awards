9630769 Rohrmann Sequences used by the baculovirus, Autographa californica, to
initiate in vivo DNA replication will be identified and characterized.
Interactions between different components of the replication complex will be
characterized and their roles in DNA replication determined. A gene, ie-1, which
is essential for DNA replication and is a transactivator of early gene
transcription will be characterized. Its interactions with replication origin
sequences will be investigated and the domains involved in these functions
mapped. The replication origins used by baculoviruses in vivo will be mapped and
the structural and functional requirements of a replication origin will be
determined. %%% Relatively little is known about the origins of replication in
eukaryotic cells or about the factors that control initiation at the many
origins of replication found in the genomes of such cells. Baculoviruses provide
a model for eukaryotic genome replication origins because, in contrast to other
viruses, they do have multiple origins of replication. Moreover, they are used
as expression systems for the production of properly modified recombinant
proteins and because late gene promoters used to express recombinant proteins
depend on DNA replication a better understanding of replication in these viruses
could lead to the development of improved baculovirus expression systems. ***
