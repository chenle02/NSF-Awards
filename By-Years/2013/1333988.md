This project funds approximately 10-12 US-based graduate students to attend the
Tenth Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation (NSDI?13) to be
held April 3-5, 2013 in Lombard, IL. Participation in NSDI and similar
conferences is a valuable and important part of the graduate school experience
and will provides students with the opportunity to interact with more senior
researchers in the &amp;#64257;eld, and exposes students to leading edge work in
the &amp;#64257;eld. The conference focuses on the design principles of large-
scale networks&lt;br/&gt;and distributed systems.
