This award provides funding for the conference, "The 2017 Great Lakes
Mathematical Physics Meeting," that will be held June 23-25, 2017, at Michigan
State University.

The conference focuses on recent developments in Analysis, especially in the
field of Mathematical Physics. A number of distinguished mathematicians have
agreed to attend and speak at this conference. This award gives early career
researchers, members of underrepresented groups, researchers not funded by NSF
and the like an opportunity to attend and participate in this conference. The
organizing committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to
target groups through a number of different activities. More information will be
