For enhancement of the curriculum in cell biology, this project provides a
Philips EM208S transmission electron microscope with a digitized imaging system.
The Philips 208S allows students to use electron microscopy in their
investigations of new and emerging areas of biology. The instrument permits new
exercises in the Cells and Tissues laboratory course; allows the introduction of
electron microscopy into laboratory courses in Microbiology, Plant Physiology,
and Neurobiology; enables fine-structure studies in individual projects in the
Microbiology laboratory course; and expands the opportunities for electron
microscopic investigations for students participating in independent research.
The new equipment builds upon a 26-year history of undergraduate use of a
temperamental (and now almost antique) RCA EMU4B. By contrast, the Philips 208S,
with its automated controls, digitized imaging system and printing capabilities,
substantially upgrades and expands the capabilities for instruction in electron
microscopy. The ability to digitize images enables students to (1) collect data
in finished form during one laboratory period, obviating the need for long hours
in the dark room; (2) record the images for later analysis; and (3) print them
for research presentations and reports. Display of the image on the computer
screen allows groups of students to view a specimen simultaneously without
lengthy dark adaptation. The Philips 208S, with computerized settings and
automated controls, can be used by students with minimal supervision after
introductory instruction. Finally, it is relatively easy for faculty to maintain
without the assistance of a dedicated technician. The Philips 208S provides
effective access for our undergraduates to a key modern instrument in their
laboratory courses and impart technological skills important for continued work
in biology. *
