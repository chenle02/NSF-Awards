The main objective of this project is the study of nonlinear parabolic equations
which come from differential geometry problems, such as the evolution of a
hypersurface of Euclidean space by functions of its principal curvatures, the
Ricci flow and the Yamabe flow. More precisely, the PI focuses on singularity
analysis of possible finite time singularities occurring in those evolution
equations. Such equations appear in quantum field theory, plasma physics, thin
liquid film dynamics. More precisely, one of the things the PI wants to study is
the regularity of nonlinear geometric flows, such as finding the minimal
geometric conditions that will guarantee the smooth existence of a solution to
the Ricci flow and the mean curvature flow. The other thing the PI would like to
understand are the ancient solutions to nonlinear geometric flows and their
classification. It is well known that ancient solutions arise as singularity
models (blown up limits) at finite time singularities. Their classification is
crucial for better understanding the singularities that may occur in finite
time. Ancient solutions to the two dimensional Ricci flow describe trajectories
of the renormalization group equations of certain asymptotically free local
quantum field theories in the ultra-violet regime. One special class of ancient
solutions are Ricci solitons. The PI would like to study those, having an
ultimate goal of classifying generic singularities of a generic Ricci flow.

The project the PI proposes links many different active fields of mathematics,
such as nonlinear analysis, differential geometry and topology. The proposed
research activity on singularity analysis and regularity of nonlinear parabolic
geometric evolution equations may result in interesting applications in geometry
and topology. There may be potential application in physics as well. It is well
known that the Ricci flow theory has lead to a solution of the Poincare
conjecture in topology. The hope is that geometric flows may help solving other
important topological question such as the classification of manifolds in higher
dimensions. One of the main obstacles in order to even approach such a difficult
question like that by using the flow theory is understanding the singularity
formation and the classification of singularities, since one can not hope the
flow will exist forever. Most likely it will develop singularities in finite
time. The PI proposes to understand the formation of singularities in the flows
such as the Ricci flow, mean curvature flow, the Yamabe flow and therefore
contribute to finding a way to approach the big mentioned problem above.
