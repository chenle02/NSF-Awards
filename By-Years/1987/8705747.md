The purpose of this study is to determine the fundamental processes that
control structure and regulate the size of clonal plant populations. To date
there has been surprisingly little agreement among ecologists as to how any
plant population is regulated. Dr. Silander has developed an approach that
combines field experiments with mathematical models, based on observations of
individual clone performance (i.e. size, growth rates, reproduction, etc.) and
clone competition. These models will provide specific predictions of clone
population composition and fluctuation which can be field tested. This protocol
has been used to accurately predict the fluctuations and species composition of
annual plant populations. The proposed study will provide the same for clonal
populations. The experimental phase of the study will focus on clonal
populations of white clover raised in the field with perennial ryegrass.
Together these species form one of the dominant types of agricultural forage
communities found throughout the temperate zone of the world. This system is
thus of considerable economic importance. Competition among white clover clones
and between clover and ryegrass will be examined. Furthermore the study will
examine the effects of environmental variation (temporal and spatial) on clover
population fluctuations. The study will provide an unprecedented understanding
of the structure and composition of plant populations. It will allow prediction
of the population consequences of variation in genetic diversity, environmental
variation and grassland management regimes. Thus the study has significant
application for agricultural systems as well as providing basic knowledge of the
ecology and population biology of white clover.
