The field of continuous complexity studies numerical analysis algorithms from a
mathematical point of view This research seeks sharper estimates of the density
of convergence and getting density bounds for Newton's method was based on a
multi-layer compactness argument which will be extended to a wide class of
purely iterative root finding methods. Non-blocking networks will also be
investigated. In particular designs for easily implementable networks with a
small number of edges will be sought.
