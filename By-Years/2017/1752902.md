This proposal supports a workshop on U.S. and South Korean collaboration in the
area of robotics, specifically humanoid robots that collaborate with people.
International collaboration is important for keeping U.S. researchers abreast of
the latest technological developments around the world, which have impact on our
quality of life, quality of work, and quality of education. The workshop will be
held in conjunction with the International Conference on Intelligent Robots and
Systems (IROS), in Vancouver, Canada, September 2017. The focus of the workshop
is to keep abreast of latest developments in robotics research, communicate the
benefits of the U.S. environment supporting leading edge innovation, and begin a
?match-making? process to connect U.S. and South Korean robotics researchers.
The goal is to develop a sustainable model for international collaboration,
where the benefits exceed the added administrative burdens typical of such
collaborations. Innovative approaches both during and after the workshop will be
employed in order to develop and nurture nascent research collaborations.
