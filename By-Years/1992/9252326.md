The project is designed to expose undergraduate biology students to
investigative research throughout their college education. All of the biology
labs are being revised to include investigative components. In addition, in
their junior year, biology majors take a research techniques course. Some majors
then undertake an independent research project. The labs and the research
projects encourage students to be active participants in scientific
investigation, rather than being passive observers. To conduct investigative
laboratories and to support student research projects in structural biology, the
project requires a research quality compound microscope and dissecting
microscope equipped with an interchangeable automatic camera system and color
videocamera and monitor. The compound microscope will have the capability of
brightfield, phase contrast, and Nomarski optics, as well as low UV and visible
light epifluorescence.
