This project will provide support for a special symposium on magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI), titled 'Paul C. Lauterbur Memorial Symposium' during March 26-28,
2008 at University of Illinois Urbana Champaign. Dr. Paul C. Lauterbur has been
known as the 'father' of MRI. He and Sir Peter Mansfield won the Nobel Prize for
Physiology or Medicine in 2003 for their seminal discoveries that made MRI
possible. The Paul C. Lauterbur Memorial Symposium will provide a unique forum
for a systematic discussion of historical developments, present status, and
future directions of MRI. The symposium features four plenary sessions of
invited talks and two keynote lectures by leading MRI researchers, as well as
two special sessions of talks by some of Dr. Lauterbur's former colleagues and
students. This symposium will be of great educational benefit and be inspiring
to junior researchers and students in the field and across fields.
