The Gephysical Study Committee of the National Academy of Sciences will continue
its efforts to develop a series of reports on key geophysics issues. Three such
efforts are in process. The first two, on "Sea Level Change" and on "Fluids in
Crustal Processes", are well-underway and are expected to be completed in the
coming year. A third study is being planned on geomaterial fluxes: glacial to
recent. This effort is expected to begin late in 1988 and continue into the
following year. Each of these studies will culminate in a symposium, followed by
the Academy's issuance of a report including the individual papers prepared for
the symposium and concluding with a sumaary of the key issues identified and
conclusions and recommendations for addressing these issues in the future.
