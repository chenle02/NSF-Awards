Dr. Stahler will continue a theoretical study of the formation of stellar
clusters and associations. He plans to do this through a combination of semi-
analytic calculations and numerical, N-body simulations. Two parallel
investigations will be conducted: 1) An exploration of how stellar groups form
within contracting molecular clouds; and 2) A study of the history of stellar
open clusters. The research will involve a multi-pronged attack on the origin of
stellar groups, and will provide insight on other fundamental issues, such as
the evolution of molecular clouds and the global efficiency of star formation in
galaxies.

During the period of the award, Dr. Stahler will be a Shapley Lecturer for the
American Astronomical Society and will give both public and professional talks
at small, undergraduate institutions. He is also contracted to write a popular-
level book on the origin of stellar groups, and will teach an adult education
course on star formation.
