This award supports the improvement of a seawater system for the Bowdoin Coastal
Studies Center (CSC), which provides a program of scientific research and
undergraduate training that emphasizes high quality faculty-student mentorship
in a small-scale research setting. Research projects at the CSC involve faculty,
students, and visiting scientists from other institutions. Students participate
in a variety of programs and activities that include summer fellowships, student
honors projects, course-related activities and outreach. The results of these
projects are presented at professional conferences and published in peer-
reviewed journals. The improved seawater system will strengthen the quality,
volume and reliability of seawater available for use in the CSC's laboratory.
The CSC also offers programs designed to promote scientific literacy through
exchanges between scientists and non-scientists involved in coastal research
through hands-on field training, weekly seminars, poster sessions, exhibits and
informal gatherings. Improvements in the CSC are also expected to strengthen a
nascent partnership whose goal is the training of high school teachers in modern
marine science.
