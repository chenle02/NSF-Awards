The proposed research is directed towards a number of topics in the area of
likelihood based statistical methods. One set of topics will involve the
development of several new asymptotic methods in the area of parametric models,
focussing on improved distributional properties in the presence of nuisance
parameters and on testing methods for the number of components in a mixture. The
second set of topics revolves around semiparametric and nonparametric inference
in the mixture model, where the class of models needs to be expanded and further
inferential methods need to be developed. The most widely used method for
drawing statistical conclusions, called the method of maximum likelihood, is
based on a mathematical version of the intuitive notion that the true value of a
parameter will generally be found among those that seem "most likely" given the
observed data. This powerful tool enables one to write down models for complex
phenomenon and, by maximizing the likelihood, draw conclusions about the state
of nature that generated the data. However, the likelihood method is not
perfect, and the objective of this research proposal is to further its
development, both in computation and in theory, in several areas of wide
application.
