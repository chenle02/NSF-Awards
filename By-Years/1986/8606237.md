The purpose of the experimental and theoretical research proposed here is to
design and study amplitude transmission apertures that create and transmit beams
not subject to diffraction spreading. The technical and theoretical feasibility
of non-diffracting apertures was proposed recently in theoretical work at the
University of Rochester by Durnin. Professor Eberly proposes to demonstrate the
formation and propagation of optical beams with spot sizes smaller than 100
microns with less than 10% beam spreading over path lengths on the order of
meters. The potential is great for near-term applications in such areas as
laser-scribing, laser micro-welding and even laser surgery, where narrowly
focused beams with unusual depth of field are desirable.
