This is a Presidential Young Investigator (PYI) award. The research project
involves experimental studies of the kinetics and mechanisms of hydrothermal
water-rock reactions. Specific objectives include investigations of: (1) rates
and mechanisms of dissolution of minerals in aqueous solutions, (2) rates and
mechanisms of diffusional healing of cracks in minerals and the influences of
temperature, pressure, fluid flow, and fluid chemistry on the processes, (3)
rates and mechanisms of water- enhanced deformation of minerals, and (4)
kinetics of hydration and dehydration reactions. The research will also involve
studies of the thermodynamics and chemistry of natural brines from a variety of
geologic settings. The results of these studies will enhance our understanding
of the important role of aqueous fluids in geochemical dynamics.
