9319816 Karatzas This project will focus on various mathematical problems
arising in continuous-time finance that require the development of new
techniques in stochastic control theory. These include (1) questions of
optimization, hedging, and valuation of contingent claims in incomplete markets
and/or under constraints; and (2) questions of economic equilibrium in
incomplete or "effectively complete" markets. With regard to (1), it is expected
that the problem of portfolio optimization with random endowment streams will
require non-standard techniques from functional and convex analysis. Questions
of pricing are formulated in terms of a new kind of stochastic control problem
where the terminal reward function has a random component. Issues related to (2)
include the establishment of the martingale property for certain exponential
local martingales, and the representation property of a given set of martingales
as stochastic integrals with respect to a second, given set. Existing methods
for pricing financial instruments (for example, contracts whose value will be
revealed at some future date) assume that financial markets are "complete" of
"perfect" in the sense that it is possible to exactly calculate the present
value, and hence the price, of such instruments. In reality, this is not the
case; markets are "imperfect" or "incomplete" due, among other things, to
investment constraints, transaction costs, different interest rates, different
patterns of information, etc. Thus, it is very important to develop new methods
for pricing financial instruments in imperfect markets; such methodologies will
be investigated in this project. In a similar vein, standard economic
equilibrium theory provides ways to determine prices for financial assets so
that individual agents' utilities are maximized and "markets clear" (that is,
supply equals demand) - but again, only in the context of perfect markets. This
project will develop an equilibrium theory which is more g eneral and at the
same time also more applicable by being able to deal with imperfect markets.
