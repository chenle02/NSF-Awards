AST-0216493&lt;br/&gt;Heacox, William D.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A 32-inch clear
aperture telescope will be built and instrumented by the faculty and students of
the University of Hawaii at Hilo, Hawaii for the purpose of training students in
astronomical instrumentation technology development and for use by the
astronomical sciences research faculty for compelling research in the areas of:
evolution of galaxies in dense clusters, the formation and early evolution of
multiple star systems, the formation and early evolution of planetary systems
and the chemical evolution of our galaxy. The State of Hawaii will provide the
building and observatory dome). The undergraduate astronomy degree program at
the University of Hawaii, Hilo, will extensively use the planned observatory.
Young people of the State of Hawaii will be trained for careers in astronomy and
for technical jobs within the many Observatories on Mauna and in Hilo.
