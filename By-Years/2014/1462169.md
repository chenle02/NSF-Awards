1462169&lt;br/&gt;Emanuel&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant will support a field
and laboratory technician who will be enagegd in NSF funded research projects
focused on the interaction between physical hydrology and terrestrial ecosystem
ecology. Some of these questions include: How do topography and vegetation
jointly influence runoff generation in headwater catchments? What are key
coupling points between water and carbon cycles in complex landscapes? and What
factors determine the vulnerability of freshwater-dominated coastal ecosystems
to surface water salinization? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technician will
contribute to ongoing efforts to mentor students through participation in
research and to broaden participation among groups underrepresented in science,
technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and will directly support an
early career Native American geoscientist. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***
