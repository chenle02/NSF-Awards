0417670&lt;br/&gt;Grossmann&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Pan-American Advanced
Studies Institutes (PASI) award, jointly supported by the NSF and the Department
of Energy (DOE), will take place August 5-14, 2004 at Iguacu Falls, near the
Argentina/Brazil border, on the topic of Process Systems Engineering. Organized
by Dr. Ignacio E. Grossmann of Carnegie-Mellon University, the institute will
involve approximately 50 advanced graduate students and 20 lecturers in the
field from the U. S., Canada, and Latin America. The institute will consist of a
course with modules in four areas: Optimization, Process and Product Design,
Process and Supply Chain Operations, and Process Dynamics and Control.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The course is a logical follow-up to two successful CEPAC
(Chemical Engineering Pan American Collaboration) workshops that were organized
in the area of Process Systems Engineering in Santa Fe, Argentina in 1999, and
in Guaruja, Brazil in 2001. The participation of women and underrepresented
ethnic minorities will be promoted. Notes and materials from the PASI will be
made available to the entire community of researchers and graduate students at
the CEPAC web site http://cepac.cheme.cmu.edu. &lt;br/&gt;
