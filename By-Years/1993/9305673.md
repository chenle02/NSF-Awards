Two sequential annual workshops on research areas associated with probabilistic
methods in mechanics of materials will be held. The first workshop will occur
during June 29-July 1, 1993 at The Catholic University of America, Washington,
D.C. The second is tentatively scheduled for the last week in June of 1994 at
CUA. The workshops will explore the following topics: (1) Experimental
determination of the statistical properties of the microstructure of materials.
This would include materials ranging from commercially pure metals to composite
materials. (2) Characterization of the microstructure in terms of statistical
quantities. (3) Development of theories to predict the macroscopic properties of
materials from the statistical properties of microstructure. (4) Development of
processing methods to obtain a material with given statistical properties of the
microstructure.
