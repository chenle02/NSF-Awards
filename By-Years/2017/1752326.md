This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award will contribute to the
advancement of national prosperity and economic welfare by studying efficient
operations of complex network systems. Current supply chain networks, financial
networks and other industries have complex interconnected structures, where the
performance of one participant can affect the performance of the entire system.
In such cases, systemic risk arises when the failure of one supplier or
financial institution cascades through the network, which can be costly to
overall welfare. This award supports a fundamental understanding of incentives
that manage network vulnerabilities, mitigate systemic risk, and resolve
failures, while allowing for profit-maximizing behavior of individual
participants. The interdisciplinary nature of this research will create new
channels of communications between academics, practitioners, and policy makers,
leading to synergistic efficiencies in the design of effective policies. The
accompanying educational plan aims to broaden STEM interest in stochastic
networks through hands-on activities based on lab curricula and digital
libraries, and to provide opportunities for underrepresented
communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will build a strategic decision-
making framework encompassing a broad class of networks, and will develop
techniques to provide timely solutions for systemic risk mitigation. The
framework will model the reaction of agents in the network as their joint
decision-making process adapts to shocks and failures, and account for agents'
facing incomplete information on the state of the network. The proposed research
fills an important gap in the network literature, which mostly consider agents
that both mechanically follow pre-specified agreements and transparently observe
the entire network. The analytical infrastructure leverages and extends state-
of-the-art techniques from stochastic analysis, game theory, and risk
management. The project will develop mathematical techniques to recover Nash
equilibria in constrained, weighted, and directed stochastic networks through
the solution of non-linear discontinuous functional fixed-point equations. It
will produce numerical algorithms to approximate the sequential equilibria that
arise when agents are uncertain about the state of the network, and update their
higher-order beliefs on beliefs of other agents and their interactions. The
performance assessments of the control policies will be informed by available
data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
