This research is concerned with computational group theory. The principal
investigator will develop improved techniques for determining the order of a
permutation group from a set of generators. He will explore the connections
among coset enumeration, the nilpotent quotient algorithm and the Knuth- Bendix
procedure for strings in an effort to improve the performance of each of these
procedures. He will also investigate the possibility of devising a practical
algorithm for computing infinite solvable quotients. This research concerns the
development and computer implementation of group theoretic algorithms. This
project is breaking ground in computational algebra which is an underdeveloped
area relative to current computational technology. The ideas that are proposed
are new state-of-the-art innovations and may provide dramatic improvements in
certain types of enumerations.
