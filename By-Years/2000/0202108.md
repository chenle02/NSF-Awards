This project will use an analytical approach to describe the evolution of ring
current ions and electrons during magnetic storms. A more realistic magnetic
field and electric field will be used than has previously been done in analytic
studies. It will examine the radial transport and loss mechanisms of particles
in the inner magnetosphere and will examine the role the ring current and its
associated magnetic field play on the particle dynamics. The motion of both
electrons and ions will be described using a Hamiltonian formalism. This
formalism will allow the model to treat the particle motions even near the inner
boundary of the ring current region (L ~ 2).
