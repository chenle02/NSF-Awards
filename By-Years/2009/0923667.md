"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of
2009&lt;br/&gt;(Public Law 111-5)."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Guidance and targeting
of neuronal axons from eye to brain is orchestrated through a set of cues that
are being discovered. This project addresses the mechanism by which L1, a key
neural cell adhesion molecule, regulates the map of retinal axons to the
superior colliculus, a region of the brain that contains a topographic map of
the visual world. The function of this system is to direct behavioral responses
toward points in surrounding space through eye, head, and arm movements. The
hypothesis to be tested is that L1 guides retinal axons to correct synaptic
targets by regulating adhesion to a substrate-bound molecule, termed ALCAM, in
conjuction with graded axon guidance cues ephrinB and EphB receptors. The role
of L1 interactions in synaptic targeting will be studied using a novel L1 mutant
mouse that lacks the ability to stabilize adhesion, and mice with genetic
deletions in ALCAM and EphB genes. Axon tracing, cell adhesion and axon growth
assays using retinal cells from each strain of mice will determine if L1 binds
to ALCAM thus promoting ephrinB1-dependent synaptic targeting of retinal axons
to proper coordinates in the brain. This project will enhance economic growth
and recovery and provide exceptional educational value by scientific training of
undergraduates, graduate, and postdoctoral students, and hiring of a research
technician. The importance of this work is that it provides the first molecular
explanation for how neurons develop reversible anchorage to form an eye-to-brain
map.
