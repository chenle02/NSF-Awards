The project proposes a conference to stimulate a national conversation on new
STEM learning research paradigms that cut across boundaries and investigate
multiple contexts and media, rather than historical approaches that have viewed
learning within limited temporal, spatial and socio-cultural contexts.

The project will create a special peer-reviewed, international themed issue in
the journal Science Education that reflects the meeting, convene the national
conference of prominent learning sciences researchers, host a post-conference
national web conference, follow-up on participants after one year, and host a
series of national discussions around new paradigms in STEM at multiple national
meetings.
