The Science Museum of Minnesota would like to create a network of partnerships
between the museum and small community-based science organizations (CBSOs).
CBSOs will receive professional development workshops to increase their capacity
to produce high quality exhibits and publications and offer effective science
programming. A team from each science organization will participate in a 12-hour
skills development workshop to cover such topics as exhibit development,
audience research, science communication and program development. A workshop
"tool kit" will capture the essence of the training workshops and be made
available to other museums. Each team will develop a small traveling exhibit and
supporting materials. Annual Science Summit programs will showcase the CBSOs to
the general public, museum visitors and students, while a CBSO Roundtable will
invite the participants to explore collaborations and programming strategies. An
online database will be created and a complimentary printed resource guide of
all local CBSOs will be available to the public. The model will be tested at two
small science centers, the Kirby Science Discovery Center in Sioux Falls, SD,
and at the Headwaters Science Center in Bemidji, MN. It is anticipated that 72
organizations and 450 CBSO staff members will be served by this project, in
addition to over 5,000 members of the general public.
