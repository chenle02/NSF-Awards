Problems will be studied from a broad spectrum of numerical analysis and it will
be determined to what extent fast stable algorithms can be derived for parallel
computers. Two categories of parallel architectures will be considered: (1)
Shared memory multiprocessors (CRAY-X-MP, CRAY-2, ETA-10, Encore Multimax). (2)
Distributed memory message passing architectures (NCUBE, Cyberplus). The goals
of the research are: (1) To determine the extent to which various advanced
architectures can be utilized to speed up computations, (2) To obtain general
design techniques that can be used to derive efficient stable algorithms
suitable for high sped parallel processing, and (3) To develop robust codes
which efficiently implement these algorithms on parallel architectures. The
research conducted to date has resulted in the discovery of a design technique
for parallelizing a class of iterative methods for solving large sparse linear
systems of equations. Efficient parallel algorithms for shared memory machines
with memory hierarchy and for message passing machines have been obtained and
are faster than previously existing algorithms. 8722260
