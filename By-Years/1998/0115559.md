This project proposes a study of the organization and management of the three
largest urban public school systems in America (New York, Chicago, and Los
Angeles), a comparison of each with its counterpart parochial school system, and
a study of three innovative, decentralized public school systems (Seattle,
Houston, and Edmonton). The analysis will test the "M-Form Hypothesis," which
predicts that among large organizations, the decentralized form with
accountability will outperform the centralized form. The study will undertake an
evaluation of the managerial, budgetary, legal and economic features of each
system through a multidisciplinary research team.
