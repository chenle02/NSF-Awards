The visualization of complicated three dimensional Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and
Solid State chemical structures is a particularly difficult problem for students
to overcome when the primary means of communication is the two dimensional world
of text books, blackboards, and overhead projector screens. Due to the increased
performance and availability of personal computers, both instructors and
students are beginning to embrace interactive multimedia as a means of
communicating chemical information. The goal of this project is to provide on
CD-ROM a wide variety of manipulatable molecular models, miniature movies, and
dynamic animations that address the topics in Inorganic and Bioinorganic
chemistry that will most benefit from a multimedia format. The free software
Chem3D Viewer is being used to present a database of hundreds of accurate
crystal structures that will benefit students and teachers at all levels who
encounter inorganic structures. Stand alone tutorials that describe the use of
the software and explain difficult structural concepts of inorganic chemistry
are being produced. Dissemination of test versions will be via the Internet,
followed by the complete version on CD-ROM, and evaluated by polling users at a
variety of small and large institutions.
