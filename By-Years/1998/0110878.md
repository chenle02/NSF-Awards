Adenylosuccinate lyase catalyzes a critical step in purine biosynthesis by
converting adenylosuccinate to AMP and fumarate. High-resolution structures of
two bacterial enzymes in the absence of substrate have been reported. Three
histidines, contributed by two different subunits, have been identified in the
active site. However, the structure of adenylosuccinate lyase suggests that in
an enzyme tetramer, three subunits actually contribute to each of the four
active sites. This project's goal is to understand the major chemical and
structural contributions to catalysis by normal adenylosuccinate lyase and the
molecular basis for decreased activity in patients with ASL deficiency. The
specific aims address three questions: 1. Which additional amino acids of
adenylosuccinate lyase contribute to catalysis and/or substrate binding? This
issue is approached by site-directed mutagenesis of amino acids postulated as at
the active site of B. subtilis adenylosuccinate lyase. Stable analogs of
adenylosuccinate, inert to enzymatic cleavage, will be synthesized and used to
prepare crystalline enzyme-inhibitor complexes; they will also be used to assess
substrate binding by enzymes. 2. How many subunits contribute to each active
site of adenylosuccinate lyase? Complementation experiments will be conducted in
which pairs of different, inactive mutants are mixed and tested for restoration
of activity in hybrid tetramers. 3. What is the molecular basis for the
structure-function relations in the adenylosuccinate lyase? B. subtilis
adenylosuccinate lyase will be engineered with amino acid substitutions
equivalent to those in some human variants with adenylosuccinate lyase
deficiency. These mutant enzymes will be models to elucidate further the
structural/chemical basis of the enzyme function. (This project is supported
