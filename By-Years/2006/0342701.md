With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
(CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of North Carolina
in Chapel Hill will acquire an LC time-of-flight mass spectrometer with
atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) and electrospray ionization
(ESI) capabilities. This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas
including a) discovery of new enantioselective dipolar cycloadditions from small
ring heterocycles; b) combinatorial development of the catalytic asymmetric
Aldol-Tischenko reaction; c) studies of pi-pi stacking interactions in small
molecules and beta-turn peptides; d) chiral supramolecular assemblies and their
applications in enantioselective processes; and e) biologically inspired studies
in asymmetric catalysis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mass spectrometry (MS) is a
technique used to probe intimate structural details and to obtain the molecular
compositions of a vast array of organic, bioorganic, and organometallic
molecules. The results from these studies will have an impact in a number of
areas including biochemistry and materials science. &lt;br/&gt;
