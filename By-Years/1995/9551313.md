This project is purchasing three Silicon Graphics Indigo workstations and
molecular modeling software for use in years two, three, and four of the
undergraduate program. The hardware is located in a newly remodeled computer
facility and accessed using X-Windows emulator software from existing department
PC and Mac clusters, and a new computer classroom. In the sophomore organic
course, molecular mechanics methods are being applied to modeling the products
of an enzymatic hydration and calculating key features of their 1H nmr spectra.
Semi-empirical MO methods help students predict the regioselectivity of
cycloaddition reactions. In the junior physical chemistry laboratory, students
are being introduced to molecular dynamics methods of simulation, allowing the
computation of thermodynamic properties of solutions. At the senior level,
students are making an extended synthetic molecular mechanics, and MO
investigation of rotational barrier in iron-cyclopentadienyl complexes. Modeling
methods are also being incorporated into senior research projects.
