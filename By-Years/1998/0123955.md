The aim of this project is to explore ways of integrating forefront research
into undergraduate education. The PI is creating a collaborative environment in
which research faculty scholars at universities translate their cutting-edge
scientific research into meaningful undergraduate educational experiences.
Participating faculty have a) free access to the PI's open source core software
tools, which ease the development of new software, b) a full set of assessment-
based curriculum development frameworks based on the PI's prior education
efforts, c) access to the education and research staff of the PI and
collaborating institutions, and d) web-based community support. The PI is also
developing collaborations with teaching faculty scholars from 2- and 4-year
colleges and community colleges to facilitate the introduction of research-based
educational materials into their science courses and encourage science research
opportunities for undergraduates. Participating faculty have a) free access to
all educational technologies developed through prior and concurrent development
collaborations, b) free access to assessment-based curriculum activities, c) an
ongoing collaboration with a research university and the research staff of the
PI and collaborators, and d) Web-based community support.
