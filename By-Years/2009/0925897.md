This award funds doctoral dissertation research that uses lab decision making
experiments to test hypotheses about the effects of legislative apportionment on
the allocation of resources. These hypotheses are developed from a political
economy model that uses game theory methods. This model predicts that the
allocation of power to propose how to allocate funds and not the allocation of
power to vote on that proposal that determines how legislatures allocate
resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this award include the
support of graduate education, the involvement of undergraduates in conducting
the research, and the interdisciplinary impact of this research on game theory,
economics, and political science.
