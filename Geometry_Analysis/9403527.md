9403527 Adams The scope of the research entails several projects in the area of
metric rigidity theory on foliated manifolds. The main interest will focus
around geometric-analytic techniques in the longitudinal direction and
ergodicity techniques in the transverse directions respectively of the
foliation. This research has potential applications to other areas of
differential geometry and dynamical systems. ***
