This effort is to explore the improvements in hole quality and drill life of
micro-drills used in the printed circuit board manufacturing industry, by the
utilization of helical points on the drills rather than planar points that are
currently utilized. A new geometrical model that describes a helical point on a
micro -drill will be developed. Based on this model a kinematic mechanism will
be designed and fabricated to grind helical points on micro-drills. The
availability of helically-pointed micro-drills is essential to explore
improvements in performance and life that appear to be theoretically feasible.
This feasibility is based on the fact that helical points offer a much higher
clearance angle distribution along the drill's cutting edge, without weakening
the edge, in comparison to planar pointed drills. This effort that deals only
with micro-drills in combination with the large dollar volume of the printed
circuit board industry and it's strategic importance to the electronic industry,
makes this a high risk venture with a significant potential for large pay-offs.
