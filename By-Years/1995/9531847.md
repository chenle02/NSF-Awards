9531847 Measures The western Atlantic is a good location for examining the
effects of multiple inputs, biogeochemical processes, and circulation on the
concentrations of trace elements. This study will examine the interaction
between inputs, cycling, and transport for Al, Be, Fe, As, Se, Sb, and other
trace elements in the western Atlantic. The cruise track provides opportunities
to collect samples from nearly all of the major intermediate and deep water
masses in the Atlantic, as well as a detailed surface transect across the
western boundary currents in the south Atlantic, the equatorial Atlantic/ITCZ
(which receives large amounts of Saharan dust), and the Amazon plume, (supplying
terrestrial organic ligands, suspended sediments, and colloidal matter). This
cruise track will also meet the second research objective, to coordinate and
execute the third Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission Baseline Expedition
for Trace Metals and Organic Contaminants in the western South and equatorial
Atlantic. The stated goal of these expeditions, as envisioned by the IOC, is to
characterize the major water masses of the world's oceans for as many
contaminants as possible so that changes due to anthropogenic activity can be
identified.
