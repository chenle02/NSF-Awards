A principal aim of this project is to assess the stability of a local wetland
and to promote awareness of the need to preserve wetland ecosystems. Studies of
this wetland ecosystem, therefore, are determining population densities and are
providing data on diversity. We have recently added a course in field biology to
our curriculum and students in this course also participate directly in the
research. Videotapes describing the life of the wetland are also being produced
for use by the community. It is expected that the project will provide
additional education opportunities such as cooperative learning and independent
study.
