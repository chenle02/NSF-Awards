9360936 Fang This SBIR Phase I project will seek to determine the technical
feasibility of an implantable nerve stimulator for bladder control in patients
with paralysis. During the period of the award the system requirements would be
established for clinical application, conceptual design for the implantable
stimulator and its external controller, the waveform generator, and the output
driver. Successful completion of the Phase I project will provide the basis for
identifying the technical challenges for Phase II prototype device development.
