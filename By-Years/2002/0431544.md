The University of St. Thomas (MN) has established partnerships with 10 Twin
Cities metro area high schools to develop, pilot, implement, and evaluate a
comprehensive strategy for increasing the number of undergraduate students
seeking and completing degrees in STEM disciplines, especially the physical
sciences and engineering. Project goals are to: 1) attract new students to STEM
major degree programs, 2) increase the ethnic diversity of STEM students, and 3)
enhance the retention of students in STEM programs by improving the quality of
those programs in significant ways. Numerically, the project will recruit 100
new students into STEM fields over five years and, through improved retention,
retain an additional 50 students in these programs. Specific programmatic
initiatives deriving from our partnerships include: 1) a new Summer Academy for
20 incoming freshmen designed to provide students, especially women and students
of color, with enhanced math and science background prior to beginning their
STEM studies; 2) a variety of academic, social, and career oriented programming
designed to foster community among STEM students and faculty; 3) two new,
interdisciplinary January term courses that introduce students to STEM research,
internships, and careers; 4) and faculty development workshops on integrating
math into science courses, learning styles, transfer of learning, team teaching,
and developing minority connections.
