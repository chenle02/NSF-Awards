This award supports the development of a pH-stat instrument that does not
require any liquid reagents to operate. This instrument will operate using low
level electrical currents injected into tiny sample droplets via a suitable
miniature electrode to produce hydrogen or hydroxyl ions needed to keep pH
constant. This concept has the potential to enable fine chemical manipulations
of specimens as small as a fraction of a rain drop, without reagents, easily
controlled from a laptop computer. The injected current can be directly
translated into the amount of acid or base added using Faraday's law. This may
render the scheme calibration free. No dependence of the delivery mechanism on
temperature is expected. The required instrumentation is simple, small, and
portable. For all these reasons the main idea of this project is a new concept
in experimental biology.
