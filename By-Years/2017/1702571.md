Water resources are a critical issue for agriculture in the arid parts of the
US, and it is likely that water availability will be affected by future climate
change, yet it remains difficult to predict the magnitude of future rainfall
changes. The proposed research will develop a new and precise method for
quantifying past changes in water table depth, using measurements of dissolved
noble gas isotopes in ancient groundwater. This knowledge of past water table
fluctuations will help illuminate the regional rainfall response to climate
variations, and strengthen predictions by providing rigorous tests of rainfall
models. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The method is based on the demonstrated fact that
heavy gases settle to the bottom of the stagnant column of air in the soil above
the water table depth. The deeper the water table, the more extreme the
enrichment of heavy isotopes, and these heavy isotopes become dissolved in the
water thus preserving information about the water table depth in aquifers
containing ancient groundwater. This groundwater is already routinely sampled to
learn about past temperature from the abundance of the noble gases; the proposed
research will add water table depth to the information that can be extracted
from the samples.
