9703427 Chrzan This is a CAREER award to a new faculty member. The grant is
comprised of a research component integrated with an educational component. The
goals of the award are to (1) develop a detailed atomic and meso-scale
understanding of the mechanical properties of Ni3Al (and related materials); (2)
develop microstructure-based constitutive relationships for these materials; (3)
make computational materials science more accessible to the typical materials
scientist through development and teaching of a computational materials science
"lab" course; and, (4) make the course and codes widely available via the
internet. %%% This is a CAREER award to a new faculty member. The grant is
