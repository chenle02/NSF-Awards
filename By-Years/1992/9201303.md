This project will investigate efficient manipulation of finite groups and
estimation of their parameters. The main focus is on the design and analysis of
efficient algorithms for large group-theoretic problems. While interested in
improved asymptotic performance, the project will also emphasize practicability,
demonstrating the relevance of the asymptotic paradigm to efficient
implementation. Of interest also is the development of parallel versions of the
algorithms. The investigation will be extended to matrix groups, the most
frequently occurring representations of finite groups. Finally, the project will
investigate important parameters of groups, especially the estimation of
diameters of various classes of Cayley graphs.
