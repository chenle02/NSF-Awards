This is a proposal to obtain a 300 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer
equipped with variable temperature 1H/13C probe and a variable temperature
controller. The instrument will serve as a major research tool by members of the
chemistry department in the following areas: 1. isolation, structure proof and
synthesis of biologically significant natural products. 2. NMR studies of
calmodulin - peptide interactions 3. thermodynamic study of the hydrophobic
interaction These research efforts require high sensitivity and resolution plus
variable temperature control. Acquisition of this instrument is expected to have
a dramatic, positive effect on the research efforts of the Department. The
utilization of the instrument will involve 5-10 undergraduates a year in senior
research and similar number in summer research.
