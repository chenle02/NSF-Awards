A theoretical investigation is proposed for the temporal evolution of quantum
correlations&lt;br/&gt;in physical situations that are both appropriate for AMO
experimentation and also give access to the unexplored realm of very high
entanglement. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Calculational methods using the Schmidt
decomposition will be employed to examine EPR correlations for massive particles
in infinite-dimensional (continuous) Hilbert space. &lt;br/&gt;A wide class of
so-called breakup processes has been identified for which a &lt;br/&gt;universal
or generic time-dependent correlation theory appears realistic, and it is
proposed&lt;br/&gt;that work toward such a unifying theory be
undertaken.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Funds will be used to support a graduate
student working on the aforementioned problem.&lt;br/&gt;
