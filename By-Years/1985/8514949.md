The goal of this research is to improve our understanding of the process of
mechanical design. This understanding will improve future computer-aided design
tools. The method for gaining this understanding will be to perform an
experiment in which designers are given carefully constructed problems and to
study their protocols for creating a design from specifications to
implementation. Using existing models from the field of artificial intelligence,
the protocols will be formalized. A major effort of this research project will
be directed toward developing a formal language for stating specifications, a
formal language for describing artifacts (objects, processes, or systems), a
system for qualitative simulation and constraint propagation, and an intelligent
database system to support design. A breakthrough in any of these areas would be
a major advance for design theory.
