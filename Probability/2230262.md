This project aims to understand the behavior of large random systems at positive
temperature. Examples of such models are given by random three-dimensional
stepped surfaces, interacting particles systems, the six-vertex model (used to
describe the structure of a thin film of water molecules), and interacting
avoiding random walkers (sometimes called line ensembles). Many of these models
have remarkable algebraic and combinatorial properties, which makes their study
tractable. The main goal of the project is to obtain a detailed description
(involving exact mathematical formulas) of the asymptotic behavior of these
random systems as their size (volume and/or the number of particles) grows.

The project involves three interwined directions of research. The first involves
the derivation and asymptotic analysis of joint observables for integrable
models in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. A distinguished
feature of integrable models is that they allow for various exact formulas of
different observables. A notorious problem with many of these formulas is that
they are difficult to study asymptotically, due to the presence of hard to
control cross-terms, and one of the goals of the project is to develop a
framework for analyzing these cross-terms. The second direction of the project
is to establish universal scaling limits for Gibbsian line ensembles. Various
integrable models, such as Hall-Littlewood processes and the log-gamma polymer,
naturally carry a structure of a line ensemble and it is expected that these
ensembles converge to the parabolic Airy line ensemble (one of the universal
scaling limits in the KPZ universality class) -- the project seeks to establish
this statement. The third direction of the project is to utilize loop equations
to understand the scaling limits of multi-level interacting particle systems,
which are discrete analogues of the beta-corners processes from random matrix
theory and are related to Jack symmetric functions.
