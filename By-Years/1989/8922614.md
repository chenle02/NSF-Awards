A modern ultrahigh-vacuum pumping system is acquired in order to test the
proposition that carbon-hydrogen bonds can be activated photolytically in
molecules adsorbed on very small metal clusters. This acquisition will enable
the investigator to obtain preliminary data to demonstrate the feasibility of
this approach. If successful, it could open up a new avenue of catalytic
research.
