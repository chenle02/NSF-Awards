ABSTRACT CTS-9615903 This is a comprehensive analytical and experimental study
of microscale heat transfer in porous silicon. Analytical work incorporates
size, structure, and surface-area effects into a general microscale heat-
transfer framework to predict thermal conductivity, optical properties, and
radiative transfer. Established experimental techniques are used to examine
these effects and to determine key model parameters. Simple engineering models
for energy absorption and transport in porous silicon are developed for use in
design of porous-silicon-based optoelectronic devices. There is no extant
analytical framework for predicting the combined effect of crystallite size and
structural randomness on energy absorption and transport in nanometric-scale
random structures. Porous silicon, which has such a structure, can emit visible
light in response to optical or electrical stimulation at room temperature
offering a prospect of large-scale integration of optics and electronics.
Knowledge of the thermophysical properties and energy transport mechanisms is
critical for design of porous-silica-based devices like optical switches and
light-emitting diodes (LEDs), as well as for the laser processing of these
devices.
