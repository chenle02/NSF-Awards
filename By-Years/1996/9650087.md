To enrich the chemistry experience for nonmajors through the development of an
introductory chemistry laboratory course for honors and nonhonors students, the
department is purchasing a Parr Plain Jacket Oxygen Bomb Calorimeter and a
Tecator Kjeldahl apparatus. In the laboratory, students may initially perform
small-scale experiments from the Chemistry in Context Laboratory Manual, many of
which involve food analyses. Using the new equipment, students analyze the
caloric and nitrogen contents of popular foods as these determinations are
performed in the food industry. Such an opportunity both promotes student
interest and provides students with a realistic knowledge of the utility of
chemistry. Inclusion of the Kjeldahl analysis provides a clear illustration of
the risk/benefit considerations made when working with solutions and compounds
that are commonly thought of as being hazardous.
