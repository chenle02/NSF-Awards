The principal investigator will carry out research in second order asymptotics,
where he is among the leading experts in the world. Cramer-Edgeworth expansions
are a powerful tool in approximations of distributions. The advances made so far
relate to continuous distributions with smoothness properties. The current
project will find such expansions for discrete distributions. Since the data in
real life is always discrete, such expansions will be more suitable for
applications. The research is based on highly computational rather than
analytical tools.
