Dr. Stephen Beckerman will use this award to complete ethnographic research on a
South American tropical forest society, the Barí of Venezuela. There are four
major data gaps to be addressed in this research: 1) the locations and
identities of all Barí local and territorial groups; 2) Barí relationships with
non-Barí neighbors; 3) partible paternity, a very rare kinship system in which
multiple fathers share paternal status for a single child; and 4) the
relationship between household economy and marriage practices.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Completing documentation of Barí society is important
because there are very few groups for which pre-contact ecological and
demographic information still can be gathered. Research to date has shown that
Barí social practices were ecologically sound. For example, partible paternity
significantly increases child survivorship. Completing documentation of the Barí
will help scientists to understand the full range of human socioecological
systems. The research also supports international scientific collaboration.
