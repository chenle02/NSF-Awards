The proposed conference will bring together leading national and international
researchers and practitioners from developmental and cognitive psychology, game
design, and media to examine how learning transfers from video game play to
formal and informal learning. The conference will convene in New York City and
serve to lay the foundation for an interdisciplinary New York-based community of
researchers and practitioners interested in examining the implications of video
game play on learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Invited participants will address
cognitive skills and content knowledge that children and adolescents acquire and
refine during video game play; game features that captivate and promote skills
development among game players; and evidence of skill and content knowledge
transfer from video game play to informal and formal learning. Discussion of
these issues will culminate in specification of the most appropriate research
agenda to investigate the academic potential of video game play, particularly
using those games that children and adolescent players find most compelling.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An edited book will be published of the conference
proceedings. The audience for this book will be academics, educators, game
designers, media professionals, and policymakers interested in understanding the
potential of video game learning for formal and informal instruction based on
the most current research and practice.
