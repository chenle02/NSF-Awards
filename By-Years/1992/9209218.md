The synthesis and chemical reactivity of a variety of fluorinated reactive
intermediates and related species will be investigated. Among the intermediates
to be characterized spectroscopically are triplet halocarbenes and
difluorovinylidene. In addition, the thermal and photochemical reactivity of
fluorinated cumulones, difluorocyclopropenone, difluoroacetylene, and
fluoropropynoyl fluoride, will be studied. In the case of the fluorinated
cumulenones, as well as partially fluorinated fused cyclobutenes, semi-
fluorinated polymers will be synthesized and characterized with respect to
conductivity and selected physical properties. In an attempt to define new
methods for carbene production, photolysis of cyclic alkene derived ozonides
will be investigated. %%% This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports
the continuing investigation of reactive fluorinated compounds by Professor W.
P. Dailey at the University of Pennsylvania. A major goal of the research will
be to generate, detect, and follow the subsequent reactions of highly reactive
intermediates called carbenes which only exist at room temperature for a
fraction of a second. Special spectroscopic techniques are required to identify
these reactive carbenes, which are important since they control the rate and
type of products formed in a variety of chemical transformations. A secondary
goal of the project will be to synthesize and characterize polymeric materials
with fluorine groups attached. Such materials are of particular importance in
fabricating surfaces with low surface tension capable of repelling water.
