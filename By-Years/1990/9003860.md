Since 1983, the National Science Foundation has funded research with a phased-
array HF radar at Goose Bay, Labrador. This radar was constructed by The Johns
Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory to study the formation electron
density irregularities in the E and F regions of the high - latitude plasma
ionosphere and to study the lagre-scale structure and dynamics of high-latitude
convection. This grant provides support for studying the dynamics of the
convection response in both the dayside and nightside ionosphere to changes in
the interplanetary magnetic field and solar wind. Additional projects to be
studied include convections structures resulting from oscillatory or transient
magnetospheric boundary disturbances and the formation of high-latitude
ionospheric irregularities. A portion of the grant will be used to continue to
maintain a data base of continuous HF radar observations of the high-latitude
ionosphere which will be available to other scientists. ***
