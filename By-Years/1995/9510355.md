9510355 Popovic During the grant period several problems in quantum insulators
will be explored on small Si metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors
fabricated at IBM. Issues that will be studied include: (1) Kondo impurity vs
Coulomb blockade in disordered hopping and tunneling systems, (2) statistics of
localized states and noise in correlated insulators, (3) lineshape of resonance
peaks in correlated insulators, (4) direct measurement of resonant tunneling and
hopping conduction via two different paths, (5) Hall effects and magnetic field
driven metal-insulator transitions in Kondo systems, (6) length scales
associated with quantum interference in correlated insulators. The experiments
will comprise linear and non-linear transport meassurements in zero magnetic
field and in non-zero field. Equilibrium and shot noise experiments will be
analyzed in terms of recent theoretical developments about noise and the
response of correlated systems to shed new light on the problem of correlated
electron transport in quantum insulators. %%% During the period of this award,
recently discovered behavior in very short transistors that cannot be understood
in terms of the conventional physics of electronic devices will be explored
through a variety of experiments. The research will be centered on electronic
quantum transport (discrete moverment of electrons) in submicron-size silicon
transistors (one micron = 40 millionths of an inch). One focus of this effort
will be nonlinear effects (the quality which gives any transistor the ability to
amplify), which are also significant for a wide variety of applications. This
research project will be a university-industry collaboration among three
institutions: the measurements will be performed at the City College of CUNY and
the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and the transistors will be
fabricated at t he IBM T. J. Watson Research Center. ***
