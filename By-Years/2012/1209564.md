Males and females have nearly identical genomes, yet males and females can
differ dramatically in appearance, physiology, and behavior. The proximate
explanation for sex differences in phenotype is differences in gene expression,
i.e., which genes are ?turned on or off? in males and females. But exactly how
gender affects gene expression is an open question where much remains to be
learned. Hormones such as testosterone are likely candidates for controlling
differences in gene expression of genes in males and females. To date much of
the research in this area has focused on experimental manipulation of hormones,
rather than on the role of natural, individual variation in levels of
circulating hormone. The research supported by this award asks two primary
questions: (1) what genes and gene networks are affected by natural, individual
variation in testosterone phenotype, and (2) how do males and females differ in
affected genes and gene networks? The dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemalis), a North-
American songbird, will be the subject of study because of the recent
development of genomic tools in this system and the wealth of historical data on
its natural history, response to testosterone, and sex differences in behavior;
all studied in a wild population. Successful completion of the aims of this
project will enhance our understanding of the genes and gene networks that are
related to natural variation in testosterone. The research proposed here will
have broader impacts because it will provide unique opportunities for
undergraduate research: the preliminary stages of this research have already led
to undergraduate research opportunities for four individuals from
underrepresented groups.
