With this research, the Principal Investigator (PI) seeks to utilize data from
an inter-hemispheric network of 13 conjugate-point all sky imagers (ASI) to
investigate various upper atmosphere phenomena that are manifestation of a
couple ionosphere-thermosphere-magnetosphere (ITM) system. This study, utilizing
data from instruments deployed globally, offers a unique way to make progress by
studying the effects a single cause has in two hemispheres simultaneously; with
high-resolution images illuminating the roles receptor conditions play for each
phenomenon studied. The broader impacts of this project are very strong,
spanning education and training of students, outreach activities, and
international collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific goals of this
research, i.e., to study a broad set of upper atmospheric science topics that
are manifestations of highly coupled systems within and connected to the ITM
regions, are highly compelling, and the utilization of a global network of
imagers would open new scientific investigations enabled by this comprehensive
observational capability. The distinguished high qualifications of the
investigators, together with an impressive and long-standing record of
significant productivity represent high likelihood of success.
