9307823 Kesseli The long term objectives are to define the genetic changes and
evolutionary processes that lead to dioecy (separate male and female individuals
in a population) and to understand the common factors that may be responsible
for the repeated occurrence of the dioecious reproductive strategy among living
organisms. %%% Specifically the genetic bases for the evolution of dioecy in the
plant genus Silene is explored. Four short term objectives will be pursued. The
first is to develop genetic maps for the sex chromosomes of the dioecious plant
species Silene latifolia and S. otitis. The second is to evaluate gender
stability and potential shifts in breeding system in the genus. The third is to
characterize and define the organization of the genus responsible for sex
determination. The fourth is to compare the architecture of these genes among
related dioecious species and hermaphroditic species which lack separate sexes
and sex chromosomes.
