The Pacific northwest consists of a number of exotic terranes that were
accreted to the continental margin beginning in the Cretaceous, however the
tectonics and timing of the assembly is controversial. This renewal of a
collaborative project will address the mechanics and processes of mid-
Cretaceous Orogeny in the southeast Coast Plutonic Complex of British Columbia
and its extension in the Crystalline Core of the North Cascades of Washington.
Models of orogenesis to be tested include bulk shortening, transpressive
thrusting, contractional thrusting and magmatic accretion. Evaluation of these
models will utilize mineral thermobarometry, fabric analysis and U-Pb Zircon
geochronology and pertains to a larger view of the orogen as either a
collisional welt related to terrane accretion, or as a complex Andean-type
magmatic arc developed on the edge of the North American craton.
