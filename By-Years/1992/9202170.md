Microlithographic quasi-two-dimensional complex surfaces will be constructed
through which DNA will be electrophoresed. The motions of large single molecules
through these obstacle arrays will be observed using real-time fluorescence
imaging techniques. %%% These devices should allow the fractionation of DNA
molecules at the chromosome length scale in a highly reproducible environment.
The ability to bind and move very long DNA molecules through synthetic
microlithographic surfaces may be used to align chromosomal length DNA molecules
on complex designed surfaces, to analyze the DNA sequence using scanning
techniques and to probe DNA structure using optical sensors. The overall aim of
the project is single molecule processing.
