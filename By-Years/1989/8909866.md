Over the last decade statistical data inference have played an important role in
establishing the basic facts used for public policy, e.g. estimating the
prevalence of HIV infection, determining the risk of cancer from occupational or
environmental exposures, and in the legal setting, e.g. cases concerning
employment discrimination. The purpose of this project is to study statistical
problems arising in these contexts and to develop appropriate statistical
methodologies for their solution. Research on procedures for estimating the
prevalence of rare diseases which preserve anonymity by combining individual
samples into batches prior to testing is a major goal. These methods should
enable health specialists to obtain the cooperation of the public as infected
individuals and non-infected persons who are misclassified (false positive) will
not be identified. Robust methods which led to statistically valid inferences
when several scientifically plausible models may underlie the data or when a few
observations may be erroneous will continue to emphasized. In addition,
statistical methods continue to play a role in the analysis of pay, promotion
and hiring data in employment discrimination cases. In particular, alternative
regression approaches will be analyzed that were used by parties in the Watson
v. Fort Worth Bank case.
