This award will provide supplementary support to enable Dr. Mark A. Matthews of
the University of California, Davis to conduct collaborative research for eight
months with Dr. Kenji Omasa of the National Institute for Environmental Studies
in Tsukuba, Japan. They will investigate the physiological mechanisms by which
water deficits inhibit photosynthesis and by which photosynth- eitic acclimation
to dry conditions occurs. At low water status, stomatal closure and inhibition
of chloroplast function reduce photosynthesis. Although significant nonstomatal
limitation to photosynthesis at low water status is widely accepted, most
studies to date have assumed that rates of photosynthesis and transpiration are
homogeneous over the experimental leaf area. This project will use state-of-the
art instrumentations for localized measurements of leaf physiology to take into
account the heterogeneity in stomatal closure that may occur at low leaf water
status. This will allow a more rigorous assessment of the relative importance of
stomatal and nonstomatal limitation to photosynthesis under dry conditions.
