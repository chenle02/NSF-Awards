The new data acquisition systems with support modules will be purchased to
replace outmoded equipment. The new test machinery will be dedicated to support
engineering research in : improvement of mechanical excavators for constructing
high level nuclear repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada; improvement of surface
drilling for site characterization at the Yucca Mountain site; futuristic
excavation technologies for hard rock mining; evaluating the mappability of rock
fractures.
