The research objectives of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER)
Program award are to (a) experimentally and computationally elucidate the
fundamental mechanisms underpinning ion conductivity and other relevant thermo-
mechanical properties in next generation polymer nanocomposite electrolytes, and
(b) discover the effect of mechanical stresses and strains on electrochemical
performance and potential coupling effects in flexible and stretchable lithium
ion batteries. Fundamental understanding of electrochemical and mechanical
properties in stretchable PNEs and Li ion batteries will pave the way for the
realization of many tantalizing applications such as intelligent electronic
textiles, rollable computers, electronic eyes among
others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Outreach efforts will aim to (a) educate general
public and students of all levels on science and engineering, with specific
emphasis on energy storage and (b) increase interest and participation in
engineering among minorities and women. Educational outreach will be
accomplished through dissemination of energy-science related issues by
occasionally hosting a radio show (with an audience exceeding 50,000 listeners),
participation in the international sustainable world energy engineering
environment project to motivate high school students towards energy research and
collaboration with an ongoing NSF GK12 program at UH to target local schools
with significant Hispanic and African-American populations. New graduate and
undergraduate courses themed around energy with significant hands-on component
will be developed.
