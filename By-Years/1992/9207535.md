It is known that a hormone, luteinizing hormone (LH), produced by the pituitary
gland induces a number of changes in the follicular wall which results in a
rupture of this wall and release of the egg or ovum. The goal of this proposal
is to elucidate the mechanism through which luteinizing hormone acting on the
granulosa and theca layers of preovulatory follicule induces ovulation. The
hypothesis to be tested is that one of the primary roles of LH in the induction
of ovulation in the hen involves production of the plasminogen activator and
collagenase. These key enzymes either dissociate or degrade the fibers in the
stigma region. This research will lead to new fundamental findings.
