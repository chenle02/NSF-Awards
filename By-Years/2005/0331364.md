The general objective of this research program is to understand the regulation
and flux control of central carbon metabolism in photosynthetic microorganisms
and in particular the interaction of central carbon metabolic reactions and
downstream pathways of carbon utilization for product synthesis. The specific
aims of the present research are to: (i) evaluate the effect of modifications in
specific single-gene expression on the rate of growth, CO2 fixation and
biopolymer product synthesis, (ii) investigate the potential of modifications in
multiple-gene expression for achieving improved phenotypes, (iii) elucidate the
mechanism of regulation of the biopolymer synthesis pathway to allow high
production under realistic levels of CO2 partial pressures, and (iv) evaluate
the physiology of promising recombinant Synechocystis strains.
