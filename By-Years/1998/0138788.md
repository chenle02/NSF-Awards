"Addressing Accessibility in Mathematics, Phase 2" is a three-year Professional
Development Materials project. Education Development Center, Inc. (EDC), in
partnership with CAST, proposes to create professional development materials to
help teachers enable all students, including those with cognitive, sensory,
physical and emotional disabilities, to be successful with standards-based,
middle-school mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work is based on a
two-year NSF "proof of concept" project (Addressing Accessibility in Middle
School Mathematics, Phase 1). The proposed materials comprise six components:
(1) an Accessibility Toolkit, (2) Workshop Modules, (3) Collaborative Planning
Group Resources, (4) an Addressing Accessibility Implementation Guide, (5) a
Guide for Writing Accessible Mathematics Curriculum, and (6) an Addressing
Accessibility Website. The project's audience will be mathematics and special-
education teachers, school and district leaders, professional-development and
technical-assistance providers, curriculum developers and publishers because
each is a key stakeholder in ensuring that students with disabilities receive
the best possible mathematics education.
