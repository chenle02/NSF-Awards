TransPAC4 is a cross-organizational approach to provide services and bandwidth
connecting scientific researchers in the US with their counterparts in Asia.
This connectivity has an immediate impact on the research environment, and also
anticipates future application and technology
advances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Indiana University (IU) leads the TransPAC4
Collaboration in a cooperative partnership with Asian regional partnerships
including: Asia Pacific Advanced Network (APAN), the Trans-Eurasia Information
Network (TEIN), and the Delivery of Advanced Network Technology to Europe
(DANTE) project. Research and Education networking partners include the Japanese
National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT), the
Japanese National Institute of Informatics (NII), the Singapore Advanced
Research and Education Network (SingAREN), and the Taiwan National Network.
Domestic partners include Internet2, the Energy Sciences network (ESnet), and
Pacific Wave's international peering facility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition
to providing high performance network capacity in the form of 10G-100G circuits
and associated services, the project focuses on increasing the partnerships
needed to take advantage of these links, including but not limited to growing
communities in geosciences, bioinformatics, and particle physics. The TransPAC4
Collaboration expands and enhances end user engagement and operational
integration in Asia-Pacific. Close cooperation among participants serves to
maximize US-Asia connectivity, increase collaborations, deploy dynamic circuit
services to meet the needs of high-bandwidth applications, and increase
reliability through alternative circuits. The project also extends the use of
Software Defined Networking (SDN)and network acceleration services.
