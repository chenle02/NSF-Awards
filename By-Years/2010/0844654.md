The proposal offers an innovative approach to automatic music audio analysis
using signal processing and harmonic methods. This is a contribution to the
field of Music Information Retrieval (MIR) based on isolating chord sequences in
western tonal music archives. The approach is modeled in part on work in
bioinformatics, particularly work in structure alignment. The proposed work
intends to expand on current approaches to music analysis whcih are limited
because of insufficient attention to temporality - a key aspect of musical
composition. A new signal processing method is proposed for the isolation of
chords and chord sequences.
