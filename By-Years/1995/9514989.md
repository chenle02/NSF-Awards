Gilbert Metcalf National Bureau of Economic Research SBR-9514989 This research
will investigate the returns to households of making energy conservation
investments. It will use a large data set on residential energy consumption,
which includes information on income and family characteristics as well as
detailed characteristics of the home. The research will consider the impact of
the rebound effect, where consumers may increase their use of energy when energy
conservation reduce the costs of overall energy use. The effect of weather
conditions on energy consumption will be taken into account. The analysis
produced by this research will be useful to other researchers and policy- makers
as well.
