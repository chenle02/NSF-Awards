This proposal requests funds for the purchase of a preparative ultracentrifuge
with rotors and a tube slicer kit. These instruments will be used by five
investigators for research involving the isolation of chromosomal, plasmid, and
chloroplast DNA as well as protein and RNA. The instrumentation will
significantly strengthen the research capabilities of faculty in the area of
molecular and cellular biology.
