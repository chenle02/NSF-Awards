Kumar will continue his work on equivariant cohomology with generalized
coefficients. He will study a new G-equivariant cohomology theory of a G-space,
where G is a real Lie group. This new cohomology theory is defined as the
cohomology of the complex which is obtained from the polynomial functions on the
Lie algebras of G by generalized functions on the Lie algebra. This cohomology
is encountered in studying the index theory of transversally elliptic operators
on G-manifolds. The theory of Lie groups, named in honor of the Norwegian
mathematician Sophus Lie, has been one of the major themes in twentieth century
mathematics. As the mathematical vehicle for exploiting the symmetries inherent
in a system, the representation theory of Lie groups has had a profound impact
upon mathematics itself, particularly in analysis and number theory, and upon
theoretical physics, especially quantum mechanics and elementary particle
physics.
