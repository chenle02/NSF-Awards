9360877 Pierce Cygnus Laser proposes to replace the semiconductor laser as a
source for high resolution laser spectroscopy and high precision atomic clocks
with a compact, all solid state laser source based upon titanium-doped sapphire
(Ti:S). Recent spectacular improvements in the efficiency and output power of a
continuous-wave frequency doubled diode pumped Nd:YAG laser has made this system
feasible in the near term, with attractive overall wall plug efficiency. Our
quasi monolithic single frequency Ti:S laser is approximately the same size as a
stabilized single mode diode laser system, but it is intrinsically frequency
stable, dramatically reducing the complexity and increasing the reliability of
the active stabilization system. It will be an ideal source for the next
generation of atomic clocks and other frequency standards. ***
