This award to Laura A. Katz, Associate Professor of Biological Sciences at Smith
College, will support systematic (taxonomic) studies of protozoans in two
classes of ciliates. The diverse class Colpodea includes many soil ciliates,
whereas members of the class Spirotrichea are abundant in freshwater and marine
ecosystems. Numerous taxonomic hypotheses have emerged from studies of the
visible structures (morphology) of these ciliates. To date, only a singe nuclear
gene has been analyzed to assess hypotheses based on morphology. This award will
dramatically increase the amount of molecular data from these microbes and will
allow further evaluation of taxonomic hypotheses. Specifically, the work will
focus on the nuclear gene plus other genes isolated from ciliate mitochondrial
genomes. The resulting data will further our understanding of the evolution of
ciliates, diverse microorganisms that are important ecologically and are
commonly used in other biological research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will
support the training of students at both the undergraduate and graduate levels.
There will be a continued recruitment of students from traditionally
underrepresented groups and first generation college students, in part through a
program founded by the principal investigator: Achieving Excellence in
Mathematics, Engineering and Science (AEMES). AEMES is designed to enable
diverse undergraduates to excel in science early in their studies at Smith
College. At least one graduate student will also be trained, both in scientific
methods and in effective mentoring of undergraduates. For all participants,
training will be in the theoretical and practical aspects of molecular
systematic methods. Finally, K-12 efforts will continue to focus on outreach to
schools, with hands-on laboratory instruction at the Smith College campus and
presentations at local schools.&lt;br/&gt;
