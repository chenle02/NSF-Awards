This proposal pertains to a conference on Designs for Generalized Linear Models
(GLMs) to be organized by the Department of Statistics, University of Florida,
and the Statistical Engineering Division of the National Institute of Standards
and Technology (NIST). The meeting will be of a three-day duration (April 18-20,
2002) and will be held on the NIST campus in Gaithersburg, MD. The Conference
will feature leading active researchers in the field of GLMs. One goal of the
conference is to provide a forum for interaction among people working on diverse
areas of GLMs. The second goal is to provide a stimulus to young researchers and
graduate students working in the design area of GLMs.

Funding from this proposal will provide travel grants for eight doctoral
students and junior scientists to attend the Conference. Special efforts will be
made to solicit applications from members of under-represented groups (persons
with disabilities, minorities, and women). Priority will be given to Ph.D.
students who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents. It is hoped that the
grant awardees will benefit from the interaction with the invited speakers, who
can provide mentoring and role modeling for the awardees.
