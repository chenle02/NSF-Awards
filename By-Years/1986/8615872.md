This project is in the general area of materials chemistry. It involves the
chemical synthesis of "effect" polymers which will exhibit non-linear optical
properties. Stiff polymers with extended axial dimensions may possess a wide
variety of material properties of interest, including special optical
properties, and the ability to exhibit extraordinary strength. The polymers
under investigation are characterized by extended helical conformations which
arise because of the interplay between conjugative and steric forces. The
helical dissymmetry of these systems allows control of the axial dimension
through stereochemistry. This research will provide a correlation between the
materials properties and those chemical factors which impart chain stiffness.
The materials chemistry aspects of this research have important implications in
telecommunications and optical information processing.
