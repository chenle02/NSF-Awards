The neuropeptide arginine-vasopressin (AVP) is involved in the regulation of
diverse social behaviors in adulthood. However, it is less clear how the AVP
system in the brain regulates social behaviors during the juvenile period. This
project will elucidate the mechanisms by which AVP regulates social play and
social novelty-preference in juvenile male and female rats. Complementary
approaches will be used, including microdialysis, pharmacological manipulations,
and neuronal activation, to elucidate interactions between AVP and GABA systems
in the lateral septum and AVP-mediated alterations in neuronal activation in
projection areas of the lateral septum. The results will provide new insights on
the regulation of social interactions among juveniles, which are known to be
critically important for development of social competence and socialization in
mammals, including rodents and humans.

The research will be integrated with an education plan in which new initiatives
will be developed to expose high school and undergraduate students, particularly
those from minority and under-represented groups, to hands-on behavioral
neuroscience research. The research and education plans will build a firm
foundation for a lifetime of integrated contributions to behavioral neuroscience
research and education. Research findings will be disseminated to the public
through public lectures, publications, and a web site. The archiving, access,
and sharing of data will be according to Boston College policies.
