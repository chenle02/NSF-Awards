This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address bulk
micromachining of single crystal silicon carbide and III-V nitride
semiconductors to develop miniaturized fluid density and viscosity sensors based
on acoustic wave (AW) principles. Phase I will develop sensors capable of
precisely measuring fluid viscosity and density over wide limits under harsh
operating conditions: high pressure, high temperature, corrosive, or abrasive.
The harsh environments require fabrication of microelectromechanical systems
(MEMS) for fluid viscosity-density sensors from silicon carbide (SiC) and
gallium-aluminum nitride (GaN-AlN) compounds, which have high melting
temperatures (1700-3000 degrees Centigrade) and favorable chemical and
mechanical properties. Phase I will test the feasibility of the micromachined
SiC-AlN fluid viscosity-density sensors by fabricating an unpackaged pre-
prototype device from these materials and demonstrate the measurement of
viscosity and density in a variety of fluids at various temperatures and
pressures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Harsh-environment MEMS fluid viscosity and
density sensors have commercial applications in boreholes for oil exploration
and production, monitoring of engine fluids in automobiles, aerospace and
military vehicles, and monitoring chemical synthesis and production processes.
These devices are expected to increase oil-well production at reduced cost,
promote more efficient use of engine fluids resulting from direct and continuous
feedback of fluid characteristics, and enable real-time in situ monitoring of
chemical processes.&lt;br/&gt;
