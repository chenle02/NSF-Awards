This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This engineering education
research award to Northern Illinois University will employ researchers to
develop and assess the effectiveness of a "minimal" game for use in a sophomore
level Engineering Dynamics course. Since virtual reality games and complex
simulated environments are interesting to teens and young adults, and game
players are motivated to spend time solving challenging complex problems in the
games, it is logical to try to create similar environments for engineering
education. Although students using games may be more engaged and may learn the
material at a deeper level, the specific aspects of complex educational games
that are important for improved learning outcomes are not known. The simpler
"minimal" game will be developed as an instrument to systematically isolate
specific aspects of the video game to determine how and why these aspects
improve learning. This research addresses important questions about the
effectiveness of games developed for educational use in engineering and will
provide guidance for future development. It will contribute significantly to
basic understanding of the effects and roles of educational video games which
will improve learning and better prepare students for engineering
jobs.&lt;br/&gt;
