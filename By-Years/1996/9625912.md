The proposed work involves the design, analysis, and implementation of serial
and parallel algorithms for certain eigenvalue and singular value problems. A
primary goal of this work is to devise algorithms that are fully accurate and
stable when implemented in floating point arithmetic. Because the singular value
and eigenvalue problems arising in real-life applications are often of very
large order, a second goal of this work is to develop variants of these
algorithms that are efficient on distributed-memory MIMD multiprocessors without
loss of accuracy. This class of machines provides both the computational power
and the extensive memory required by large linear algebra problems. The work
will proceed in four phases of increasing complexity. To begin, the PI will
identify and construct stable building blocks for numerical algorithms and
software. For example, they will study the computation of the angle between two
vectors for use in various kinds of elementary plane transformations. The next
phase will be to refine existing algorithms and software to reflect our newest
understanding of accuracy and stability issues. The PI will be particularly
interested in the symmetric eigenproblem and the singular value decomposition.
The third phase will be to develop new algorithms and provide software for
numerical libraries such as LAPACK. The problems of interest include the
generalized and the product singular value problems, and the cosine-sine
decomposition. The final phase will be to map our algorithms efficiently to
distributed-memory multiprocessors while balancing the tradeoff between
parallelism and numerical stability.
