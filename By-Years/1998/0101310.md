This project involves a data-analysis and theoretical investigation into the
properties and causes of steady magnetospheric convection (SMC) events. SMCs are
extended intervals of elevated geomagnetic activity without the occurrence of
substorms. The objectives of this project are (1) to further our understanding
of SMCs by statistically comparing their properties with the properties of non-
SMC periods, (2) to further our understanding of solar-wind/magnetosphere
coupling by using SMCs as a probe of the special solar wind conditions that
drive SMCs, (3) to further our understanding of how bursty bulk flows (BBfs)
transport magnetic flux, energy and momentum in comparison with substorm
transport, and (4) to explore new ideas about why SMCs occur under certain solar
wind conditions.
