1034832&lt;br/&gt;Basu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports upgrade of an
existing thermal ionization mass spectrometer (TIMS) in the Earth and
Environmental Sciences Department at the University of Rochester. The instrument
was installed in 1988 and later upgraded through EAR/IF support (EAR-0732679 )
to support detector electronics and a modern data acquisition system. This
funding will allow for additional electronic component upgrades (magnet power
supply, filament control) that are failing. The TIMS lab at Rochester supports
research and research training in radiogenic isotope geochemistry as applied to
problems in igneous petrology, geochronology and tectonics and environmental
geochemistry including studies of the timing and petrogenesis of rift volcanics
from the Afar basin, geochemical and tectonic studies of Franciscan complex
subduction generated magmatic sequences from the California Coast Ranges, and
studies of the magmagenesis of Rajmahal flood basalts from eastern India. The
proposed upgrade will extend the life of a 22 year old instrument at a fraction
of the cost of a new TIMS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***
