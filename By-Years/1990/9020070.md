This dissertation research award will support the linguistic and ethnographic
research of a cultural anthropologist on the Navajo Indian reservation. The
project will investigate the significance of a linguistic term denoting the
abstract creation principle of "non-constancy" as well as "Navajo mythological
figures", and "berdache" (meaning Native Americans who adopt the behavior,
dress, and/or sexual preferences of the opposite sex). Methods will include
linguistic and ethnographic interviews with medicine people as well as people
identified by the term ("nadleeh"), and archival research. This research will
add to our knowledge of "berdache", and important element of Native American
culture that has been clearly understood. In addition knowledge of the community
understanding and values on these issues can help regional health specialists to
understand Native American sexual behavior, which can help develop culturally
relevant AIDS prevention strategies.
