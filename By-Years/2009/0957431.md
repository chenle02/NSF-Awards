This research seeks to accelerate simulation of quantum circuits through
symbolic and numerical techniques. Large matrices and vectors arising in
quantum-mechanical simulations are represented by graphs and manipulated through
graph algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merits of this research
include the deployment of new, faster graph algorithms for quantum circuit
simulation. These algorithms will be integrated into an established software
framework called QuIDDPro. Faster quantum-circuit simulation will facilitate
evaluation of new quantum algorithms and quantum communication protocols,
support educational activities in quantum information theory, and help in the
design of atomic physics experiments.&lt;br/&gt;
