This proposal is to solicit support for exchanging experience in civil
infrastructures for a group of prospective participants from the United States
at the International Conference and Exhibition on "Extending the Life of
Bridges, Civil and Building Structures," London, United Kingdom, July 4-6, 2001.
The focus of the conference is on bridge investigation and repair, concrete and
composites, and buildings and civil structures All these topics are important
issues pertaining to the performance and safety of civil infrastructure systems
in the United States. It is expected that the conference will help identify
potential cooperative research topics between the participants from the United
States and the United Kingdom on advancing both the state-of-the-art and the
state-of-the-practice in performance evaluation, safety assessment and life-
cycle management of civil infrastructure systems. Research is needed in these
fields to enhance our understanding of the performance of civil infrastructure
systems, to improve current methods for design and safety assessment of new and
existing structural systems, and to permit an optimal management of the civil
infrastructure systems in the United States.
