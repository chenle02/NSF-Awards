Abstract Price

This proposal is directed towards the investigation of some problems on
dynamical systems on von Neumann algebras, and is related to recent work by a
number of authors on the subject of semigroups of endomorphisms on von Neumann
algebra factors. This research project involves a number of areas of
mathematics, including operator algebras, finite fields, number theory, and
combinatorics. In contrast to semigroups of automorphisms, a semigroup of
endomorphisms may be viewed as a dynamical system that may proceed forward but
not backward in time. It is remarkable how challenging this subject has proven
to be in light of the relatively simpler theory of one-parameter semigroups of
automorphisms on a type I factor. A principal goal of this proposal is to make
additional progress in the classification of one-parameter semigroups of unital
endomorphisms, analogous to Wigner's characterization of groups of automorphisms
acting on factors of type I.

The study of operator algebras traces its origins back to the work of von
Neumann and others. Their goal was to construct mathematical models that capture
the behavior of quantum mechanical systems, and to use these models to make
predictions about the time evolution of such systems. As knowledge has grown and
techniques in the field have been refined, connections have been established
between operator algebras and a number of other areas of mathematics and
science. This proposal involves connections among the fields of operator
algebras, commutative algebra, number theory, and combinatorics. The principal
objects of study in this project are known as binary shifts on a certain type of
operator algebra and are defined using bitstreams of 0's and 1's such as one
studies in the theory of linear recurring sequences. A major goal of this
project is to complete the classification of the binary shifts and to relate
this classification to the analysis of linear recurring sequences. Binary shifts
will also be studied for their potential applications to the theory of quantum
dynamical systems, specifically those systems that may proceed forward, but not
backward, in time.
