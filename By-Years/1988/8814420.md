Professor Richard S. Hamilton of the University of California at San Diego will
be principal lecturer at an NSF-CBMS Regional Conference to be held at the
University of Hawaii at Manoa in July of 1989. The lectures will discuss the
intimate connection between parabolic (heat-type) partial differential equations
and geometric structures on differentiable manifolds, in which developments in
each subject have shed light on the other.
