The 1992 Gordon Conference on Condensed Matter Physics is devoted to "Quantum
Collective States in Solids with Localized Moments." Topics include multi-
channel Kondo phenomena, one-dimensional antiferromagnetic chains,
unconventional superconductors and theory of the metal-insulator transition. The
goal of the conference is to address important topics at the frontiers of modern
Condensed Matter Physics while also providing surveys of several more mature
areas that continue to provide surprises. The funds will be used to assist
graduate students to attend the conference.
