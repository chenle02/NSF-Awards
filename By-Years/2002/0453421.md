We will offer an 8 week REU in geometric analysis/mathematical physics at
Brigham Young University (BYU) for 8 students during the summers of 2005, 2006,
and 2007. The program will consist of two research groups working with 2 faculty
mentors and 1 graduate student assistant. The two research topics will be
selected from three areas related to the PI's expertise and experience. These
areas are: geometric optimization; minimal surfaces; and mathematical physics.
The objectives of this program are: (1) to&lt;br/&gt;provide undergraduate
students with the opportunity to experience doing mathematical research; (2) to
encourage undergraduate students, especially female students and students from
institutions with limited research opportunities, to attend graduate school in
mathematics; and (3) to prepare participants to be successful in graduate
school.&lt;br/&gt;
