The objective of this proposal is to conduct a preliminary
analytical/experimental investigation on the effects of solitons in solid
materials. Soliton is a single isolated wave pulse which propagates at a
constant velocity without change in shape or amplitude in a nonlinear elastic
medium. Since its discovery in 1834, it has been studied theoretically but to
date it has never been recorded experimentally in solids. This is an Expedited
Award for Novel Research in which the PIs will attempt to detect the solitons
indirectly by impacting a one dimensional sandwich model which is fabricated
with alternating metal and rubber plates. Successive spallation of the metal
plates will be an indirect and simple evidence of the existence of solitons. In
addition to its academic interest, this soliton study will provide an insight to
the dynamic fracture of elastomeric spring and in the design of shock isolation
devices.
