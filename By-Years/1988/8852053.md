This project proposes to begin the first phase of the development of a modern
physics laboratory facility for freshman and sophomore science majors. Students
principally affected will be majors in physics, engineering, mathematics,
electro-optics and the biological sciences. The equipment proposed for purchase
consists of six student gamma ray multi-channel analyzer stations. Each station,
which typically will accommodate two students, has an IBM compatible Intel 80286
based microcomputer and plotter interfaced with a multi-channel analyzer board.
A scintillation detector and amplifier detects gamma radiation from a number of
sources, enabling the students to perform experiments in which isotopes are
identified, absorption coefficients are measured and half-lifes determined. The
microcomputers purchased under this proposal will also be used to interface with
other experiments in the laboratory and to run related software packages.
Moorpark College will match the NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.
