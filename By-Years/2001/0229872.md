Children's Discovery Museum of San Jose, CA, will develop a three-pronged
project called "Round and Round" focused on the geometry, science and technology
of circles and wheels. All three project products (one permanent and one
traveling version of a 2000-sq. ft. exhibition; an array of complementary
educational programs for children ages 3-10; and published research on patterns
of interactions among families of diverse backgrounds in museum settings) will
be developed in cooperation with developmental psychologists from the University
of California at Santa Cruz and advisors from Latino and Vietnamese communities
in San Jose. "Round and Round" exhibits and programs will offer a trans-
cultural, gender-neutral, and multi-disciplinary look at the ingenuity and
ubiquity of circles. Together they will provide a comprehensive array of
interactive experiences that help children, ages 3-10, and adults explore the
mathematics, physics, physical properties and engineering advantages of circles
and wheels. The project is expected to serve three million visitors in science
and children's museums across the nation within four years of implementation.
