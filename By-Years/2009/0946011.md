This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate the
feasibility of economical and scalable GaN bulk crystal growth techniques to
produce non-polar and semi-polar GaN substrates with a uniformly low dislocation
density. The non-polar and semi-polar GaN substrates will be derived from a
novel multi-step crystal growth process that yields true bulk GaN single
crystals.

These substrates will find application in advanced GaN-based devices such as
laser diodes and ultra-high brightness light emitting diodes (LEDs).The
resulting substrate price reduction will accelerate adoption of GaN substrates
by LED manufacturers, and expand LED use in demanding and price sensitive solid-
state lighting applications. GaN-based LEDs present exciting long-term prospects
for solid-state lighting, via the replacement of inefficient and/or toxic
conventional light sources such as light bulbs and fluorescent lamps.
