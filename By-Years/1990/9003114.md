The research is a renewal of a highly productive grant at Northwestern
University (DMR-8701167). During the three years of support by the National
Science Foundation two students were awarded the doctorate degree, one received
the masters degree, and three students are in various stages of the doctorate
degree. Seven papers were accepted for publication in refereed scientific
journals, and seven more are in process. The research during that period
emphasized the following: (1) transition and rare earth metals as electronically
active defects in compound semiconductors, (2) flow modulation epitaxy of indium
phosphide and its alloys, (3) defects in indium phosphide based
heterostructures. The current research studies deep level defects in
deliberately doped epitaxial indium phosphide and its alloys prepared by
atmospheric pressure organometallic vapor phase epitaxy. A number of defect
phenomena are being emphasized, for example, compensation mechanisms in heavily
doped material, deep donor levels associated with substitutional impurities,
deep levels in quantum wells and superlattices, and rare earth related
impurities. The materials are being characterized using photoluminescence,
photoconductivity, and deep level transient spectroscopy.
