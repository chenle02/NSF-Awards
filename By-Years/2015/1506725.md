With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division
of Chemistry, Professors Vachet and Rotello and their groups at University of
Massachusetts, Amherst will develop a new mass spectrometry-based imaging
approach to track nanomaterials in biological samples. Nanoparticles are
increasingly used in applications that include drug delivery, sensing, imaging
and therapy. In all cases, nanoparticles with the desired biological stability
are required. Conversely, the increased presence of nanomaterials in commercial
products raises concerns over the environmental and biological fate of
nanomaterials. These new methods to be developed by Vachet and Rotello will
provide quantitative insight into how to design nanoparticles of desired
stability, from semi-stable materials used in drug delivery to much more stable
materials that are required in commercial products. In addition to the
envisioned scientific and societal impacts, the PIs propose to disseminate
learned knowledge broadly through the National Nanomanufacturing Network (NNN)
among the nanomanufacturing research, development and education community, as
well as provide research opportunities to both undergraduate and graduate
students, including those from underrepresented minority groups.

The intellectual merits of the proposed work lay in the development a dual mode
imaging approach that can track nanoparticles based on both their core material
and their functionalized monolayers. Specifically, Vachet and Rotello will use
laser desorption/ionization (LDI) MS to track nanoparticles in tissues according
to the monolayer molecules attached to the gold core and laser ablation (LA)
inductively-coupled plasma (ICP) MS imaging to site-specifically monitor the
extent to which nanoparticles stay still intact in biological systems. Vachet
and Rotello will then use this new combined imaging approach to study the effect
of nanoparticle surface chemistry, nanoparticle size, and tissue biochemistry on
nanoparticle stability in tissues and organs from mice after intravenous (IV)
injection of these NPs.
