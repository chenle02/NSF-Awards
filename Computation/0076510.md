The investigator an his colleague continue working in the area of interface
modeling, level set methods and fast marching methods, with applications to
plastic injection moulding, the computation of seismic travel times,
semiconductor manufacturing and computer vision. They also continue to develop
statistical prediction methods for partial differential equations with
underresolution and partial data, with applications to turbulence, climate
modeling, and many-body problems. The common thread of these topics is
computation and analysis in the presence of uncertainty

The main difficulty in many important problems of engineering is to find the
exact location of a surface or the exact time a signal arrives at a given point.
Well-known examples occur in the manufacture of microchips, where it is
important to control exactly various manufacturing processes, and in robotics,
where one has to find the optimal way to perform a task. The investigators have
developed powerful computer methods for solving such problems; these methods
obviate the need for costly and lengthy trial-and-error in a physical
laboratory. They continue to improve these tools, with new applications in
manufacturing, geology, and computer vision. Many problems in science lack
sufficient data for a complete specification, or are so complex that they cannot
be solved in full. Examples are weather and climate forecasting as well as
problems in biology. The investigators have examined carefully what is the most
one can reliably say in such situations, and have developed computer methods for
finding effectively the best information one can in problems where a full
solution is out of reach. They are also developing ways of telling in advance
what the uncertainty in the answers will be when one can estimate the
uncertainty in the data.
