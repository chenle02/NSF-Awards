Weatherly 9730120 Funds are provided to complete the analysis, interpretation an
synthesis of current meter mooring and hydrographic data collected in the South
Atlantic under the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE). The analysis will
focus on the transport and heat flux associated with the flow of North Atlantic
Deep Water and Antarctic Bottom Water in the Brazil Basin. In addition, a
collaboration with French Oceanographers to analyze the hydrographic data they
collected in the South Atlantic will expand this study of abyssal circulation to
the whole western South Atlantic.
