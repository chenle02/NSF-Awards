Gymnolaemates are a class of bryozoans, which comprise a phylum of colonial
organisms that inhabit freshwater and marine environments. Dr. Russell Zimmer
has discovered a previously overlooked pattern of cell development (the "inter-
coronal cells") in the larvae of gymnolaemates, and he proposes a survey of
these cells as they occur in different gymnolaemate groups. Differences among
cell types and their pattern of development will help to discriminate species,
and to reconstruct their evolutionary relationships. The results based on cell
development patterns will be synthesized with those based on data from adult and
fossilized specimens. The proposed project will find an interested audience
among invertebrate zoologists, and developmental and evolutionary biologists. A
better understanding of bryozoan diversity and evolutionary relationships will
form the basis for research in ecology, marine biology, biogeography, and cell
biology.
