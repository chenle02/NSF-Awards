The cessation of passive margin sedimentation in Paleozoic time and the
beginning of arc magmatism in Mesozoic time in southern Arizona are clearly
established, and the deposits associated with both Paleozoic sedimentation and
Mesozoic volcanism have been or are being studied. The nature of the transition
itself remains unknown, however, although coherent and plausible models have
been provided for a similar time span in the Mojave Desert and elsewhere along
the Cordilleran margin. This project will investigate epiclastic,
volcaniclastic, and volcanic strata associated with the Paleozoic/Mesozoic
boundary in southern Arizona. An integrative geologic investigation will
involve: 1) Detailed field mapping of sections where depositional sequences from
Paleozoic to early Mesozoic strata are known or inferred; 2) Facies analysis of
strata along the contact, in order to determine a) the tectonic setting of
earliest Mesozoic magmatism; 3) U-Pb zircon b) the tectonic setting of earliest
Mesozoic magmatism; 3) U-Pb zircon geochronology on volcanic rocks at the
contact to establish the initial timing of magmatic activity, or where
appropriate as a tool in correlating sequences. This research will fill an
important gap in our understanding of late Paleozoic to early Mesozoic tectonic
evolution of the southwestern Cordillera by shedding light on the timing and
style of the transition from passive-margin sedimentation to subduction and
magmatism in southern Arizona.
