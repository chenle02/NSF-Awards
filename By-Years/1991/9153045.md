The College of Science at the California State Polytechnic University, Pomona,
is setting up a networked student laboratory of eight VAX stations plus a file
server in order to support new offerings in computational chemistry,
computational physics, and a possible new major in computational science. This
network is clustered with the current Faculty Computational Science Laboratory
so that devices such as array processors are shared. A secondary benefit of the
project is the fostering of student research, particularly in computational
chemistry, and an increased capability in graphics and scientific
visualization.NSF grant funds are being matched with funds from non-federal
sources.
