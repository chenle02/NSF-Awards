This research examines the corrosion resistance of metallic glasses. General
and localized pitting corrosion in amorphous alloys is under study with the
imposed associated effects of applied stress, electrode potential, and
environment. Factors influencing the formation of stable, inert films will be
determined with emphasis on the transition metal-metalloid alloy systems,
especially chromium, with metalloid additions of phosphorous or boron, and
magnetic alloys of the iron-neodymium- boron type. This research provides needed
information on the nature of passivity in amorphous metal alloys and on the
future potential for employing various types of amorphous films to improve
corrosion resistance of materials.
