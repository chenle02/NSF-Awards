The aim is to develop a meaningful mathematical description of translation,
which can provide insights into the mRNA-protein expression relationship in
Escherichia coli. The two overarching objectives of the proposed efforts are:
(i) the identification of the parameters that affect the correlation of mRNA and
protein expression based on the formulation and computational analysis of
mathematical models of the translation processes, and (ii) the quantification of
these parameters using the information derived within the experimental component
of the proposed work.&lt;br/&gt;
