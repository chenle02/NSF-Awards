Professor Robert E. Wyatt at the Department of Chemistry, University of Texas at
Austin, is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry
Program at NSF for theoretical studies of the spectra, dynamics, and reactions
of small polyatomic molecules. The work supported under this grant is
specifically concerned with spectroscopy and time-dependent vibrational
dynamics. It is divided into four topics: (1) quantum dynamics and spectroscopy
of benzene; (2) multiple timescale intramolecular dynamics of formyl fluoride;
(3) state specificity and dissociation dynamics fluoroform; and (4) extraction
of interior eigenstates from large matrices. The common theme which links the
various parts of the work being carried out under this grant is to obtain
information about and understanding of the time, spatial, and energetic aspects
of the evolution of vibrationally excited states. The dynamical properties and
the spectra of molecules are consequences of the way in which the electrons and
the nuclei which compose the molecule interact with each other. A goal of the
supported research is to learn how information about these fundamental
interactions can be extracted from a knowledge of the molecular dynamics and
spectra.
