This study is concerned with the development of fast algorithms for estimating
mixture parameters associated with finite mixture densities that arise in many
statistical models. Estimating the parameters is often difficult and undesirably
time- consuming. The central objective of this research is to determine fast
iterative procedures for approximating maximum- likelihood estimates of these
parameters. Two broad types of iterative methods are proposed. The first type
consists of special quasi-Newton methods. They are designed to take advantage of
the special structure of the log-likelihood function. The second type consists
of modifications of the popular EM algorithm. They are intended to exhibit
accelerated convergence while preserving many of the advantages of the EM
algorithm.
