The multilinear extension (MLE) of a game, first introduced as a technique for
calculating the value of a game, has over the past two decades been shown to
have numerous other applications. In this project its mathematical properties
will be studied in some detail, with a view towards such applications as the
computation of both symmetric and asymmetric values of large games, deriving
other (asymmetric) values to games, developing solution concepts for games
without side payments, and computing reduced games. MLE may also be used to
resolve certain problems which are found in the current representation of some
types of games. These include non-atomic games, which are used to represent
economic situations of pure competition, and spatial games, which are frequently
used to model voting and coalition formation in political situations. In both of
these cases, the current representation fails to allow for some stochastic
behavior on the part of agents; the MLE (which has a probabilistic
interpretation) can remedy this drawback.
