The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to enable the
commercialization of the carbon dots technology, with the initial focus on uses
in high-performance sensors for water and food analyses and in imaging
techniques for the early detection of cancers and other biomedical applications.
Carbon dots have been developed as nontoxic and environmentally benign
alternatives to the commercially available semiconductor quantum dots, which are
nanomaterials of excellent optical properties but mostly containing highly toxic
heavy metals in order to achieve the desired properties and performance levels.
With similarly excellent properties and high performance, carbon dots as carbon-
based nanomaterials can be produced from abundant and environmentally friendly
precursors. They are benign and nontoxic. Because of the low-cost nature, the
carbon dots technology is also expected to have broader applications beyond the
initial focus for many other societal needs.

This I-Corps project assesses the market potential and the likely customer base
for a carbon dots technology. Carbon dots have emerged as a rapidly advancing
and expanding field of research and development. Under the umbrella of the
carbon dots technology, significant applications in a number of technological
areas have been explored, including carbon dots as extremely sensitive, yet
benign and nontoxic, optical probes, potent photocatalysts, photodynamic agents
for therapy and other purposes, antibacterial and antiviral agents, and
materials and components in various renewable energy and energy conversion
devices. The focus of this project is on the technology for imaging and sensing
to take advantage of the most important and uniquely advantageous
characteristics and properties of carbon dots, specifically on several high-
value uses for immediate commercial development.
