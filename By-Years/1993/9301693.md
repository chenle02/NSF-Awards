9301693 Tree Flow-induced crystallization of semi-crystalline polymers to
produce extended chain crystals provides an opportunity to produce lightweight,
high-strength materials from inexpensive feed stocks by carefully controlling
the processing variables. The project will bring together researchers from the
fields of polymer processing, thermodynamics and computer simulation to study
flow- induced crystallization kinetics. The research will use a specially
designed rheometer and a newly developed rheo-optic technique to obtain in-situ,
quantitative measurements of flow- induced crystallization kinetics in
crystallizable polymers. Anew model of polymer crystallization kinetics, based
on current molecular theory for polymer molecules, will be developed and
incorporated into a simulation of polymer processing in order to optimize the
design of polymer processing operations with respect to the degree of extended
chain crystallinity, which in turn is directly related to the mechanical
properties of the product. The research may allow the production of high
performance plastic parts from inexpensive polymer materials through the careful
control of processing variables.
