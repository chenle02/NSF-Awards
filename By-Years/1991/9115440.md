This research project will address a number of issues about the determinants
and supply of U.S. scientists and engineers. It will accomplish this by using
the sixth round (1986) of the National Longitudinal Study of the High School and
Beyond (HSB) survey for recent graduates; and it will use the Consortium of
Financing Higher Education (COFHE) data set for college graduates. They will
investigate how labor market conditions affect enrollments in higher education,
how financing arrangements for education affect a sequence of choices, how the
quality of science and engineering education affect career choices, how these
effects differ for women and minorities, and how effects vary with ability of
individuals.//
