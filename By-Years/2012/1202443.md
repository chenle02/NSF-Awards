Project Summary Objective: Seven key challenges have been identified related to
theory, design, and manufacturing of metamaterials. Simultaneous solutions to
these challenges will transform the design of all devices working on
electromagnetic principles and enable novel devices that challenge the human
imagination today. This project will address four of those seven key challenges
through a single prototype that simultaneously demonstrates (1) full isotropy,
(2) negative index, (3) operation in optical wavelengths, and (4) bulk
fabrication using a combined ?meandering wire? concept and a novel 3D stimulated
emission depletion microscopy-inspired direct laser writing fabrication.
Intellectual Merit: Stringent requirements already imposed by the prototype will
set it as a benchmark for many future optical metamaterial devices that
challenge the human imagination today. This project will leverage state-of-the
art 3D optical lithography and boost other complementary efforts in the field to
address the remaining challenges which are (5) compensation of optical losses,
(6) tunability, (7) broad bandwidth, and operation in higher optical frequencies
for more functionalities. Broader Impacts: Broader impacts of the project
include (1) exploring the most viable route for "making optics from scratch" and
advancing the science of controlling light on-demand, (2) advancing state-of-
the-art imaging, sensing, lithography, and nanomanufacturing science and
technology, (3) strengthening collaborations with world-renowned national and
international research teams, (4) training graduate and undergraduate students
in interdisciplinary and international environments, (5) taking the right steps
for turning academic curiosity into industrial products, and (6) establishing a
popular research track to attract young students for careers in science,
mathematics, and engineering
