Black Hills State University (BHSU) and Western Dakota Technical Institute
(WDTI) have created a consortium including school districts and industrial
partners to develop, deliver, refine and evaluate a network-based distance
education model for the delivery of basic electronics curriculum. This project
is designed to improve technology instruction, experiences and opportunities for
juniors and seniors in six school districts. Key elements of the project include
on-site teacher training course content and delivery; the implementation of
distance education at participating high schools; professional and technical
support for participants provided by faculty and industrial partners; technical
experiences for students provided by industrial partners, evaluation of the
program by all partners; dissemination about the project at the local, state and
national levels; and/or credit at BHSU or WDTI for the proposed secondary course
work.
