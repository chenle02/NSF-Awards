This award funds a conference in macroeconomics. The PI is bringing together a
group of leading scholars to discuss research in progress. The conference
includes both established and emerging scholars, and it provides an important
opportunity for cross-fertilization between different areas of macroeconomics.
Participants were chose from over 500 paper submissions. The meetings are also
open to graduate students and policy-makers. Researchers will benefit from the
opportunity to get early feedback on their
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts include promoting under-
represented groups in economic science; the conference organizers are working
together with mentoring programs sponsored by the American Economic Association
to invite promising graduate students and junior scholars from under represented
groups. Much of the research presented is relevant for macroeconomic policy
decisions.
