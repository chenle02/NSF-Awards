This grant provides funds for a shared Viscoelastic Characterization Facility
(VCF) for the characterization of viscoelastic properties of soft materials at
the University of Pennsylvania. The VCF has research studying materials ranging
from synthetic gels and colloids to biological tissues and carbon nanotubes. The
VCF will characterize soft materials by rheologic methods that assist in
determining their response to mechanical deformation. The nature of viscoelastic
characterization (or the field of rheology) is such that no single instrument
can measure the different geometries and extent of deformation that are
appropriate for desired experimental systems. Accordingly, this grant covers
five instruments to span a range wide enough to be useful to the maximum number
of researchers. Specifically, two complex instruments will be developed by
groups with specialized needs and expertise: 1) A customized version of the
ThermoHaake Rheoscope Imaging Rheometer - to be built in collaboration with
MRSEC faculty that requires single molecule imaging within polymer networks. The
current version of the Rheoscope will be modified to mount on a Zeiss inverted
microscope with image deconvolution capability. 2) A Bohlin C-VOR-200 Rheometer
modified with transparent sample housing to interface with existing scattering
facilities, such as a dynamic light scattering system, allowing more powerful
capabilities to relate molecular structures to macroscopic properties than
possible with existing instruments. Three other instruments will serve a broad
range of users whose needs are met by commercial instruments. These instruments
will differ in types of samples for which they are best suited (e.g. solid
versus fluid), the type of deformation they apply, the temperature range over
which they operate, and the volume required for measurement.

The equipment will be integrated into existing courses in the Bioengineering and
Physics Departments to train both undergraduate and graduate students and will
be used in the NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates Program to train
additional undergraduates and provide outreach to underrepresented minorities.
The management plan for the facility provides additional plans for training and
outreach to both underrepresented students and industry. The VCF would also
impact other communities at PENN, as seen in the range of investigators involved
in this proposal which include 22 groups in 12 departments within the Schools of
Arts and Sciences, Engineering and Applied Sciences, Medicine, and the
Children's Hospital of Pennsylvania.
