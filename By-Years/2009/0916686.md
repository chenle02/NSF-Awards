Abstract below:

Graphs and networks are a natural representation across a wide range of
disciplines and domains. Statistical tools have recently been brought to bear on
the analysis of graphs, yielding rich dividends in various application areas.
The aim of this project is to use tools from statistics and graph theory to
develop algorithms that generate similar graphs efficiently. Since graph data is
often expensive to collect, it is desirable to synthetically generate graphs. To
be widely applicable however, the generated graphs need to both preserve the
semantics of the original data (i.e., be drawn from the same distribution) and
be efficient to compute.

Two key questions form the core emphasis of the current project. First, how does
one measure similarity between two graphs? Second, how can this notion of
similarity be used to generate new graphs? On the topic of similarity, the
project will investigate representations to preserve global properties, propose
new, efficient, representations for signatures, and explore sampling techniques
and their convergence behavior. On the topic of generation of new graphs, the
project will develop an exponential random graph model using signatures,
investigate feature selection via regularization, propose novel methods to
sample from the exponential random graph model and novel techniques to produce
proposal graphs, and provide rigorous empirical validation across a range of
application areas.

The project will facilitate the study of large complex structures of the kind
frequently encountered in domains like theoretical ecology, social networks, and
chemo-informatics, allowing researchers in these domains to leverage statistical
network analysis tools to identify significant patterns and understand algorithm
performance.
