Heterogeneous parallel systems incorporate diverse models of parallelism within
a single machine or across machines. These systems provide high performance for
large, diverse applications. Heterogeneity unfortunately complicates software
development. Users currently hand parallelize each task for each architecture.
These programs are not portable and must be recoded if changes occur (e.g.,
machines are added or removed). The user is also burdened with performing the
appropriate optimizations to achieve high performance. A compiler can solve
these problems. The most important advantages of a compiler based approach are:
(1) Portability and Ease of Use: Users program the appropriate model of
parallelism for their algorithms. The compiler automatically maps them on to the
specifics of the available architectures. (2) High Performance: The compiler
optimizes with aggressive, target specific optimizations and coordinates diverse
hardware to achieve excellent performance. To manage heterogeneity the compiler
must: target diverse architectures, adjust optimization strategies to suit
targets, exploit run-time changes in machine availability, and allow languages
to evolve. The objective of this research is to investigate a compilation system
to support these requirements. The system will use an innovative compiler
organization and representations in order to provide the flexibility that
heterogeneity requires. This project concentrates on the design and
implementation of this compiler infrastructure. The system will be used to
investigate automatic parallelization and partitioning strategies for a
heterogeneous target. It will address issues such as how to map programmer
models of parallelism on to the corresponding machine and how to further
optimize it for total system performance. This compiler-based approach will
provide an infrastructure capable of performing the advanced dynamic and static
optimizations that heterogeneous systems demand for high performa nce. ***
