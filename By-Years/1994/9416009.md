This research involves studies of atmospheric composition by measuring twilight
airglow emissions. By measuring the decay in selected atmospheric emission rates
as the solar depression angle increases, the temperature and product of density
and integrated solar flux can be determined. The use of two look directions aids
in the separation of the density integrated solar flux product. Two narrow band
tilting filter photometers are deployed to obtain the data. The objectives of
the research are to quantify the variations in temperature and density, relate
these changes to solar EUV flux, discover how variations due to dynamics are
discernible from that due to the solar variation, and to give input to the
models so that they are able to explain the rapid composition variations.
