AST 0407063&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI Bailyn&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
is a program of observations of a remarkable class of celestial objects, the
Soft X-ray Transient systems, consisting of a black hole or neutron star
accreting matter from a Sun-like companion star. The accretion is episodic, with
short intense outbursts of X-rays (the bulk of the emitted energy) alternating
with long stretches of quiescent behavior. By combining observations of
quiescence phases and of the outbursts, and by studying the optical and infrared
radiation alongside the high energy radiation, one can create a more complete
and detailed picture of these remarkable sources and the exotic physical effects
that take place in them. Without such complementary ground-based
optical/infrared observations, the data from NASA's fleet of high-energy
observatories cannot be adequately interpreted. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts. This project is one of the key programs in the Small and Moderate
Aperture Research Telescope System, and the Principal Investigator is the
Principal Scientist of this consortium. The group provides well-instrumented
1m-class telescopes in the southern hemisphere at the Cerro Tololo Interamerican
Observatory that are available to all US astronomers through proposals to the
National Optical Astronomy Observatories. Data of the kind obtained forms an
ideal basis for undergraduate research projects, and this program provides many
opportunities for undergraduates to carryout front-line research. There is
continuing work in creating web-based public outreach tools and on-line courses
to inform the public of project results. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
