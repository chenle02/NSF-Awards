This research will continue the development of methodology for obtaining
approximations with error bounds for difficult to compute quantities and
distributions arising in applied probability models. This includes quantifying
the accuracy of exponential approximations for first passage time distributions
and bounding the sup norm distance to exponentiality in terms of the first two
moments. This research studies approximations of models used in applied
probability. The purpose is to determine how close the approximations are to the
actual model.
