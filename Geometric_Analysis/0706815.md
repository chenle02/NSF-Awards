This proposal concerns work at the interface of topology and geometry. Perelman
has made great advances in applying Ricci flow to the topology of 3-manifolds.
There remain open questions about using his ideas to completely classify closed
3-manifolds (i.e., establish Thurston's Geometrization Conjecture). These
questions revolve around the theory of sufficiently collapsed 3-manifolds and
their relationship to Alexandrov spaces of dimension at most 2. Sorting these
issues out will give a complete, detailed argument proving the Geometrization
Conjecture. There should be an analogous theory of sufficiently collapsed
4-manifolds and the relation of these objects to Alexandrov spaces of dimension
at most 3. Developing such a theory for 4-manifolds will be important in its own
right, but may also be crucial in applying Ricci flow to prove topological
results in dimension 4. The other area of study is mirror symmetry for Calabi-
Yau 3-folds in toric varieties.Here the idea is to establish mirror symmetry for
these examples at the fairly delicate level of variations of Hodge structure and
monodromy representations.

There have been exciting developments in the subject of topology in the last few
years which this proposal will explore. These involve the interplay between
topology and other, more geometric and analytic, areas of mathematics.
Perelman's application of a heat-type flow equation and techniques from geometry
to establish the Poincare Conjecture, the oldest and most fundamental of all
topological questions, is a major watershed moment in the subject. This is one
of the deepest and most beautiful applications of partial differential equations
to a purely topological problem ever. There remain many questions of how to
apply the same ideas to all 3-dimensional spaces, not just simplest, which is
the 3-dimensional sphere. More speculatively, there is the question of how to
extend these ideas to provide new insights into 4-dimensional spaces, about
which we know little, except that the possibilities are much wider than in
dimension 3. Another main theme in topology and geometry over the past few years
is to make sense of the mirror symmetry. This principle is derived by non-
rigorous physics arguments and is unlike anything normally seen in `classical
mathematics.' It is some version of `quantum mathematics.' This notion has led
to an incredibly rich flourishing of mathematics on the interface of topology
and geometry as mathematicians attempt to understand special cases of this
notion, to formulate this notion precisely, and to establish it mathematically.
