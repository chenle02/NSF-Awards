The central object of study are Schrodinger operators with potentials displaying
aperiodic order. In one dimension there have been recent advances in the
understanding of their spectral and quantum dynamical properties, particularly
in the case of the Fibonacci potential and related models, so-called Sturmian
potentials, which are the standard models of one-dimensional quasicrystals. It
is the goal of the proposed research to extend the theory to larger classes of
potentials in one dimension and to tackle the higher dimensional case. A crucial
tool in one dimension is the trace map, an energy-indexed dynamical system which
can be used to characterize and study the spectrum of the operators. Along with
combinatorial partition results and Gordon-type criteria one can obtain good
bounds on generalized eigenfunctions from which one can deduce spectral and
quantum dynamical consequences. It appears feasible that this approach is
applicable to potentials beyond the class of Sturmian potentials -- sufficiently
low complexity should suffice to induce partitions and trace maps. In higher
dimensions the main goal is to find an analog of Gordon's criterion which can
serve as a link between combinatorics and spectral theory.

The mathematics of aperiodic order is a young emerging field that has sparked a
lot of research activity since the mid-nineties. Researchers from disciplines as
diverse as spectral theory, group theory, dynamical systems, combinatorics, and
algebraic topology have found a common ground that was motivated by the
discovery of quasicrystals in 1984 and the subsequent reconsideration of the
nature of order and ordered structures. By now, quite a number of structural
models for quasicrystals have been proposed. Joint efforts are being undertaken
to investigate their properties and shed light on why quasicrystals exist, how
they form, why they are stable. Regarding their electronic transport properties,
it is expected that quasicrystals may exhibit anomalous behavior. It is
therefore planned to study transport properties of Sturmian and related models
from this perspective.
