The aim of this project is to change how undergraduates learn biological
structure, by changing from an emphasis on presenting the histological structure
of vertebrates to an emphasis on learning to analyze and interpret structure.
The Microanatomy course at the University of Richmond will emphasize three
approaches to science education. (1) Collaborative Inquiry: Student teams will
learn the structure and function of selected tissues by pursuing their own
investigations using light microscopy, and transmission and scanning electron
microscopy. (2) Quantitative Analysis: Students will analyze their specimens
morphometrically. (3) Technological Competence: Light microscopes capable of
Kohler illumination and phase contrast optics will be purchased to train
students in analytical light microscopy. Macintosh computers, monochrome and
color video cameras, and an image scanner will be purchased to capture images
from light and electron microscopes. Students will then use software to
quantitatively analyze and reconstruct images, and to present their data.
