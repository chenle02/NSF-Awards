This project establishes a network of laboratories that give undergraduate
students a state-of-the art environment with many languages and development
tools for practice in solving real world problems. The goal is to give students
the broad education they will need in intelligent systems design and
development. The laboratory provides modern workstations that meet the needs of
students in courses that involve expert systems and AI programming. Software
products, NEXPERT Object, Goldworks II, and LEVEL5 are to be installed to
support in-class exercises and prototyping projects. Students will study
theoretical models of knowledge representation, practice capturing knowledge
from experts, design and implement expert systems, and analyze alternative
development tools. This laboratory will provide undergraduates with a hands-on
research experience in a state-of-the-art artificial intelligence environment.
It is significant because it will provide students with a broad education in the
rapidly developing area of intelligent systems design.
