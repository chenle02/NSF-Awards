This award is being given to support student attendance at the Third Meeting of
the Society for Research on Biological Rhythms to be held in May 1992. The
three-day meeting will include a plenary lecture, symposia, workshops, slides
presentations and poster presentations. Attendance will allow students to
interact with senior researchers in the field. This type of interaction is an
important aspect of training of young scientists. Knowledge of biological
rhythms is critical to understanding diurnal rhythms of hormones and brain
transmitters in humans as well as seasonal cyclicity in other animal species.
