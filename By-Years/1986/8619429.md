attend the Seventh Congress of the International Federation for the Theory of
Machines and Mechanisms in Seville, Spain during September 17-22, 1987. It
enables significant international technical exchange in an area with a major
impact on productivity and international competiveness. The principal
investigator is a major contributor to machine theory and strongly qualified to
properly implement this project. An award is recommended.
