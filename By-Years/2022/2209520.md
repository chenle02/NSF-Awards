The project aims to develop new models and algorithms for online stochastic
problems arising in matching markets. The underlying models and algorithms are
inspired by and applicable to marketplaces used for the online allocation of
goods and services, including online retail markets, ad auctions, ride-hailing,
ride-sharing applications, and short-term housing markets. These markets occupy
a rapidly increasing fraction of the economy, and their massive size
necessitates efficient and scalable algorithms that can match demand and supply
in real-time. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Decision-making in an uncertain, dynamic
environment influenced by one's decisions is universal across various
applications and is studied in multiple disciplines, including computer science,
economics, statistics, and operations research. The project aims to characterize
the complexity of multistage stochastic optimization problems and the
tractability of finding approximately optimal decisions for them. This is in
contrast to competitive analysis, a popular framework in algorithm design that
characterizes the worst-case performance of an online algorithm compared to
optimum in hindsight. The project employs a range of techniques including
stronger linear programming relaxations, specifically a hierarchy of linear
programs, to capture the optimum online. This effort is complemented by a study
of the hardness of approximation and specifically PSPACE-hardness
results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
