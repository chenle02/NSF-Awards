The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project will be to establish an artificial intelligence (AI) system capable of
providing data-driven insights for attorneys. The legal community currently
lacks data analysis tools to help with civil case preparation, which can lead to
suboptimal trial outcomes. The proposed technology can help lower costs through
document analysis. The technology is designed to both automate and improve the
decision-making process and enable attorneys to expand their case load, as well
as enabling cost-effective representation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small
Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will use federated learning
techniques to train the technologyâ€™s algorithm across multiple decentralized
databases without exchanging data samples, thus keeping information private and
confidential. This approach overcomes the lack of access problem in applying AI
to legal cases, without compromising data confidentiality. The proposed research
will include two major objectives: 1) improve and verify the accuracy of the
platform, and 2) create internal checks to ensure that the model does not
propagate bias. Computational outputs will be assessed using data and records
from randomly selected cases with known outcomes to demonstrate system accuracy;
moreover, the model will explicitly account for potential sources of
bias.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
