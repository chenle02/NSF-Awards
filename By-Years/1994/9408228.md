9408228 Harvell Plants, and colonial animals such as corals and bryozoans, are
termed modular organisms because they are constructed of iterated units.
Although it is understood how materials are transported among the units of
plants, this process is poorly known in colonial animals, where the transport
moves resources among units that show division of labor between feeding,
reproduction and defense. This study examines whether the amounts and rates at
which materials are moved among the units constrain performance. In the marine
bryozoan Membranipora membranacea, defensive units are induced by the proximity
of predators and competitors. The construction of defensive units slows growth
and this research will investigate whether construction of the defensive units
also changes transport of a radioisotpoic marker in the colony. Although costs
of defense are widely cited as a limitation on the types of defenses organisms
deploy, in no organism has the mechanism underlying the cost been demonstrated.
