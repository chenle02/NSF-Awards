This award will provide infrastructure for research that is organized around
five laboratories: 1. LINC - for research on artificial intelligence and natural
language processing; 2. GRASP - for research on machine perception and robotics;
3. GRAPHICS - for research on graphic interfaces, movement description, and
animation; 4. DSL - for research in computer architecture and computer
communication; 5. LOGIC & COMPUTATION - for research in logic and computation,
including theory of computation, database systems, and programming languages.
Two new facets of the research, integration and upward scaling, require an
enhanced experimental environment involving machines with massively parallel
architectures. The award will help to develop this environment by providing
funds for a SIMD machine for work in natural language processing, and active
perception and real time manipulation; a MIMD machine for simulation and
research involving extensive scientific calculations; as well as high speed
workstations with rich environments for work in theoretical computer science.
