The University of Utah is being supported to establish a Research for
Undergraduates (REU) SITE. The purpose of this SITE is to provide meaningful
hands-on research opportunities in contemporary chemistry for outstanding
undergraduate students under the supervision of experienced research chemists.
The program will support about 7 students for the summer of 1987, of which
almost half will be recruited from other institutions. Research activities will
include the following: o Field-Flow Fractionation o Carbene Chemistry o Quantum
Chemistry o Phosphorous-Containing Rings of Biological Interest
