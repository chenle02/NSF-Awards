BenM and CatM are LysR-type transcriptional regulators (LTTR) that participate
in the complex regulation of aromatic compound degradation by the soil bacterium
Acinetobacter sp. Strain ADP1. While LTTRs comprise the largest family of
bacterial transcriptional regulators, a clear understanding of their function
has been hampered by past problems in characterizing atomic- level protein
structures. These studies of BenM and CatM will use protein X-ray
crystallography to examine structural changes underlying transcriptional
activation. The conformational changes that occur in response to effector
binding will be characterized. Furthermore, protein/DNA co- crystallization
methods will address the structural basis for transmitting regulatory signals
via alterations in protein-DNA interactions and evaluate the changes in protein
conformations that enable two distinct effectors, benzoate and muconate, to have
a synergistic effect on transcriptional activation by BenM. This type of dual-
inducer synergy is a novel form of transcriptional regulation that may represent
an important, and widespread, feature of transcriptional control. CatM, which
has overlapping regulatory functions with BenM, responds only to muconate as an
effector and thus provides a comparative model for identifying key structural
features required for transcriptional synergism. BenM and CatM serve as a
paradigm for complex transcriptional regulation and LTTR-controlled gene
expression. Variant proteins and mutated promoter region DNA will also be
characterized structurally. Previously proposed regulatory models will be tested
by these structural studies. These studies of regulated aromatic compound
degradation, in addition to expanding our understanding of bacterial
transcriptional regulation, should increase the success of bioremediation of
man-made pollutants and create new biotechnological applications.
