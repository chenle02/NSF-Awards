ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;13 July 2011&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:
1118204&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Minnesota Duluth&lt;br/&gt;PI: R.
Ricketts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests one Shipboard Scientific
Support Equipment (SSSE) item for the R/V BLUE HERON; namely a new dual
frequency echo sounder. This item will enhance navigational safety and provide
greatly improved science support capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts: The University of Minnesota supports federally-funded scientific
research on the Great Lakes and routinely exposes graduate and undergraduate
students to the marine sciences. The R/V BLUE HERON is scheduled to complete
over 50 NSF sponsored days in 2011.
