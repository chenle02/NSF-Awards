Technology that can be used for wireless information networks is currently
undergoing rapid development. Such networks are taking an expanding role in the
world's telecommunication infrastructure and interest in wireless communications
is growing faster then ever. It is important for schools of electrical
engineering and computer engineering to prepare their students for careers in
this important discipline. This project relates to offering a short course
suitable for electrical engineering undergraduate faculty interested in
developing a Wireless Communication Systems Laboratory at their home institution
or including wireless topics in the courses they teach.
