9701488 Wang This project examines the structure and magnetic properties of
epitaxial Co/Cu/Co trilayers and Co OwiresO prepared by molecular beam epitaxy
(MBE). The Co and trilayer films are grown on flat and vicinal (step bunched)
silicon (111) surfaces, respectively. The parameters describing the interface
roughness and mixing of these Co nanostructures are determined quantitatively in
situ from the angular profile measurement of diffraction beams using high
resolution, low energy electron diffraction complemented with scanning electron
microscopy. The coercivity, magnetic anistropy, exchange coupling, magneto
resistance, and magnetic inhomogeneity are obtained in situ from the surface
magneto-optic Kerr effect (SMOKE), ferromagnetic resonance, and the Van der Pauw
method. Atomic force microscopy and magnetic force microscopy provide important
information on morphology and magnetic domain wall structures. In addition the
temperature dependence and magnetic stability of these nanostructures are
studied. %%% The quantitative relationship between interface roughness and
magneto resistance and magnetic exchange coupling and their temperature
dependence will permit an optimization of the trilayer that has the largest and
thermally stable magneto resistance at very low magnetic fields. Such materials
have applications in magnetic read heads for ultrahigh density hard disk drives.
