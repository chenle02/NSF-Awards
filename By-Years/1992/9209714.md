This project will study two important constructions in algebraic K-theory. The
first is the assembly map for the K-theory and L-theory of group rings. The
method will be homotopy- theoretic, using the bounded K-theory of Pedersen and
Weibel. The investigator hopes to complete his study of the surjectivity
question for cocompact, discrete, torsion-free subgroups of Lie groups, and to
generalize the approach to include more general groups with finite classifying
space. The second object of study will be the descent spectral sequence for the
algebraic K-theory of a field F. He will study a homotopy colimit construction
for the K-theory of the algebraic closure of F, in the case where the absolute
Galois group is topologically cyclic. The component pieces in the colimit
construction will be copies of the K-theory of the field F. The details of these
parts vary, but each is concerned with reducing geometric information to a
subject for calculation or to perfecting the algebraic machinery used for the
calculations. The nature of the geometric information involved is the crux of
the difficulty. While questions about lengths, areas, angles, volumes, and so
forth virtually cry out to be reduced to calculations, it is far different with
what are known as topological properties of geometric objects. These are
properties such as connectedness (being all in one piece), knottedness, having
no holes, and so forth. All systematic study of such properties, for example,
how to tell whether two geometric objects really differ in respect to one of
these properties or are only superficially different, or how to classify the
variety of differences that can occur, all these have only truly been
comprehended and mastered when they have been reduced to matters of calculation,
and two of the principal tools for this are homotopy theory and K-theory.
