The research equipment is for a workstation system for modeling of structural
systems using large-scale simulation softwares. The principal investigators are
active in the areas of finite element analysis, expert system development, and
the nonlinear modeling of structures and components under impact loading
conditions. Significant ongoing contributions are in the area of the accurate
prediction of the response of structures and components used in the building,
automotive, aerospace, shipbuilding, and manufacturing industries. A very
important emphasis is on the accurate prediction of the fatigue life of
structures and components in the presence of flaws. Another emphasis is on the
development of accurate simulation schemes for the optimal design of such
structures for efficient performance and cost reduction. The system is capable
of large-scale computations at a fast pace, allows access to the LISP
environment, possesses excellent graphics capabilities, exhibits the advantages
of desktop stand-alone systems, allows easy networking with more powerful
computers and upgrading with changing needs, uses the latest technology, and
handles development work efficiently.
