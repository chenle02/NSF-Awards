A four-station undergraduate laboratory for digital hardware and microprocessor
design is being established. Each laboratory station includes industry-standard
digital test equipment and an advanced computer workstation. The workstations
run schematic drawing, digital simulation, and printed circuit design software
as well as software for the attached microprocessor development system. They are
connected to common service equipment by a local area network. The stations are
used to design, simulate, construct, and debug digital and microcomputer
hardware. The laboratory supports a three-course sequence starting with a theory
course addressing the general design process, digital hardware design,
microcomputer applications, and hardware fabrication with emphasis on hardware-
software tradeoffs. The first course would be co-requisite for a accompanying
design stations through structures experiments and ending with a small design
project. These would be followed by a second design course consisting students
which would be formally documented at each step in its development. This course
sequence, supported by industrial- quality laboratory equipment, would enhance
student's theoretical education while developing design and communication skills
in a hands-on, project-oriented environment.
