This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
Informatics for FY2002. The fellowship supports research and training at the
postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational,
computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the
fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a
career in biological informatics in which research and education will be
integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics
at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through
these fellowships will play important roles in training the future workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Applying
biological informatics and chemical genetics to explore developmental processes
regulated by the plant hormone auxin." The plant hormone auxin arbitrates plant
development at multiple levels. This research deconvolutes the complex
regulatory network controlled by auxin and its effectors using small molecules,
oligonucleotide microarrays, and bioinformatics. More broadly, it develops a
general experimental and analytical framework for using chemical genetics and
biological informatics to elucidate intricate signaling pathways in plants.
