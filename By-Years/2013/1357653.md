This award funds research in statistical methods for the analysis of economic
data. The goal is to expand the scope of the existing statistical theory that
explains the properties of estimation and inference methods for a partially
identified model with set identified parameters.

The research clarifies the main challenges to expanding the scope of the
existing theory of semiparametric inference, develops new approaches to overcome
these challenges, and develops practical suggestions for constructing
asymptotically efficient estimators within semiparametric models. The research
develops new methods that are robust against lack of identification, robust
against misspecification, and asymptotically efficient within semiparametric
models.

Broader impacts will come from the use of these methods to evaluate the results
of a variety of government and business decisions. The PI will make software
code available to other researchers who want to use these new methods.
