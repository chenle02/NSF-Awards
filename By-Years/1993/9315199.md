9315199 Rao This award of $180,000 is for curriculum development in smart
composite structures, which encompass several technologies that enable flexible
structures to sense and control their own geometric, environmental and
structural characteristics to achieve high performance and self-diagnostic
capabilities. The work necessitates the integration of (i) composite structure
modeling and fabrication, (ii) advances in sensor and actuator technology, (iii)
advanced control methodology, and (iv) artificial neural networks. The
objectives of an interdisciplinary team of faculty members are to: (i) introduce
smart structure concepts to senior undergraduate and graduate students, (ii)
develop interdisciplinary educational experience, (iii) enhance the design
component of curriculum and capstone design projects, and (iv) train future
scientists and engineers in areas of national importance and technologies
critical to defense missions. The approach adopted is to (i) develop a two-
course sequence on smart structures, (ii) integrate multidisciplinary laboratory
experience with coursework, (iii) develop senior undergraduate capstone design
projects soliciting feedback from an advisory committee in finalizing the
topics, and (iv) develop course materials and multi-media instructional tools,
and (v) disseminate curriculum development results to the greater engineering
community.
