Computer Science (31)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CS1 and calculus are major hurdles
for computer science and computer engineering majors, and faculty members at the
University of Arkansas have found that students entering their programs with an
ACT score below 26 are not adequately prepared to enter and succeed in these
courses. To help students overcome the CS1 and calculus hurdles, this project is
developing a preparatory CS0 course in which the teaching of programming is
focused on calculus as an application area. Through this course, students not
only are gaining the skills and confidence to succeed in subsequent courses, but
also their exposure is making the ideas presented in the subsequent Calculus I
course seem familiar and less intimidating. In the CS0 course, students are
exploring calculus through the implementation of very small and elegant
programs. This course is being encouraged for students failing to reach the ACT
score threshold. It will ultimately be required for these students. The two
critical components of this course are: a simple, yet expressive programming
language, and a calculus text that explains the basics of calculus in a clear
and concise manner, and develops ideas in step with the introduction of
programming fundamentals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CS0 course is boosting the
performance and retention of at-risk students from a variety of socio-economic
backgrounds. The primary metrics for measuring project success are GPA and
retention statistics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
