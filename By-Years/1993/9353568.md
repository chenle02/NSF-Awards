The planning grant is to develop a proposal for a comprehensive statewide math
and science program for teachers in grades 9-12 in which basic concepts from
math and science will serve to unify themes, methodologies, activities,
materials and assessment strategies. The program will continue and build on the
K-8 SSI grant. Groups of teachers and administrators will meet and plan the
workshops and curricula which will be a part of the proposal.
