This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop an
innovative solar technology that combines nanotechnology with conducting polymer
photovoltaics to achieve light weight, flexible solar cells that surpass current
solar cell efficiencies, but can be manufactured at a fraction of the cost.
Phase I, successfully demonstrated the feasibility of this innovative technology
and identified key device design and material requirements to address underlying
loss mechanisms limiting the nanocomposite photovoltaic performance. Specific
developments included (1) controlled nanocrystal surface chemistry (2) novel
nanocrystal synthesis (3) film morphology control and (4) reproducibility and
control of the entire process from synthesis to device measurement. Phase II
research will build on the knowledge gained in Phase I, and focus on the
development of optimized optical and electronic materials and the development of
an advanced stacked-intra-layer recombination device architecture. The output of
Phase II will be a prototype of an optimized, light-weight, low-cost, flexible
solar cell with efficiency greater than 10%; amenable to large-scale, low-
temperature manufacturing by roll-to-roll.

Commercially this technology has the potential to meet the market needs to
enable solar energy to become an integral and critical power generation source
world-wide, providing societal benefits in the areas ranging from environment to
national and economic security. Commercial applications exist for high
performance, low-cost solar cells that can provide an alternative power
generation source. Specific examples of use include on-grid building integrated
electricity generation systems; on-grid wholesale power generation; remote off-
grid power generation; portable power generation; and power generation for long-
term aerospace applications.
