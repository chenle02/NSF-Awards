Abstract &lt;br/&gt;"This award is funded under the American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)." &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ocean
Observatories Initiative (OOI) project has the potential to revolutionize ocean
science by providing the means to collect unique, sustained, time-series data
sets that will enable researchers to study complex, interlinked physical,
chemical, biological and geological processes operating throughout the global
ocean. The OOI infrastructure will include deep sea-buoys capable of deployment
in harsh environments such as the Southern Ocean and regional electro-optical
cabled nodes on the seafloor spanning several coastal observatories. These
assets will all be integrated by a cutting edge, open access, user-enabling
cyberinfrastructure that will link the marine components and facilitate
experimentation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Cooperative Agreement will cover the
construction (ARRA &amp; MREFC funds) and initial operations (R&amp;RA funds) of
the OOI project. The OOI construction project was developed under a separate NSF
award and followed the NSF Large Facilities Manual. The project underwent
extensive scientific, technical and project management reviews. &lt;br/&gt;
