A Conference on Infinitary Ramsey Theory will be held at the University of
Denver May 24 - 28, 2014. In the past thirty years, Ramsey theory has risen to a
prominent place in mathematics, providing the key to solutions of long-standing
problems, in particular, Gowers' solution to the distortion problem. Recently,
the paper of Kechris, Pestov, and Todorcevic connecting Ramsey theory with
topological dynamics led to the recent boom in research regarding applications
of Ramsey theory applied to finding minimal flows; and the recent book of
Todorcevic on Ramsey Spaces has prepared a path for a surge in progress on
Ramsey theory. This conference will focus on Ramsey theory of an infinite flavor
and its applications in the fields of Banach spaces, homogeneous structures, set
theory, and topological dynamics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference will
promote cross-pollination of ideas and results among Ramsey theorists from
different four or more continents, many of whom have never met each other. It
will serve as a unifying point for the subject of infinitary Ramsey theory and
increase future collaborations. It will also provide entry to the field for
young researchers with diverse backgrounds. As such, the field of infinitary
Ramsey theory will be strengthened, very likely speeding up the rate of progress
in this area and areas in which it is applied. The conference website is at
