Electronic structure of two classes of novel Mott insulators will be studied
under this Materials Synthesis and Processing Initiative grant: the crown-ether
electrides and the layered transition metal oxides. Although these oxides are
believed to be traditional Mott insulators explained by the Hubbard model, in
fact the ground state of that model disagrees seriously with experimental Bragg
neutron scattering. The assumptions of this model will be examined with the
objective of finding an appropriate replacement that will describe the observed
spin density as well as the excited states. A novel feature of the crown-ether
electrides is that the anions are simply the localized electrons themselves.
Calculations on isolated crown-ether molecules suggests that the localized
electrons will trace their lineage to a highly diffuse Rydberg-like orbital
occupied by the unpaired electron. The diffuse character of these molecular
electrons may permit them to become localized in the cavities formed "between"
the molecular ions. This proposition, as well as the spatial distribution of the
ordered magnetic moment in the transition metal oxides, will be explored using
ab initio Hartree-Fock theory as well as multi-band Hubbard models using both
variational and perturbation methods. %%% Theoretical research will be conducted
as part of the Materials Synthesis and Processing Initiative. The primary focus
will be on a theoretical explanation of a new class of electride materials - the
crown-ethers. These materials have been synthesized at Michigan State and a firm
theoretical explanation is required. In addition, research will be conducted on
a related material, the transition metal oxides, which is important as the
precursor material for high temperature superconductors.
