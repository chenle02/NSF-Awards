This three-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research in materials
research involves Matthew Tirrell of the University of Minnesota and Catherine
Amiel-Guenoun of the Laboratory for the Chemical Physics of Biopolymers at the
French National Center for Scientific Research in Thiais, France. The award
provides travel support and living expenses to Dr. Tirrell and a graduate
student. The objective of the research is to study the interfacial structures
generated by adsorption of hydrophilic-hydrophobic block copolymers on solid
surfaces. A particular novel system, known as polyoxazoline-
polyisobutylvinlether, is the basis of the research program. The collaboration
takes advantage of the simultaneous application of two experimental methods:
small angle neutron scattering performed by the French investigators and surface
force measurement conducted by the American team.
