The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to support needs in emergency medicine,
neurology, and anesthesiology for a low-cost, non-radiative device that allows
for accurate, efficient, and intuitive placement of needles in the spine. By
reducing the number of required injection attempts, the device reduces patient
pain, number of complications, and the need for radiation. The device could also
be employed as a training tool to improve physician skill and familiarity with
lumbar punctures, thus reducing errors. While the currently proposed device is
limited to use in the lumbar region, future versions will expand its use to
other regions on patients’ spine, greatly impacting injections for pain
management. In the future, the device can also offer an imaging option for the
current blind techniques in other clinical procedures such as joint injections.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project
will expand functionality of the first device. A prototype device has been shown
to improve the accuracy and efficiency of lumbar punctures. However, in response
to clinician needs, the functionality will further be expanded as follows: The
first objective adds external needle position tracking by adding full needle
insertion and lateral adjustment functionalities to the needle guide. Tracking
mechanisms will be developed to detect and display the needle’s position on the
image. These modifications will be tested on a bench model by clinicians and
compared to the previous device. The second objective incorporates feature
detection into the image. Physician feedback will drive the selection of
necessary features and propriety algorithms will be developed to highlight the
features on the image. This project will test algorithms on existing data and
then incorporated into a bench model. The third objective incorporates an
external digital pressure sensing mechanism to alert the user of entry of needle
into epidural space to prevent complications from inadvertent punctures beyond
the epidural layer. The accuracy of this design will then be tested by
clinicians on a bench model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
