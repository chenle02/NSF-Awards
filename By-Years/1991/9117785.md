Many bacteria are propelled by reversible rotary motors which derive the energy
for rotation from a protonmotive gradient. Among the many proteins required to
build a fully functional motor, there are five, called MotA, MotB, FliG, FliM,
and FliN, that are most likely to be involved in torque generation. FliG, FliM,
and FliN are also important for assembly and for determining the direction of
rotation; these are called "switch-complex" proteins. The roles of the switch-
complex proteins in torque generation will be examined, using molecular genetics
to make mutations in these components, and detailed measurements of motor
performance to assess the consequences. The effects of controlled, low-level
expression of theses proteins also will be examined. This strategy is similar to
that used previously to study MotA and MotB. The long-term objective of these
studies is to understand, at the molecular level, how the flagellar motor
converts chemical energy into mechanical energy. Understanding mechanisms of
energy conversion is a central concern in bioenergetics. Also since motility
plays a role in certain bacterial infections, understanding the flagellar motor
is likely to have clinical significance.
