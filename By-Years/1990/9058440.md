This project investigates the possible use of randomization in the design of
algorithms and data structures for geometric problems that involve a large
number of objects, with a particular emphasis various aspects of the so-called
higher-dimensional point problem. The goal is to design data structures that
permit the rapid location of a query point in a polyhedral partition of d-
space. Various range query problems which consider possible between
preprocessing time, space usage, query time, and are also investigated.
