As local industries implement cloud-based solutions, there is an increasing need
of skilled technicians to implement, maintain, and troubleshoot cloud services.
This project team plans to design the curricula for a degree in Cloud
Administration Technology with the input from local industry representatives to
meet industry workforce needs. Students will get training related to networking,
Internet of Things (IoT), programming, virtualization, and cloud computing. The
project will take an interdisciplinary approach to prepare students to transfer
their knowledge and skills to the workforce. The proposed project has the
potential to grow the local talent-pool of cloud service technicians and provide
a model curriculum informed by industry's needs for other community colleges to
use.

The three main goals of this project are: (1) to design a new curriculum leading
to an AAS degree and/or a certificate in Cloud Administration Technology, (2) to
increase the supply and diversity of the IT workforce in the Mississippi Gulf
Coast region by increasing the enrollment of military veterans, removing
obstacles for attendance of other students, and incorporating devices specific
to students with special needs, and (3) to improve curriculum for the existing
certificate in IoT and Smart Technology. The project team intends to work with
local industry and high schools to enhance existing courses and develop new
courses, while making the program more accessible to all students. The proposed
curricula will be disseminated on the ATE Central website and outcomes will be
shared locally at the biannual advisory committee meetings. The project team
will attend and present at the annual ATE PI conference, as well other
professional development conferences and workshops. This project is funded by
the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of
technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the Nation's economy.
