9417971 Axelrod Although numerous (50+) Middle Miocene (18-12 Ma) Floras have
been collected and a good number described from the great Basin region, little
is known of its vegetation and climatic history following 10 Ma. This proposal
plans to collect and describe 16 new fosssil floras dataed 10-5 Ma from the
region and integrate them with described pollen floras that contain "sage" taxa
that make up the present lowland flora but are unrepresented by megafossils.
Description and analysis of these floras will provide a resource for diverse
fields of research. 1) Rates of climate change in the later Neogene and its role
in modification of composition of floras and mammalian faunas. 2) Climatic
conditions at these sites can provide a reliable basis for interpreting the
developement of paleosoils. 3) Temperatures inferred for the fossil floras
provide a basis for estimating elevation. 4) Rates of evoluation of woody plants
and of mammals during the period 10-5 Ma. 5) Influence of taphonomy on floral
composition at diverse sites (i.e., lake, floodplain, volcanic mudfow). 6) And
as a resource, the species of each flora are entered into the data base in Mus.
Paleo. UC Berkeley and are available via Internet.
