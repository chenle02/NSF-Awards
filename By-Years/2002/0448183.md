This project explores data management methods for geosensor networks, i.e. large
collections of very small, battery-driven sensor nodes deployed in the
geographic environment that measure the temporal and spatial variations of
physical quantities such as temperature or ozone levels. An important task of
such geosensor networks is to collect, analyze and estimate information about
continuous phenomena under observation such as a toxic cloud close to a chemical
plant in real-time and in an energy-efficient way. The main thrust of this
project is the integration of spatial data analysis techniques with in-network
data query execution in sensor networks. The project investigates novel
algorithms such as incremental, in-network kriging that redefines a traditional,
highly computationally intensive spatial data estimation method for a
distributed, collaborative and incremental processing between tiny, energy and
bandwidth constrained sensor nodes. This work includes the modeling of location
and sensing characteristics of sensor devices with regard to observed phenomena,
the support of temporal-spatial estimation queries, and a focus on in-network
data aggregation algorithms for complex spatial estimation queries. Combining
high-level data query interfaces with advanced spatial analysis methods will
allow domain scientists to use sensor networks effectively in environmental
observation. The project has a broad impact on the community involving
undergraduate and graduate students in spatial database research at the
University of Maine as well as being a key component of a current IGERT program
in the areas of sensor materials, sensor devices and sensor. More information
about this project, publications, simulation software, and empirical studies are
