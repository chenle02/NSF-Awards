9410063 Li This proposal research is to study the system architectural model and
system software support of network of personal workstations (NPW) connected by
SCI (Scalable Coherence Interface, IEEE Standard 1596). Oppose to the
traditional LAN-connected NPW, SCI- connected NPW can provide physically shared
memory and cache coherence among workstations across a network with high
bandwidth (1Gbyte/sec) and low latency (microseconds). The research will provide
the understanding of the new parallel architecture which is highlighted by
contradiction between its closely-coupled nature due to shared memory and cache
coherence and its loosely- coupled nature due to the physical distance between
workstations and independent operations of the workstations. This research will
result in models of various designs of SCI-connected NPW and their comparisons,
operating system designs to support such architectures, and performance data
based on typical parallel applications. The result will be an important step
towards inexpensive but powerful and widely available parallel computing
platforms. The work will be done in three steps: (1) Model the architectural
characteristics of SCI-connected NPE. (2) Design and implement operating system
software supports based on the hardware and applications requirements. System
level performance will also be studied. (3) Design and implement application
prototypes to obtain performance data. Simulation will be used to predict the
performance of large scale SCI-NPWs. ***
