Encapsulated affinity adsorbents will be developed and will be employed in one-
step, whole-broth isolation/purification of monoclonal antiboidies (Mabs). The
capsules consist of hydrogel-membrane wall and an encapsulated, ligand-bonded
polymer adsorbent. The capsules are highly selective due to the combined kinetic
selectivity of the membrane and the affinity selectivity of the bonded polymer.
The capsules are easily retrievable due to their large sizes (0.5 - 1.5 mm).
Process schemes for using the capsules including chromatography will be studied.
The research has the potential to offer new and economic approaches for binding
and separating biological molecules from complex mixtures.
