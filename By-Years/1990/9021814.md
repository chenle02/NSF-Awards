This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP) award from the
Research Facilities Office provides funds to the University of Alabama for the
renovation and repair of Lloyd Hall which houses the synthetic chemistry,
biochemistry, and materials science research and research training activities of
the Department of Chemistry. This building was constructed in 1931 and last
renovated in 1980. The ARFMP grant of $1,060,000 and $1,270,321 provided by the
grantee as cost sharing will be used to modernize these research and research
training facilities. This project will address the need to improve the current
research infrastructure in terms of health and safety as well as of quantity,
quality, and efficiency of the research that can be conducted by (a) converting
the former chemistry library for use as research laboratory space; (b)
installing additional or replacement fume hoods, additional electrical circuits,
and gaseous nitrogen lines; (c) upgrading the building's heating, ventilation,
and air conditioning (HVAC) system; and (d) providing more safety equipment.
This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by providing an improved
environment for the conduct of research and for the training of undergraduate
and graduate students. Penetration into new research areas made possible by this
renovation will increase the productivity of the Department of Chemistry's
graduate students and hence the role that the University of Alabama will be able
to play in helping to meet the nation's current and future scientific manpower
needs.
