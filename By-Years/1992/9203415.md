This proposal plans to investigate the interfaces between the high Tc
superconductor oxide film and other material media. The high Tc superconductor
oxide film, deposited on a yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) buffered silicon
substrate. This 2-terminal device structure is characterized electrically by the
I-V and C-V measurements. The high Tc superconductor oxide is of the ytrrium-
barium-cupric oxide (YBCO) type. Deposition is made by the pulsed deposition
(PLD) method. Processing parameters will be varied and the resultant 2-terminal
device structures will be probed of their interface bahaviors. %%% This research
will provide information to the understandings of the interfaces between the
high Tc superconductor oxide film layer and other material media in a 2-terminal
device structure. Electrical characterization of the 2-terminal device
structure, through the I-V and C-V measurements, will provide information which
can suggest future improvements in the performance of the device structure. It
will enhance the potential usefulness of superconducting devices.
