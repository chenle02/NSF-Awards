Bridge damage during past earthquakes indicates that the interaction between
the deck and abutments might be an important factor. This project is to develop
analytical models for investigation of this complicated phenomenon. The study
will provide adequate response information for bridges and lead to much needed
methods for seismic safety design of bridge structures.
