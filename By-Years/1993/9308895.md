9308895 Korel This project will investigate dynamic program slicing and its
application in the debugging of large programs. Slicing has been shown to be
useful in program debugging. The major idea behind slicing is to identify that
part of the program that might potentially contain the fault. It has been shown
that by taking a particular program execution into account, dynamic slicing may
significantly reduce the size of the slice as compared to static slicing. As a
result, dynamic slicing is better suited for the purpose of debugging than
static slicing. Our objective in this project is to continue our earlier
research on dynamic slicing and algorithmic debugging. The investigation will
involve constructing a dynamic slicing environment, extending the theory of
dynamic slicing, development of new methods of dynamic slice derivation, and
evaluating the effectiveness of dynamic slicing in the process of debugging of
large programs. ***
