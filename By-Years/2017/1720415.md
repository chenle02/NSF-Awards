NonTechnical Abstract: The Wisconsin MRSEC brings together teams of researchers
- undergraduates, graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and faculty - from
diverse disciplinary backgrounds from across the University of Wisconsin-Madison
and other key partner universities to understand at the level of atoms and
molecules how to create new materials that will enable next-generation
technologies. By addressing fundamental challenges related to a critical void in
knowledge involving disorder in materials, and the emergence of order from
disordered materials, new materials for telecommunications, clean energy,
quantum information sciences and biotechnologies are being developed. The Center
integrates the discovery and sharing of new knowledge with national leadership
in development and dissemination of research-inspired educational materials for
K-12 and the public, innovative projects that broaden participation of groups
underrepresented in STEM fields, development of new characterization facilities
that integrate data analysis and sharing, industry outreach to promote regional
economic development, and professional development and international
opportunities that train the next-generation US
workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract: Center research is organized
into two interdisciplinary research groups (IRGs) each addressing complex
challenges involving metals, inorganic oxides, semiconductors and organic
molecular assemblies. The IRGs unite 44 senior investigators from 9 disciplines,
and integrate synthesis, structural characterization, theory/simulation,
property evaluation and applications. IRG1, entitled Stability in Glasses: New
Materials and New Insights, leverages the cross fertilization of ideas and
techniques from inorganic and organic glass research to address fundamental
questions related to processes, structure and properties of glasses, building on
the discovery that physical vapor deposition can increase kinetic and
thermodynamic stability of organic glass films. IRG1 is enabling diverse
applications by creating ultrastable glass thin films of various materials,
including ultralow-loss oxide dielectrics for quantum computing and mirrors,
ultra-smooth metallic glass hard coatings, and materials for organic
electronics. IRG2, entitled Order from Disorder: Approaches for New Thin-Film
Oxides, understands and engineers the growth of structurally, chemically and
topographically complex epitaxial metal oxide crystals from amorphous layers,
with a focus on compositions of oxides unconstrained by requirements of
thermodynamic stability, and 3D geometries that are inaccessible via current
methods. IRG2 controls atomic reordering and solid-state mass transport during
crystallization to impact technologies from electronics, ionic transport, and
optics to areas as diverse as glass devitrification in nuclear storage and
biomineralization. Both IRGs provide an interdisciplinary and multi-
institutional learning environment for graduate students, postdocs, and
undergraduates, in which the research focuses on the important area of glass
science and the development of multi-functional and earth-friendly materials.
