Cranchiate cephalopods are a diverse family of squids that are a dominant
component in the world's oceans. They constitute an important link in the food
web in mid-water depth intervals. Dr. Nancy Voss has held several NSF awards for
systematic, biogeographic and evolutionary study of the family. She has
requested renewed support for the production of monographic revisions of two
genera, and for a biogeographic synthesis of 13 genera in the family. This
project is a natural continuation of past contributions and will lead eventually
to a synthesis of the family's evolutionary and biogeographic history. The
proposed research has wide implications for study of the evolution and
distribution of other cephalopods, and of other members of the pelagic fauna.
Applied scientists will have the benefit of improved identification criteria and
superbly illustrated guides to species.
