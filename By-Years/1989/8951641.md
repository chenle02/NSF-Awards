Surface chemistry has become a very important analytical approach for the study
of heterogeneous catalysts, semiconductors and corroded surfaces. Yet
undergraduates receive very little introduction to the field in the classroom
and none in the laboratory. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Auger
electron spectroscopy (AES) are two complimentary surface techniques and are the
most commonly used of the surface analysis techniques. Equipment has been
purchased that is mounted onto an existing vacuum system so that the system is
configured for the large number of samples that are involved in student use.
Students use this equipment in physical chemistry and instrumental analysis
course to learn the strengths of each technique and see how they can use the two
to determine the surface elemental composition and chemistry and to determine
film thickness. The institution is matching the NSF grant with an equal amount
of funds.
