Model theory is a branch of mathematical logic, which itself is a fairly new
subject that originated in the late 19th century with philosophical
investigations into the foundations of mathematics. However, in recent decades
it has found many applications in other parts of mathematics, in computer
science, and even in engineering (quantifier elimination as it relates to
robotics). Algebra, on the other hand, is one of the oldest and most mature
disciplines of mathematics. Aschenbrenner proposes to continue his research in
the intersection of these two disciplines, where a fruitful exchange has been
going for the better part of the last half-century.

The project is organized around several themes, including a continuation of
Aschenbrenner?s collaborative efforts to develop a model-theoretic treatment of
asymptotic analysis, and investigations into some model-theoretic questions with
the means of combinatorial geometry. These topics have relationships not only to
other fields within mathematics but also to applications of differential
equations in engineering, and to computational learning theory. Another aspect
of the proposal concerns finding algorithms for algebraic problems and studying
their complexity, a topic which is of central importance for applications of
computer algebra in science and engineering.
