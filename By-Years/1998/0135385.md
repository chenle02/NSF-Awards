&lt;br/&gt;This three-year continuation of assessing the ATE Program will
address four major questions: 1) To what degree is the program achieving its
goals? 2) Is it making an impact, reaching the individuals and groups intended?
3) How effective is it when it reaches it constituents? 4) Are there ways the
program can be significantly improved?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will be
comprised of three components. The first is the continuing collection and
reporting of monitoring information for the ATE program through a database this
project developed. Second is the design and implementation of four studies
examining critical issues for ATE: the value added by ATE as determined by
business and industry, the quality of materials development and their impact,
the quality of professional development, and the nature and extent of
sustainability of ATE project. The third component is dissemination of the
evaluation project's findings through traditional and innovative
approaches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
