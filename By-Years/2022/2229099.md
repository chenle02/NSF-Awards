Automated reasoning systems are used to solve complex problems in mathematics
and computer science. The method involves translating problems into a
fundamental logical language. For efficiency, very subtle translations are often
used. It is then hard to be sure that the translation adequately represents the
original problem and that the automated reasoning results therefore have the
intended meaning. The novelty of this project is the use of a mathematical
verification system based on logic, to check the correctness of translations.
The projects' impacts include having more flexible and reliable means of solving
hard problems in mathematics and computer science using automated reasoning
technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, this project aims to develop
formal libraries, methods, and tools for carrying out all of the following tasks
in verified ways:&lt;br/&gt;encoding statements as clausal formulas; using
results from satisfiability (SAT) solvers to justify further reductions;
reducing search space by introducing clauses that break symmetry; and carrying
out substantial transformations of problems to reduce them to forms amenable to
verification by SAT solvers. The project uses the Lean interactive proof
assistant to verify correctness, and demonstrates the utility of its methods by
applying them to notable problems in mathematics and computer
science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
