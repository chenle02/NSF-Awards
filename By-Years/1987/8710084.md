This project will observe the mean and time variation of the large scale ocean
circulation in the cental tropical and subtropical Pacific Ocean. Expandable
bathytermograph (XBT) soundings will be made from a merchant vessel to obtain
quarterly eddy-resolving sections of temperature to a depth of about 850 m along
a track from New Zealand to study and others of its kind. Although support for
this project is limited to three years, it is envisioned that this project will
continue through 1996.
