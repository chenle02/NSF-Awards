A School of Mathematics and Theoretical Physics will be held on Guadeloupe May
30 to June 13, 1993. The school will present to students at or near the Ph.D.
level discussions of recent progress in such fields of mathematical physics as
non- commutative geometry, quantum groups, integrable systems, and the
foundations of quantum field theory. These fields represent an exciting
interplay between mathematics and physics which is potentially very useful to
both. The lecturers include a number of excellent practitioners of these fields.
