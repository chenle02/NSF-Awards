9612306 Collins Point defects in intermetallic compounds are investigated using
perturbed angular correlations of gamma rays (PAC), a spectroscopy technique
providing excellent resolution of different local environments of probe atoms in
solids. Lattice vacancies and antisite defects belonging to higher- order
equilibrium defects are detected in atomic shells close to indium probe atoms.
The equilibrium defect of greatest interest is the high-temperature one that
makes diffusion possible, such as the Schottky vacancy-pair in a binary alloy.
There are three objectives to the grant: (1) Properties of equilibrium defects
are determined through measurements on quenched samples and samples at high
temperature. Binary alloys selected have the B2 (CsC1) structure, including
high-temperature structural aluminides, such as NiAl and model systems such as
PdIn and AuCd in which disturbances from PAC probes are minimal. For the first
time vacancy migration enthalpies are determined from nuclear relaxation of PAC
signals caused by vacancy motion at high temperature. (2) A study is made of
ordering among Au and Ag atoms in the ternary compound AuAgCd2. Because the
order parameter is determined locally, there is a much greater sensitivity to
order-parameter fluctuations than found when using conventional diffraction
methods. If the transition is found to be second-order, the measurements give
insight into the range of interactions leading to the ordering. (3) The fraction
of stored energy associated with lattice vacancies in mechanically-milled PdIn
is examined using PAC to determine vacancy concentrations and calorimetry to
determine the stored energy. To date there is inadequate knowledge of how excess
energy is stored in materials during milling, and the goal of this study is to
determine the amount of energy stored in vacancies. %%% The material defects
under study here affect phase stability and diffusion in advanced materials used
in a variety of applic ations. ***
