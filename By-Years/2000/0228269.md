The investigators will study the macroscale irregularity features seen in high
frequency radar observations. The plasma of the high-latitude ionosphere is
highly structured on spatial scales from hundreds of kilometers to meters. The
effects of these irregularities are readily apparent in technical systems, such
as radar, navigation, and communication. The radars of the SuperDARN (Super Dual
Auroral Radar Network) system detect backscatter from decameter-scale
irregularities, from which behavior of larger scale structures may be inferred.
Thus, the observations will provide information about the occurrence frequency,
spatial distribution and motion of the irregularities and their relation to
larger scale ionospheric features such as patches, blobs, and polar cap arcs.
Because the SuperDARN radars are widely distributed over the northern and
southern Polar Regions, the data is especially useful in tracking the origin and
dynamic behavior of plasma structures. The observations will also be compared
with simultaneously derived convection maps to test models that describe the
evolution of patches as they move through the high latitude ionosphere. The
investigators will provide community access to data products that will help
other investigators study irregularity features for specific events. The
scientific studies enabled by the observations will contribute to the
development of space weather models that specify and predict ionospheric
conditions that might impact the operation of technical systems.
