This Small Business Innovation Research Phase 1 Project is to develop
microarrays for analyzing thousands of sequences of DNA for genomic and
diagnostic applications. The microarrays would be made from sol-gel coatings
with specific microstructures. These substrates will allow higher density arrays
and higher signal/noise ratio from each of the array elements. This will result
in increasing analytical throughput with an improved accuracy in detection and
reproducibility of the data. The commercial applications of this project will be
in the areas of healthcare and agriculture.
