Recent evidence shows that epidermal browning of tall- stemmed, long-lived
cacti is related to total time of sun exposure. Epidermal browning is much
greater on the southern exposures of such cacti in the Northern Hemisphere and
on northern exposures of similar species in the Southern Hemisphere. This
surface browning leads to death of individual cacti. An evaluation of authentic
photographs of saguaro cacti an Arizona for the past 90 years shows that
epidermal browning has increased by about 4% per decade, the same percentage
increase in ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure in the United States over the
past three decades. The increase in ultraviolet light exposure has been shown to
be related to the depletion of the ozone layer in the stratosphere. The data
base (473 cacti) of saguaros has been able to show the sequence of steps during
epidermal browning. The purpose of the proposed research is to make the same
series of phenological and physiological measurements on several species of
cacti in Chile and Argentina, to determine if the sequence of steps of epidermal
browning is similar to those of saguaros. If the sequence of steps is similar
among all these cacti (both Northern and Southern hemispheres), the basis for
further investigation of a possible mechanism for UV-indeed injury would be
strengthened.
