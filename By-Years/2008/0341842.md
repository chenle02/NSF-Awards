Given the reduction in the number of students interested in preparing to
become&lt;br/&gt;engineers, increased emphasis must be paid to retaining the
students who do&lt;br/&gt;matriculate. Building on previous work at the
University of Cincinnati, faculty in the&lt;br/&gt;schools of engineering and
education collaborate on the use of instructional&lt;br/&gt;technologies as a
mechanism for delivering materials that accommodate a variety
of&lt;br/&gt;learning styles. Instructional materials based upon research into
the use of instructional&lt;br/&gt;technologies improve student engagement and
exploration. It is expected that this&lt;br/&gt;change can increase student
satisfaction and performance in fundamental engineering&lt;br/&gt;science
courses and their interest in fields of engineering and engineering
technology.&lt;br/&gt;Modules, to be developed and tested are in Strength of
Materials and Industrial&lt;br/&gt;Controllers.
