This Research Planning Grant project is in the broad area of materials chemistry
and in the subfield of nanostructures. During the tenure of this eighteen-month
standard grant, Professor Liu and her students at Wayne State University will
conduct preliminary experiments designed to establish the feasibility of a
research program in the fabrication and characterization of nanoscale materials.
Their strategic approach involves the preparation of a variety of nanoparticle
structures and patterns including dots, line, and two-dimensional islands with
various shapes, followed by the characterization of these structures using force
microscopy, particularly scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and atomic force
microscopy (AFM). Nanostructure synthesis will be based on both traditional
self-assembly and Langmuir-Blodgett techniques to prepare templates as well as
the direct electrosynthesis of nanostructures using the probe tips of the force
microscopes. The ability to prepare nanometer-sized materials and to control the
size and structures of these particles is of immense fundamental and
technological importance. This Research Planning Grant project will lead to a
research program in the fabrication and characterization of nanoscale materials
with `size tunable` properties of importance to quantum physics and chemistry,
new sub- micron electronic devices, and novel optoelectronic materials.
