With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program is supporting Professor
Hyun-Suk Lim, of the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at Indiana
University School of Medicine to develop new modulators of protein-protein
interactions (PPIs). Such PPI modulators are in high demand in chemical biology
and medicinal chemistry today. The approach taken here involves the design,
synthesis and evaluation of conformationally constrained aryl-bridged
cyclic/bicyclic peptoids bearing helix-mimetic segments. Design features include
relatively large size, a high structural diversity, and increased conformational
rigidity, all features expected to promote binding to large and non-contiguous
protein interfaces Compared to conventional peptides, these cyclic peptoid
scaffolds are expected to display improved aqueous solubility, excellent cell
permeability and be easily accessed synthetically. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project will exposed graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to
multidisciplinary chemical biology environment with a notable synthetic
component. The project will also provide training opportunity to undergraduate
students at Indiana University - Purdue University at Indianapolis (IUPUI)
through the Life Health Science Internship (LHSI) program. In addition,
underrepresented minority students supported by IUPUI Graduate Office will be
involved. Professor Lim will also participate in "Distributed Drug Discovery"
(D3) program led by IUPUI to incorporate undergraduate education into the search
for drug leads for neglected diseases.
