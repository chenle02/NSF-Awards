9424517 Webster This U.S.-Brazil Program award will fund a planning visit by Dr.
Grady L. Webster of the University of California, Davis to discuss collaboration
on systematics of Euphorbiaceae with botanists in Brazil. Dr. Webster is linking
this visit to the XLVI Congresso Nacional de Botanica in Riberao Preto, Sao
Paulo, Brazil. He will stay on to meet with colleagues at Instituto Botanico in
Sao Paulo and at Museu Municipal in Curitiba. An informal conference will be
held to discuss collaboration in preparing a systematic treatment of the
Euphorbiaceae of Brasil, as a possible precursor to a new Flora Brasiliensis
that will include all vascular plant families. The 60 genera with c. 900 species
of Brasilian Euphorbiaceae include species of biogegraphic and evolutionary
interest, and the wild forms of important economic plants such as Hevea (rubber)
and Manihot (cassava). ***
