The first area addressed in this project is fault-tolerance in distributed
systems with primary focus on continuous systems operation and collaboration.
Collaboration is achieved when multiple distributed entities contribute toward a
common goal. For collaboration to be successful in a distributed system, the
goal must be achieved in a potentially unstable network environment. The second
area is the investigation of telecommunication switching architectures.
Specifically, the design and deployment of high-speed multimedia networks.
