Abstract for DMS - 0110321

This projects mainly deals with some central issues in Kaehler geometry: the
uniqueness and existence of extremal Kaehler metrics and as well how to obtain
such a solution. On the Kaehler Ricci flow problem, I am working with G. Tian.
Our main results are: in any Kaehler-Einstein manifolds, if the initial metric
has positive bisectional curvature, then the flow converges exponentially to a
unique Kaehler-Einstein metric. I plan to work with him to eliminate with the
assumption of positive bisectional curvature or the assumption of Kaehler
Einstein metrics. On the problem of geodesic, the main results of my research
are: a) there exists a geodesic with second derivatives uniformly bounded,
between any two Kaehler metrics in a Kaehler class. A direct consequence of this
result is that the constant scalar curvature metric is unique in each Kaehler
class if the first Chern class of the manifold is negative. b) the space of
Kaehler metrics is a metric space and it is non-positively curved in the sense
of Alexandrov. On the problem of geodesic, I want to improve the regularity of
geodesic to three derivatives uniformly bounded (or to understand when this
regularity might fail). That will be a very important consequence in Kaehler
geometry.

Kaehler Einstein metric arose naturally from Physics, algebraic geometry and
some other diverse areas of mathematics. Extremal Kaehler metric is a natural
generalization of these concepts by E. Calabi. The method of finding these
metrics is by solving a totally nonlinear elliptic partial differential equation
on manifolds. Most of the time, one can not find solution explicitly. Then one
has to rely on various kind a priori estimates to determined when there exists a
solution and if the solution metric should be unique. In this project, we will
develop some new techniques to handle these difficult estimates. And these
techniques will have impact in other related problems of mathematics.
