This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in "The
Twentieth Riviere-Fabes Symposium" that will be held April 28-30, 2017, on the
twin-cities campus of the University of Minnesota. The bulk of the support is
directed at graduate students and postdocs.

This annual conference, of which the 2017 meeting will be the twentieth
rendition, honors the mathematical legacies of the late Nestor M. Riviere and
Eugene B. Fabes by focusing on recent developments in analysis, especially in
the field of partial differential equations. The 2017 program will feature four
principal speakers (Manuel del Pino, Philip Isett, Sylvia Serfaty, and Luis
Silvestre), each of whom will deliver a two-hour lecture. The program allows
ample time for informal discussion among the participants. More details about
the symposium are forthcoming on http://www.math.umn.edu/conferences/riv_fabes/.
