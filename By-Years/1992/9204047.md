Ozone (O3) and other oxidants in the troposphere affect both local air quality
and global climate. Photochemical reactions involving odd nitrogen compounds and
carbon monoxide (CO) or hydrocarbons (NMHC) produce ozone, but measurements of
these species are sparse. The resulting paucity of data for air over nonurban
areas of the eastern United States and over the northern Atlantic Ocean limits
our understanding of the atmospheric chemistry of ozone and hydroxyl radicals
(OH). The PI's plan to conduct measurements at the AEROCE (Atmosphere/Ocean
Chemistry Experiment) site in Bermuda in spring/summer 1992 and 1993, when they
will measure various reactive nitrogen species and collect grab samples for
hydrocarbons. Intensive experiments will be carried out for one month, than the
instruments will be operated in an unattended, monitoring mode for as long as
possible. Total reactive nitrogen (NOy) will be measured by direct
chemiluminescence, and CO by IR absorption. Carbon monoxide will be measured
continuously in both Bermuda and a U.S. East Coast site. For communications and
data acquisition in Bermuda, they plan to use a PAM-based (Portable Automated
Mesonet) system. These field experiments will study the fate and effects of
pollutants after they have left the North American continent, and support
aircraft experiments coordinated by the Center for Clouds, Chemistry, Climate
(C4), and the North Atlantic Regional Study (NARE).
