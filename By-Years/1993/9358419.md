9358419 Rutland A program is being developed to study turbulent reacting flows
using direct numerical simulation (DNS) techniques coupled with kinetics. DNS
will be used to understand the basic physical processes in turbulent flames and
to develop models from this. A building block approach will be used. The focus
of the effort will be on DNS results, not development of codes. Existing codes
will be used. Some specific techniques and assumptions are: (1) variable density
flow with heat release; low Mach number no sound waves; (2) use of spectral
methods and high order compact finite difference methods; (3) use simple single
step and reduced multi-step chemistry. ***
