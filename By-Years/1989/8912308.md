This award provides renewed support for the Natural Hazards Research and
Applications Information Center at the University of Colorado in Boulder. The
Center disseminates hazards research information to multiple users-
administrators, practitioners, policy makers, and scientists. The Center
publishes and distributes the Natural Hazards Observer to over 8,000 persons or
institutions six times a year, and publishes monographs, working papers,
bibliographies and special publications. It holds an annual workshop involving
users and producers of hazards research, and provides information on a day- to-
day basis in response to inquiries. The Center conducts modest research
activities relating to societal response to natural hazards and supports
researchers throughout the nation as they carry out "quick response" analyses of
specific hazard events. In addition to NSF, the Center also receives support
from FEMA, NOAA, NIMH, EPA, USGS, and the Corps of Engineers.
