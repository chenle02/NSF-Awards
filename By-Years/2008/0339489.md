This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase 1 project seeks to advance a major
application domain for a recent patented technology, Explicit-Multi-Threading
(XMT), for building and using computers. Numerous algorithm researchers have
developed a computational model, the Parallel Random Access Model (PRAM), during
the 1980s and 1990s. From that starting point, a highly parallel XMT processor
architecture whose performance objective is reducing single task completion time
has been conceived and developed. Using fast driving as a metaphor for fast
single task computing, and a flat tire for cache miss, XMT seeks not only to
build cars that can be driven very fast; the cars will also allow safely
changing a flat tire while the fast driving continues.

The XMT technology will give programmers the freedom and power to think and code
in parallel. The simplicity of the parallel programming model enables high
productivity for the application programmer. Orders of magnitude faster general
purpose single task completion time for a given amount of hardware are expected.
