The Department of Ocean Studies is purchasing a fluorometer and continuous flow
analyzer to strengthen the chemistry, marine studies and field research
curricula. Both instruments are being in the chemistry, marine science and basic
biology courses enrolling approximately 200 students per year. Additionally,
several dozen students use the equipment each year on oceanographic research
cruises that link course work to field training as marine scientists.
