In this Faculty Early Career Development Award funded by the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program at NSF, Daniel Neuhauser at the Chemistry
Department of the University of California at Los Angeles will investigate
problems in three distinct research areas in molecular structure and molecular
dynamics. The work in all three areas is based on related mathematical
approaches for the efficient diagonalization of large matrices. The first area
uses a Quantum Monte-Carlo approach to obtain accurate electronic wavefunctions
and potential energy surfaces for molecular systems. The second area involves
efficient solutions of path-integral simulations of molecular dynamics and
scattering, both reactive and non-reactive. The third area involves the
determination of the normal modes for the vibrations of proteins. Neuhauser's
teaching plans include an increased emphasis on undergraduate research and the
introduction of computational chemistry projects into undergraduate coursework.
The work in each of these three areas of research will extend the understanding
of the fundamental processes which underlie many important chemical reactions.
The reactions to be studied initially in the first two areas were chosen because
of their relevance to combustion processes. One of the goals of the studies of
the normal modes in proteins, the third research area, is to obtain information
necessary for the simulation of reactions involved in photosynthesis.
