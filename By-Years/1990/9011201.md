An experimental and numerical study of collision between two liquid drops in an
immiscible viscous liquid environment is proposed. The drop bouncing,
coalescence, separation and shattering will be visualized for different Weber
numbers, Reynolds numbers, drop size ratios, surrounding flow characteristics
and impact parameters. The head-on collision of two liquid drops in an
immiscible viscous liquid will be numerically simulated, by improving a
previously developed code. The predictions on drop shape and drop internal flow
field will be compared to experiments. The proposed study will be useful to
better understand and predict atmospheric rain drop formation, liquid-liquid
extraction, emulsion polymerization, dense spray systems and several processes
in material production.
