DMS-9502892 Eaves This research is to be directed along three closely related
concepts, namely, the solution of equations and paths of equations with
homotopies, the solution of parametric or short paths of equations with
infinitesimals and ordered fields, and the formalisms of a linear problem and
linear algorithm. The essence of the first concept is following the path of
solutions where there is one dimension of freedom, while perhaps, using
approximations, subdivisions, and/or Newton's method. The essence of the second
concept is doing arithmetic with infinitesimals and, transferring algorithms,
problems and solutions from one ordered field to another. For certain problems
and algorithms a parametric version of the problem can be solved by lifting it
to an ordered field containing an infinitesimal to obtain a single problem, the
original algorithm is run in the new ordered field, and the solution is lowered
to the original field to obtain a short path of solutions to the parametric
problem. The essence of the third concept is the precise identification of what
a linear problem is and what type of algorithms solve them. This research is to
be directed along the concepts related to the solution of systems of equations;
the pertinent systems of equations are widely applicable in engineering,
science, and management.
