The undergraduate curriculum in chemistry will be improved by a new rapid scan
60 MHz CW-NMR instrument. This NMR is particularly suitable for undergraduate
teaching laboratories because it is easy to operate and maintain, and acquires
spectra rapidly. This instrument's increased sensitivity will greatly expand the
quantity and quality of experiments carried out in the micro-scale organic
laboratories. Students in the Advanced Organic course will use the instrument in
combination with a computer molecular modeling program for conformational
analysis experiments. The instrument will also have substantial impact on the
Advanced Instrumental Analysis and the Physical Chemistry courses. The grantee
will match the NSF award from non-Federal sources.
