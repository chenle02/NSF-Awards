This award supports participation in the Atlanta Lecture Series in Graph Theory
and Combinatorics, which will be held November 11-12, 2017 and April 21-22, 2018
at Georgia Institute of Technology and Emory University, respectively.
Combinatorics and graph theory have undergone dramatic development in the past
few decades. These two conferences will feature the latest research developments
and themes in the areas of structural graph theory, extremal graph theory, and
probabilistic combinatorics. The series has become a major event for the
combinatorics community, providing opportunities to strengthen collaborations
among researchers and institutions within the southeast region of the United
States.

Each conference features two one-hour lectures by a distinguished researcher,
four one-hour lectures by established researchers mainly from the southeast
region, and four 30-minute talks by early-career researchers and graduate
students. The meetings provide opportunities for interaction among established
researchers and rising stars; this award supports the attendance of graduate
students, early-career researchers, and invited speakers. Additional information
concerning financial support and the conference schedule is maintained at the
lecture series website: http://www.als.math.gatech.edu/
