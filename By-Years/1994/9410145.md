This activity is a planning grant supported under the Research Opportunities for
Women Program. The purpose of this grant in to allow the investigator to begin
investigating and implementing appropriate non-experimental estimation
procedures to determine the effectiveness of a government-funded compensatory
education program. With the help of an unusually rich data set from the
Longitudinal Study of Children at Risk, the possibilities of obtaining unbiased
estimates of program effectiveness will be explored. Various estimation
techniques will be employed in order to determine the effects on student
achievement and grade retention of participation in a Head Start type program
that extends from preschool into the primary grades. A central question of the
broader study is: Can the often noted fading effects of Head Start related
programs be postponed or even eliminated by extending the compensatory services
into the primary grades?
