The principal investigator will continue his research on geometric variation
problems. He will study stability and holomorphicity properties of minimal
surfaces in arbitrary codimension, and develop existence theory for Lagrangian
minimal submanifolds of Kahler-Einstein manifolds. He will also study the
structure of harmonic maps into singular spaces of nonpositive curvature and
determine general conditions under which the Bochner method can be used to
establish rigidity theorems. This award will support research in the general
area of differential geometry and global analysis. Differential geometry is the
study of the relationship between the geometry of a space and analytic concepts
defined on the space. Global analysis is the study of the overall geometric and
topological properties of a space by piecing together local information.
Applications of these areas of mathematics in other sciences include the
structure of complicated molecules, liquid-gas boundaries, and the large scale
structure of the universe.
