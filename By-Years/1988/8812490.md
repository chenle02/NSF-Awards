This is a project to extend the PI's work on analyzing Seasat and Geosat geoid
signals of fractures zones to small offset fracture zones from the North and
South Atlantic. The altimeter data will first be decomposed using and Empirical
Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis, and from this simplified data set systematic
variations of form and amplitude of the profiles will be interpreted in terms of
various models that may be related to crustal thinning. Crustal thinning is
expected to be the main cause of different geoid signals across small offset
fracture zones. %%% Fracture zones are a fundamental feature of the seafloor.
They represent part of a plate boundary and may be control magma segmentation
processes along ocean ridge crests. Not much is understood about ridge-fracture
zone intersections and the physical processes that operate there. The analyses
to be performed during this project should provide useful information regarding
fundamental geological processes on the seafloor.
