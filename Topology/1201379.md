In this project we propose to expand our methods (Makanin-Razborov's machinery,
algebraic geometry over groups, free actions on non-standard trees, structure of
limit groups, etc.) developed in the proof of the Tarski's conjectures on first-
order theories of free groups into several directions: model theory and
algebraic geometry in the presence of negative curvature and for right-angled
Artin groups; group actions on Lambda-trees, Lambda-hyperbolic geodesic spaces,
and cube complexes; algorithmic problems for groups and elimination processes;
equations in a wide variety of groups and algebras.

Solving equations is one of the main themes in mathematics from ancient times.
Equations give a universal language to describe scientific problems in all their
variety. Over the years (centuries, in fact) equations and their solutions
became very complex, so to understand their hidden structure one has to use very
elaborate techniques from algebra and geometry. In particular, groups are used
to describe symmetries of mathematical objects, they play a fundamental role in
studying solutions of equations. Nowadays, when mathematics gets ever more
complex, equations alone cannot describe subtleties of scientific phenomena; new
problems require much more powerful means and more powerful languages. Most of
the essential properties of objects that occur in everyday mathematical practice
can be described in a very particular but universal language, so called first-
order logic. In this project we study properties of groups, in all their
entirety, that can be described in the first-order logic. Along the way we hope
to shed some light on several fundamental open problems in group theory and
algebra.
