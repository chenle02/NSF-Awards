A mismatch exists in modern computer systems between the computational resources
provided by emerging multicore chip-multiprocessors (CMPs) and the ability of
virtual machines (VMs), such as the Java VM or Microsoft Common Language
Runtime, to exploit those resources. CMP architectures will dominate the next
several processor generations; meanwhile, for reasons of security and
portability, software will target VMs rather than native processors. However,
since modern VMs are ill-equipped to directly exploit the coarse-grained
parallelism provided by CMPs, they will not experience significant performance
increases with future generations of processors.

This work aims to pioneer an approach for accelerating the execution of VMs on
CMPs by creating pipelined VMs which are implemented as a series of balanced
programs, or pipeline stages, each executing on a distinct processor core. A
pipelined VM with N balanced stages can provide an N-fold increase in
performance relative to an unpipelined VM. Pipelined VMs allow programmers to
benefit from multicore parallelism while writing sequential single-threaded
programs.

This research agenda closely integrates theoretical work on the benefits and
limits of VM pipelining, with both 1) the design and implementation of pipelines
on real systems, and 2) the exploration of novel computer architectures and
mechanisms. For concreteness, the research plan focuses on pipelined VMs that
target high-speed networking, an area in which aggressive CMPs are already
deployed in commercial and academic platforms and where publically-accessible
testbeds will allow others to develop and deploy pipelined VMs of their own
design.
