This award will support approximately 24 students to attend three co-located
conferences: 2019 High-Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA), Code Generation
and Optimization (CGO), and ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles and Practice of
Parallel Programming (PPoPP). These symposia have leading researchers attending
from academia, both students and faculty, and from industry. The symposia were
held annually separately for many years, and jointly since 2013. Students who
will attend the conferences will be exposed to intellectually stimulating
research by attending the many talks, panels, keynotes, and poster presentations
at the conferences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students receiving travel grants
through this award will learn the importance of good communication skills as
well as learn about what it takes to conduct high quality research, through
interactions with speakers, faculty, and peer student groups. The award also
seeks to enhance the diversity of the attendees, thus maintain a balance between
underrepresented and other groups among the participants supported from the
grant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
