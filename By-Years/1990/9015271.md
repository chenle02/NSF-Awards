The focus of this research is on estimation and signal processing of
multidimensional data. The work involves two main areas of research. The first
deals with the development of multiscale models and estimation methods for
Markov random fields (MRF) and their application to problems in image processing
such as segmentation, edge detection and coding. The goal of this effort is to
develop multiresolution techniques for MRF's which extend the wavelet methods
introduced recently for the multiscale representation of deterministic signals.
The second part of the research focusses on the development of efficient
multigrid and domain decomposition methods for the solution of multidimensional
estimation problems, and for inverse problems or impedance imaging. This work is
part of a collaborative research effort with a group at MIT led by Professor
Alan Willsky.
