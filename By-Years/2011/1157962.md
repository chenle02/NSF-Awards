1157962/Chin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this proposed research is to
investigate and develop autonomous sentinels for pathogen detection and capture.
A system composed of these sentinels will mimic the function of naturally
occurring biological defensive systems, such as white blood cells. This
autonomous sentinel system will have the capability of seeking out invasive
bacteria, spores and toxins in liquid environments, detecting and capturing
them. Once detected and captured, the invasive pathogens can be removed by
retrieving the sentinels. These sentinels will be constructed of
magnetostrictive materials and require no onboard power. The Intellectual Merits
of this project are: 1) this research will further the scientific understanding
of magnetostrictive alloys as a class of materials for sensor applications
through both theoretical simulations and experimental verification and 2) novel
methods of generating magnetostrictive powered propulsion will be investigated.
New autonomous sentinel technologies developed under this proposal are
anticipated to have Broader Impacts leading to a plethora of devices for food
safety, biosecurity, point of care, home care, and environmental monitoring. In
the area of food safety alone, the impacts could be monumental. Every year over
48 million Americans become ill due to eating pathogen contaminated foods. The
resulting foodborne illnesses will lead to the hospitalization of approximately
128,000 people and the death of more than 3,000 at a cost of over $30 billion
dollars. The autonomous sentinels developed under this project could be used to
identify contamination of foods before human consumption. This would
substantially improve the safety of our food supply, improve the quality of
human life, reduce human suffering and deaths, and limit lost productivity due
to foodborne outbreaks in the world.
