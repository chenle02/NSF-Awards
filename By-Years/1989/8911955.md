The planned research focuses on some questions concerning the topology of
singularities and various related structures. It includes a continuation of the
investigator's study of the topology of isolated singularities using methods of
surgery theory, an application of insights gathered from the study of algebraic
knots to the study of fibered knots which leads to the definition of some new
invariants, and an investigation of free and semi-free group actions on spheres
for which the invariant submanifolds are links of singularities. In addition it
envisions an application of these methods to other situations such as isolated
singularities of complete intersections and to non-isolated singularities,
including the development of a Picard-Lefschetz theory for non-isolated
singularities using stratified Morse theory and intersection homology theory.
