LEE DEB 9706317 Research will examine the effect of plants, both native and
transgenically modified species, their rhizosphere communities and microbial
mats on the bioremediation of sediments contaminated with high levels of mercury
and PCBs. The project will include studies to: characterize (chemically,
physically and biologically) the contaminated sediments; establish salt marsh
and brackish water systems in mesocosms using the recently constructed
Bioremediation and Environmental Research Mesocosm (BERM) facility at Skidaway
Institute; evaluate various manipulative strategies for their affect on the
accumulation and transformation of contaminants by plants growing in the
mesocosms; and, test the most promising strategies from the mesocosms studies in
the field. The results of the research should begin to establish a more complete
understanding of the roles of various ecosystem components on bioremediation
under field conditions as well as test the utility of selected transgenic
species for their use as part of a multi-component bioremediation methodology.
