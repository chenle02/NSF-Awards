&lt;br/&gt;The proposal seeks to bring together for a 3 day conference scholars
from 3&lt;br/&gt;academic communities: 1) the learning sciences; 2) science
studies; 3) educational&lt;br/&gt;research. The structure of the conference has
two parts. The sessions on the first day of&lt;br/&gt;the conference will be
devoted to discussion of issues about the nature of scientific&lt;br/&gt;inquiry
and inquiry models of learning. The sessions on the second day will continue
the&lt;br/&gt;focus on inquiry models but also begin to ask questions and raise
issues about aligning&lt;br/&gt;models of scientific inquiry into curriculum,
instruction and assessment models.&lt;br/&gt;There will be representation from
each of the 3 scholarly communities: learning sciences, science studies, and
educational research. There will be two summary panel groups composed of
educational researchers. The entire proceedings of the conference (e.g.,
presentations, comments, and discussions) will be published as
an&lt;br/&gt;edited volume and made available as a CD. Symposium session
presentations on the&lt;br/&gt;outcome of the conference will be submitted to
American Educational Research&lt;br/&gt;Association, National Association for
Research in Science Teaching, and the History of&lt;br/&gt;Science Society. In
addition, the recommendations and issues emerging from this&lt;br/&gt;conference
will inform the framework and content for the Critical Issues Conference
of&lt;br/&gt;the 2005 International History and Philosophy of Science and
Science Teaching, Leeds,&lt;br/&gt;England.
