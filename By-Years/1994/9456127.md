9456127 Carothers A coalition of five liberal arts colleges, a community
college, a comprehensive state university, and a research university will plan
an interdisciplinary program on mathematics and environmental problems.
Mathematicians and scientists from a variety of disciplines will develop an
interdisciplinary entry-level mathematics and science course; will produce
modules, labs, and projects for several existing mathematics, biology, geology,
engineering, and chemistry courses; and will develop an interdisciplinary upper-
division project-based course for mathematics and science majors. These
institutions have experience with mathematics curriculum reform, and have worked
well together previously under NSF curriculum and undergraduate research grants
and through the Michigan Calculus Network and the Pew Midstates Science and
Mathematics Consortium. The participating institutions also have a strong record
of scientific research and expertise in environmental issues. The coalition will
provide a diverse range of institutional perspectives and a variety of
situations in which to test materials.
