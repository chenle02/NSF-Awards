DMR-9707320 A modest level of support is being provided to cover the costs
associated with convening a Planning Committee to institute the NSF Workshop on
Solid State Chemistry and Materials to be held late in 1997. Support from NSF
will be used to cover travel expenses for the members of the planning committee,
and to provide for meeting space at O'Hare Airport in Chicago on Saturday,
January 25, 1996. %%% An ad hoc group participating in the 1996 Gordon Research
Conference on Solid State Chemistry met in July to discuss organizing a Workshop
in Solid State Chemistry and Materials (SSCM). A planning committee was formed
which then met at the Materials Research Society Symposium on Solid State
Chemistry of Inorganic Materials in Boston in December, 1996 at which time the
Proposal for Convening a Planning Committee to Institute a Workshop on Solid
State Chemistry and Materials was discussed and finalized. The Planning
Committee meeting will be held on Saturday, January 25 at Chicago's O'Hare
Airport. A follow-up session is then planned which will involve the Planning
Committee members who will attend the European Gordon Conference on Solid State
Chemistry in Oxford in the Fall of 1997 with the objective of finalizing
participation in the NSF SSCM Workshop by the international community working in
areas of solid state chemistry and materials. ***
