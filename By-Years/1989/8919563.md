This project is the continuation of a research program by an extremely active
group working at infrared wavelengths. Dr. Wynn-Williams and his group will
study the distribution of stars and dust grains in the disks of spiral galaxies
using infrared radiation in the 1 to 2.5 micron wavelength range. They will
concentrate on high luminosity infrared galaxies, interacting galaxies, nearby
disk galaxies, and star formation regions in extragalactic spiral arms. Their
goal is to improve our under- standing of the origin of far infrared emission of
galaxies.
