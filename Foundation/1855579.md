This project investigates descriptive set-theoretic aspects of graphs. A
familiar example of a graph is the internet: a huge network of computers,
connected by cables. Over time, it is easy to imagine this network growing so
large that referring to individual computers becomes next to impossible.
Instead, one can probe large collections and ask questions like "how many labels
do I need so that no two connected computers receive the same label?" This
parameter, called the chromatic number of the graph, can change depending upon
the complexity of the algorithms allowed to produce the labeling. Such
parameters have (often surprising) connections with other areas of mathematics
-- including combinatorial and geometric group theory, probability theory, and
operator algebras -- and a secondary aim of this project is to strengthen these
connections in addition to forging new ones.

More precise proposed areas of study within this general setting include: (a)
existence of measurable vertex colorings, edge colorings, and matchings, and
subforests, (b) applications to structurability of measured equivalence
relations, in particular those arising as orbit equivalence relations of
probability-measure-preserving actions of locally compact Polish groups, (c)
applications to finding measurable tilings of group actions, and (d)
applications towards characterizing paradoxical decompositions. Particular
attention will be paid to ergodic-theoretic applications of this study,
connecting algebraic properties of an acting group with measurable combinatorial
properties of its associated graphed equivalence relation.
