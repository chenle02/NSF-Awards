Professor Curt Wittig and other members of the Chemistry Department of the
University of Southern California are being supported to conduct a Research
Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry. For the period 1990-92,
ten (10) undergraduate students will spend ten (10) weeks each summer actively
engaged in a variety of research projects. Projects range from electrochemical
characterization of coordination complexes to computer simulations of the
dynamics and functions of biological macromolecules. Students will attend weekly
group meetings and make an oral presentation on their work at the end of the
program.
