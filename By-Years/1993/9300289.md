This project establishes a statewide network of 33 institutions, and connects
29 of the institutions to the net. The other four institutions already have
connections to the mid-level network MIDNET. Faculty and students at the
institutions will benefit from access to the resources of the Internet,
including libraries and supercomputers. In addition, they will be able to
communicate and collaborate with colleagues at other campuses in pursuit of
research and educational projects.
