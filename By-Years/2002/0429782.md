This project addresses the growing gap between nominal and exceptional peak
operating conditions in modern microprocessor designs with particular emphasis
on thermal and power delivery systems. In this project, we will develop and
evaluate an adaptive, multi-disciplinary approach to the problem. We propose to
characterize the prevalence of voltage and thermal emergency conditions and
explore methods to sense and detect these emergencies at runtime. We also
propose to develop flexible and extensible architectural interfaces to pass
alarm information to a novel binary translation layer, where the alarm
information is processed and the execution stream modified to avoid recurrences
of the original emergencies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks
to address a key problem in the design of future computer systems; particularly
in application domains where energy efficiency and the ratio of price-to-
performance are more important design principles than peak performance. The
proposed project aims to realign the design of microprocessors given this
emerging trend and allow a greater number of applications in high-volume web
services like web searches, computational genomics/biology, and massively multi-
player role-playing games (e.g., military simulations) to achieve substantial
price/performance gains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
