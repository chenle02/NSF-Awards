Developing systems for interactive visualization of arbitrarily large datasets
is a fundamental challenge in computer graphics. We propose to build a
visualization system capable of processing arbitrarily large polygonal datasets
at interactive frame rates and on a wide range of hardware configurations. The
system will adjust the quality of the images and the frame rate depending on the
performance of each stage of the visualization pipeline. On high-end devices,
the system will deliver high-resolution images at real-time frame rates, while
on lower-end devices (e.g., PDAs), the system will deliver smaller images at
slower (albeit interactive) frame rates. To achieve this scalable performance
over a spectrum of devices, we will develop techniques that effectively decouple
the visualization requirements from the available hardware
resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interactive visualization of large datasets has
applications in many areas. Examples of such datasets include computer-aided
design (CAD) models for manufacturing (e.g., Boeing's 777), models of real-world
environments for disaster simulation and analysis, and results of scientific
simulations (e.g., environmental modeling). Because most of these data are
represented as collections of triangles, visualizing polygonal datasets is a
particularly important problem. Using this technology, end-users will be able to
interact with complex visualizations of large 3D data from the office or on the
field.&lt;br/&gt;
