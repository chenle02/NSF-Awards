This award will support a workshop on effective technical writing for new
researchers in the statistical sciences who seek to publish their research or to
present their research plans in the form of grant proposals for federal funding.
Researchers, especially new researchers, often have difficulty disseminating
their research results not because of the quality of the research but rather
because of inappropriate choices of publication venues for the particular
research and/or because of poor presentation of technical material to the chosen
audience. The National Institute of Statistical Sciences and the American
Statistical Association will manage the Workshop. The workshop will be held at
the Joint Statistical Meetings in Miami Beach, FL, July 31 - August 3,
2011.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will open with tutorial sessions on the
organization of material for a technical article or grant application, on
technical writing techniques and on the specific missions and audiences of key
journals in the statistical sciences. Then each participating new researcher
will work individually with an experienced journal editor as mentor to address
these issues on an individualized basis for draft of the new researcher's work
in progress. Revisions following this guidance will be critiqued by the mentor
to assure that the new researcher's implementation of writing techniques has
been successful before the article or the grant proposal is submitted for
review. The workshop will be held at the Joint Statistical Meetings in Miami
Beach, FL, July 31 - August 3, 2011.
