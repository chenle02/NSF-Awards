Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is ubiquitous in nature since it drives many
thermodynamically unfavorable reactions. Of the 240 enzymes which require ATP,
many are critical to the synthesis of high-value biochemicals such as
polysaccharides. ATP may be regenerated using phosphate donors, but removing the
spent donors creates a separation problem. An alternative approach is H+-ATPase,
a membrane-bound enzyme which regenerates ATP without forming waste products.
The energy required for this reaction may be provided by a proton gradient. It
is the purpose of this research to immobilize the H+-ATPase in a vesicle
composed of an artificial membrane. To avoid the accumulation of spent salts,
the pH gradient needed to power the H+-ATPase will be created electrochemically
rather than with buffers. The ATP product will be used to produce
glucose-6-phosphate from glucose using hexokinase to demonstrate that the ATP
product will be useful for enzymatic syntheses.
