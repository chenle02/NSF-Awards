ABSTRACT

OCE-0136853

The proposal will enable a collaboration between Oregon State and geochemists
of the Consolidated Research Group in Marine Geosciences at the University of
Barcelona, Spain. The purpose of this collaboration is to extend some analyses
of sediment trap materials collected from sites in the Alboran Sea, during June
1997- May 1998 as part of an EC funded Mass Transfer and Ecosystem Response
(MATER-II) project. Particulate matter barium fluxes and other lithogenic tracer
analyses, to be part of a dissertation of a student from the University of
Barcelona, are to be completed with facilities at Oregon State. The scientific
goals of the project are a better understanding of the causes of variability in
the Ba/Corg ratios found in different ocean regions.
