Control of the insect pest, red scale, on citrus trees by the parasitoid
Aphytis melinus is a classic example of biological control resulting in a stable
interaction. We have tested and rejected eight hypotheses seeking to explain
stability in such systems. We have demonstrated that one mechanism, a spatial
refuge, actually decreases stability. Using a combination of modelling and field
experimentation, we will investigate the role of three other potential
stabilizing mechanisms: the presence of an invulnerable adult stage of scale,
and size-dependent sex- allocation and host-feeding by Aphytis. Using the same
approach we will also explore the dynamic effects of the spatial refuge and will
begin evaluating the effects of a minor parasitoid, Encarsia. Our research will
provide general ecological insight into the mechanisms influencing the dynamics
of predator-prey systems, will extend both general ecological theory and the
development and testing of realistic models, and will help elucidate the
distinguishing features of successful biological control.
