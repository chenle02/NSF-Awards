The goal of this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic
Chemistry Program is the development of new methods for stereoselective
synthesis of organic compounds based on compounds containing such transition
metals as tungsten and molybdenum. Such methods are extremely important because
the three-dimensional structure of a molecule can affect profoundly its chemical
and biological properties. The two aims of the project are the development of
new methods using metal complexes for asymmetric and regioselective syntheses
and the elucidation of the mechanisms of stereoselective reactions which are
synthetically useful. The potential utility of higher oxidation state
organometallic complexes for these applications will be explored also. A new
method will be developed for obtaining detailed structural information for
organometallic compounds in solution. Ligands containing paramagnetic metal ions
which bind to organometallics will be designed and synthesized. NMR measurements
using these new shift reagents will allow detailed delineation of structure
(angles and distances) of reactive organometallic species, especially catalytic
intermediates, which exist only in solution.
