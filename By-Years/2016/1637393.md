Swarm robotics explores how groups of robots can work towards a singular goal.
Such a goal is typically achieved by equipping each robot with sensory
capabilities, basic computing power, and actuation. The sensors detect something
about the environment, this information is used to make a decision about the
next action, and some resulting actuation is performed. Swarm robotics has made
many advances in recent years, but it is still in its infancy. The PIs will take
a "task-oriented" approach and start from a desired macroscopic emergent
collective behavior to develop the distributed and stochastic algorithmic
underpinnings that the robots will run (at the microscopic level) in order to
converge to the desired macroscopic behavior; as part of the process, they will
also provide the understanding for yet unexplored collective and emergent
systems. The robots envisioned are small in scale, ranging in size from
millimeters to centimeters, so that when deployed in crowded (i.e., dense)
environments, they will behave as active matter, more specifically as
macroscopic programmable active matter. The emergent behaviors of interest for
simulations include clustering (forming a tight-knit community that is mostly
well-connected), compression (maintaining coherence of a connected community
while minimizing perimeter), flocking (determining an agreed upon direction of
orientation), and locomotion (collectively moving while maintaining
cohesiveness). Many of these have interesting converse problems which are also
equally worthwhile, such as exploration (maintaining a connected population, but
exploring maximal area) and desegregation (preventing separation in a binary
mixture of particles).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs have strong records for
interdisciplinary research, including initiating interdisciplinary areas, e.g.,
robo-physics (Goldman), self-organizing particle systems (Richa), and the fusion
of statistical physics and randomized algorithms (Randall). The PIs also have a
strong commitment toward supporting minorities, women, and undergraduate
research (e.g., through NSF S-STEM programs at ASU; ADVANCE and S.U.R.E.
programs at Georgia Tech). This project will bring together techniques from
multiple disciplines, and new research approaches and findings will be
incorporated into graduate courses. Findings (including open source code) will
be published in the various disciplines, and will be made available on the web
and ArXiv.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific goals of this project are to work
toward developing a theoretical framework for task-oriented active matter,
informed by models of simple physical systems, that can realize and test the
algorithms. The swarm robotics systems that biophysicists build to understand
nature can be modified to perform the tasks these new algorithms require. The
physical models will allow refinements to the theories under additional
constraints, such as gravity and limited energy. It also will allow the PIs to
test their algorithms for robustness, as physical systems admit some error. The
fundamentals of swarm robotics will be studied from a physics standpoint, by
viewing the ensemble as active matter composed of programmable elements at the
micro-level. Thus, a (macro-)task oriented approach will be followed in order to
design a distributed, stochastic algorithmic framework to construct and evaluate
algorithms at the micro-level that yield the targeted emergent macro-behavior.
