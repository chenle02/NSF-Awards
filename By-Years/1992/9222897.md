This Small Business Innovation Research Program Phase II research is to design
and build a functional prototype of a fully portable Computer-Aided Instrument
Design (CAID) and is preparatory to full-scale development of a table product
use in design and test of fully portable digital signal processing (DSP)
instrumentation. The CAID system will have: 1) the software environment for
design of portable DSP instruments; and 2) a Functional- Programmable Instrument
(FPI) platform, which embodies these instruments. The CAID software integrates
instrumentation, DSP, and real-time aspects of signal processing instruments.
FPI consists of uncommitted instrumentation/DSP hardware blocks and software
functions.
