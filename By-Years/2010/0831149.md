Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project studies the privacy and
integrity properties of recently-proposed voting systems which aim to prove
tally-correctness to voters and election observers. Privacy and verifiability
are key characteristics of voting systems, and their importance cannot be
overstated. The research focuses on two types of systems: (1) ones that use
randomized partial audits of mixnet-like components and reveal information to
computationally bounded adversaries, and (2) ones that do not use cryptography
in the construction of ballots. The research approach builds on an information-
theoretic model of voting to measure privacy loss and to study the fundamental
limits of privacy and verifiability. The research has practical value for voting
system designers and election officials. In addition, this project has a
significant outreach component, including the development of course material for
high school education in cryptography and voting systems.
