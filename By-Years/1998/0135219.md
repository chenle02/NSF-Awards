ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Krzysztof M. Jarosz&lt;br/&gt;Proposal:
DMS-0135219&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Southern Illinois University at
Edwardsville&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
proposal requests funding for a Fourth Conference on Function&lt;br/&gt;Spaces
featuring several internationally known leaders in the &lt;br/&gt;field as
principal speakers. This conference has a long an &lt;br/&gt;successful history
and it is expected that it will attract a fair&lt;br/&gt;number of graduate
students and young researchers form all of the&lt;br/&gt;US. Most of the award
funds will be used to enable them to attend&lt;br/&gt;the Symposium. We are
confident that the event will once again be&lt;br/&gt;of significant benefit to
a broad mathematical community and &lt;br/&gt;enthusiastically recommend the
award. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
