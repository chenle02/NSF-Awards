The Environmental Chemical Sciences (ECS) and the Macromolecular, Supramolecular
and Nanochemistry (MSN) programs of the Division of Chemistry will support the
research program of Prof. Christy Landes of Rice University. Prof. Landes and
her research group will develop and apply state of the art single molecule
spectroscopic techniques for understanding and controlling transport in charged
polymer membranes. The research is thus focused on the water/membrane interface,
and will address questions such as how molecules move in charged and crowded
environments. The ultimate goal is to be able to predict and control
heterogeneous processes in interfacial materials at the molecular scale.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The chemical systems to be studied have direct relevance
to the heterogeneous phenomena that occur at the environmental water/soil
interface. The project will increase our understanding of how molecular-scale
dynamics relate to macro-scale interfacial properties. These topics relate to
general large-scale issues such as a future shortage of clean energy and water,
and more directly to separations and water purification applications. Students
working on this project will receive an excellent educational opportunity
because it represents an interdisciplinary research project that relates
chemistry, physics, materials science and environmental science.
