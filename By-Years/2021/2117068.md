Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research develops a new benchmark theoretical
model to understand how imperfections in financial markets impact the strategic
interactions between individual firms and the long run dynamics of different
industries. The interplay between limited access to capital markets and
strategic behavior by firms can have a significant impact on prices, corporate
investment and the degree of industrial concentration. The project will show
that financial frictions are consequential for the industrial organization. The
findings will have important implications for corporate finance by taking into
account the strategic interplay between firms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
will explore how financial market imperfections impact dynamic strategic
interactions between firms and industry. The project will develop a new
benchmark theoretical setting that integrates core insights about the impact of
financial frictions on investment with dynamic industrial organization. The
first project constructs a parsimonious baseline tug-of-war theoretical setting
in which two firms compete to enjoy a dominant position. The second project
develops a workhorse settings used in applied corporate finance to analyze the
impact of financial frictions on investment. Baseline model yields three
preliminary findings: (i) Financial frictions often lead firms charge lower
prices in equilibrium; (ii) Financial frictions may slow down industry
concentration; and (ii) Even when financial frictions lead to a more
concentrated industry in the long run, there is higher investment along the way.
The project, on the overall suggests that financial frictions may act as a pro-
competitive force.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
