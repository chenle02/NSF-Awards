This project involves the formation of strained rings containing both alkoxy and
arylphosphonium salt functional groups so that their utility in a tandem ring
expansion-Wittig reaction can be assessed. The alkoxycyclopropyl and cyclobutyl
phosphonium salts will be prepared from beta-oxophosphonium salt derivatives.
Formation of these substituted strained rings has not been reported, so an
efficient method leading to their synthesis is of clear value. In addition,
their preparation will lend new insights into the reactivity and applications of
the beta-oxophosphonium salts, which are themselves important Witting reaction
precursors. Finally, the study of the ring cleavage of these strained rings
followed by a subsequent Witting reaction will determine whether this method
will be suitable for development in more complex systems. %%% Research Planning
Grants enable women who have not had prior independent Federal research support
to develop a competitive research proposal. This project involves organic
chemical reactions leading to medium-sized rings which are common in a large
number of natural products.
