This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) program entitled,
"Instrumentation for the Nano-World," at Northern Arizona University (NAU),
under the direction of Dr. Lawrence M. Fritz, is jointly funded by the
Directorate for Engineering (ENG), Division of Engineering Education and Centers
(EEC), the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS), Division of
Materials Research (DMR), and the Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO). A
multi-disciplinary team of faculty at NAU will develop and teach a new, lower-
level undergraduate, laboratory-based course on modern instrumention for
nanoscience and nanotechnology. The course will be comprised of lectures and
hands-on demonstrations involving, electron microscopy, scanning force
microscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, mass spectometry, photelecron
spectroscopy and engineering micro-fabrication. Lecture topics will include the
history, theory, applications, resolution, limitations and future directions for
each technique whiles hands-on demonstrations will investigate the propoerites
of a nano-material common throughout the course; the physical properties of
carbon nanotubes. Students will learn the applicability, advantages and
limitations of each instrument in investigations on carbon nanotubes. NAU will
recruit from its large community of Native American, Hispanic students for this
course.
