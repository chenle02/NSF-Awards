This is a collaborative study on criminal careers (with Land, SES92-10437). The
study will test two competing models of criminal careers. One model suggests
that there are two classes of offenders (frequents and occasional) and that each
has a different probability that an offender desists criminal activity after a
certain number of convictions. The second models assumes that each individual in
a population has a propensity for engaging in criminal behavior, and that the
offending rate for an individual remains constant over the life course. The
study will employ mixture Poisson regression models and latent-threshold normal
regression models to analyze data from three longitudinal data sets on criminal
activity. This study will increase our understanding of patterns of crime over
individuals' lifetime and of the social and individual characteristics
associated with criminal careers.
