9315165 Eklund This award supports a two-year collaborative research project
between Professor Peter Eklund, Department of Physics and Astronomy and the
Center for Applied Energy Research, University of Kentucky, and Professor
Riichiro Saito, Department of Electronics Engineering, University of Electro-
Communications, Tokyo, Japan. The focus of the joint research is on the chemical
and physical properties of novel forms of carbon-based materials including high
surface area carbons, metal carbide particles, and fullerene-based solids and
tubules. In addition to Professor Eklund, four other U.S. investigators
(Professors Francis Derbyshire and Ping Zhou of the University of Kentucky and
Professors Gene Dresselhaus and Mildred Dresselhaus of MIT), one postdoctoral
fellow, and three graduate students from the University of Kentucky and MIT will
participate in the project. The materials will be synthesized both in the United
States and Japan. A wide variety of experimental probes will be used to study
these materials (electron spin resonance, magneto- transport, UV-Vis-IR optical
spectroscopy, Raman scattering, piezoresitivity, photoconductivity, electron
microscopy, x-ray diffraction, specific heat, and magnetic susceptibility). The
data will be analyzed to formulate structure-related microscopic models for the
chemical and physical properties of these carbon-based materials. ***
