The University Press of New England is planning to produce a new publications
series "Studies in Arctic Affairs," starting in 1991. A distinctive feature of
the series will be publication of translations of significant and broadly
appealing works from contemporary Soviet literature. This grant provides support
to assist in the inaugural activities of translating several major Soviet books.
This support is consistent with the NSF responsibilities to assist in the
dissemination of Arctic knowledge and its leadership role under the Arctic
Research and Planning Act of 1984.
