This project is devoted to the study of stochastic analysis in infinite
dimensions. The main topic is stochastic differential equations (SDEs) in
infinite-dimensional spaces, such as noncommutative L^p-spaces, related
infinite-dimensional groups, loop groups, and path spaces. The questions of
existence and uniqueness of solutions of the SDEs and smoothness of solutions
will be studied. Then the solutions will be used to construct and study heat
kernel measures (a noncommutative analogue of Gaussian or Wiener measure) on the
infinite-dimensional manifolds. In general these infinite-dimensional groups are
not locally compact and therefore do not have a Haar measure. The PI intends to
study Cameron-Martin type quasi-invariance of these measures. It is an
interesting questions in itself, but it also can give rise to unitary
representations of the infinite-dimensional groups. It is proposed to study
properties of square-integrable holomorphic functions. For example, quasi-
invariance can be used to prove weak Cauchy-Riemann equations for holomorphic
functions. Besides the classical infinite-dimensional stochastic analysis the PI
intends to study noncommutative SDEs.

The proposed research is motivated by several subjects. Infinite-dimensional
spaces such as loop groups and path spaces appear in physics, for example, in
quantum field theory and string theory. The PI proposes to formalize some of the
notions used in physics, such as measures on certain infinite-dimensional
spaces. The proposed problems in the field of noncommutative probability have
their origins in quantum physics.
