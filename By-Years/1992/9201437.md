The project focuses on the development and testing of structural control methods
using neural networks. Research activities include both theoretical and
experimental components. Experimental research will be done on a one-eighth
scale model of a nine story steel structure. All tests will be performed on the
shaking table at the U.S. Army Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL) at
Champaign, Illinois. CERL technical staff will participate in this project. The
choice of neural networks as the controller is an important feature of the
research as neural networks have capabilities suitable for control applications.
Preliminary experimental and theoretical studies have confirmed the
applicability and the power of neural networks in control problems. The study
emphasizes two structural control methods, active bracing systems and variable
stiffness methods including experimentation with new control arrangements.
Different structural control designs will be developed and studied in numerical
simulations, and then will be implemented and tested on the shaking table at
CERL. The response of the actively controlled structure will be compared with
the response of the structure without control, with and without diagonal
bracing.
