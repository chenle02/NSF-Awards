This taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional studies of fossil walruses
(Odobenidae sensu Demere) will focus on exceptionally well preserved and
systematically informative skeletal material from the Emlong Collection (USNM,
Smithsonian Institution). Specific objectives of this qtudy are: (1) to document
odobenid diversity form the early Miocene through the Pliocene (17-3 million
years ago), (2) to evaluate the systematic relationships of these Neogene
odobenids that are especially critical to walrus phylogeny, and (3) to use this
phylogenetic framework to investigate adaptation of feeding strategies and
locomotor patterns among odobenids and related pinnepeds (seals and sea lions).
