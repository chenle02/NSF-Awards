The American Mathematical Society will administer a program of travel grants
for U.S. mathematicians to attend the 1998 International Congress of
Mathematicians, Berlin, Germany, August 18-27, 1998. This will be similar to
travel support programs conducted in 1990 and 1994. Approximately $200,000 will
be awarded. This program is open to U.S. mathematicians (those who are currently
affiliated with a U.S. institution). Applications will be evaluated by a panel
of mathematical scientists, who will use their judgment in evaluating
professional qualifications. Travel awards are intended to provide partial
support and may be used for travel or subsistence costs. Junior mathematicians
will receive a slightly higher award amount. Mathematicians who accept the
support offered under this program may not supplement it with any other NSF
funds.
