A core of instrumentation will be established to facilitate and promote a
variety and ongoing series of projects in molecular biology and molecular
genetics. The following new equipment items requested are: a DNA sequencer, and
an expanded centralized computer system for DNA/protein sequence analysis. The
facility will also include a DNA synthesizer, a fluorimeter, an HPLC, and a high
voltage paper electrophoresis apparatus. The facility would be supervised and
maintained by a dedicated technician, who would also carry out the DNA syntheses
and the DNA sequencing gel runs. Major users of this facility are studying the
expression of the dihydrofolate reductase gene in cultured mammalian cells, the
role of the enhancer in immunoglobulin gene regulation, the mechanism of RNA
splicing and 3' end formation, biogenesis of mitochondria in yeast,
transcription termination and antitermination in E. coli, and the
characterization of genes controlling cell differentiation in C. elegans. The
facility would be available to all 24 laboratories of the Columbia Department of
Biological Sciences, and to a limited extent, to undergraduates.
