Two well-established theories, both developed some fifty years ago, explain why
organisms age. However, these models omit ecological and behavioral forces that
could influence the evolution of aging. Using mathematical models and computer
simulations, this project will develop new models of aging that include
ecological and behavior forces. The ultimate goal is to understand currently
unexplained aging phenomena, such as why females typically outlive males in most
mammals or why some species escape the aging process, and to help predict what
sorts of genes should be associated with aging.&lt;br/&gt;When complete, these
models should give us a much broader understanding of why and how aging occurs
in humans and other species, and aid the search for genes that influence aging.
In addition to the basic scientific advances that will result from this project,
this work will also increase the quality of math science education. This project
facilitates a collaboration between the principal investigator-a laboratory
researcher who works on aging--and three mathematically-oriented theoreticians.
As such, it will greatly enhance opportunities for mathematical training not
only for the PI, but also for graduate students and undergraduates at the PI's
home institution.&lt;br/&gt;
