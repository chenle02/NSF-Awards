Development of a process for controlling errors of idealization will be
investigated under this project: The exact solution of a mathematical model is
in fact an approximate solution of a more general mathematical model. For
example, the problem of linear elasticity can be viewed as the first step in
Newton's method in solving nonlinear problems. The key to assessment and control
of errors associated with mathematical models is to view those models as members
in a hierarchic sequence of models. The sequence of (exact) solutions
corresponding to those models converges to the most general mathematical
representation of the system modelled. The model is properly chosen if the
engineering conclusions derived from it are not sensitive with respect to the
various assumptions incorporated in the idealization, such as assumptions of
linear elasticity, kinematic boundary conditions, etc. Focus will be on the
treatment of an important class of engineering problems, the modelling of
structural connections. Incorporation of experimental information into
mathematical models of structural connections will be investigated.
