SSC-9353171 CUNY John Jay College New York, NY Christ, Lily and Green, Edward
"John Jay Summer Computer Camp" The John Jay College Summer Computer Camp
(JJSCC) is an academically intensive five week summer program followed by an
academic year component with mathematics as the curricular focus. This program
is modeled after the highly successful NSF funded TexPrep curriculum, with some
modifications to suit the local conditions. The target population for JJSCC is
students entering grades 7-9 from selected schools in New York City. The Program
consists of: (1) a structured schedule from Mondays through Thursdays during the
summer including courses in computer science, logic, probability and statistics,
and problem solving; and (2) informal field trips, hands-on project workshops,
and SEM career counseling on Fridays during the summer and six Saturdays during
the academic year. Guest speakers serve as role models and provide the
participants with personalized exposure to the multitude of career opportunities
in the fields of science, engineering, and mathematics (SEM). The curriculum
emphasizes the students' development of abstract reasoning and problem solving
skills. All courses will be taught by using "team-teaching" and "cooperative
learning" techniques. Students will be encouraged to work together and to
utilize peer- tutoring by establishing "Academic Fraternities", a model
introduced by Treisman. Computers and calculators will be an integral part of
the program. The John Jay Summer Computer Camp will enroll 35 students in JJSCC
I (level 1) the first year (June 28, - August 2, 1993); and 55 students in each
of the second and third years, 30 for JJSCC I (level 1) and 25 for JJSCC II
(level 2).
