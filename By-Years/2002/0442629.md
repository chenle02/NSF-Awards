Interdisciplinary (99). This project is creating a set of instructional
spreadsheet modules that connect mathematics to nonmathematical contexts to
support the diffusion of Quantitative Literacy throughout the curriculum. Each
module addresses a topic in a particular discipline by posing a problem that
students must figure out how to solve by applying mathematics. In the process
they are also challenged to design and define the spreadsheet calculations that
are needed. The intellectual merit of this full development effort includes its
grounding in an earlier "proof-of-concept" project, DUE 0126500, "Spreadsheet
Exercises in Geological-Mathematical Problem Solving." This initial work sparked
interest at the Washington Center for Improving the Quality of Undergraduate
Education. Now a major partner in this full project, the center is facilitating
the engagement of a large community of faculty in creating, editing, curating,
and disseminating these modules. Evaluation includes pre- and post-use testing
of student learning and attitudes at various institutions together with site
visits, focus groups, and in-depth studies of selected students as part of a
robust study to determine how problem-solving using such spreadsheet-based
modules affects student learning. In promoting Quantitative Literacy, this
project is having a broad impact by developing habits of mind in future citizens
to engage quantitative material in relevant contexts. Working through a
statewide network offers a model that is transportable to other states and
regions.
