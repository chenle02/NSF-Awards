The investigators are conducting fundamental research focused on the synthesis
of a series of novel "vine-like" robots. Vines are found throughout the natural
(and human-made) world. They have unique capabilities allowing them to adapt to
congested spaces and/or irregular terrain, significant voids, and unpredictable
dynamic environmental interactions. Robots emulating the capabilities of vines
can extend the reach (literally and figuratively) of robotics into previously
inaccessible domains and applications. This offers new and useful solutions
across a wide range of endeavors important to society, including persistent
environmental monitoring, field archaeology, medical procedures, and urban
disaster relief.

Exploiting their combined expertise in continuum robots and biological vines,
the PIs are collaboratively designing, modeling, creating, and demonstrating a
series of innovative vine-like continuum robots. Coordinated basic research in
the laboratory at Clemson and the greenhouse at Cornell is providing inspiration
from biology for the vine-like robots, and returning insight from engineering to
biology regarding open questions on mechanisms governing biological vines. The
key innovations in robot hardware, representing a significant new direction in
continuum robotics, are enabling unprecedented workspace reach via augmentation
with passive and active appendages (artificial thorns/tendrils), and creating
the ability to "branch" into new continuum "growth". The novel navigation and
manipulation capabilities enabled by these hardware innovations are providing
both new theoretical insight and innovative operational modes for robots. The
overall results are pushing the range of access of robots to a new level,
currently beyond the reach of the field.
