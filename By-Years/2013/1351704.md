The recent discovery of a new type of electrophoresis, contact-charge
electrophoresis (CCEP), is interesting, but is not broadly useful per se in that
the phenomenon results in a charged particle or droplet oscillating between two
electrodes. The PI has drawn out a roadmap of how to break out of the
oscillation and linearize the motion by using "ratchets" to move the particles
through long distances and to use the ratchets to separate particles in
microfluidic devices. He has also laid out plans to understand the basic
mechanism of CCEP using new simulation tools and to validate his models in his
laboratory.

This new ability to manipulate small particles will have an additional impact on
many technologies such as those that require particle separations or
technologies used in electronic displays, cell sorting, and DNA sequencing.
