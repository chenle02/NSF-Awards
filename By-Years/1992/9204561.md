The objective of this proposal is to gain an understanding of the molecular
mechanisms of lymphoid V(D)J recombination and DNA double-strand break (DSB)
repair. These two pathways share at least one common factor, the SCID (severe
combined immune deficiency) gene product and probably share many others. In
particular, we intend to determine whether this overlap can be extended to the
murine wasted mutation, which confers onto affected animals a severe immune
deficiency and a sensitivity to ionizing radiation. The high cancer rate
associated with DNA repair defects suggests that generalized DSB repair is also
critical for many other important biological processes including chromosome
integrity and stability, mutagenesis and carcinogenesis as well as lymphoid
V(D)J recombination. These two important biological pathways will be
characterized using 3 lines of experimentation: 1)Does the wasted (wst) mutation
affect the process of V(D)J recombination? 2)What are the DNA repair defects
associated with the wst and scid mutations? 3)Do the scid and wst mutations
affect homologous and/or illegitimate (non-homologous) recombination? %%%% The
ultimate goal of these studies will be to use the scid and wst mutations as
tools to understand the molecular mechanisms of lymphoid gene rearrangement and
DNA repair.
