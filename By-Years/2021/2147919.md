Racial and ethnic segregation in U.S. cities has been linked to a wide range of
contemporary social problems, including inequalities in employment, education,
and health. This study investigates the origins of the very high levels of
residential segregation in metropolitan areas that were reached by the mid- to
late-20th Century. The project examines which neighborhoods were targeted for
restrictive covenants, deeds that restrict a property owner from renting or
selling to identified racial and ethnic groups. The study considers the impact
of both restrictive covenants and mortgage redlining – the designation of racial
and ethnic minority neighborhoods as high-risk for lending – on neighborhood and
socioeconomic change. In addition to the experience of African Americans, this
study investigates the segregation of Hispanic Americans, who were a major
presence in many urban areas as early as the 1930s. The research generates new
data infrastructure that will be useful to other social scientists, including
high resolution GIS maps and census data across 45 major cities for every decade
from 1920 through 1970.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To better understand the origins
and impacts of residential segregation, this project intensively studies 45
major metropolitan areas in the period 1920-1970. Data sources include newly
available redlining maps prepared by the Home Owners Loan Corporation in the
late 1930s, mapped data on the location of restrictive covenants in several
cities, and Census data at the enumeration district scale. Data visualization is
paired with models of neighborhood change that estimate the effects of redlining
and restrictive covenants over time. Better understanding the processes that
created residential segregation is useful to decision-makers who are taking
steps to undermine residential segregation and its social and economic
harms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
