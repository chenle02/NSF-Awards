The goal of this research is to develop optimal earthquake-resistant design
procedures that incorporate the current state of knowledge regarding the
earthquake phenomenon. Three seismically active regions are selected for the
study. These include the Mixico subduction zone, the Alaskan subduction zone,
and California interplate boundary regions (e.g., the San Andreas fault zone).
The following studies are performed: (1) the data for each region is reviewed
and analyzed; in particular, for the temporal and spatial pattern and fault
mevhanisms of large earthquakes; (2) a stochastic non-Poissonian model is
developed to reflect the temporal and spatial dependence of earthquake events;
(3) the occurrence model is combined with appropriate ground motion model to
obtain sity specific hazard estimates; (4) the feasibility of the occurrence and
site hazard estimation models is demonstrated through application to specific
sites within the three study regions; and, (5) optimal design procedures are
developed that consider the non-Poissonian nature of the earthquake occurrences,
the uncertainties in the site ground motion estimation models, and the benefits,
costs, and losses for a particular design.
