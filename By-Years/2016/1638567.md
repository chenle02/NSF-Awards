Understanding what helps and hinders rapid adaptation is crucial to predict
organism responses to changing environments. Iceland's dynamic landscape
provides a natural laboratory of fast-paced changes shaped by glaciers,
volcanoes, and severe oceanic storms. The focus of this project is marine
stickleback fish that have colonized multiple freshwater lakes, and thus have
evolved in waters differing dramatically in clarity. The research examines
sensory system evolution to ask if eyes get better at seeing in murky water, or
if fish instead evolve better senses of smell and touch. The project identifies
how genes and environment contribute to sensory system adaptation in different
environments. The project gives young scientists cutting-edge training in
multiple disciplines, generating a scientific workforce to help deal with large-
scale environmental issues our society faces. Outreach efforts in museums and
schools educate young and old alike on evolutionary changes driven by
environmental change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research studies adaptation of
sight, smell, and touch in extreme sensory environments. It assesses how
differences in sensory systems affect survival from predators in murky glacial
and clear lakes. The research reveals how genetic variation and gene expression
differ, and reconstructs the history of colonization and the extent of parallel
evolution of these traits in multiple lakes. It also uses transplant experiments
to evaluate the extent of plasticity in sensory systems. This research combines
the phenotypic and functional with the genetic dimensions of biodiversity, all
within a historical context. Each dimension informs the other to help understand
sensory adaptation.
