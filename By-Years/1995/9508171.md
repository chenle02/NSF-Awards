9508171 Banfield This research will explore fundamental relationships among
crystal size, structural energy and surface characteristics of finely
crystalline (nanocrystalline) minerals. Such nanocrystalline materials are
common products of weathering and diagenetic reactions, and they account for a
very large proportion of reactive sites in nature because of their inherently
high surface areas. The objectives of this project are to explore the nature of
crystallization and growth of nanocrystalline materials at low temperatures, to
quantitatively investigate connections between measured surface energy and
thermodynamic stability, and to model relationships among surface energy,
surface structure and reaction rates.
