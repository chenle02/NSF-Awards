9316033 Butler Most models of the tectonic evolution of the Appalachians involve
stages of subduction accompanied by collision. Until the recent discovery of
eclogite, evidence of the high-pressure metamorphism typical of subduction or
collision zones was lacking in the southern Appalachians. This project is an in-
depth study of the ecologite in the North Carolina Blue Ridge, and will provide
structural-petrologic-chronlogic data for developing models for the evolution of
the Blue Ridge, in particular the emplacement and tectonic relationships of
oceanic crust on the Laurentian craton.
