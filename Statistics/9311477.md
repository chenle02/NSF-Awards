The proposal is focused on estimation problems involving infinite dimensional
parameters, such as cumulative distribution functions, characteristic functions,
error distributions in regression models etc. Methodologically, a geometric
approach has been successfully developed to solve nonparametric estimations
problems from i.i.d. (independent and identically distributed) data. This
approach is also applicable to a wide range of nonparametric and semiparametric
problems, in which the traditional restrictive i.i.d. assumptions can be
relaxed. The main emphasis is on the estimation of differentiable statistical
functionals. For a general differentiable transformation of the unknown abstract
parameter, the asymptotically efficient estimates will be constructed using the
geometric approach. Complex statistical data that are collected in areas such as
medical, econometric, and engineering reliability studies often cannot be
analyzed using traditional statistical methods. The diversity of people in
clinical trials, the multitude of inputs affecting economic outputs, and the
intricate interaction of components affecting the performance of sophisticated
electronics or equipment do not permit the use of simple statistical modeling
techniques. These applications require instead a new methodology that is more
flexible and yet does not sacrifice information unnecessarily. The proposed
research will develop methods for estimating key features of complex statistical
data. These methods do not depend on the validity of traditional assumptions.
Results of this work will be applicable to a rich variety of areas, including
the estimation of drug efficacy, a population profile of potential patients,
proficiency characteristics for industrial output, and the probability of
successful operation of electronic equipment.
