9502726 Petterson This is a Research at an Undergraduate Institution project
that will investigate the dynamics of rough or surface- melted surfaces. The
project is intended to provide educational opportunities to students, as well as
address questions of scientific importance. The initial experiments will be
focused on the behavior of methane adsorbed on a magnesium oxide surface. The
methane will be probed via its nuclear magnetism. The nuclear magnetic resonance
response of carbon atoms in the methane molecule can report on the surface
motion of the methane, and also provide information on the surface structure of
the methane. The experiments will contribute to the basic understanding of the
nature of roughening of a surface, and the process of surface melting.
Undergraduates will be involved in this project. They will acquire valuable
laboratory skills, and be exposed to topics of current scientific and
technological importance. %%% This is a Research at an Undergraduate Institution
