This research will continue to use genomic resources known as cosmid libraries
to study in detail the evolution of genes in the major histocompatibility
complex (Mhc) of birds. The Mhc is a genetic locus associated with disease
resistance and susceptibility in natural populations. The evolutionary processes
at this locus can be compared to processes in other vertebrate groups, in
particular mammals, which are comprehensively studied as part of whole genome
projects. The genetic variability of loci within and outside of Mhc will also be
studied in order to understand whether elevated levels of variability within Mhc
is due to heterozygote advantage, as opposed levels in the non-coding, neutral
regions. Finally, the extent of genetic linkage between coding and non-coding
regions will be analyzed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The resources provided by cosmid
libraries will permit a variety of population genetic studies in genetically
less tractable songbird species. These studies will be important for
understanding how a highly polymorphic, disease-associated locus varies in
natural populations and the extent to which such loci influence the evolutionary
trajectories of neutral loci that are physically close on the chromosome
(hitchhiking). &lt;br/&gt;
