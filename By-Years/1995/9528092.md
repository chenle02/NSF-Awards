9528092 Pelcovits This is a renewal proposal of a grant that was originally
funded under the program Computational Approaches to Real Materials (CARM). The
work involves a study of the equilibrium and nonequilibrium properties of the
nematic liquid crystals using large scale computation. Previously developed
(under CARM) sequential and parallel molecular dynamics (using Gay-Berne
potentials) codes will be run on workstations and massively parallel machines
respectively. The specific objectives include the dynamics of nematics after
rapid quenches, with special emphasis on the behavior of topological defects and
the response of nematics to electric fields. %%% Liquid crystals are used in
flat panel displays and electronic and photonic devices. The present grant is to
study, using large scale computation, the relationship between the microscopic
molecular properties and the material response of the nematic liquid crystals.
The work follows the earlier development of the molecular dynamics codes
supported by a CARM grant. The present work will help elucidate the relationship
between the microscopic properties of nematics and their macroscopic response to
rapid cooling and to applied electric fields. ***
