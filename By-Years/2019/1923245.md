The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine will execute a
series of regional workshops, prepared by the Policy and Global Affairs
Division's U.S. Science and Innovation Policy unit, aimed at engaging the
national community in identifying effective, evidence-based strategies for
increasing the participation, retention, and advancement of women of color in
tech fields. These fields include computer science, computer and information
science and support services, information technology, and engineering.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The barriers and challenges encountered by women of color
in science, technology, engineering and mathematics have been well documented in
the literature, but effective strategies for removing such barriers are
warranted. This initiative will convene regional workshops to identify evidence-
based strategies to address these challenges and then disseminate this
information, via a report and web portal, to a wide set of stakeholders
(including academic institutions, employers, policymakers, and federal
agencies). The goals of these workshops are to: &lt;br/&gt;1) Identify
constructive and sustainable solutions for colleges and universities,
businesses, and government agencies by collecting and synthesizing evidence on
effective programs, practices, and models that take an intersectional approach
to recruiting, retaining, and significantly increasing the participation of
women of color in tech degree programs and careers.&lt;br/&gt;2) Build a
community of practice devoted to addressing this important national issue, and
create research-practitioner partnerships to drive the implementation and
evaluation of evidence-based strategies and programs for improving the
participation of women of color in tech.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
