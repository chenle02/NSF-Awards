This dissertation research analyzes results from a 1999-2000 survey of current
and laid-off (xiagang) workers from six Chinese cities. Outcomes being studied
include layoffs, earnings, and job search strategies. Among individuals,
variations in human capital (education, experience) and political capital (party
membership, cadre status) determine these outcomes, but the relative importance
of these determinants depends on firm-level factors (e.g., productivity) and
city-level factors (e.g., degree of market development). Additional firm and
city data will be collected to supplement the existing survey data. Qualitative
data will also be added to explore individual workers' rationale for leaving
state enterprises and their understanding of the new labor market
structure.&lt;br/&gt;
