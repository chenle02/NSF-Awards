This action funds Raymond Eliot Crafton of the University of California, Davis
to conduct a research project, entitled "Assessing invasion risk for unwanted
non-native marine species in New Zealand," during the summer of 2012 at the
University of Auckland in Auckland, New Zealand. The host scientist is Mark
Costello.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is the development of a novel,
comprehensive model that includes where a species can exist (biogeography) and
where and how it is likely to arrive (transport vectors) to study non-native
species' potential for introduction and establishment. This study aims to
improve understanding of species ranges and distributions, core interests in
ecological research.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.

While scientific in nature, this project intends to communicate at the science-
policy-public interfaces. By understanding where and how a species is likely to
be introduced, policymakers, managers, and the public can be more aware of and
able to reduce the threat imposed by the introduction of non-native species. In
this way, the output from the model developed in this project, a simple,
comprehensive risk map, is an easily interpretable, educational tool that can be
used to communicate across audiences and institutions.
