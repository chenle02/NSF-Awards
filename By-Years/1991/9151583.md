This proposal requests the computing equipment and software necessary to convert
a classroom at Towson State University into a Social Sciences Laboratory. The
lab will consist of twenty 80386/SX work-stations, two printers, projection
equipment, a local area network, and system and application software.The
laboratory will permit hands-on learning by students in statistical and
simulation techniques used in social science research. Currently there is no
such facility on campus. In political science, the laboratory will support
research methods courses in statistics, system dynamics, and game theory as well
as applied courses in international relations (using the ICONS simulation) and
public policy. In sociology and anthropology, the laboratory will support
research methods courses required by sociology majors and provide vital tools
for students in demography and anthropology.The proposed software provides both
the user- friendly interface necessary for new computer users and the computing
power needed for more advanced courses. The lab will be supported by faculty
with experience in teaching computer applications and research methods and by
the commitment of the University to encourage and expand student exposure to
research in the social sciences.
