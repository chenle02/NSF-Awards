This award provides partial funding for the Brookings Conference on
Macroeconomics and the accompanying Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, a
conference volume.

The conference is designed to bring together scholars in economics (primary
macroeconomics) to focus on the scientific analysis of economic policy issues.
The topics include fiscal and monetary policy, asset pricing, labor markets,
consumptions and saving behavior, business investment, housing, wage and price
setting, business cycles, long-run economic grown, the distribution of income
and wealth, intermational capital flows and exchange rates, international trade
and development, the macroeconomic implications of health costs, energy supply
and demand, environmental issues, and the education system.

The papers presented develop empirical evidence, include real world
institutions, and focus on relevance to policy. A wide range of methodological
approaches are included. Papers are available online to the general public, and
the series has been praised as a key forum for discussion of economic research
and policy.
