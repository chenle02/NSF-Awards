This project will bring 15 high ability and high potential 8th and 9th grade
students to Montana State University for science-related career exploration
activities. The project begins with a 9-day residential summer workshop of lab
and field experiences. It will be followed by a structured computer--network set
of activities designed to connect students in their local setting with each
other as well as university personnel. Two meetings during the following year
will expose these students to established science program for high achieving
students in the state. Emphasis will be placed on recruiting Native Americans
and women.
