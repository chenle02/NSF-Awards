This project is a partnership is a partnership between the ERC for Particle
Science and Technology at the University of Florida and the National Institute
of Standards and Technology (NIST). The objective is to provide fundamental
information concerning the effectiveness of polymeric and surfactant dispersant
layers during chemical and mechanical interactions with surfaces. Direct
measurement of surfaces force and characterization of dispersant layers under
high applied loads, shear rates, and solution conditions will be used to develop
dispersant selection criteria for optimal performance in extreme conditions. The
ERC's graduate students and researchers will be working in NIST laboratories and
NIST personnel will visit the ERC to present seminars and teach students in new
characterization techniques.
