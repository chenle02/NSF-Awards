The PI proposes to determine the spatial and temporal variation of the chemical
content of snow and ice in central Asia in order to improve our understanding of
the distribution of chemical species in the atmosphere in this region, and their
variation over space and time. He plans to collect snow and ice samples within
the accumulation areas of eight to ten different central Asian glaciers from
snowpits six meters deep and ice cores drilled up to twenty meters. The samples
will be analyzed for chloride, sulfate, nitrate, phosphate, bromide, fluoride,
sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, ammonium, iron, oxygen and hydrogen
isotopes, 7Be, 210Pb, 137Cs, selected trace metals acetate, formate, methyl
sulfonic acid, hydrogen peroxide, dissolved organic carbon, and microparticles.1
