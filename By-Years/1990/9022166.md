Single ions contained in a small electromagnetic trap move in orbits at normal
mode frequencies directly related to the charge-to-mass ratio. Trapping and
loading techniques are being developed and refined to permit mass measurement
(relative to an appropriate calibration ion) with a precision that is ultimately
expected to exceed one part in 1010. Improved determinations will be made of:
the proton-to-electron mass ratio, the proton's atomic mass, the atomic mass of
2H, and the 3H - 3He mass difference. These measurements may yield an
independent determination of the fine structure constant, a measurement of the
neutron mass, and may help establish the antineutrino rest mass.
