Station data and gridded analyses and forecasts from numerical models have been
used extensively for research and instruction in the Department of Meteorology
at the University of Utah. The elimination of UNIDATA support for the VMS
operating system, in conjunction with other factors, has led to the need to
reconfigure existing equipment and to acquire new equipment. A graphics
workstation will be purchased for instruction, image analysis, research model
development, and data ingest. The workstation will be equipped with a large
capacity disk drive, backup tape and CD-ROM reader. The new workstation will
allow students to have improved access to real-time and archived weather data in
undergraduate and graduate level classes. The workstation will also provide a
means to develop research models that are impractical using the existing
workstations in the Department.
