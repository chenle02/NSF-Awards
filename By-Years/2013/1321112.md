Programming has undergone a paradigm shift: with the abundance of resources
available on the web, including open source code repositories, question and
answer forums, tutorials, and online books, programmers now routinely search for
code. Indeed, it can easily be argued that the modern programmer has to be as
versed in finding and interpreting relevant code on the web as they are in
actually writing code.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clearly, how effective and efficient
developers are in their searches depends on the tool they use. Whether a search
concerns a quest for an entire component that performs certain functionality, a
hunt for an example of how to use an API, or a quick look for how to implement
some algorithm, the success of the search stands or falls with the quality and
relevance of the results returned by the chosen search
engine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks to explore the concept of
social-technical code search, in which the information that is used by the
search engine to produce its results is enriched with both social and technical
metadata that, together, construct a rich context about the code, its current
state, and how it came about. We hypothesize that this context significantly
increases the quality and relevance of code search results, and, particularly,
too, enables the developer to effectively explore code search results rather
than just examining each result one-by-one in
isolation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specific outcomes from this research will
include: (1) a novel conceptual approach to code search, (2) new ranking
algorithms that take into account both code and its social-technical context
when ordering search results, (3) a novel code search engine and associated
search interface, (4) new insights into how developers search for code, and (5)
an publicly available archive of search queries and behaviors that can be mined
and analyzed by other researchers for their purposes.
