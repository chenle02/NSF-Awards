This project aims at designing algorithms to infer 3-D models of the geometry
(shape) and photometry (material) of objects from collections of images. Such
algorithms are based on a representing visual scenes as dense surfaces, defined
implicitly as functions of the measured images, and entail the numerical
solution of partial differential equations. Our research aims at integrating in
a unified analytical framework many ``shape from X'' algorithms for
reconstructing spatial properties of a scene from images, including stereo,
shape from shading, and shape from motion. Applications of the technology we
plan to develop ranges from geology to medicine, manufacturing, security, to
entertainment.
