This is a study of the structure of social and economic isolation in low-income
populations. The project investigates three problems; the first two relate to
social capital theory, whereas the third is methodological. First, the
investigators will examine the micro-level behaviors and social structures
relevant to spatial mismatch theory, which concerns the lack of low-skill
employment opportunities in the immediate vicinity. Second, the investigators
will test the hypothesis that inner-city residents paradoxically rely primarily
on strong ties (e.g., close friends, relatives) for day-to-day assistance, but
lack the weak ties (friends of friends, acquaintances) which would aid them in
such instrumental action as job-finding. Third, the work will explore the
efficacy of standard survey data collection methods in an inner-city
neighborhood. This will be done through interviews with 600 residents of a poor
neighborhood in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. %%% This project will improve our
understanding of the social roots of the increasing problems of low-income
neighborhoods, including high rates of poverty, unemployment, teenage pregnancy
drug use, serious crime, and other indicators of social disorganization. It will
examine the linkage of economic isolation (poverty and welfare dependence, loss
of economic capital, lack of access to jobs) with social isolation (the
isolation of low-income persons from mainstream individuals and institutions,
and their inability to gain access to the information, influence, and other job-
finding assistance that would allow them to escape poverty). The study will be a
major step forward in testing theories about the roots of poverty.
