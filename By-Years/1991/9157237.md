A PYI award will support research on surface degradation of brittle materials as
well as progression of the damage to the point of catastrophic instability.
Experimental studies and non-destructive testing will be correlated with
computational and theoretical research. The results will later be extended to
surface damage and edge delamination problems in advanced composite materials.
