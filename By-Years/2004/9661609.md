*** 96-61609 Shleser This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I
project focuses on genetic improvement of the black tiger shrimp, Penaeus
monodon. This species represents 75% of the world production of farmed shrimp,
valued at more than 3 billion dollars per year. Selective breeding of this
shrimp for performance in a farming environment is expected to improve
profitability. Phase I will produce genetically identifiable Specific Pathogen
Free P. monodon stocks, that can be selectively bred for improved farming
performance. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) amplification of introns in
conserved nuclear genes using universal PCR primers will be applied to
differentiate individuals of closely related populations of marine shrimp. This
method will be used to evaluate captive populations of P.monodon to identify
family lines for the breeding program. The commercial application is in a
genetically improved broodstock and post larvae for export of shrimp throughout
the world. ***
