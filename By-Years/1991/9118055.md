This award provides for one half the funds needed to upgrade an inductively
coupled plasma atomic emission spectrophotometer (ICP-AES). The additional
funding to make this acquisition possible has been committed by Lehigh
University. This upgraded instrument forms an important component of expanding
research and educational programs in the recently reorganized and enlarged
Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences Lehigh. A large number of users
conducting research in diverse areas of geologic,geochemical, and environmental
study is planned.
