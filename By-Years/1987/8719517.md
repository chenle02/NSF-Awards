Dr. Walrond describes an in depth study of the structure of the sites where
neurotransmitter is released (active zones). He intends to determine the
relationship between the organization of active zone components (active zone
particles, synatic vesicles, and presynaptic densities) and the amount of
transmitter released from synapses with diverse functions. Lobster (Homarus
americanus) neuromuscular junctions provide a unique model system for these
studies, since they contain synapses that release known amounts of
neurotransmitter. The synapses will be identified in thin section and freeze-
fracture views in the electron microscope. Dr. Walrond will examine three
mechanisms that may regulate the amount of transmitter released: the number and
density of large intramembrane particles aggregated at the transmitter release
sites (active zone particles); the number of synaptic vesicles appropriately
positioned to release transmitter (active zone vesicles); and the distance
between the active zone vesicles, the active zone particles and the presynaptic
density. These factors will be examined in three different preparations: in
normal adult animals to correlate structure and function at mature, well-defined
synapses; in developing synapses to correlate changes in active zone structure
with changes in the amount of transmitter released during muscle growth; and in
experimentally manipulated preparations to correlate long-term changes in the
amount of transmitter released with changes in active zone structure
accompanying altered patterns of neuronal activity. These studies will provide
insights into the relationship between structure and function in one of the
remaining puzzles of synaptic transmission: how functionally diverse synapses
differentially control the amount of transmitter they release in response to a
stereotyped signal, the action potential, and modulate the dynamic output of
statically connected neural circuits.
