This Symposium on Comparative &amp; Integrative Vision Research is part of the
annual meeting of the Society for Integrative &amp; Comparative Biology (SICB).
It addresses recent advances in vision, with a plan that integrates
multidisciplinary work including development, molecular biology, optics and
sensory ecology, and evolution. The meeting emphasizes interdisciplinary
interactions among newer and more established investigators. Introduction of new
people to the society is enhanced by the international aspect of the meeting in
Toronto, Canada. Funding assists with travel awards for participants to attend
the meeting. &lt;br/&gt; The impact extends beyond sensory neuroscience to the
fields of sensory ecology and evolutionary biology, by discussions at the
meeting and publication in the journal Integrative &amp; Comparative Biology.
There is a further impact on scientific education and training by the emphasis
on graduate and undergraduate participation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
