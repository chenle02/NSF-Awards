Eight private colleges in Nebraska are establishing connections to NSFNET via
56,000 bits per second lines through the MIDNET mid-level network. The
connections enhance collaborations of campus researchers with colleagues in
several fields such as biology, psychology, computer science and music, and
enables on-line access to remote bibliography databases and supercomputers. This
award funds part of the costs for two years.
