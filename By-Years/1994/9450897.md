9450897 Kagan The University of New Haven Physics Department will equip an
innovative instructional facility for science education. This facility will be
used as an undergraduate teaching facility for physics. However, the facility
will be multi-functional, and will be used for a number of University
educational initiatives in other science and mathematics courses as well.
Traditional undergraduate students, secondary minority students in community
outreach science and mathematics enrichment programs, as well as science and
mathematics teachers in training, will be able to use this facility. Although
individual modules are computer-based, the physics curriculum that will be
implemented will integrate a hands-on approach to scientific experimentation,
and a computer-interface (based on IBM's Personal Science Laboratory (PSL)
system) for data collection and analysis. The CUPLE (Comprehensive Unified
Physics Learning Environment) system, a new approach to physics education, will
also be integrated into this new program.
