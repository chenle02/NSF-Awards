Abstract: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Large scale sensor networks can often be viewed
as distributed databases in which information querying is a fundamental
operation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to research a framework for
efficient information discovery in sensor networks, based on a new paradigm
called "active query forwarding". The basic principle of this approach is to
consider queries as active entities which move efficiently through the network
in search of desired information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A multi-part methodology
is employed in the project. Algorithms are designed for query guidance,
semantics, adaptation, and optimization; these are then evaluated through both
mathematical analysis and computational simulations. Important elements of the
active querying framework are further validated on real experimental
platforms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expected results consist of: (1) a scalable
querying framework, (2) its constituent mechanisms, and (3) the related
evaluation and validation studies. Together, these provide a fundamental
building block for information management in next-generation sensor networks.
Utilizing such building blocks efficiently can potentially improve sensor
network lifetimes by orders-of-magnitude over existing approaches, without
sacrificing information quality. The techniques developed in this project are
useful for a wide range of large-scale sensor network applications, from
industrial process control to structural health
monitoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of the project are to be
disseminated widely and in a timely manner through high quality publications,
talks, and interactions with several industrial teams. The project is also
closely integrated with the undergraduate and graduate networks curriculum at
the University of Southern California, including new courses on sensor and ad-
hoc networks and the training of several M.S./Ph.D.
