A computer classroom/laboratory equipped with Macintosh IIsi computers running
Mathematica is being used by students to learn calculus in a more stimulating
setting. The emphasis is on student-centered learning as opposed to teacher-
centered instruction. This emphasis is carried out through educed lecture time,
in-class discussion, "brainstorming" and problem sessions, the use of a graphing
calculator, and the assignment of outside problem sets.
