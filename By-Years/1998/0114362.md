A goal of natural resource management is to balance multiple uses of forest
lands. One aspect has been production oriented, and is concerned with where and
when timber extraction takes place. This is commonly a component of the harvest
scheduling process. Another aspect of natural resource management involves the
protection of species and habitat through a process known as nature reserve
design. Both timber harvesting and resource conservation are integral components
of public and private forest usage and planning, but do not necessarily occur in
a coordinated fashion. One area of study will be a comparative evaluation of
harvest scheduling optimization models for limiting spatial activity. The
dominant feature of current approaches is the need to limit or restrict the
local extent of harvest activity. One approach assumes that spatial units are of
sufficient size to require explicit stipulations regarding what may take place
in neighboring units. The alternative approach recognizes that spatial units may
in fact be relatively small in relation to maximum disturbance restrictions. The
differences between these two approaches are associated with how spatial impacts
are limited mathematically. This project will investigate differences between
these two approaches, particularly with respect to spatial scale and unit
definition. The research will utilize data for two study areas: Buttercreek
watershed in California and Forestal Millalemu in Chile. Exact and heuristic
solution development for harvest scheduling will be examined. An important
theoretical aim is to evaluate whether spatial inconsistencies exist between the
two approaches. Finally, the project will integrate spatial optimization
techniques with geographic information systems (GIS) to find solutions that
address both harvesting production and nature preserve design.

The development of exact and heuristic solution techniques based on different
spatial unit constraints will contribute to the optimization literature as well
as the issues of scale and unit definition in geographic information science
research. Establishing reserves is an important component of natural resource
management. The integrated modeling approaches developed in this research, which
combine issues of production (harvest scheduling) and conservation (nature
reserve design) using multi-objective optimization methods, enable conflicts to
be resolved in a coordinated fashion. Such integration utilizing GIS techniques
and functionality is expected to contribute significantly to planning and policy
evaluation directed at sustainable forest management practices.
