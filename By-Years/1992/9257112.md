The focus of this research is the development of high performance analog
architectures and circuits for mixed analog-digital IC's. Emphasis will be
placed on improving the immunity of the analog circuits to digital switching
noise and in obtaining high speed and accuracy analog circuit performance with
the newly emerging 3.3 Volt power supply standard. Current-mode circuits will be
examined as a way of overcoming these limitations and this research will yield a
general understanding of the advantages and limitations of current-mode circuits
as compared to voltage-mode circuits. The current-mode circuits will be used to
implement area efficient, high-order sigma-delta A/D converters.
