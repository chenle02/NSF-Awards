This project is jointly initiating an S-STEM program to increase enrollment and
graduation rates in undergraduate biology and chemistry programs at both the
University and the community colleges in the Eastern Iowa Community College
District. Using a cohort model, S-STEM students are engaged in similar learning
activities to improve retention and student success. The project is increasing
enrollments in biology and chemistry through (1) multiple matriculation pathways
into biology and chemistry programs; (2) marketing biology and chemistry careers
and programs to potential students; and (3) providing financial and academic
support. Specific recruitment strategies are targeting underrepresented
populations (minorities and women). Retention strategies are helping 80-90% of
S-STEM students complete their degree. In four years, this project aims to
graduate 27 biologists and chemists qualified for local industry or advanced
education with 10 more to graduate after the grant concludes.
