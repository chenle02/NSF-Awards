Many species on Earth are unknown to scientists, and in some groups, such as
beetles, many known species are poorly documented. This project will build tools
and methods to increase the rate of species discovery and documentation, and it
will apply these tools to a group of ground beetles (Bembidiina) having over 300
species in the United States. The researchers will discover and delimit species
by analyzing DNA sequences using new methods they will develop based on
population genetic theory. Photographs of the beetles and their defining
physical characteristics will be captured and presented with the DNA results
live as they are gathered in an open, online database to which other biologists
can freely contribute. The researchers will develop tools to create tablet-apps
and print-on-demand, custom-build field guides and scientific monographs.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to increasing knowledge about these common
beetles, this project will produce many tools that will broadly benefit
biodiversity scientists, regardless of their organisms of study. The new DNA
analysis methods will allow experts to increase their rate of species discovery,
and the improved integration of data collection with dissemination will ensure
that effective documentation keeps pace with the rate of discovery.
