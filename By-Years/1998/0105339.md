0105339&lt;br/&gt;Gehrels&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Himalaya has received
intensive study as if is an active continent - continent collision, and many
parameters such as amount of shortening, rates and subducted material measured
in the Himalaya have been used in developing general models for continent -
continent collisions. Recent results indicate that some of the shortening in the
Himalaya may be due to an older event. This project aims to investigate this
pre-Himalayan deformation and separate it from the tertiary collision of India
with Asia, generally considered to be the Himalayan orogen. Results are expected
to refine or correct important aspects of the deformation history of this
important system that will have widespread application.&lt;br/&gt;
