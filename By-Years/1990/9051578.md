The computer controlled coordinate measuring machine (CMM) represents a final
phase in the development of a computer integrated manufacturing (CIM) system. It
is an addition to the current facilities that includes a 30 station PC based
computer aided design drafting laboratory using AutoCad software; a Harris mini
computer using CAD/CAM software; an 18 station PC manufacturing management
laboratory featuring manufacturing resource planning and simulation software,
and a three machine computer numerical control (CNC) laboratory scheduled for
upgrade. All are integrated via Novel software and an IBM Token-Ring computing
network. The CIM has become a part of the CIM network and, using the CMM
software, is able to inspect parts from projects developed in the CAD and CAM
Laboratories. The CMM is used primarily by the Materials Testing and
Measurements Class, but has impact on Statistical Quality Control and other
courses using the CAD and CAM facilities. The award is being matched by an equal
amount from the principal investigator's institution.
