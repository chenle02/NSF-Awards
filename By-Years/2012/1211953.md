This is a proposal to study spatially localized structures in driven dissipative
systems. Such structures are characterized by a balance between energy input
through suitable forcing and energy dissipation within the structure, and are
common in many physical systems including fluids, nonlinear optics and reaction-
diffusion equations. This proposal seeks to extend existing understanding of
these structures to two and three spatial dimensions through mathematical
analysis of global bifurcations in spatially reversible systems together with
numerical continuation techniques. Systems with both variational and
nonvariational structure will be studied, with a focus on understanding the
growth and multiplicity of stationary or moving structures as parameters are
varied. Time-dependent localized structures will be studied through analysis of
the bulk state and the motion of the front or boundary that confines it.
Collisions between moving structures and their trapping by external
inhomogeneities will be investigated by direct numerical simulation. The results
will be applied to several systems exhibiting thermally driven motion including
binary fluid convection, doubly diffusive convection and rotating convection.

Spatially localized structures are common in physical systems. Familiar examples
in fluids include localized convection, vortices, liquid drops and solitary
waves. Additional examples are provided by spots in optical and chemical
systems, localized buckling of slender structures under compression, pulses
propagating along neural fibers and localized oscillations in vibrating granular
media. Although these examples reach across many areas of the physical sciences
the localized structures that appear have many properties in common. This
proposal seeks to develop a mathematical understanding of the origin and
properties of such structures focusing on changes that take place as the
parameters of the system change, and aims to identify the properties that are
shared by these different examples.
