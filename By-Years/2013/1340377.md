The 35th Midwest Probability Colloquium at Northwestern University on October
10-12, 2013, at Northwestern University. Probability theory has been the most
applicable branch of pure mathematics. During the last decade we have seen a
clear surge in popularity of probabilistic tools and methods in other branches
of pure and applied mathematics. This year's selection of program topics and
speakers reflect the broad scope of applicability of the discipline. By
maintaining a wide range of active research directions, the Midwest Probability
Colloquium continues to provide a forum for the exchange of intellectual
interest across a wide array of applied fields as well as for core areas of
mathematics. Following the well established traditional format, the colloquium
will be divided into the Tutorial Program and the Research Program.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The speakers of the Research Program are:
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Martin Barlow (University of British Columbia)
&lt;br/&gt;Lionel Levine (Cornell University) &lt;br/&gt;Dmitry Panchenko
(University of Texas, A &amp; M)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The topic of this year's
Tutorial Program is "Random Walks on Groups" and will&lt;br/&gt;be hosted by
Steve Lalley (University of Chicago)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The MPC website is at
