The research goal is to develop a successful and satisfactory foundation of the
theory of secure protocols by: o Identifying the key quantities that govern the
security of distributed protocols, o Devising the most general and robust notion
of secure computation that respects these identified quantities, and o Forging a
set of tools for making it easier to prove or disprove the security of
distributed protocols. ***
