9355732 Schroder This project of the Franklin Institute is based on a four-year
model that will improve inquiry-based science teaching throughout Pennsylvania
by establishing a statewide cadre of middle school teacher leaders. The
Commonwealth Excellence in Science Teaching Alliance (CESTA2) will provide these
120 teachers with a series of intensive, professional development opportunities
and technical support that will enable them to: improve their knowledge of
science content areas; apply science to real-world situations; strengthen their
ability to facilitate inquiry-based science learning; and develop leadership
skills for the improvement of middle school science education. Teams of two to
three teachers from each school will first focus on changing the teaching of
science in their building and then provide leadership to their entire school
district. ***
