The research objective of this award is to develop a new framework for
incorporating risk into sequential decision making under uncertainty. The two
pillars of the approach are cumulative prospect theory and dynamic risk
measures. The framework builds on both of these research streams to formulate a
single theory that integrates subjective preferences in human behavior with
normative decision-making objectives. Existing utility-based dynamic models
cannot handle the nonconvexity implied by the behavioral models of prospect
theory, whereas the framework allows the probability weighting found in
cumulative prospect theory to be combined with the usual outcome weighting of
traditional expected utility formulations in a sequential decision-making model
that incorporates both types of risk sensitivity. The framework will be used to
develop efficient dynamic programming sampling and simulation-based methods for
risk-sensitive optimization and control problems, and to investigate how the new
modeling of risk-sensitivity affects the behavior of decision
makers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will
provide an alternative framework for decision making under risk to currently
existing approaches. The framework unifies the predominantly descriptive
research stream of prospect theory coming primarily from psychology and
behavioral economics with the normative approaches generally associated with the
microeconomics and operations research communities. From this new approach arise
a host of challenges, both theoretical and computational. Algorithms will be
developed that can be used to address practical operational and tactical
decision-making problems arising in a wide variety of application areas, from
manufacturing and supply chain management to service systems, including health
care, transportation, and financial engineering.
