This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop and
demonstrate unique features of a novel biotechnology process for in-situ
bioremediation of Methyl Tert-Butyl Ether (MTBE) in groundwater. Major problems
with in-situ bioremediation of MTBE include the inability to establish high
densities of bacteria, the inability to maintain contact between the degrading
bacteria and MTBE, and the upsets and losses of bacteria. The primary objective
of this Phase I project is to evaluate degradation performance of the biological
permeable barrier [BPB] using Bio-beads as the reactive material. It is
anticipated that MTBE will be effectively biodegraded to non-detectable levels.

The commercial application of this project is in the area of bioremediation.
Success of the work is expected to have major impact on the various
environmental problems linked to contaminated sites both in the public and
private sectors.
