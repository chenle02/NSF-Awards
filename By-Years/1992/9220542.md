This award provides approximately one-half the funding required for the
acquisition of an electron microprobe to be installed and operated in the
Department of Geology and Geophysics at the University of Minnesota. The
University is committed to providing the remaining funds necessary. The new
electron microprobe will provide state-of-the-art capabilities in quantitative
chemical analysis of geological samples with spatial resolution on the order of
a micrometer. A group of eight faculty research groups in the Department of
Geology and Geophysics are actively pursuing research projects requiring such
capability. In addition, the instrument will be made available regionally to
staff/students at the Minnesota Geological Survey, the Duluth campus of the
University of Minnesota, the 3M Company, and Honeywell.
