This "Second Meeting on Applications of Group Theory to Math-Physics" is
designed to encourage future joint efforts between mathematics and physics, just
as did its predecessor, the 1982 Chicago AMS-SIAM meeting. Mathematicians and
physicists, in roughly equal numbers, will present and compare work on
mathematical structures and physical models of current mutual interest. Specific
topics include representations of infinite dimensional Lie structures, strings,
and quantum fields. Group theory is a mathematical subject with deep connections
to several areas of physics. Physicists apply this theory, leading to further
development in both group theory and the relevent areas of physics.
