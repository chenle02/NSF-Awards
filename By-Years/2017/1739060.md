This 20th occurrence of the Biochemical and Molecular Engineering conference
organized under the auspices of the Engineering Conferences International (ECI)
will bring together leaders in the field of biochemical engineering and
associated fields, both from academia and industry, along with the newest
entrants into the field, for a small, focused conference. The objectives of the
conference are: 1) to bring together all factions of the biochemical engineering
community to consider the newest advances in our field; 2) to provide a forum
for the community to exchange ideas that will lead to both advances in science
and a culture of cooperation within the community; 3) to address how our
science/ technology can be used to address the compelling issues of the day,
either in sustainable manufacturing, rapid response to Ebola, or developing new
therapeutic modalities to cure disease; 4) to bring together the community to
consider how changes in science, technology, funding climate, and the economy
are impacting our profession, and how should impact education and other
practices. This conference will not only highlight the most noteworthy advances
in the field with Keynotes from people like George Georgiou (Texas), Vilhelm
Bohr (NIH), Christina Smolke (Stanford), and Jennifer Cochran (Stanford) but
will also build the community, provide opportunities for this international
audience to exchange ideas, and for the community to set new directions in
education and training if needed.
