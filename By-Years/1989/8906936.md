This proposal will develop a framework for the forecasting of electrical demand
under changing socio-economic infrastructure. Standard forecasting techniques
rely mostly on past history which may not be valid when changes take place in
the infrastructure. The expected deregulation of electric generation and the
proliferation of demand side technologies will have effects that cannot be
accurately forecasted by traditional methods. This project will develop
methodology that is adaptive to such changes.
