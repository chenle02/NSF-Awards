Very high energy particles are known to be produced in various astronomical
objects observed at different wavelengths. These particles must be accelerated
in some way. One way is to accelerate them with a shock wave from some explosion
somewhere in the source. There has been considerable theoretical research done
on diffusive shock acceleration. The theory can now be used with some confidence
to model nonthermal particle distributions in realistic astrophysical
conditions. The research program will focus on the acceleration of particles in
the Sun, active galactic nuclei, accreting neutron stars, and supernovae. The
predictions of the models will be compared with ground-based and satellite-based
observations.
