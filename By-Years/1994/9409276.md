Optically detected resonance (ODMR) will be applied to a study of point defects
in two ternary chalcopyrites (silver gallium selenide and zinc germanium
phosphide). These semiconductors have been identified as primary candidates for
frequency-conversion applications in the near and mid-infrared wavelength
regions. The proposed studies will help to identify and characterize the point
defects responsible for unwanted optical absorption bands in the range from 0.7
to 2.0 microns in these materials. Nonlinear optical materials are used in
tunable infrared laser systems. Two prime candidates, silver gallium selenide
and zinc germanium phosphide, have met limited success due to defects which
produce optical absorption bands. Optical spectroscopic techniques which allow
atomic scale resolution will be applied to characterize the defects.
