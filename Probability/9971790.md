This proposal describes a variety of stochastic problems for investigation.
These problems are associated with stochastic adaptive control which is the
control of an incompletely known stochastic system. Typically to solve an
adaptive control problem it is necessary to identify the unknown parameter of
the system and simultaneously to construct a control. The cost functionals for
the control problems are typically ergodic (average cost per unit time). A
family of processes, fractional Brownian motion, is proposed for development by
extending a stochastic calculus and using these processes for adaptive control
problems. This family of processes seems to have wide applicability. Adaptive
control for stochastic distributed parameter systems is proposed by considering
partially known semilinear systems. This family of systems includes some
stochastic partial differential equations. The adaptive control of continuous
time branching processes is proposed for investigation because these processes
are important and little use of control has been made for these processes. Risk
sensitive control problems are especially useful for financial models. It is
proposed to study adaptive control for these problems. The work in this proposal
should be applicable to physical systems that have stochastic models that are
controlled. It should enhance the understanding of these physical systems.

Mathematical models are used to describe physical systems and analysis is
performed on these mathematical models. Typically it is required to control the
physical systems so that control is introduced in the mathematical models.
Usually the models are not completely specified so it is necessary to identify
some parameters of the model from the evolution of the system. To describe
perturbations or unmodelled dynamics in a system, noise is introduced in the
model. The control of an incompletely specified system with noise is called
stochastic adaptive control. It is proposed to investigate a wide variety of
problems in stochastic adaptive control. These problems include lumped and
distributed systems. Some new noise models using fractional Brownian motion will
also be investigated.
