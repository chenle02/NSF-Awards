A series of deep fine and microstructure profiles will be conducted across the
Romanche and Chain fracture zones of the equatorial Atlantic mid-ocean ridge.
The focus of the research is on the flow of bottom waters over major sills where
enhanced mixing associated with hydraulic jumps is expected. Several sites
located on the equator and at 1 and 2 degrees latitude, but outside the fracture
zone will also be sampled to contrast the conditions within the fracture zone
and document the velocity and mixing fields of the deep cross equatorial jets.
This exploratory work is collaborative with one of the French contribution to
the deep basin experiment.
