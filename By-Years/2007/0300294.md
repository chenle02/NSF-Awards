This project entails laboratory research on the formation of radicals from the
photolysis of aldehydes, both in the gas phase and adsorbed on ice surfaces.
Aldehydes are known to be important sources for free radicals, especially "odd
hydrogen" (HOx) species that play essential roles in the oxidative capacity of
the troposphere and lower stratosphere. Experimental techniques include laser
photolysis followed by formyl radical detection using Cavity Ring-Down
Spectroscopy (CRDS) and detection of other products by step scan Fourier
Transform InfraRed spectroscopy (FTIR). The study addresses two separate, but
related, reaction series: the photolysis of aliphatic and unsaturated
dialdehydes in the gas phase, and the photolysis of formaldehyde and
acetaldehyde on ice surfaces (as a surrogate for snow). Broader community
impacts are addressed as follows. This work involves a contribution to
interdisciplinary (surface chemical morphology and gas phase kinetics) science,
will advance fundamental understanding of homogeneous and heterogeneous
photolysis of aldehydes and could potentially bring quantitative insight to the
current discussion of snow pack photochemical processes, considered to be of
high relevance to climate change. The staffing plan includes a postdoctoral
researcher and graduate student, and the principal investigator will include
technical methodology and research findings into her university teaching
coursework.
