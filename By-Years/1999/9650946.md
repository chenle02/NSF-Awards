The goal of this project is to develop an undergraduate digital microprocessor
laboratory for electrical engineering technology students. Until now,
electronics courses have not offered practical laboratory experience in digital
design. A series of experiments has been developed that effectively accomplishes
this goal. Twelve workstations are being acquired. Each station consists of a
Pentium-class personal computer equipped with a 68HC11 EVB microprocessor
development board, a Universal Design Lab Platform experiment board, and ORCADTM
software for logic verification and printed circuit layout. Students now receive
hands-on experiences in basic digital electronics and microprocessor hardware
design. Students are able to conceive, design, and simulate digital circuits.
The new laboratory experiences serve as part of a revised and updated digital
electronics and microprocessor courses and can consolidate, add, reinforce, and
update the skills taught in the old sequence of design courses.
