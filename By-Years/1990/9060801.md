This is a SBIR Phase I award in the topic area of biological instrumentation.
Radiation Monitoring Devices, Inc will develop a large area, real-time imaging
system for measuring the distribution of radioactivity on the hybridization
membrane. The project is designed to overcome a limiting step in current
technology (autoradiography) in screening radiolabeled hybridization membrane.
If successful, such a product will have a wide application beyond DNA
hybridization screening in biological research.
