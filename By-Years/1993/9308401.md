9308401 Zhao The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Wayne
State University will purchase a Q switched Nd:YAG Laser at 1.3um wavelength,
which will be dedicated to research. The equipment will be used for several
research projects, including in particular (1) nonlinear optical devices at
1.3um for optical communication systems using semiconductor multiple quantum
wells, (2) materials characterizations of novel photonic materials, including
wide band gap semiconductors, amorphous semiconductors, and conducting plastics,
(3) lasing without population inversion and electromagnetic induced
transparency, and (4) spectral information processing using persistent spectral
hole burning in crystals. ***
