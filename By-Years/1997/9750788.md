This project develops an integrated laboratory to facilitate and strengthen the
current undergraduate instruction of manufacturing processes within a Mechanical
Engineering (ME) curriculum. Along with the college's materials testing
equipment and computer-aided engineering and design facility, the new
Manufacturing Processes Laboratory allows for vital hands-on experience in
conjunction with the study of manufacturing processes, while emphasizing the
integration of manufacturing with other key disciplines of the product
realization process, including product design, stress analysis, and material
selection. The main incentive motivating the development of the Manufacturing
Processes Laboratory is the lack of a physical laboratory experience associated
with the previous junior-level Manufacturing Processes class. The new facility
allows students to learn about manufacturing processes through hands-on
experience and participation in the fabrication and inspection of parts. The
equipment thus serves to provide the vital link between theory and application
and creates a more comprehensive and interesting learning environment. With this
knowledge serving as a prerequisite, the students are given the opportunity to
use the laboratory facility in the following additional courses: (1) Capstone
Senior Design, offering a full year design-to-fabrication experiment to ME
seniors, (2) Computer-Integrated Manufacturing, a proposed senior elective where
the issues of computer-aided design, manufacturing, and quality control are
addressed, and (3) Science of Materials, where the analysis of thermoplastics
and their solidification properties has been without the benefit of physical
demonstration. In addition, the new equipment can be introduced to freshmen
engineering students in Exploring Engineering, a course providing an
introduction to basic engineering concepts and issues.
