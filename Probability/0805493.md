The study of random surfaces and random interfaces has long held the interest of
physicists and mathematicians. Only recently, however, have there arisen
mathematical techniques for understanding simple interfaces of more than one
dimension. The next simplest case,that of two dimensional interfaces in three
space,is already quite difficult. The two-dimensional interfaces we study are
called 'stepped surfaces'. Under the simplest choice of measure on these
surfaces, the uniform measure for a fixed boundary, the large-scale shapes taken
by these surfaces has begun to be worked out by the PI and Okounkov, using
techniques from PDEs, analysis and tropical geometry. This model is essentially
the only mathematically 'solved' model of random interfaces. Moreover it
contains a great deal of mathematical connections with other areas: to random
matrix theory, integrable systems, string theory and Gromov-Witten theory. For
these reasons it is worth understanding this model better, and also worth
looking for generalizations.

We are studying mathematical models of crystal surfaces. On an atomic scale, the
surface of a crystal, such as a salt crystal or diamond, is rough and 'random',
but at large scales it is typically smooth and facetted. How these large scale
features arise from the microscopic interactions of the atoms comprising the
crystal is, to a large extent, still mysterious. However we can make models of
crystal surfaces which are computationally tractable in a mathematical sense,
and display the same behavior as real crystals: in particular they display
facetting and large-scale shape formation. By studying these models we hope to
gain understanding not just of crystal surfaces but of the general phenomenon of
how local interactions among a large number of constituents can develop into
large-scale behavior.
