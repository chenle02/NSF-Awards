This Science in Developing Countries Award will support Latin American
participation in the Year in Mathematical Logic to be held at the Mathematical
Sciences Research Institute (MSRI) in Berkeley, California. This special
emphasis year will provide a unique opportunity to make a major impact on the
development of mathematical logic in Latin America. A significant number of the
world's leading logicians will be in residence during the year, many of them for
extended periods running from three months to the full year. Greater contact
with logicians in the rest of the world will serve to continue the development
of a number of Latin American research centers in mathematical logic. This award
will support the participation of seven junior Latin American researchers, no
more than six years from their Ph.D., in this special emphasis year at MSRI.
Financial hardships in most of the Latin America countries work particularly
hard against young researchers who have to compete with more senior established
researchers for scarce funds. Providing younger researchers in Latin America
with the means of making contacts and engaging in collaborative research with
leading researchers in their fields, will help to ensure ties with the future
leaders of mathematical logic in the area.
