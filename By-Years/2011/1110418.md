Disease is often known to lead to the performance of risky behaviors. Using the
energy budget rule of Risk Sensitivity Theory as a theoretical foundation, this
project asks whether such risky behavior stems from the energetic stress
incurred from a disease because it is adaptive to be risk-averse when one?s
energy budget is positive and be risk-prone when it is negative. Using the
honeybee as a model, the project will use a suite of feeding regimes to put
individuals at different energy budgets and use an olfactory conditioning assay
to test their choice for constant (risk-averse) and variable (risk-prone) reward
distributions. The project will also test how an individual monitors its
energetic state in order to behave in a risk-sensitive fashion and how this
assessment is operative in an individual whose energetic state is tightly tied
to that of the colony. Using an enzyme inhibitor to keep an individual
artificially starved and thus uncouple its energetic state from that of its
colony (which also mimics the energetic stress of a parasitic infection in a
host), the project will test if foraging decisions can be dictated by the
energetic state of the individual independent of the energetic state of the
colony. By integrating potential links between disease ecology, physiology, and
behavioral ecology, the proposed research has the potential to provide a
mechanistic basis and a novel perspective for the recent worldwide phenomenon of
honeybee colony collapse characterized by bees disappearing from their colonies.
The project will also involve undergraduate students in science education at
local schools and collaboration with local beekeepers to improve honeybee health
in general.
