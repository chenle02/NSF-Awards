This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY
2011, Broadening Participation. The fellowship supports a research and training
plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden
participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this
fellowship to Michael DeGiorgio is "Using mathematical models to study the
spatial distribution of human genetic variation." The host institution for this
research is University of California, Berkeley and the sponsoring scientist is
Dr. Rasmus Nielsen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research promises a better
understanding of the processes that led to the current distribution of genetic
variation among human populations. The research plan includes testing different
hypotheses of modern human origins by developing and analyzing models of human
genetic history and applying statistical techniques to next-generation sequence
data from human populations. Further, the Fellow is deriving mathematical
formulas to describe the distribution of genetic variation under different
models of human evolutionary history. Findings from this study add to greater
knowledge of the demographic processes that shaped the spatial distribution of
human genetic variation, enabling investigators to distinguish signals of
adaptation from those of demography.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The training
objectives include learning to make population genetic inferences from low-
coverage next-generation sequencing data and gaining new perspectives for
interpreting and understanding evolution. The new computational tools being
developed are being made available to the public and results published with open
access.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts include research experience for
undergraduate students from underrepresented groups early in their scientific
training through the Berkeley Biology Scholars Program to expose them to
population genomic research, computation, and the ethical implications of the
research.
