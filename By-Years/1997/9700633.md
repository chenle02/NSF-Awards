Abstract ATM-9700633 Denton, George H. University of Maine Title: Millennial-
Scale Climatic Oscillations in New Zealand During the Last Glacial Cycle: PEP
III Transect Paleoclimate records from Greenland ice cores and North Atlantic
sediments indicate that the glacial climate over the North Atlantic basin was
punctuated with large and frequent abrupt climatic changes (Dansgaard-Oeschger
and Henrich events). Because the events first appeared to have been regionally
restricted, most explanations have invoked regional forcing mechanisms. But
quite a different perspective would emerge if these events were shown to be of
this global-scale. SGER award supports a reconnaissance study of the glacial and
vegetative paleoclimate record of the massive morainal deposits of the Southern
Alps of New Zealand This will establish the paleoclimate potential of this
record to contribute to our understanding of interhemispheric climatic linkages
and forcing mechanisms for the last glacial cycle.
