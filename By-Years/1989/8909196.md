The objective of this research is to gain insight into automating engineering
reasoning about physical systems through the construction and utilization of a
qualitative model addressing the domain of fatigue and fracture in metals.
Engineering problem solving requires an understanding of how physical systems
behave even when only incomplete and nonnumeric information is available on the
parameters which influence that behavior. For this reason, qualitative physics
is one of the critical areas requiring key advances to support intelligent
computer aided engineering. Engineers make extensive use of abstraction and
simplifying assumptions in construction and manipulation of mental and analytic
models. Formalization of modeling assumptions and construction of a multilayered
qualitative domain model capable of supporting reasoning at various levels of
abstraction and under various sets of assumptions are goals of this project. The
domain of application is that of fatigue and fracture in metals. This aspect of
material behavior has wide engineering applicability. The envisioned qualitative
model encompasses a range of physical phenomena within the domain such as high
cycle fatigue and low cycle fatigue. More specific models can then be
automatically generated by setting initial assumptions. After the qualitative
model has been built, its capabilities for qualitative simulation and
comparative analysis will be studied. The end product will be an intensive
qualitative domain model and a systematic understanding of its predictive
behavior.
