Many mathematical models of natural phenomena, e.g., biology, physics and
materials science, involve nonlinear systems of partial differential equations
(PDEs). Traditional numerical methods focus on the unique time-marching solution
and are very hard to capture these solution structures such as bifurcations,
multiple steady states, and the structural stability. This project aims to
address these challenges by developing efficient computational methods to
explore bifurcations and multiple solutions of nonlinear PDEs.

The aim of this project is to develop efficient numerical methods to study the
bifurcations and multiple solutions of nonlinear systems of PDEs. Two novel
numerical techniques are proposed to study nonlinear systems of PDEs. First, an
adaptive homotopy tracking with bifurcation detection algorithm will be designed
for computing bifurcation points and bifurcation solution branches based on
adaptive tracking, endgame technique, and inflation process. Second, a homotopy
method with optimal basis approximation will be developed to compute multiple
solutions of nonlinear systems by optimizing the solution basis in order to
minimize the size of the discretized polynomial system. Homotopy method will be
employed to solve this bootstrapped discretized polynomial system. The project
will also focus on demonstrating and verifying efficiency/reliability of these
proposed numerical methods on the real biological problems which have attracted
extensive mathematical studies since the models were proposed.
