Drs. Dean and Graybill will continue their dendroclimatological work to
reconstruct past climates in the United States Southwest. Because the size and
configuration of annual growth rings in trees are affected by changes in
rainfall and other environmental variables, it is possible to use them to
reconstruct past climatic change. Also, since tree rings are deposited on an
annual basis, they permit an accurate dating of this change. Drs. Dean and
Graybill will add to an already substantial data base through the collection and
analysis of additional cores from living trees in Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, and
Colorado. They will correlate this information with data obtained from weather
stations and apply the results to older samples derived from archaeological
contexts. They will reconstruct changing annual and seasonal variations in
precipitation, temperature, growing season length, the Palmer Drought Severity
Index, and changes in stream flow. The Southwestern United States saw the rise,
in pre Hispanic times, of complex cultures which covered large portions of
several states. These archaeological complexes expanded and contracted over time
and the largest disintegrated before the arrival of the Spanish. Archeologists
have hypothesized that these cultural changes were in fact responses to
variation in the environment and that the Southwest offers an excellent
laboratory to study the relationship between environmental change and human
response. The tree ring data will significantly aid in analyses of this kind.
This research will be important not only for archaeologists, but also
paleoecologists and scientists interested in climate dynamics and changes.
Changes in temperature and precipitation which are of such concern today
occurred many times in the past. It is important both to understand them and to
learn how human societies responded.
