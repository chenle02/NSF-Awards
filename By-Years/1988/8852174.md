Mankato State University will purchase equipment to use satellite imagery,
weather radar data, National Weather Service information, lightning strike data,
and local weather data to enhance instruction in several undergraduate courses.
These include both large introductory courses in physical geography and weather;
and more specialized courses in climatology, advanced weather analysis and
remote sensing. Students will have the opportunity to engage in a number of
"hands-on" projects that utilize data obtained with this equipment. The lower
division courses serve significant numbers of K-12 teacher candidates. Mankato
State University will match the NSF equipment grant with an equal amount of
funds.
