This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).

This award provides funds for the renovation of two laboratory spaces and
upgrade supporting infrastructure for genetics research in the Biology
Department at Ursinus College. One research laboratory will be utilized to study
C. elegans as a model system. The second laboratory will be utilized for
research on the role of prion-like protein aggregation in the normal biology of
the cell using the model organism, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The improvements
will provide greater opportunities for students to participate in research and
research training. The improvements to the two labs will include cabinetry,
chemical fume hoods, improved electrical and power outlets, sinks, gas outlets,
overhead lighting, flooring and ceiling tiles, and white boards. The funds will
provide the addition of a new environmental system for the two labs and their
support spaces. A single, dedicated air handler with energy saving enthalpy
wheel and a new general laboratory exhaust system will be provided in a remote
unit located on the roof directly above the two labs. With the addition of a new
vertical duct chase, the similar orientation of the labs will allow efficient
stacking of supply and return ductwork. The new single unit will provide
centralized, efficient temperature and humidity control for both labs in an
easily accessible roof top unit. Reinforcement of the roof structure above lab
210 will support the loads of the new air handling unit. The HVAC will be
supplied with hot water from the college's central steam plant and chilled water
from the college's central chiller plant.
