Recent palynological research has produced detailed regional vegetation
histories for northeastern Beringia (northern Alaska and northwestern Canada).
Comparisons of these histories with paleoclimate models raise questions
concerning regional spatial and temporal patterns of late Quaternary climate and
vegetation change. This award will support an investigation to collect and
analyze the pollen content of 8 lake sediment cores from southwestern Alaska,
interpret the late Quaternary vegetation and climate history of this region, and
compare these histories to those from other regions of Beringia. The vegetation
history will be described based on species ecologies and statistical comparison
of modern and fossil pollen spectra. Response surface analyses and autecological
requirements of indicator taxa will be used to infer past climate from the
pollen records, and these interpretations will be compared to computer
simulations.
