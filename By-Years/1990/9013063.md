The Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory (MDIBL) is the oldest cold-water
marine laboratory in the eastern United States, annually providing facilities
for between 40 to 50 research programs ranging from the comparative physiology
and biochemistry of osmoregulation and renal and epithelial transport in
vertebrates and invertebrates to endocrinology, developmental and molecular
biology. Scientists throughout the world apply to work at the MDIBL; acceptance
is competitive. This project provides matching funds for the renovation of a
sixty-seven year old building, the H. V. Neal Laboratory. Although continuously
used for decades by researchers, including some of the MDIBL's most illustrious
summer scientists, the Neal building no longer provides an adequate laboratory
environment for modern electrophysiological, biochemical and molecular biology
research. Plans call for modernizing the building to provide climate- controlled
research space with vibration-free floors. The interior of the building will be
modified to provide both laboratory and work space on two floors by the removal
of present interior partitions and the lowering of the first-floor ceiling.
Electrical service, lighting and plumbing also will be upgraded. The exterior
siding of the building, unchanged since original construction, will be replaced.
A new entrance will provide access for handicapped persons. Renovation of the
Neal Laboratory will increase by two-fold the area of temperature- controlled
modern space for state-of-the-art research at the MDIBL.
