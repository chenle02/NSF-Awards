This award provides support for junior scientists to attend the 25th
International Spin Symposium (SPIN 2023). The symposium is held every two years
and alternates between the U.S., Europe, and Asia. It traditionally brings
theorists and experimentalists together to discuss instrumentation and theory in
spin phenomena of particle and nuclear physics. The symposium format consists of
talks in plenary and parallel sessions, with a poster session. The symposium is
organized in the following topics: • Nucleon Helicity Structure • Transverse
momentum dependent structure (TMD) • Form factors and Generalized Parton
Densities (GPDs) • Future facilities and experiments • Fundamental Symmetries
and Spin Physics Beyond the Standard Model • Acceleration, Storage, and
Polarimetry of polarized Beams • Polarized Sources and Targets • Spin in Nuclear
Reactions and Nuclei • Applications of Nuclear Polarization in other Fields •
Low energy spin physics with lepton, photon, and hadron probes

The symposium will be held September 24 – 29, 2023 at Duke University.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
