Morse is working on a project involving a filtration for the space of symmetric
functions that depends on a positive integer k. In earlier work, Lapointe,
Lascoux, and Morse introduced new families of polynomials that lie in these
subspaces, and they made a number of assertions relying on their
characterization of these elements. Among these conjectures is one stating that
their elements form a basis for the k-subspaces of the symmetric function space
and that the Macdonald polynomials expand positively on this new basis. More
generally, their claims lead to a family of positivity conjectures which will
provide a natural refinement for many fundamental concepts in symmetric function
theory. For example, their elements appear to play a role in the k-subspaces
analogous to the important role that the Schur functions play for the symmetric
function space. Morse is working on proving these conjectures and is also
investigating the possible representation theoretic interpretation for these
polynomials.

The theory of symmetric functions is a classical part of mathematics with a wide
variety of applications in fields including physics, engineering, and computer
science. Recent development in the study of symmetric functions was made with
the introduction in 1988 of a new family of symmetric functions called the
Macdonald polynomials. Remarkably, these polynomials have also been found to
play an important role in areas such as geometry, representation theory, and
many-body physics. The successful completion of this project would prove
important properties of the Macdonald polynomials and more generally, would
provide a natural refinement for the fundamental concepts in symmetric function
theory.
