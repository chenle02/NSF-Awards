The award supports the Workshop 'Mixing in Rapidly Changing Environments -
Probing Nature at the Extremes.' The Workshop is a part of the program
'Turbulent Mixing and Beyond' (TMB). The Workshop is focused on interfacial and
turbulent mixing in fluids, plasmas and materials under extreme conditions of
high energy density and sharply changing flow fields, and on their applications
in nature and technology, from astrophysical to atomistic scales. The workshop
will consist of invited lectures by leading experts on hydrodynamic
instabilities in fluids and plasmas, contributed talks and posters. The inter-
disciplinary and international program of the Workshop will provide an
infrastructure for promoting research frontiers, for developing productive
collaborations, and for leveraging the community experience in educational
programs for graduate and professional education. The results of the workshop
will be published.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The target problems of the TMB Workshop
'Mixing in Rapidly Changing Environments' (TMBW- 2014) include Rayleigh-Taylor
instabilities and interfacial and turbulent mixing, active and passive scalar
mixing, the evolution of phase boundaries, and non-canonical turbulence and
convection in fluids, plasmas and materials, and their applications in fusion,
astrophysics, reactive flows, aerodynamics and material science. TMBW-2014 will
provide the opportunity to bring together young researchers and seasoned
scientists from the areas of fluid dynamics, plasmas, astrophysics, material
science, nonlinear physics, and applied mathematics. TMBW-2014 will serve to
advance knowledge of fundamental aspects of hydrodynamic instabilities and
mixing, and will potentially have an impact on predictive modeling capabilities,
physical description and, ultimately, control of these complex processes.
