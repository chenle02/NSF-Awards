This project is devoted to studying deterministic and random cellular automata
models of growth processes, with the emphasis on several new directions. The
first field of study are long-range growth processes, specifically the behavior
at the edge of the expanding wave by investigating, depending on the regime,
mixing times and hydrodynamics limits.The investigator also aims to study
nucleation and metastability properties of monotone growth models, and space-
covering properties of nonmonotone ones. A new research direction is the
utilization of three-dimensional mesoscopic modeling to understand growth of
snow crystals. Computational and analytical methods are developed to connect the
mesoscopic scale dynamics with the microscopic (particle) and macroscopic
(continuum) versions. Finally, the investigator will devise combinatorial and
probabilistic methods to understand the effects of random environments on growth
processes in high-dimensional spaces important in genetics.

In a broad scientific context, the aim of this project is to understand
principles by which various physical systems propagate disturbances. For
example, crystal growth has been a subject of intense research for more than a
century, yet growth of objects as familiar as snowflakes remains mysterious. The
investigator's research sheds light on how microscopic description of a growth
process effects the resulting shape, its space-covering ability, behavior at the
expanding front, and stability to perturbations in the environment and in the
dynamics. An important feature is the interplay between rigorous mathematical
analysis and large--scale computer experimentation. This component aims to
develop connections to physics, engineering and biology for fundamentals of
crystal growth and other expansion processes, to computer science for efficient
simulation and visualization algorithms, and to theoretical genetics for
realistic insights into the structure of genotype and phenotype spaces. Together
with the advancement of mathematical and computational methods, such research
has potential applications to crystal manufacturing in material sciences,
understanding snowfall in atmospheric sciences, and genetic diversity in
biology. Finally, communication with general public by means of attractive
computer graphics, and ample opportunities for undergraduate and graduate
students' involvement in all aspects of such studies, will popularize
mathematics and its applications.
