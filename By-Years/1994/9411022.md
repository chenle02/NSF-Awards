9411022 Weisner This proposal from the Institute of Electrical and Electronic
Engineers, requests support to conduct a workshop entitled "Industry 2000
Workshop." Industry 2000 will bring together leaders from industry, academia,
government, and professional societies to focus on the appropriate development
and delivery of career-long education to professionals seeking to keep current
in the field. The Workshop participants will grapple with practical issues based
on the experience of fellow participants and their organizations. How does
industry perceive the need for training, continuing education, and professional
development? What makes sense in the short and long term? How can industry work
with the various providers, particularly universities, to develop more
accountability for dollars spent on professional development? In addition to
providing a forum where ideas and resources can be shared, Industry 2000 will
provide IEEE with an opportunity to learn about industry needs first hand. Since
this proposal is for conducting a workshop, it is exempt from peer review in
accordance with NSF Manual No. 10, Section 122.1-3. Award of a grant is
recommended. Paul J. Herer February 9, 1994
