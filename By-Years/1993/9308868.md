This research addresses the issue of automated hypothesization of situation
models that are needed as contexts for reasoning and decision making. The three
different but related aspects that are addressed by this research are: 1.
Learning from domain data the qualitative relationships among domain attribute
and their associated probabilistic uncertainty knowledge; 2. Integration of
uncertainty knowledge and other known causal qualitative relationships of the
domain into a single graphical knowledge structure; and 3. Hypothesization of
small and interesting situation models from the intermediate representation of
domain knowledge acquired in the preceding step. The learning of qualitative
relationships from databases is extended to include acquisition of temporal
dependencies among attributes, and also to the cases when the available data is
in the form of multi- databases. This learning method is also sought to be
applied to the problem of incomplete databases. The knowledge based dynamic
hypothesization of situation models is sought to be extended to apply to path
planning and temporal modeling problems. The issue of specifying a situation
model at varying levels of precision and certainty are also examined.//
