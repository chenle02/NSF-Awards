Hypergeometric functions in one variable are fundamental objects of widespread
use in mathematics, science, and engineering. Hypergeometric functions in
several variables share this importance. For instance, polynomial equations of
degrees five or higher cannot be solved in terms of radicals, but they can
always be solved using multivariate hypergeometric functions, regardless of the
degree. Working in several variables, however, presents substantial challenges.
This project seeks to overcome these challenges by developing new combinatorial
and algebraic techniques. An important attribute of all hypergeometric functions
and differential equations is that they depend on parameters; varying the
parameters can cause substantial changes, and in most cases, neither these
effects nor the mechanisms that control them are completely understood. The
specific questions addressed in this project involve the investigation of the
parametric behavior of hypergeometric functions and differential equations.

In the late twentieth century, Gelfand, Graev, Kapranov, and Zelevinsky
introduced a generalized theory of hypergeometric functions and differential
equations based on toric varieties. Powerful algebro-combinatorial tools of
independent interest were developed by these authors in the hypergeometric
context, which have provided vast and elegant generalizations of some very
classical statements about hypergeometric functions in one variable. The goal of
this project is to use techniques drawn from polyhedral geometry, commutative
algebra, D-module theory and complex analysis to study these hypergeometric
functions and differential equations. The development of new tools for this
study also motivates and inspires specific projects within combinatorial
commutative algebra. Another major theme is to use hypergeometric tools and
intuition to obtain results beyond the hypergeometric world.
