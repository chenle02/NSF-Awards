This sixth through eighth grade comprehensive, project-based, science curriculum
focuses on students acquiring deep understandings of the concepts, principles
and habits of mind articulated in national science standards. The curriculum
builds upon the experiences of the Center for Learning Technologies in Urban
Schools developing the LeTUS modules for Chicago and Detroit Public Schools. The
project brings together scientists and science educators from three
universities, teachers and administrators from six school districts, curriculum
speialists from Project 2061, educational researchers from EDC, and Kendall/Hunt
publishers. The design principles, arising from research on teaching and
learning, include alignment with standards, assessments, contextualization,
sustained student inquiry, embedded learning technologies, collaboration, and
scaffolds between and within modules. Phase 1 focuses on the development of two
units: Structure of Matter and Diversity of Life and Evolution. Learning
outcomes are identified, target understanding performances are specified and
assessments are designed before the activities are developed. Everday authentic
questions that students hold as important provide the basis for projects,
contextualize the activities and give coherence to the curriculum. In addition
to the student materials and teacher guides, the project develops materials to
provide information to administrators and the community to understand and
support the implementation of the modules. Issues of language, literacy, culture
and diversity are addressed. Professional development materials address teacher
attitudes and beliefs while educating the teachers about the new context and
pedagogy.
