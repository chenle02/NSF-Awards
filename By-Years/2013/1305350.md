Increasing functionality and complexity of integrated circuits, particularly
those used in high performance computational devices such as computers but also
in portable and mobile devices, necessitate high frequency communication links.
The information generated and processed at the relentlessly increasing pace in
these devices flows over the high frequency communication links between
computation, storage and display units. The design and analysis of these high
frequency communication links, much like the computation, storage and display
units themselves, necessitate design and measurement equipment that is capable
of supporting their multi-GHz range of operation. This project is for the
acquisition of such a measurement testbed for high frequency interconnects to be
located at Drexel University in Philadelphia, PA. Opportunistically, the
measurement testbed is used for testing of many types of circuits and systems
including those involving microelectronics, optics, sensors, radio-frequency
applications, nano-electronics and molecular-electronics. Measurements of the
circuit and system devices enabled with this infrastructure enable the
development of computing devices that are increasingly portable, fast and
significantly less power demanding than the current electronic products. The
measurement testbed is used to develop lecture modules on high frequency
measurement, bridging a gap with the US microelectronics industry demand with
practical hands-on training with integrated circuit measurement and testing in
undergraduate education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The measurement testbed is used
by a large number of faculty members at the host institution (and users in the
Delaware Valley region) in a number of computing and non-computing projects. The
primary computing projects that are enhanced by this measurement testbed are
novel approaches in developing high performance integrated circuit
interconnects: 1. On-chip wireless interconnects, 2. Resonant clock
interconnects, 3. On-chip wireless interconnects. The measurement testbed is
useful as a whole or in pieces to the many other computing and non-computing
research areas thanks to enabling on-wafer testing and multi-port measurement.
These additional projects range from reduced dimensional photonics for THz
sensing to nanowires for energy storage and IC-based artificial photosynthesis.
