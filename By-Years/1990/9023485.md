The research interests here lie in the general area of compound semiconductor
materials and devices. This research explores novel devices, using unique
material characteristics such as quantum and strain effects in compound
semiconductors. Four major directions will be examined. They are: device
applications of selective epitaxy, mass transport of compound semiconductors,
submillimeter wave technology, and band structure engineering.
