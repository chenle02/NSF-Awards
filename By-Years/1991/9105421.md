Timing of early embryonic cell divisions is crucial for establishing the
coordinated interactions necessary for normal development. Dr. Hecht will
investigate a pathway responsible for initiating zygotic control of cell lineage
division in the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans. The regulation and function of
the emb-29V gene, defined by temperature sensitive alleles that arrest embryonic
cell divisions at or near the G2/M interface, will be investigated. An
understanding of the mechanisms controlling the expression and function of this
strict non- maternal gene product will provide insights into those factors that
interact with an important genetic element required for entry into the mitotic
stage of different embryonic cell lineages. To achieve these goals the emb-29
gene will be identified and isolated by transformation rescue. Emb-29 will then
be sequenced. Probes for emb-29's mRNA and its encoded protein will be used to
determine the cell lineage onset and intracellular localizations of the emb-29
gene product. Putative DNA regulatory domains will be identified by a
comparative sequence analysis of the homologous gene from the related species C.
briggsae. The in vivo and in vitro function of these domains will be determined
by transformation and DNA gel-shift assays, respectively. The properties of the
recombinantly expressed gene product will be biochemically determined and in
conjunction with the isolation and analysis of suppressor genes, the
investigation of interacting components will be initiated. In this manner, the
genetically and biochemically defined elements involved in the modulation and
expression of an essential gene controlling one of the pathways necessary for
embryonic cell lineage proliferation will be understood.
