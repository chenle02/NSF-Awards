9624189 Wilkening Unequivocally endorsed by the Chancellors and the UC Regents,
CAMP has become the standard bearer for ensuring diversity among our student
populations systemwide. CAMP has come far in the first four years, laying the
groundwork for exiting new possibilities that extend the program in various ways
to further develop the pipeline to baccalaureate degrees and beyond. NSF funding
phase II will allow extending the project by strengthening the quality and
quantity of B.S. degree recipients among underrepresented students; expanding
curricular reforms; integrating and institutionalizing programmatic components;
linking with teacher preparation through K-12 collaboration; continuing to
disseminate successful efforts, and extending the use of evaluation to decision-
making. Phase II offers a set of experiences that engage the entire educational
continuum and also extend to the development of minority teachers in science,
mathematics, engineering and technology fields. Through summer and academic year
programs that have seen unprecedented success, and through new bold plans that
address the transition to graduate and professional school, Phase II promises to
advance the faculty-driven momentum that the Alliance has achieved. New
collaborations and synergy with related initiatives will fuel our endeavors.
Similarly, linkages with business and industry will be strengthened through the
Statewide advancement officer who will be dedicated to developing corporate
partnerships at each UC campus.
