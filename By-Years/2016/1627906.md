At the heart of decision-making lie cognitive processes through which an
understanding of the decision context is acquired and decision-relevant
evaluations made. These processes can be cognitively costly and in particular
may be bounded by limited cognitive resources. The PIs propose to analyze the
behavior that might arise from such bounded cognition and to subsequently
construct choice models. This would provide a path for possible applications of
cognitive science in economics. Cognitive science is a multi-disciplinary field
spanning psychology, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, linguistics, etc.
and the proposal is a step in the direction of exploring the richness of its
possible connections with economics.

As a first step, the PIs propose to study an agent in an intertemporal choice
context who evaluates any given consumption stream by drawing on limited
cognitive resources to think about the consequences of the stream for his future
selves. They posit that the optimality of the use of cognitive resources should
be reflected behaviorally in greater patience when dealing with larger stakes.
Moreover, the existence of capacity constraints should lead to non-
separabilities in the evaluation of consumption streams. They will proceed to
find a utility representation for such behaviors that is interpretable in terms
of bounded cognition. The project makes use of the approach of axiomatic
decision theory.
