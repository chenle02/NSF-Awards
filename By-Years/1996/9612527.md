ABSTRACT Frankel 9612527 The proposal is to partially fund a workshop on
Boundary Element Technology. This numerical technique has wide applicability in
diverse areas of engineering, including heat transfer, fluid mechanics,
electromagnetics, and stress analysis. Within heat transfer, applications
include inverse conduction, melting, and radiative transport. The proposed
workshop is the 12th in a series of International meetings on boundary element
technology and is jointly sponsored by the University of Tennesee and the Wessex
Institute of Technology in the United Kingdom.
