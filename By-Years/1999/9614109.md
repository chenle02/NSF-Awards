9614109 Campbell This is a proposal that aims at studying the mineral pyrite
using transmitted near infrared light microscopy. This technique has only
recently been applied successfully with other less common opaque ore minerals
such as wolframite, enargite, and molybdenite. Preliminary data show that pyrite
displays a number of internal features including fluid inclusions, solid
inclusions, growth banding, and shear planes. In this study, it will also be
assessed if the variable transparency of pyrite is controlled, as in other
minerals, by trace element variations. Fluid inclusion studies using this
technique may be able to provide information on the conditions of pyrite
mineralization. In order to maximize the potential for making microthermometric
measurements on pyrite, variations in transparency controlled by chemical
impurities, thickness and temperature need to be understood. A better
understanding of the IR transparency of pyrite will allow new opportunities to
use pyrite in petrological studies to determine its geological origin.
