In this project funded by the Environmental Chemical Sciences Program in the
Chemistry Division, Professor Paul R. Sheppard of the University of Arizona is
establishing techniques to measure the levels of nitrogen present in tree rings
(dendronitrogen). The quantity of dendronitrogen correlates with nitrogen
availability to the ecosystem and therefore permits the long term profiling of
nutrient availability. Professor Shepard is studying ways to overcome two
challenges to understanding the mobility of nitrogen between tree rings. First,
some nitrogen-containing species are mobile across plant tissues that include
tree rings, so the ratio of mobile to immobile species needs to be determined.
Second, nitrogen is difficult to measure accurately and precisely in whole wood
samples. These difficulties have historically cast uncertainty on the accuracy
of dendronitrogen data and correlating the temporal variation in dendronitrogen
to the environmental availability of nitrogen. Professor Shepard is working to
establish a wood pretreatment strategy that will permit measurements that
reflect availability of nitrogen at the time of ring formation and to develop
protocols for accurately measuring nitrogen content in wood samples.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a measurable component of nitrogen in tree rings
that is immobile in the form of proteins within cell walls. That immobile
component can reflect environmental nitrogen availability at the time of ring
formation. Wood can be pretreated to effectively remove mobile nitrogen while
preserving the immobile component. This is achieved in two steps. First, the
tree cores are sliced into thin sections in the tangential orientation using a
rotary microtome, a novel approach. Second, these slices are then treated with a
mild combination of organic solvents in a sonication bath, to remove mobile
nitrogen, while allowing the tracheid cells to remain intact and undamaged. This
is key to preserving the structural, immobile nitrogen contained in the cell
walls. Combustion elemental analysis and isotope-ratio mass spectrometry,
specifically optimized for nitrogen, are used to quantitatively assess the
amount of dendronitrogen as a function of time. This research directly impacts
our understanding of forest and ecosystem health and dynamics, and improves our
general awareness about impacts of human society on ecosystem health.
