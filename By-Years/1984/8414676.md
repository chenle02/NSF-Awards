Recently, an issue which has emerged as being important for practical
applications, is the behavior of adaptive controllers in practical realistic
environments, where the assumptions made in the idealized nominal theory are not
satisfied. This research program analyzes the robustness problem for stochastic
self-tuning controllers. Other issues such as presence of measurement noise,
stray excitations 'picked up' by the system, etc., will also be addressed and
attention will be given to the utility of remedies proposed. Moreover, the
research will also deal with some properties which are totally intrinsic to
adaptive algorithms, and show how these properties manifest themselves in
applications.
