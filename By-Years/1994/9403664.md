The objective of this research is the measurement of the size and charge of ice
particles in thunderstorms, a crucial ingredient of existing theory of charge
separation in such storms. The measuring devices, including a new one designed
to evaluate the reliability of the electrical measurements, will be mounted on a
balloon and flown near Socorro, New Mexico where special radars and other
instruments will provide a useful meteorological characterization of the
thunderstorms.
