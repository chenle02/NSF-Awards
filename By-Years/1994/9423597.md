This grant supplies funding to the Bermuda Biological Station for acquisition of
shipboard instrumentation in support of NSF-funded research. The instruments
will be used aboard the R/V WEATHERBIRD II, a 115 foot vessel, which is owned
and operated by the Station. The instrumentation is required for support of NSF-
funded cruises aboard the WEATHERBIRD II during 1995 and will enhance the
scientific capability of the vessel in the future. Instruments funded include a
fluorometer, a transmissometer, a rosette pylon and an IMET shortwave radiation
sensor. ??
