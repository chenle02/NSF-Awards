The objective of this bilateral workshop on " The Mechanics of Ice and Its
Applications," is to bring together strong common interests of the United States
and the Soviet Union in obtaining a better understanding of the behavior of ice
at all scales. To safely and economically exploit the vast resources in Alaska
and Siberia, it is required to have an in-depth understanding of the movement of
the ice cover, the forces the moving ice can exert against bottom founded
structures, and the ice resistance on vessels used to transport these resources
to the market. The proposed workshop will bring together top ice researchers and
scientists from academia and industry to discus these key issues.
