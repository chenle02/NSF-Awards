Abstract:

The New Researchers Conference is a meeting for new researchers in statistics
and probability, where "new" is defined as doctoral students within one year of
completion of the Ph.D. or post-doctoral statisticians and probabilists up to
five years since the completion of their degrees. The primary purpose of this
conference is to foster the professional development of new researchers by
providing a much needed venue for interaction among new researchers by allowing
these junior researchers to exchange ideas and initiate contacts amongst
themselves as well as with the invited senior participants in the context of a
smaller meeting, rather than the larger meetings more common in this field. All
participants present their research in a short talk or poster session. The
program also includes several talks by senior researchers and panel discussions
with representatives from several statistics journals and representtatives from
funding agencies.

The New Researchers Conference is a meeting for recent Ph. D. recipients in
statistics and probability (or those within one year of completion). This
conference aims to facilitate the development of new researchers to help them
become productive scientific researchers and educators. The conference provides
a controlled environment for junior researchers to interact by exchanging ideas
and initiating contacts amongst themselves. All participants must present their
research during the meeting. Also included in the program are several talks by
senior speakers on topics of professional development and informational panels
consisting of representatives from professional journals and funding agencies.
