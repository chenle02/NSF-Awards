The objective of this three-year U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research project in
earth sciences between Nada Horvatincic of the Rudjer Boskovic Institute and
Henry S. Chafetz of the University of Houston is to study the physical and
chemical surficial processes influencing the formation of freshwater carbonate
deposits (travertines) in waterfalls. Joint field trips in the USA and
Yugoslavia are an integral part of the research plan and will enable the
investigators to compare the geology, geochronological and environmental
conditions favoring the development of such deposits. This project was approved
by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on Cooperation in Science and Technology and is
supported through a joint fund consisting of matching contributions from the
U.S. and Yugoslav governments. The U.S. contribution is provided annually by the
Department of State. No NSF funds are involved. The grants are composed
principally of Yugoslav dinars and made to the principal Yugoslav institute.
Grants include travel for U.S. scientists to Yugoslavia and a modest dollar
allowance for Yugoslav scientists' living expenses in the U.S.
