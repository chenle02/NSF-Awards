The recent acquistion of an energy dispersive x-ray fluorescence (EDXRF)
spectrometer allows this instrument to be used in the analytical/physical course
sequence in chemistry at Saginaw Valley State College. Students have an
opportunity to demonstrate the character of atoms through generation of line
spectra, to show the relationship between x-ray photon/electron interactions
using Compton shift and other effects relating to absorption edges, absorption
and photoelectric effects. Since EDXRF is a rapid, non-destructive technique,
students who carry out experiments utilizing this instrument acquire up-to-date
qualitative and quantitative analytical techniques and a basic understanding of
atomic structure and the properties of x-rays, required to enter their
respective scientific fields.
