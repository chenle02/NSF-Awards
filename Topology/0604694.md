The present research lies on the boundary between low dimensional topology and
quantum physics. It aims to construct a geometric model for the quantization of
the moduli space of flat SU(2)-connections on a surface, with the Lagrangian
given by the Chern-Simons functional. This would yield a new method for studying
the Jones polynomial of a knot, a fundamental topological invariant, with the
tools of quantum mechanics. The main problem is to understand the observables of
the quantum mechanical system associated with the Jones polynomial. The quantum
physical model in discussion is currently applied to the study of the behaviour
of electrons in a strong magnetic field at low temperatures. Physicists use the
Chern-Simons functional to couple a magnetic charge to the electric charge of
the electron and transform it formally into a particle whose physics is easier
to describe. It is believed that the behaviour of electrons is sophisticated
enough so that it can be used for writing the code of a quantum computer. We are
concerned with the mathematical aspects of this theory.
