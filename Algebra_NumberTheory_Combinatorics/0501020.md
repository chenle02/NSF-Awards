The investigator works on the topology of complex algebraic maps, with
applications to algebraic cycles. The study of the relations between the
topology of the domain and target of a map is interesting and has broad
applications in the fields of geometry and topology. This project aims at 1)
Furthering the study and the understanding of the Hodge and Chow-theoretic
properties of complex algebraic maps and at 2) Explicitly studying these
properties in significant cases.

The term ``algebraic maps" above is a technical term for polynomial equations.
Algebraic geometry is the discipline devoted to their study. It is an ancient
subject rooted in the early achievements of humanity, like the wheel, the
Egyptians' elliptical flowers arrangements and Archimedes' burning parabolic
mirrors. Circles, ellipses and parabolas arise from the polynomial equations we
study in high school. They are both beautiful and ubiquitous in nature as they
describe many natural phenomena, from the motion of planets to the shape of
leaves and flowers, to the behavior of microscopic particles. The funded project
is strongly inclined towards pure research and proposes to study the deeper
properties of the solutions to more complicated algebraic equations. As it has
always been the case, pure and applied mathematics will influence each other and
new abstract ideas will fuel the progress of applications.
