This three year institute is designed to train cultural anthropologist in a
variety of new methods and analytic techniques in order to improve their
research skills and to pass these skills on to students. More specifically, the
objectives of the Summer Institute on Research Methods in Cultural Anthropology
are to (a) improve field research methodology in cultural anthropology,
particularly in the conceptualization and construction of primary data; (b)
promote the use of microcomputers in the field; (c) improve the skills of
cultural anthropologists in basic techniques for managing and analyzing both
numeric and textual data; (d) enable participants to train others in these basic
techniques, both through methods classes and workshops of their own.
