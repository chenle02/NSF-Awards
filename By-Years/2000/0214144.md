Science Summary: This study will obtain and analyze sediment cores recovered in
the subtropical western North Atlantic off Cape Hatteras. Multiproxy study of
the cores will be done to determine gradients in sea surface temperature and
depth gradients in temperature and nutrient content. Surface water proxies will
include oxygen isotope and Mg/Ca measurements of planktic foraminifers. Bottom
water proxies will include oxygen and carbon isotope, Mg/Ca, Cd/Ca, and Ba/Ca of
benthic foraminifers. Sample resolution of selected time-series studies for the
entire Holocene will resolve millennial scale variability. More detailed
sampling of the last 3,000 years will be done in several cores to study century
scale variability of the late Holocene. Age models will be based on AMS 14C
dates space at about 500 yr intervals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
