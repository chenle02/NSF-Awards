The chorion genes of Drosophila melanogaster are expressed in distinct spatial
and temporal patterns in female follicles (eggchambers) and provide a powerful
system for molecular analysis of developmental gene expression. To dissect the
molecular mechanisms governing spatial expression, the PI has identified and
cloned CF4: a DNA-binding protein which interacts with sequences of the s36
chorion gene. CF4 contains a novel DNA-binding domain. The PI will focus on the
molecular biology and developmental genetics of CF4 to confirm its involvement
in regional-specific chorion gene expression by: examining the temporal and
spatial RNA and protein distribution of CF4 in follicles, initiating molecular
and biochemical studies, and using a genetic approach for identifying existing
or generating new mutations using the FLP recombination system to generate
genetic mosaic follicles, and he will also develop a GALA directed follicle-
specific gain of function assay and examine the effect of CF4 ectopic
expression.//
