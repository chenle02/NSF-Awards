With this CAREER award, the Chemical Synthesis Program is supporting the
research and educational efforts of Dr. Ryan A. Shenvi of the Department of
Chemistry at the Scripps Research Institute. The focus of this research is to
develop a new class of stereoselective nucleophilic displacement reactions that
operate on isolated tertiary carbon centers through attack of unstabilized
carbocationic contact ion pairs. This research fills a major methodological gap
in chemical synthesis that has been recognized for nearly 100 years. Realization
of the goals of this proposal would broadly impact the synthesis of challenging
tert-alkyl-substituted chiral materials that are difficult or impossible to
access by other methods. A successful outcome of the research proposed here
entails the reaction of unstabilized carbocations and various nucleophiles with
high chemo- and stereoselectivity, which has important consequences for the
production of materials for the interfacing fields of biology, medicine, and
physics.

The key focus of this research is on the development of concise and scalable
syntheses of therapeutically relevant molecules through the invention of new
chemical reactions that allow a degree of complexity which has been unachievable
through standard methods. The proposed research will potentially allow ready
access to a number of important natural and unnatural products while reducing
the number of steps and increasing the efficiency. The educational component of
this grant involves curriculum development and outreach through the Scripps SURF
program. This effort involves the development of a curriculum for high-school,
undergraduate, and graduate education that articulates the scientific method in
the context of organic chemistry research.
