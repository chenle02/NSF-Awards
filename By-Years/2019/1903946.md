Christopher Faesi is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral
Fellowship to conduct a program of research and education at the University of
Massachusetts, Amherst. Faesi will undertake an extensive observational program
to study Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs)---the birthplaces of stars---in a large
sample of nearby galaxies. Studying how the properties of GMCs change with the
environmental conditions within galaxies will allow astronomers to understand
how those conditions influence star formation. Alongside this research, Faesi
will develop a series of lesson plans to introduce modern astronomical research
into undergraduate classrooms.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Faesi will measure GMC
properties across a range of environments and develop methods to calibrate star
formation rates at GMC scales in nearby galaxies. This will allow a better
understanding of the global relationship between stars and interstellar gas in
galaxies. For the educational component of his work, Faesi will develop a
program to expose undergraduate students to astronomical research by
implementing lesson plans involving digestible summaries of recent research
articles, and he will assess how this exposure affects student retention,
interest, and success in science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
