9527482 Burchat This grant funds a continuing study of charm particle production
by pions, in particular a determination of form- factors in the semi-leptonic
decay of charged D mesons, using data produced at the Fermilab Tevatron
accelerator. In addition, support is provided for participation in a large
international collaboration to design and build the detector (BABAR) that will
be put into operation at the SLAC PEP II asymmetric B factory later in this
decade. This grant has been made under the Presidential Young Investigator
program. ***
