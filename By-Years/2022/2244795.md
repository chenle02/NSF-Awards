This award renews support for a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU)
site at Boston University, BU-PRO. The site will support ten undergraduate
students from outside BU per summer for ten weeks of research in various topics
in physics. The program aims to give students at a critical point in their
education meaningful research experiences grounded in physics but with strong
links to other physical sciences, including electrical, mechanical, and computer
engineering, materials science, and chemistry. The specific components will
include 1) research experience working in groups with peers and senior
scientists on specific projects; 2) instruction in the culture, methods, and
ethics of scientific research; and 3) preparation for a future career in which
they will be interacting with colleagues coming from a wide range of
backgrounds: intellectual, educational, geographical and
cultural.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The core of the participants' experience will be
mentored research within individual research groups. The groups' interests span
the range of research in academic physics: from particle physics to biophysics
to condensed matter and materials physics to optical physics and photonics. The
faculty leading these individual research groups are distinguished scholars at
various stages of their careers, but all have experience mentoring
undergraduates. Carefully structured plenary activities will complement the
individual research experiences by developing skills and competencies important
to thriving as students, as researchers, and as professionals in a wide range of
potential future careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
