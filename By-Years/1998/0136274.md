0136274 Kaplan This three-year research project studies how people develop from
youth to aged in the traditional foraging and simple horticultural society of
the Tsimane, in Bolivia. The investigators will test predictions about age-
specific patterns of mortality, morbidity, functional status, skill, strength
and endurance focusing on the aging process and the elderly; will test
hypotheses about the attainments of social skills and social capital as well as
physical growth and strength as constraints on maturation and reproduction; and
will study the relation between life history characteristics of individuals and
the pattern of resource flows within and among families. The researchers include
two senior cultural anthropologists and five graduate and undergraduate students
from the University of New Mexico and UC-Santa Barbara. The study sample will
include ten Tsimane villages with a population of about 1,000 individuals. From
the larger sample three villages with a total population of about 250 persons
will be selected as a core sample for focused behavioral studies and monitoring.
Various measures of mortality, morbidity, anthropometry, strength, and skills
will be recorded as well as measures of time allocation, resource production and
food distribution, childrearing skills, social status, and human and social
capital. The data from this project will be important to a wide range of
scholars interested in understanding the universal and variable features of
human life histories under relatively traditional conditions, comparable to
those prevailing during the long history of selection during which the human
life course evolved.
