This U.S.-Poland Joint Cooperative Research on Chemistry of Phosphorous
Selenium Compounds is between Dr. Richard S. Glass of the University of Arizona
Tucson and Drs. Jan Michalski, and Aleksandra Skowronska of the Centre of
Molecular and Macromolecular Studies of the Polish Academy of Studies. The
researchers will develop the chemistry of selenophosphates, devise
chemoselective synthesis of organoselenium compounds as models for selective
introduction of selenium moieties into proteins and RNA's, and identification,
by comparison with authentic compounds, of P-Se compounds produced
enzymatically. The proposed international collaboration is mutually beneficial
because the Polish group's extensive experience and expertise in the difficult
synthesis of organophosphorus-selenium compounds is complemented by the
mechanistic and 77 NMR spectroscopic experience of the American group. This
collaboration will strengthen and broaden the research efforts and
infrastructure of the collaborating groups. The proposed chemoselective methods
for introducing selenium into biomolecules, if successful, would permit
introduction of the valuable 77Se NMR spectroscopic label. This label would
allow structure studies using NMR spectroscopy of these macromolecules (a
project in which the American group and Dr. T.C. Stadtman of NIH collaborate).
Such methodology would also facilitate synthesis of semisynthetic enzymes with
selenium at their active site with potentially new and useful catalytic
activities as well as synthesis of derivatives of biomolecules for
multiwavelength anomalous diffraction structural studies. This proposed research
in chemistry fulfills the program objectives of advancing science by enabling
leading experts in the U.S. and the Poland to combine complementary talents and
pool research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
