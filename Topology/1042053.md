In 1957, R. H. Fox and J. Milnor introduced the seminal idea that the
concordance class of the link of a singularity obstructs its removal. Both
concordance of knots, and the motivating goal of understanding singularities
remain central to topology and algebraic geometry. In the last 10 years we have
seen tremendous advances in our knowledge of knot and link concordance. The
introduction of the n-solvable filtration, by Cochran-Orr-Teichner, and the
subsequent work of many authors establishing the non-triviality of (half of) the
graded quotients has led to the realization that perhaps knot concordance is as
fully complicated as the fundamental group might allow. A conference will be
held at Wesleyan University, July 19-23, 2010, to bring together a variety of
researchers and students whose work connects to knot concordance.

Knot theory is the study of knotted curves in 3-space. The study of knotted
curves has important applications in biology and physics. A fundamental question
in knot theory and low-dimensional topology is when such a curve bounds a disk
in 4-space. This motivating question is the foundation for the study of knot
concordance. Knot concordance was born of the study of 4-manifolds and remains
its most accessible progeny.
