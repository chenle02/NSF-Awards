9318770 Jacobs Color vision is extremely valuable for discriminating objects and
yielding information about the contents of objects. Primates are often
considered to have the keenest sense of color among mammals, but we have data on
only about 20 of the roughly 200 non-human primate species. Recent findings show
that the distribution of two or three distinct photopigments, termed dichromacy
or trichromacy respectively, is far more complex than earlier understood, with a
genetic polymorphism in the types of pigment in the photoreceptor cone cells of
the eye, showing a striking gender difference in the squirrel monkey. This
project uses a portable, non-invasive set of electrophysiological and behavioral
tests to evaluate the correctness of emerging views on primate color vision and
its evolution. Species to be tested have been selected for particularly
appropriate comparisons to rigorously examine the generalization about high
individual variation among the group known as the New World monkeys, the
generalization about little variation and human-like properties of trichromacy
of the Old World monkeys, and to extend the very limited knowledge about the
prosimians which are a very important group for understanding the evolutionary
issues. The impact of these studies will continue to extend beyond visual
neuroscience into anthropology, molecular evolution, and genetics, and the
testing methodology may stimulate novel efficient tests for human adult and
infant visual capabilities. ***
