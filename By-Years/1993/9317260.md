ABSTRACT Proposal Number: CTS-9312760 P.I.: Rubner Institution: M.I.T. The
primary objective of this research is to develop the chemistry and nanoscale
processing techniques needed to control the molecular and supermolecular
organizations of electroactive conjugated polymers. This work is driven by the
notion that the unique optical and electrical properties of these fascinating
materials can be successfully tailored at the molecular level if suitable
techniques are developed to manipulate and control the manner in which they
organize in the solid state. To accomplish this goal, two new layer-by-layer
molecular self-assembly processes recently discovered in our laboratory will be
investigated; the self-assembly of conjugated polyions and the self-assembly of
the p-type doped conducting polymers. The ability to readily fabricate
multilayer thin films of conjugated polymers via molecular self-assembly
processes is expected to open up completely new vistas with regard to the thin
film processing of conducting polymers and related electoactive materials. In
addition, self-assembled films can be used to fabricated and examine new
heterostructure based thin film devices and sensors and to tailor the electrical
and optical properties of various surfaces at the molecular level. The
multilayer and heterostructure thin films fabricated with these new techniques
will be characterized and evaluated in the form of various technologically
relevant thin film devices such as thin film capacitors and Schottky light
emitting diodes.
