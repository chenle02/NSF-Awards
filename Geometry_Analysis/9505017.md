9505017 Dumas The proposed research is in the area of dynamical systems; in
particular, averaging and stability of Hamiltonian systems are to be
investigated. The investigator proposes to generalize Anosov's averaging theorem
to systems with more general hypotheses on the driving flow; proposes to apply
Lasker's frequency analysis to the study of transport in symplectic maps.
Hamiltonian systems arise in celestial mechanics, accelerator physics and
elsewhere in nature. The frequency analysis method, first developed by Lasker,
can be applied to a variety of such systems to detect long time instability. The
proposed research seeks to provide a rigorous theoretical framework for this
method.
