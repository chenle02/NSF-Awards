It is the purpose of this grant to establish a spectroscopic observatory at
South Pole Station using a Elbert-Fastie spectrometer and a Michelson
interferometer. These instruments will be used to study infrared and optical
emissions during the polar night. Particular emphasis will be placed on
understanding the effects of gravity waves, tides and planetary waves in the
mesosphere and lower thermosphere. It is also hoped that the investigator's
previous observations of helium emissions in the polar cusp over Svalbard can be
duplicated at South Pole and explained. The new South Pole instrumentation will
complement the similar observatory in Svalbard and also be a significant
addition to the existing complement of instruments at South Pole. This research
will be carried out by an undergraduate institution, and is supported by the
Research at Undergraduate Institution (RUI) initiative.
