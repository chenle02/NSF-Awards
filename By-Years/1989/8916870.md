The relationship between sedimentary process and stratigraphic response is
still poorly understood. As a result, the origin of stratigraphic parasequences,
the fundamental building block of most sedimentary basins, is still highly
controversial. We will examine the parasequences of the lower to Middle Cambrian
Carrara Formation, a larger-scale sequence which ranges laterally from shallow
marine carbonate to shallow marine (and possibly alluvial) siliciclastic
sediments. We will: 1) identify and correlate parasequences within the Carrara
Formation and its equivalents; 2) Characterize surfaces that bound parasequences
for information useful in determining the mode(s) of parasequence initiation and
termination; 3) Map specific facies within established parasequences to obtain
information on their thickness, geometry, and spatial distribution; 4) Describe
and interpret specific facies within parasequences to provide information on the
processes of sediment production and dispersal, water depths, paleoclimate, and
more local paleogeography. If the diversity and geometry of facies within
parasequences are delineated, then the mechanisms responsible for their
formation can be more accurately determined and, where possible, quantified.
This information could greatly refine models for paleogeography, water depths,
sea-level history, subsidence history, paleoclimate, and local or regional
tectonic events.
