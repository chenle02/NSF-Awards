CTS-931087074 Clemson University Douglas E. Hirt ABSTRACT Funds are provided
with this research equipment grant for a scanning probe microscope system. An
interfacial polymerization technique is to be explored as a basis for imaging
surface heterogeneities for improved production of low-cost, pitch-based carbon
fibers. High thermal conductivity carbon fibers and fiber-reinforced polymer
matrices will also be studied by scanning probe techniques. Materials
development continues to be vital strategic research area with broad
implications for industry. With thermal conductivities three times that of
copper, commercial carbon fibers can be used to pipe heat away in electronic
devices or integrated circuits. Fiber-reinforced polymer composites is a
promising material as components for orthopedic joint replacement and fracture
fixation. AUTOEXECBAT X J BURKA PRE dP #zs SAVERS j " ICONS j " LM Y
