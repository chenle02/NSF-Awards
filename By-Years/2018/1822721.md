"A request is made to fund new instrumentation for the R/V Oceanus, a 177?
research vessel operated by Oregon State University as part of the University-
National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet.

The R/V Oceanus is a general-purpose research vessel owned by the National
Science Foundation and operated by Oregon State University. The mission of the
ship is to support funded science research in the Pacific Northwest. R/V Oceanus
completed 215 days in 2017, 144 (67%) of which were for NSF. In 2018, the vessel
is scheduled to sail 176 days with 75% (132 days) of the schedule for NSF. With
this proposal, OSU provides technical descriptions and rationale for the
acquisition of the following Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment: 1) Blocks
with Load Monitoring $56,750

Broader Impacts The principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit
Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides
infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use
instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects
(which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of
NSF). The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation
allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working,
calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research,
and expanding the base of potential researchers.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
