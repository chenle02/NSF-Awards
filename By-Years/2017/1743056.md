This proposal is for support of a travel to The ACM Symposium on Cloud Computing
2017 (SoCC) is the eighth in an established series of symposia that bring
together researchers, developers, users, and practitioners interested in data
services and cloud computing.

ACM SoCC is today a dynamic and comprehensive program for publication,
education, and interaction. Its program includes research and industrial papers,
poster sessions, and keynote talks by leaders in academia and industry. The
scope of SoCC is broad and encompasses diverse data management and systems
topics such as software as a service, virtualization, scalable cloud data
services, and data management and analytics at scale. Many facets of systems and
data management issues must be revisited in the context of cloud computing.

This award provides a concrete opportunity to broaden participation. Funds will
be dispersed with preference given to students who would not otherwise be able
to attend the conference, paying particular attention to diversity.
