The principal investigators will study geometric scale- invariant elliptic
partial differential equations. Such equations arise naturally in many fields of
mathematics including topology, geometry , and mathematical physics. The three
specific areas of research supported by this award are Dirac type operators,
Yang- Mills equations, and curvature functionals. This award will support
research in the general area of differential geometry and global analysis.
Differential geometry is the study of the relationship between the geometry of a
space and analytic concepts defined on the space. Global analysis is the study
of the overall geometric and topological properties of a space by piecing
together local information. Applications of these areas of mathematics in other
sciences include the structure of complicated molecules, liquid-gas boundaries,
and the large scale structure of the universe.
