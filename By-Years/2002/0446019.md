Michael Jarstfer&lt;br/&gt;Proposal: 0446019 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Telomerase is
a remarkable nucleic acid polymerase that uses a portion of its integral RNA
subunit as a template for the synthesis of the 3' strand of DNA found at both
ends of linear eukaryote chromosomes. The product of telomerase activity is a
single strand of repetitive G-rich DNA that is part of a specialized
nucleoprotein complex called the telomere. The telomere functions by preventing
degradation and untoward recognition of the chromosome ends by the normal DNA
repair machinery. When telomerase activity is suppressed, telomeric DNA is not
maintained and each complete cell cycle results in increasingly shorter
telomeres. This telomere erosion is thought to function as a biological clock
that determines the extent of cellular proliferation. If cells continue to
divide in the absence of telomere maintenance, genetic instability and cell
death ensues. The role of telomeres in regulating cellular proliferation
suggests that understanding the mechanism of telomerase will have broad
implications. To further the understanding of telomerase, this project will
examine the salient features of the interactions between telomerase and the
chromosome using a multifaceted approach. The first objective of this project is
to examine the interaction between telomerase and synthetic chromosome models.
Techniques including electron microscopy, enzyme kinetics, and DNA footprinting
will be used to determine the global features of the telomerase-telomere
interaction. The second objective is to examine the interaction between
telomerase and a specialized structure of DNA called a G-quadruplex. Because the
G-rich DNA of the telomere can fold into G-quadruplex structures, it is
necessary to characterize the G-quadruplex-telomerase interaction to fully
comprehend the behavior of telomerase at the chromosome end. The final objective
is to characterize specific interactions at the individual nucleotide level
between the template of telomerase, which is contained in the middle of its RNA
subunit, and the telomeric DNA primer. Completing this objective will provide a
working model for primer alignment and extension during the telomerase reaction
cycle. The successful completion of this project will provide a comprehensive
view of the interaction between telomerase and the telomere and allow a more
complete comparison between the catalytic capabilities of telomerase and other
nucleic acid polymerases. The project also involves the training of
undergraduate and graduate students in the laboratory, as well as participation
in a summer program for undergraduate minorities.&lt;br/&gt;
