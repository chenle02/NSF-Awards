This grant supports the continuation of several research projects. One project
studies new issues in monopoly and oligopoly pricing that arise as firms come to
have more information about the purchasing habits of consumers. Previous work by
the PI studied the use of `upgrade discounts` by monopoly sellers of software,
and `buybacks` of old goods by sellers who want to prop up the price of a new
Improved version. The proposed work would study attempts by firms to `poach` the
current customers of their competitors by offering them special discounts or
other inducements to switch. The project will analyze equilibrium poaching both
with short term contracts and when long term contracts are practical; one
question will be the overall impact of this sort of price discrimination on
consumer welfare. A second project has developed equilibrium concepts for
extensive form games, based on the idea that players may persistently make
mistaken forecasts of how opponents would respond to actions that have never
been tried. Previous work studied the case where players have no information
about their opponents' payoff functions, and so are unable to make deductions
about how the opponents would respond to untried actions. The proposed work will
study the way that prior information about opponents' payoffs can restrict the
set of equilibrium outcomes. A key issue in this development is what sort of
prior information about payoffs should be considered.
