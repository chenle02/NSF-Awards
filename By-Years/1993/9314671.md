9314671 Nath This U.S.-Polish Workshop on "Physics from Planck Scale to
Electroweak Scale" will bring together leading particle physics will bring
together leading particle physicists from the U.S., Poland and other countries
to Warsaw from 16-20 September 1993. The workshop will cover the forefront
research areas of particle physics phenomenology, supersymmetry and string
theory. This grant supports the participation of 12 U.S. participants, with Dr.
Pran Nath of Northeastern University as principal investigator. There will be
corresponding support from the Polish side, with Dr. Tomasz Taylor as principal
investigator, and Dr. Stefan Pokorski, Director of the Institute of Theoretical
Physics of Warsaw University as co- organizer. This proposed research in high
energy physics fulfills the program objectives of advancing science by enabling
leading experts in the U.S. and Poland to combine complementary talents and pool
research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence. The
workshop will also be used to promote the interest of graduate and undergraduate
students in particle physics. ###
