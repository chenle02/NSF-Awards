This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will seek to
develop a novel technique for applying thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) to
turbine (jet) engine components. The use of low thermal conductivity TBCs has
enabled higher temperatures and longer component life to be achieved, along with
more efficient engine operation. Application of the state-of-the-art coating
compositions via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) has the potential for an order-
of-magnitude reduction in processing cost over the conventional technique
employed. In addition, CVD is a non-line-of-sight technique capable of coating
components and/or regions of components not possible by any other means

The next-generation TBC system to be developed in this project will provide
superior reduction in actual part temperature and oxidation resistance compared
with state-of-the-art coatings. In addition to the increased engine efficiency
realized from the higher temperature operation these coatings will allow, this
application method has the potential for an 80-90% reduction in cost. Improved
TBCs will have wide application to commercial and military propulsion and power
generation systems, including turbine and reciprocating engines.
