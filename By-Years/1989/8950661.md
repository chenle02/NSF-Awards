A computational chemistry facility has been established at Harvey Mudd College
which allows the offering of a laboratory course in quantum chemistry. Students
in chemistry and chemical physics have broad backgrounds in physics and
mathematics which make this course accessible. This course broadens the
undergraduate experience of students interested intheory and will acquaint
students having experimental interests with a range of theoretical methods that
are frequently used in the literature. In addition, several of the faculty have
theoretical components to their research which involve undergraduates. The
computational facility will greatly enhance the opportunities for theoretical
work by undergraduates in the areas of ab initio quantum chemistry, numerical
simulations of electrochemical processes, and statistical mechanics. The
institution is matching the NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.
