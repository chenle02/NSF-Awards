9318977 Tarboton Rainfall, runoff, erosion, mass movement, and sediment
transport are the physical processes that sculpture and form the landscape.
Geomorphological landforms are the signature of the action of hydrologic
processes on the landscape. Fluvial landscapes have a structural regularity that
has been quantified by Horton's and numerous other scaling laws. The ubiquity
and explanatory strength of these empirical relationships, even in diverse
geologic and climatic settings, suggests a deep universality and regularity in
fluvial landorms that goes beyond the details of the particular processes
involved. The objective is a quantitative understanding of the relationship
between processes and form in landscapes at scales ranging from single
hillslopes to complete river basins and investigate the relationship between
scaling properties and the general form of geomorphic processes. This
relationship will be investigated using numerical modeling together with careful
analysis of field data where geomorphological processes have been quantified.
