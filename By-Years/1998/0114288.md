This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is designed to
contribute to better and more efficient management of a part of our natural
resources. Current analyses of fish stocks (by National Marine Fisheries Service
and several state departments of fish &amp; game) are unnecessarily expensive,
time-consuming and inaccurate. Ultimately, this contributes to compromised
Government resource management policy-making. The result is the risk of over
fishing and considerable economic damage. Via research and development this
project will produce a prototype integrated 'plug &amp; play' system to automate
these analyses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The developed system will be marketed first
to the several dozens of U. S. federal and state agencies having a need for it,
and thereby will help to establish more precise measurement standards that will
be accepted by the worldwide community. The subsequent result of worldwide
marketing activity will benefit the fish management and research activities in
more than 20 countries, and solidify the U. S. developed and promulgated
standards and measurement techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
