It is proposed to study the scattering of spin-polarized electrons from atomic
targets, both in the ground state and in metastable excited states. In this way
one can probe the spin- dependent properties of collision systems. One
manifestation is the five structure effect, which results in asymmetric
scattering of polarized electrons by unpolarized atoms, even when relativistic
effects in the collision are negligible. It is planned to investigated the
asymmetry in a series of noble gases from Ne to Xe, allowing an assessment of
the relativistic versus five structure effects as target Z increases.
