Tubulin plays a crucial role in morphogenesis as the primary component of
microtubules. We propose to address two basic questions about these important
structural proteins using the four a-tubulins of Drosophila: are any of the
a-tubulin isotypes functionally specialized, and what regulatory mechanisms are
responsible for achieving the correct ratios and concentrations of a-tubulins
isotypes in each cell type? The multifunctionality of each a-tubulin isotype
will be tested by determining the ability of one isotype to rescue developmental
defects associated with mutations in another isotype. Transgenic strains
carrying ectopic copies of each a-tubulin gene and mutations in two of the a-
tubulins are available. An attempt will be made to generate mutations in the two
remaining genes using P-element mutagenesis and PCR, an approach that allows the
recovery of mutations with no detectable phenotype. Regulatory mechanisms
operating to maintain tissue-appropriate a-tubulin pools will be identified by
examining the ability of cells to 1) eliminate misexpressed a-tubulin isotypes
produced from chimeric genes, and 2) respond to overexpression of appropriate
isotypes from supernumerary tubulin genes. Genes encoding transacting a-tubulin
regulatory factors will be sought by reverting the female sterility associated
with overexpression of a maternal tubulin. The protein tubulin is an important
structural component of most types of cells. It exists in a number of different
forms, some present in all cells, others present only in certain specialized
types of cells. The different forms of tubulin presumably serve different
functions, but very little is known about what these functions are. This is a
proposal to investigate the different functions of the different forms of
tubulin.
