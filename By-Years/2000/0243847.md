The University of Arizona continues operating a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) Site. The REU Site utilizes electron microscopy, optical
characterization and other microanalytical tools as common thread in several
research projects on materials synthesis and processing. Eight undergraduate
students are recruited every year for a ten-week summer research experience,
with a recruitment focus on undergraduates from underrepresented groups. In
addition to participating in individual research projects, REU students take a
one-week course on electron microscopy or optical characterization, attend a
workshop on ethics in research, and participate in group social activities. The
REU Site includes a Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) component. Eight
teachers are recruited every year for a six-week summer research
experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The REU Site also has an international
component by which two returning undergraduates and two returning teachers spend
four weeks in one of the laboratories at the Thailand National Science and
Technology Development Agency. Teachers that go to Thailand spend two more weeks
in the RET experience than those who stay in the US. Undergraduates and teachers
participate in one of four collaborative research projects between US and Thai
senior investigators.&lt;br/&gt;
