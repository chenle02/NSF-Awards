A conference, "Ribosome Synthesis" will be held September 21-25, 1988 at Cold
Spring Harbor. The organizers, Drs. James Friesan, Lasse A. Lindahl, Edward A.
Morgan, J. Warner, and Janice M. Zengel have put together eight plenary
sessions, each with a specific objective, relating to all aspects ranging from
transcription to assembly in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic ribosome synthesis;
i.e., the biology of the system. The fact that ribosomes, genetics, and
synthesis are studied in a variety of organisms has actually hindered
communication within the field. Hopefully, the integration of all aspects will
foster the interchange of ideas that will serve to focus models of ribosome
synthesis in all species. The expected attendance is approximately 300
scientists from here and abroad.
