The use of laser technology in modern chemical research will be demonstrated
through hands-on experimentation by undergraduate chemistry and chemical
engineering students. Five experiments utilizing the laser system are planned.
These experiments illustrate the applicability of laser techniques in
photochemical kinetic studies and spectroscopy: Time-resolved emission spectrum
of a donor-acceptor exciplex; two-photon molecular excitation; multiphoton
ionization spectroscopy of molecular Rydberg states; laser optical
characterization of electrode surfaces; and laser induced fluorescence in trace
analysis. Inclusion of these experiments into the instructional laboratory
program promotes the goal of providing hands-on experience for chemistry
undergraduates with state-of-the-art laboratory equipment at the forefront of
modern chemical research. This ILI award from the Chemistry Shared
Instrumentation Program will help the Department of Chemistry at Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute (RPI) to acquire laser instrumentation that will be used
to enhance undergraduate laboratory instruction.
