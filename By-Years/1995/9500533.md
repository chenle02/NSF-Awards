This award supports mathematical research involving quadratic and hermitian
forms defined over the integers of algebraic number fields, their connections in
algebraic geometry, and Fuchsian groups and the related hyperbolic geometry.
There are two specific goals of this research. The first is to determine
necessary and sufficient conditions for the local primitive representation of
one form by another integral quadratic form. The second is to study analogues
for hermitian forms of Milnor's theorem on the classification and structure of
unimodular indefinite quadratic forms over the rational integers. This research
falls into the general mathematical area of number theory. Number theory has its
historical roots in the study of the whole numbers, addressing such questions as
those dealing with the divisibility of one whole number by another. It is among
the oldest branches of mathematics and was pursued for many centuries for purely
aesthetic reasons. However, within the last half century it has become an
indispensable tool in diverse applications in areas such as data transmission
and processing, and communication systems.
