This starter grant award of the Chemistry Division to the University of
Pennsylvania supports the research of Professor Marisa C. Kozlowski. The theme
of the research is the asymmetric synthesis of alpha-amino acids by transition-
metal catalyzed hydroformylation of imines. Both diastereo- and enantioselective
variants are proposed. Multistep reactions involving sequential alkene
hydroformylation, imine formation, and imine hydroformylation will be performed
using a single catalyst. Mechanistic studies will elucidate the course of the
reactions and aid in the design of appropriate catalyst systems. The successful
development of the synthetic process studied here represents a significant
improvement over existing methods in that a large number of chiral amino acids
can be produced inexpensively from readily available starting materials. Such
materials are important in catalysis and asymmetic synthesis.
