0329581&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: SENSORS: ALOHA Mooring Sensor
Network and Adaptive Sampling&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project Summary&lt;br/&gt;
The PIs propose to develop a moored deep-ocean sensor network that will first be
installed at the Hawaii Ocean Time-series (HOT)/ALOHA Observatory (AO) and then
at other cabled observatory sites as they are implemented. This moored sensor
network is based on a profiler that will move between near-surface and fixed
abyssal sensors under program control. The PIs feel that this project will
demonstrate the scientific potential of combining adaptive sampling methods with
a moored series of profiling sensors. The PIs will also develop optimization
software tools to maximize overall information return given the constraints of
competing scientific objectives, the continually changing environment that will
be observed, and the physical limitations of the observing sensors and network.
The power and two-way real time communications capability provided by the
recently funded cabled ALOHA Observatory is essential to the sampling
improvements and sensor network proposed here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
