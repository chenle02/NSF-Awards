This award supports a postdoctoral researcher to study the coupling between
tropospheric disturbances, such as hurricanes and tropical depressions, and the
lower thermosphere/ionosphere region. The objective of the research is three-
fold: 1) Observe possible effects of hurricanes and tropical depressions on the
F-region ionosphere, 2) Ascertain whether the tropical storms produce observable
gravity wave propagation into the thermosphere, and 3) Determine if gravity
waves or electric fields are more likely to produce F-region disturbances. The
approach is to assemble a database of F-region measurements coincident with
storm occurrence. The study will use ionosonde and incoherent scatter radar
measurements made at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico. After assembling
the database, the data will be analyzed for F-region disturbances, the relative
position and strength of any associated tropical storm, and variations in
F-region density and electric fields. Understanding the coupling between the
ionosphere and other atmospheric regions contributes to knowledge of space
weather and its impacts on technical systems.
