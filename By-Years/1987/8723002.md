Professor Sally will pursue research in Commutative Algebra on topics related
to the theory of local rings and their singularities. The research will also
draw from and contribute to the theory of surfaces and higher dimensional
varieties in Algebraic Geometry. The primary topics will include the search for
finiteness criteria for birationally equivalent local domains and criteria for
analytic irreducibility. The goal is the extension (to higher dimension and to
more general setting) of some of Zariski's theorems on birational extensions and
integrally closed ideals. Professor Sally will teach one undergraduate course in
algebra each semester, actively participate in graduate student and faculty
seminars in algebra and give lectures, informal talks and counseling to the
organizations at Purdue which are concerned with the role of women in science.
This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to provide
opportunities for women to advance their careers in engineering and in the
disciplines of science supported by NSF and (2) to encourage women to pursue
careers in science and engineering by providing greater visibility for women
scientists and engineers employed in industry, government, and academic
institutions. By encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a
valuable investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality.
