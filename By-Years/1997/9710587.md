9710587 Serrano This is an award to support research on the role of transient
factors that affect the flow and dispersion of contaminants in contaminated
aquifers. The investigator plans to consider factors that are normally excluded
in formulation of mathematical expressions to describe contaminant dispersion.
The factors that will be considered include assumption that the formation is
subjected to recharge, the water table is unstable, boundary conditions are not
negligible and fluctuations as well as normality of hydraulic conductivity are
affected by dispersion especially as they relate to contaminant penetration of
the saturated from the unsaturated zone by contaminants from non point sources.
Results of this project are expected to improve our understanding of the
variability of large-scale contaminant dispersion in aquifers attributable to
many conditions not now capable of being considered by existing mathematical
formulations. This knowledge may be directly applied to engineering design of
systems for decontamination of groundwater already contaminated and may also
have applicability to considering prevention of the pollution of aquifers by
contaminants from nonpoint sources. ***
