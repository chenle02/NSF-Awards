9317986 MacIntyre This research investigates the vertical circulation of
phytoplankton by turbulent motions over diurnal cycles and how this circulation
affects photosynthetic rates. It also investigates the relative importance of
nutrient supply to the euphytic zone via diapycnal mixing and horizontal
exchanges. The project comprises time-series measurements of vertical mixing and
horizontal exchange coupled with estimates of photosynthetic rates and profiles
of nutrient concentrations taken over the same periods. %%% This study will
provide the first systematic analysis of vertical mixing in which turbulence
dynamics are directly measured and related to the light environment of
phytoplankton. These data, coupled with information to be gathered on the
dynamics of nutrient movement, will permit proper analysis of resource-based
models of primary productivity, nutrient competition, and phytoplankton
succession. The results of this research will have applications in analysis of
ecosystem function and health and aquatic pollution monitoring. ***
