This Research Opportunities for Women Research Planning Grant is in the area of
bioinorganic chemistry. During the twelve month period beginning 15 May 1989,
Professor Janet Morrow will conduct preliminary experiments on the Zn(II)
catalyzed hydrolysis of phosphate diesters that are models for biologically
important molecules. These experiments, which will be conducted collaboratively
with one undergraduate and one graduate research student, should provide the
preliminary data that is necessary for the Principal Investigator to develop a
competitive full research proposal and lead to the establishment of a viable,
independent research program in her laboratory at SUNY at Buffalo. The research
area that is to be explored in this project is broadly important in biological
chemistry, particularly in the characterization of ribonucleic acids (RNAs). The
results of this work could lead to the development of new reagents for RNA
sequencing.
