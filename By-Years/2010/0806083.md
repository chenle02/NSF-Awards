The project is providing 30 scholarships each year to science, technology,
engineering, and mathematics (STEM) majors as well as providing tutorial
assistance, faculty mentorship, academic advising, and enrichment activities.

Intellectual Merit: The project is increasing the number of students enrolling
in STEM programs. The scholarships encourage students to choose these majors and
help to retain them through graduation or transfer. The project incorporates
strategies and methods to promote teaching, training, and learning; broaden
participation of underrepresented groups; foster integration of research and
education; provide opportunities for researchers, educators, and students to
engage in joint efforts; infuse education with the excitement of discovery; and
enrich education through the diversity of learner perspectives.

Broader Impacts: This project impacts the recipients and the community as a
whole through improved education for students in the stated disciplines;
increased retention of students to degree achievement; strengthened partnerships
between institutions of higher education and related employment sectors; and
improved professional development and employment/further higher education
placement of participating students.
