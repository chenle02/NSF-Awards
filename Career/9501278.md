9501278 Edelman This work is supported by a National Science Foundation Faculty
Early Career Development Award. The research component will focus on the
application of new geometrical ideas to analyze and improve numerical
algorithms. Part of the program will involve the derivation and study of an
optimization technique on the Grassman manifold suitable for solving the Kohn-
Sham equations of the local density approximation to Schroedinger's equation
used in condensed matter physics and in materials science. The second part of
the program involves the application of singularity theory to analyze and
explain the behavior of certain numerical algorithms widely used in eigensystem
analysis and systems and control. The education component will include further
development of a new course in scientific computing at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology. Computers with a projection system will be used in
undergraduate and graduate courses in numerical analysis and applied mathematics
in order to bring new insights into the material. Mentoring and training of new
researchers will also take place and will integrate the research and educational
activities. The National Science Foundation strongly encourages the early
development of academic faculty as both educators and researchers. The Faculty
Early Career Development (CAREER) Program is a Foundation- wide program that
provides for the support of junior faculty within the context of their overall
career development. It combines in a single program the support of quality
research and education in the broadest sense and the full participation of those
traditionally underrepresented in science and engineering. This program enhances
and emphasizes the importance the Foundation places on the development of full,
balanced academic careers which include both research and education.
