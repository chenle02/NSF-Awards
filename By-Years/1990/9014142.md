Under this award Professor Isao Ishibashi, Department of Civil Engineering, Old
Dominion University, will spend 12 months conducting research at the Port and
Harbour Research Institute, Ministry of Transport, Yokosuka, Japan. His
counterparts are Drs. Setsuo Noda and Tatsuo Uwabe. Shaking table experiments
will be conducted in order to investigate the validity of the "generalized
apparent seismic coefficient" theory, developed by the principal investigator
and coworkers, which may be used to estimate dynamic soil and water pressures
against marine retaining structures under stress by adequately taking into
account the role of liquified backsoil and pore water on dynamic lateral earth
pressure. These investigations will utilize the excellent shaking table
facilities of the seismic damage records. This work will contribute to the
design of safer port facilities and marine structures. The visit will commence
on January 1, 1992.
