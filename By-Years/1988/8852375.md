Williams College will purchase equipment to establish mineral separation and
uranium-lead geochemistry laboratories. These laboratories will be used for
undergraduate research projects in geochronology, and to improve instruction in
several undergraduate geology courses. The mineral separation equipment will be
used to concentrate heavy minerals from sediments and sedimentary rock and to
isolate fossils in courses in geomorphology, paleontology, and sedimentology.
Together with the equipment for carrying out U-Pb geochemistry it will be used
in courses in tectonics and geochronology to illustrate the principles of
isotopic dating. The NSF grant of $16,898 for equipment will be matched by an
equal amount of funds from Williams College. In addition, Williams College is
providing approximately $50,000 in funds for building renovation to accommodate
the new equipment.
