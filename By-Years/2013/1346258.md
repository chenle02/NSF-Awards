This Early concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) will develop a new and
potentially powerful approach to determining the extent and rate of internal
decay in living trees, without having to cut them down. Two portable versions of
equipment similar to CAT scanners will be used to create images of stem cross-
sections. These images will be used to estimate the total amount of carbon lost
to decay over the lifetime of the tree. The project will focus on the three
principal northern hardwood species: sugar maple, yellow birch, and American
beech.

This project will involve the collaboration of two forest pathologists who have
complementary backgrounds and expertise in forestry, forest ecology and
mycology. Two student interns from the Stockbridge School of Agriculture
Internship program will be trained. The lead scientists have responsibilities
for public outreach and will extend results to forest ecologists, arborists and
urban foresters. Data will contribute to the development of forest management
strategies aimed at mitigating the effects of increased atmospheric carbon
dioxide. Results will also be used in displays and presentations at local
science museums, schools and public events.
