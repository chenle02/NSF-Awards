This grant supports a broad range of research in subatomic theory.
&lt;br/&gt;Work in four particular directions will receive NSF support, two each
&lt;br/&gt;by the PI and co-PI. However, these two researchers have interests in
&lt;br/&gt;each other's work, so collaboration between the two is possible in
any &lt;br/&gt;of these topics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lebed and a collaborator
will analyze the excited states of baryons &lt;br/&gt;(such as protons and
neutrons) using a new formalism that has been &lt;br/&gt;developed for studying
these short-lived states. He will also work to &lt;br/&gt;uncover the nature of
patterns among the measured parameters from the &lt;br/&gt;masses and mixing of
neutrinos, particles that emerge from both nuclear &lt;br/&gt;reactors and the
sun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Belitsky will continue developing an approach to
discern the most &lt;br/&gt;detailed possible information about the interior
structure of protons, &lt;br/&gt;neutrons, and other strongly-interacting
particles. He will also &lt;br/&gt;pursue his studies of a hidden symmetry that
helps to shed light on the &lt;br/&gt;fundamental nature of quantum field
theories with strong interactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant will provide
not only support to the PI and co-PI, but a &lt;br/&gt;postdoctoral research
associate as well. Such a group of critical mass &lt;br/&gt;should be much more
effective not only in producing published results, &lt;br/&gt;but also for
disseminating our research findings as broadly as
&lt;br/&gt;possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
