9313838 Wu In this project, computer models are developed for predicting noise
levels inside a moving vehicle passenger compartment. Using these models,
engineers are able to optimize vehicle design alternatives, and improve interior
noise comfort level. The investigation provide a better understanding of the
physics involved in sound generation and transmission mechanisms due to random
acoustics, vibrations, and turbulent boundary-layer excitations. In addition,
the results form a useful input to the development of design criteria for
vehicle panel structures, sub-structures, and joint connections in order to
minimize vibration and sound transmission into the passenger compartment.
Coupled with vehicle structure and aerodynamic models, the acoustic models from
this research project form a powerful design tool for accurately simulating the
sound field inside a moving vehicle, and identifying the parameters that play a
critical role in both vehicle pass-by noise radiation and noise levels within
the passenger compartment. *** v s t $ $ ( F / 1 Times Symbol " Helvetica 5
