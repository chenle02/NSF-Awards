This proposal from the University of Arizona requests support toenhance the
planning of a Science and Technology Center on GlobalChange. The Center's
research, education, and outreachactivities would focus on the sensitivity of
dry regions of theEarth's surface to global change, particularly in climate
andatmospheric composition. The character of the research wouldinvolve a level
of integration of scientific activity beyondtraditional scientific departments.
Cross disciplinarycooperation in many fields, especially biology and geophysics,
isanticipated. The Planning Grant activity will refine the research
strategy,identify the personnel and resources needed, including those fromother
institutions and agencies, and establish the necessaryinstitutional and
individual commitments to the proposed Center. Given the pressing need for
better understanding of the linksbetween global change and conditions in arid
and surroundingregions, this research would address both a national
andinternational concern.
