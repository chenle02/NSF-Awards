This project is awarding scholarships to academically talented and financially
needy students and is supporting the scholars through a variety of structures
and programs. This project builds on a successful CSEMS project and is
supporting students in computer science, mathematics, physics, or the
geosciences. The student scholars are participating in a number of student
support services already in existence on campus. In addition, several new
initiatives are being implemented through this project. Students are required to
submit an Academic Success Plan each semester to ensure they are on track to
graduation and they are participating in faculty and peer mentoring activities
throughout the academic year. Scholars enroll in a one-credit course designed to
integrate geoscience topics with computer science, mathematics, and physics,
during three semesters of their participation in the program. The success of the
project is being rigorously assessed through quantitative and qualitative
measures.
