The PIs propose to investigate the causes of highway accidents. The PIs will
develop fault trees based on the databases of state and national organizations.
From these data the PIs will determine causal relationships among the vehicle
features, driver behavior, and accident occurrence. Finally, guidelines will be
generated for vehicle design modifications based upon the driver errors
identified as most frequently as being a cause of accidents. The PIs will join
with the General Motors Research Laboratories on this Private Sector Research
Initiative.
