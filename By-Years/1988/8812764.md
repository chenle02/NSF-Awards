The Ozark Mountains of Missouri and Arkansas are an interesting physiographic
region possessing a rich and diverse fauna and flora. The Reis Biological
Station is positioned strategically to become the primary biological field
station for studying the ecosystems of the Ozark. However, the inadequacy of the
Station's current laboratory facilities is hindering research at the site. this
project will fund renovations to the laboratory to house aquatic organisms, and
to provide work space for ecological research. These facilities will be utilized
by research scientists from the Reis Biological Station consortium and from
throughout the nation.
