This project explores new locomotion techniques that will
enable&lt;br/&gt;robotic systems to recover from a variety of failures. The
primary&lt;br/&gt;focus is on a class of robot locomotion termed dynamically
coupled&lt;br/&gt;locomotion. The most familiar forms of locomotion, such as
human&lt;br/&gt;walking or automobile rolling, employ kinematic coupling.
But&lt;br/&gt;locomotory systems are subject to error conditions such as falling
or&lt;br/&gt;becoming high-centered. Recovery from such errors sometimes
requires&lt;br/&gt;locomotion modes that, while less efficient, are nonetheless
essential&lt;br/&gt;to the robustness and overall competence of the robotic
system. One&lt;br/&gt;example would be a six-legged robot that has become high-
centered on&lt;br/&gt;an obstacle such that its legs no longer reach the ground
-- by&lt;br/&gt;aggressively moving its legs it is possible to excite vibration
modes&lt;br/&gt;that cause the robot to gradually move off of the obstacle.
The&lt;br/&gt;specific goal of this project is to explore the theoretical
and&lt;br/&gt;practical capabilities of such locomotion modes, to survey
their&lt;br/&gt;potential application in mobile robotic systems, and to
demonstrate&lt;br/&gt;their usefulness in real robots. The main theoretical
thrust of the&lt;br/&gt;work is to characterize the motion capabilities of
dynamically coupled&lt;br/&gt;locomotion, and to synthesize motion patterns for
mobile robots to&lt;br/&gt;recover from errors. Experimental and simulation work
will serve to&lt;br/&gt;demonstrate and validate the research. Surveys of mobile
robot&lt;br/&gt;structures and failure modes will provide context and grounding
to&lt;br/&gt;assess the potential usefulness of the
work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
