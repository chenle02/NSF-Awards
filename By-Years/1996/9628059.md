9628059 Brune In this project, an instrument to measure tropospheric hydroxyl
and hydroperoxyl radicals will be tested, improved, and deployed both on the
ground and from the NASA DC-8 aircraft. This instrument , based on laser induced
fluorescence in a detection chamber at low pressure, is the product of several
years of development and field testing under NSF and NASA support. The
instrument is now sensitive and specific enough for measurements of these
radicals throughout the troposphere. The primary goal of this research is to
better understand tropospheric oxidation from the surface to the upper
troposphere. Another goal is to understand the low mixing ratios of hydroperoxyl
radical measured in earlier field campaigns. In addition, a new channel will be
developed and added to the instrument which will measure the total chemical loss
rate of hydroxyl radical. This part will consist of a discharge flow kinetics
system and a hydroxyl detection axis, which will receive a small portion of the
UV laser light from the main part of the instrument. Results from this total OH
loss rate measurement will be compared to the sum of the products of reaction
rate coefficients and measured hydrocarbons to test the accuracy of currently
used chemical models and reaction rates. Different filters on the instrument
inlet will allow some speciation of the reactants. ***
