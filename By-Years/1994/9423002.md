9423002 Farrar Research in theoretical particle physics will be centered on two
broad areas in quantum field theory. The first area is in computer studies of
quantum chromodynamics, whose equations are believed to describe the strong
forces among elementary particles. The second area is in the description of the
symmetries between elementary particles and how they evolve as a function of
time. One of the key problems addressed in the second approach is the generation
of the asymmetry between matter and antimatter in the early universe. ***
