Technical abstract Detection of specific nucleic acid (NA) sequences is crucial
to infectious disease diagnostics, genetic screening for hereditary diseases,
personalized medicine, criminology, paternity disputes, and animal and plant
breeding, among many other applications. Although polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) technology, coupled with oligonucleotide array chips, has enabled specific
identification of multiple sequences present in a sample at very low copy
number, this method requires added labels and reagents to detect the target NA.
These labels and the hardware (e.g., optics) required to sense them
significantly increase the analysis time, cost, and footprint of devices for
detecting specific NA sequences. As an alternative to current approaches, this
project will develop novel nanopores capable of detecting pathogenic nucleic
acids with single molecule resolution. These nanopores will be fabricated in
silicon and will be engineered to contain beads labeled with complementary NA
sequences. Binding of target oligonucleotides to the beads will result in the
change of electrophoretic properties and will lead to nanopores becoming
occluded by the beads. This event will be detected electrochemically for binary
yes/no readout of the target NA.

Non-technical abstract There is a need to develop simple and inexpensive methods
for detecting pathogens for medical or food safety applications. This proposal
will develop a new approach based on small pores containing beads. The beads
will react to pathogen biomarkers, will clog the pores and will result in the
change of electrical current. This method is envisioned to have improved
sensitivity and be simpler than the current approaches.
