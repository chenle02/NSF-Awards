This project will upgrade the content knowledge and teaching skills in the
physical and earth sciences of elementary school teachers. The project will
provide basic training for elementary school teachers and also produce leaders
from each of 24 elementary schools. Phase I consists of an intensive four-week
summer workshop. Phase II includes three all-day sessions on Saturdays during
the following academic year. In addition, the project staff will visit
classrooms of participant teachers at least once during each semester. Phase III
will focus on the training of teacher leaders. Phases I and II are designed to
help teachers that want and need help with their science background and skills.
Phase III is designed to recognize and develop those teachers who are already
knowledgeable and deserve additional support. These teacher leaders will serve
as on-site resource persons for their respective schools, providing assistance
to other teachers.
