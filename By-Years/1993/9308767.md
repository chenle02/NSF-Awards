In accordance with an Agreement between NSF and NOAA, an interagency transfer of
funds will establish a project office to manage and advance planning activities
in support of the Inter- American Institute for Global Change Research (IAI). An
Agreement establishing the Institute was signed 13 May 1992 by the U.S. and ten
additional countries. IAI will become operational once six countries have
ratified and signed the Agreement. The IAI initiative was launched by the U.S.
and there is a high level of interest in supporting coordinated science
activities with developing countries in the Western Hemisphere. A project office
is essential to the successful coordination of science planning, education, and
training activities, especially in light of the broad, interdisciplinary
research agenda envisioned for the Institute. This funding action will establish
a cooperative agreement between NSF/GEO and NOAA/Office of Global Programs (OGP)
for the joint management of the project office that will be located at NOAA.
