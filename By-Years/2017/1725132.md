US-Japan Collaboration in Computational Neuroscience, Osaka, November 29-30,
2011&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a workshop, led by Hiroaki
Matsunami and Izumi Ohzawa, on US-Japan collaboration in computational
neuroscience. The workshop builds on the interests of multiple NSF directorates
and NIH institutes, and Japan's National Institute of Information and
Communications Technology (NICT) and Center for Information and Neural Networks,
in this rapidly developing area of research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop
will explore the intellectual opportunities, broader impacts, and practical
considerations needed for US-Japan collaboration to be successful. It will be
attended by researchers and government representatives from the US and Japan. A
report from the workshop will be made available at http://www.nsf.gov/crcns.
