This award provides partial support for a joint U.S.-China workshop on
photoinduced charge transfer. The topic of the workshop is an important one,
both from the point of view of basic science and technology, underpinning both
the imaging and the photographic industries. China has made rapid scientific
progress in the topic of the workshop, and it is hoped that this meeting will
expand longer term research collaboration in this field. The organizer on the US
side is Dr. David Whitten, Director of the NSF Center for Photoinduced Charge
Transfer at the University of Rochester; on the Chinese side the organizer is
Professor Yi Cao, Director of the CAS Institute of Photographic Chemistry.
