The goal of the project is the analysis of mathematical models described by
nonlinear partial differential equations describing liquid crystal and
superconducting materials, focusing on thin liquid crystal films, ferro-electric
liquid crystal materials, polar-modulated liquid crystal materials such as bent-
core fibers, and high-temperature superconducting materials. The investigators
identify qualitative features of solutions to the mathematical models describing
these phenomena, including pattern formation of various phases of the materials
and the location, nature, and number of defects. The models are highly nonlinear
and expressed in terms of nonconvex, second-order energies. Developing methods
in partial differential equations to analyze these features is part of the
project.

The project is related to applications in materials. For example, physicists
have proposed to build lattices of colloidal particles by coating each with a
thin film of liquid crystal material in such a way that the film's defects act
as natural bonding sites (i.e., chemical linking locations) between the
particles. This self-assembly allows the creation of functionalized micron-sized
objects similar to the molecules characteristic of organic chemistry, which can
be used for particle-based bioassays and catalysis, and for photonic band-gap
materials. Ferro-electric liquid crystals are used to make optical switches,
nano-devices, and displays. Liquid crystal bent-core fibers have been proposed
by physicists to model artificial muscles and other biological applications.
High-temperature superconductors are used for small-scale sensors such as squids
(superconducting quantum interference detectors) and to make powerful magnets.
The project takes up the mathematical investigation of models for these
applications.
