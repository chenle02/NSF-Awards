This research project in low-dimensional topology develops tools for classifying
three-dimensional spaces as well as surfaces and knotted curves within them.
Applications of these topological objects range from exploring the possible
shapes of the three-dimensional spatial universe we live in to understanding the
knotting of polymers and DNA. These three-dimensional objects are studied by
analyzing certain invariant properties which capture essential characteristics
of the objects. A successful family of such invariants, which has lead to
numerous applications since it was first developed two decades ago, is called
Heegaard Floer homology. The definition of Heegaard Floer homology draws on
sophisticated techniques from multiple fields, including topology, geometry, and
analysis. This project aims to reformulate some of these invariants in a way
that both sheds light on their underlying structure and also provides
computational tools and leads to new applications. In particular, the PI aims to
translate bordered Heegaard Floer invariants for 3-manifolds with boundary,
which take the form of complicated algebraic objects, into geometric objects
built from collections of curves in a surface.

This project focuses on the structure of Heegaard Floer homology with the goal
to extend and better understand the Topological Quantum Field Theory (TQFT)-like
structure in Heegaard Floer theory and to apply it to problems in low-
dimensional topology. First, the PI aims to extend the earlier results to the
stronger ?minus? version of Heegaard Floer homology, which carries more
information and also has interesting connections to four-dimensional invariants.
The PI will also consider the case of manifolds with higher genus boundary or
with multiple boundary components. In a related direction, the PI will explore
the behavior of invariants for knots under the satellite operation and
concordance. A long-term goal is to study the Fukaya categories of symmetric
products of surfaces and morphisms between them, finding practical geometric
descriptions of these objects which fit into a description of Heegaard Floer
homology as a (2+1+1)-dimensional Topological Quantum Field Theory.
