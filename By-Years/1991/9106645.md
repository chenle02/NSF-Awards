The production and maintenance of reliable software require powerful and
rigorous analysis methods. Analysis techniques for sequential systems have
generally suffered from limited applicability or computational intractability.
Analysis of concurrent software is even more difficult. In a previous project
supported by the NSF, a toolset automating the constrained expression techniques
for analyzing concurrent software systems was constructed. Experiments with that
toolset have shown that it is capable of analyzing systems that approach
realistic sizes for designs of concurrent systems. This project will involve
efforts to extend the range of questions that the constrained expression toolset
can address and to increase the size of the systems it can handle. This will
involve theoretical work on the constrained expression formalism and analysis
techniques and the modification of the existing toolset.
