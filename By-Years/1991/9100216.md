This project deals with the design, analysis and implementation of massively
parallel algorithms for a broad class of stochastic programming problems. The
developed algorithms will be used to solve models that arise in mortgage-based
financing in the banking industry, asset/liability management for insurance and
pension fund companies, hydroelectric power scheduling and transportation
planning. The Union Bank of Switzerland is cosponsoring the project.
