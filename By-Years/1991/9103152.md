In this project, the Principal Investigator will continue studies of internal
waves in coastal regions, particularly their generation and instability. In the
first task, current meter data will be analyzed to determine statistics of the
distribution of Richardson Number, and relate it to turbulent dissipation. In
the second task, a numerical model will be used to study the generation of
internal waves by moving wind stress patterns.
