The University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) proposes the establishment of a Center
for Materials Science. Researchers at the Center will form Multidisciplinary
teams to study: (a) The Corrosive Wear of Iron, Nickel, and Chromium Alloys; (b)
The Chemistry of Nonplanar Aromatics; and (c) Silicon Transition Metal Materials
and Complexes. Each team will conduct research on the chemistry and physics of
materials. The studies will include investigations of phenomena and structures
in surfaces, interfaces between different media, and developing atomic-level
models of fracture and other modes of metallic failure. The Center will also be
used to motivate minority students at all educational levels to consider careers
in science and engineering. In addition, the Center will develop strategies to
strengthen partnerships with industry and other major research institutions.
This project meets the major goal of the Minority Research Centers of Excellence
(MRCE) program: to increase the minority presence in science and engineering by
making substantial resources available to upgrade the research capabilities of
the most productive minority institutions. The project will at the same time
enable this institution to use research as a tool to increase the effectiveness
of related science and engineering activities for minority groups in its region.
The Center will accomplish this by providing opportunities for faculty and
students at UTEP and other nearby institutions with sizable minority student
enrollments to engage in meritorious research that leads to publications in
refereed journals.
