Computational geometry has provided efficient algorithms for geometric problems
in several applied areas including graphics, robotics, CAD, and geographic data
processing. The project continues studying these problems and explores new areas
where computational geometry can play an important role. Work on problems
involving arrangements of surfaces, dynamic data structures, geometric
optimization, interaction detection, and multi-dimensional searching is pursued.
There is a special emphasis on higher dimensional problems.
