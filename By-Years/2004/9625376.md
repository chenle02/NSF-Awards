Dr. David A. Atwood, Department of Chemistry, North Dakota State University,
Fargo, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program
of the Chemistry Division and by the Experimental Program to Stimulate
Competitive Research (EPSCoR) for studies of the chemistry of Group 13
complexes. The fundamental chemistry of cationic, anionic, and neutral complexes
will be investigated, which could lead to the development of applications in
Lewis acid and Ziegler-Naata catalysis and in nanoparticulate oxide synthesis.
The education component of this project integrates teaching with research, and
fundamental with applied chemistry through the formation of courses which
emphasize synthesis, catalysis and solid-state materials in ways that relate the
chemistry to applications and uses in daily life. This project addressses the
synthesis of new compounds with Group 13 metal ions such as aluminum and
gallium. Synthetic strategies will be developed, and a wide range of molecular
and solid-state characterization techniques will be used to study the
fundamental chemistry of these systems. Fundamental developments in the
chemistry of these systems could lead to applications in catalysis and solid-
state materials.
