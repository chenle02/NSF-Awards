0235883&lt;br/&gt;Cummings&lt;br/&gt; The Workshop on Molecular Evolution, now
in its 12th year of NSF support, is held for two weeks in the summer at the
Woods Hole, MA, Marine Biological Laboratory to provide a rich and intensive
learning experience for 60 students in the broad field of molecular evolutionary
studies. Specific workshop objectives include: (1) to provide advanced training
in practical, theoretical, and analytical aspects of molecular evolution; (2) to
provide advanced training in computational resources and statistical and
modelling techniques related to molecular biology, phylogenetics, and population
genetics; (3) to promote molecular evolutionary approaches to questions in
biological fields like anthropology, conservation genetics, development,
behavior, physiology, and ecology; and (4) to expand accessibility and reach of
the Workshop through the workshop's web site. These objectives are realized
through a series of lectures by invited specialists, demonstrations, and
computer training for 60 students drawn from throughout the country and abroad.
&lt;br/&gt; Students receive intensive, high-level instruction and hands-on
training in the use of major software employed in molecular evolutionary
studies. Workshop faculty also learn about the latest developments in the field,
and from each other, in ways that promote their own scientific research.
Teaching assistants extend their knowledge and understanding of recent
developments, assist in computer laboratory demonstrations and tutorials, and
lead discussions regarding teaching strategies and pedagogy. The workshop helps
promote understanding of molecular evolution and evolutionary genomics to
society at large, and has involved science reporters and other communicators in
years past as well as scientists from other Federal agencies. &lt;br/&gt;
