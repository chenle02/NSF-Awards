Ethical Issues in Physics: Survey, Workshop, and Text Development. Concern on
the part of some physicists regarding ethical issues in physics is amply
demonstrated through articles in various publications directed toward
physicists, sessions organized by the Forum on Physics and Society at American
Physical Society meetings, and discussions during the recent Ethical Issues in
Physics Workshop held at Eastern Michigan University. In this project, the PIs
propose to survey members of the physics academic community to determine which
universities are most interested in incorporating ethical issues into their
physics curricula and what topics they would be most interested in seeing in an
ethics text. Another survey of physicists in industrial and governmental labs
will seek to determine what formal training in ethical issues would be
beneficial to students whose careers take them in that direction. A second
workshop will be held to extend the recently distributed Ethical Issues In
Physics Workshop Proceedings to produce a text suitable for a one term, one hour
per week seminar course for advanced undergraduates and graduate students
majoring in physics. This text would be placed in the public domain to encourage
as wide a usage as possible.
