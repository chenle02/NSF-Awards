This award supports the travel and subsistence expenses of student participants
in the Second International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agents
Systems (AAMAS), being held July 14 - 18, 2003 in Melbourne, Australia. This
conference is entirely devoted to all aspects of research and application of
agents technology, an important area of research in the success of the World
Wide Web, electronic commerce, digital libraries, search agents, personal agents
and synthetic agents. Participation in this conference will allow a diverse
group of students, representing a wide range of research areas and
methodologies, to present their research to the agents' community. In addition,
special mentoring activities are planned for them.
