The 44th Annual Maize Genetics Conference will be held March 14-17, 2002, at the
Hyatt Orlando in Florida. The meeting offers members of the Maize Genetics
community the opportunity to present and discuss their most recent research
results. A wide range of topics will be covered including cytogenetics and
chromosome mechanics, molecular genetics, biochemical genetics, cytoplasmic
inheritance, genetic mapping and molecular markers, transposable element
behavior and applications, gene identification and expression, plant
development, tissue culture and genetic transformation, and new genomics
approaches. In addition, two dedicated workshops will focus on grasses as a
single genetic system and the promise of biotech foods. The Maize Genetics
meeting provides an outstanding opportunity for graduate students to meet and
interact with scientists in the field, to discuss their research ideas as talks
or posters, and to begin to establish the scientific networks that will prove
invaluable throughout their careers.
