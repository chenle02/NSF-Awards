9723271 Madura The overall goals of this work are to advance the understanding
of the interactions of antifreeze proteins (AFP) at the ice/water interface by
performing explicit and implicit ice/AFP/ water computer simulations, study
experimentally ice crystal growth and its modification by AFPs, and the
development and testing of synthetic analogs. Due to the great complexity of the
molecule-interface interactions in this system the success of this project is
only possible through a complementary computational and experimental approach.
To achieve the objectives, work will focus on the following tasks: The
simulation of two similar AFPs (winter flounder and shorthorn sculpin) Cryogenic
microscopy procedures for studying and analyzing antifreeze activity will be
explored to probe the interactions between AFPs and ice. Using the simulation
data and cryomicroscopy results, antifreeze analogs will be synthesized and
tested for noncolligative antifreeze activity. These synthetic analogs will be
studied in simulation experiments as well as by splat cooling and nanoliter
osmometry. The overall significance of this work will be the development of a
comprehensive, unified theory for the mechanism of action for antifreeze
proteins. In addition the results from this work will provide a basic
understanding how proteins and polypeptides can modify crystal growth. Finally,
the results from this study will have an enormous impact on society. Areas of
impact include the food industry (food preservation, etc.), agricultural
industry: frost sensitive crops (fruits and vegetables) antifreeze fuel
additives, and aircraft industry (de-icers). ***
