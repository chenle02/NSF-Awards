This project investigates signal processing and machine learning algorithms for
identifying and localizing one or multiple targets in the acoustic scene. The
algorithms will be mapped onto a parallel architecture suitable for integration
with micro-power mixed-signal hardware. A biologically inspired gradient flow
signal representation blindly separates and localizes targets using a miniature
array of sub-wavelength aperture. A support vector machine identifies the time-
frequency signatures of the localized targets. The goal of the one-year project
is to determine the achievable energy efficiency and integration density of the
autonomous sensor and the feasibility of its deployment in a large-scale
network, and to evaluate the concept using hardware prototypes. Advanced power
management using wake-up detection will be pursued to reduce standby power. The
effort will also investigate efficient means of embedding acoustic sensors onto
CMOS circuits towards a highly integrated directional and intelligent acoustic
sensor. Miniature integration and micro-power operation are essential to provide
an autonomous sensing and processing node for distributed intelligence in a
sensor network. The outcomes of this project will advance the state of the art
in acoustic sensing technology for surveillance, homeland security, and as an
aid to the soldier's awareness in the digital battlefield. The results will also
impact new developments in intelligent hearing aids and other assistive
listening technologies and human-computer interfaces.
