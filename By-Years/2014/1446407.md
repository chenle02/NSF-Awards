The Learning from Authoritative Security Experiment Results (LASER) workshop
series focuses on learning from and improving cyber security experiment results.
The workshop explores both positive and negative results, the latter of which
are not often published. The workshop strives to provide a highly interactive,
collegial environment for discussing and learning from experiment design,
issues, and outcomes. Ultimately, it seeks to foster a dramatic change in the
paradigm of cyber security research and experimentation, improving the overall
quality and reporting of practiced science.
