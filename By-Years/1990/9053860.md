This project is designing and implementing a model to assist in integrating
people with orthopedical disabilities into careers in technology. Twenty-four
orthopedically disabled individuals have been chosen to be provided with an
education opportunity in the Construction Technology Department of Indiana-
Purdue University at Indianapolis through a special Certificate Program.
Handicapped accessible computer stations are being established and equipped with
software for students with disabilities. Computer- aided and other innovative
types of instructional methodologies are being developed and employed in the
courses in this program. Education of the disabled in technology programs are
being researched through this model undertaking. Disabled students are thus able
to access mainstream construction technology education and resultant careers.
Graduates of the model project will be placed in the industry and their progress
monitored.
