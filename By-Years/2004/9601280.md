We shall continue and expand our investigations of the fundamental aspects of
quantum theory and gravitation, with a view towards experimental applications on
the one hand and obtaining theoretical insights on the other hand. We shall try
to (1) obtain new quantum effects, possibly involving gravity, with experimental
consequences, (2) resolve paradoxes arising from effects we have previously
discovered, which may lead to new effects, (3) obtain greater insight into the
quantum measurement problem and its possible relation to quantum gravity, and
(4) investigate quantum geometry, in particular its relation to supersymmetry.
