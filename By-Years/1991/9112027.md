This NSF Engineering Research Equipment Grant will support equipment that will
aide in the computer acquisition of experimental data for the general problem of
nonlinear wave plasma interaction. Experiments are performed in the areas of: 1)
soliton propagation in nonideal plasmas and higher dimensional soliton effects;
2) nonlinear self similar effects in plasma physics; 3) wake and jet effects in
plasmas flowing past or through perturbing objects; and 4) general properties of
nonlinear wave phenomena.
