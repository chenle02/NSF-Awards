9309835 Gubbins The behavior of fluids in microporous and membrane systems will
be investigated using novel methods, that allow the permeability of the pore
wall to be controlled while maintaining its atomic nature. A realistic model of
the micropore will be developed based on these methods. The fluid behavior will
be studied with respect to its structural, thermodynamic and transport
properties. Special attention will be given to the study of anisotropy in
viscosity and thermal conductivity in confined systems. Non-equilibrium
molecular dynamics (NEMD) methods will be developed for investigating these
transport properties.
