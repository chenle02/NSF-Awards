The Virtual Retinal Display (VRD) is a new form of display device developed at
the Human Interface Technology Laboratory in Seattle, Washington. This device
scans light directly into the eye to create images at the retina. It is
anticipated that the VRD will become a ubiquitous display device as it will be
miniaturized to wear on a spectacles frame. The VRD is bright, yet safe and uses
lasers as highly color saturated sources of light. The research from this
proposal will be studies on the fundamentals of light perception of scanned
images. These studies will allow us to optimize the scan characteristics for
best color, resolution and contrast. We intend to understand the features of
temporal and spatial integration by the retinal processing elements of the
scanned light and how that integration affects the image perception. We will
then be able to produce images with excellent color matching and image
sharpness. By optimizing the VRD in this research we will allow its use where
image quality is essential, such as in remote surgery, or surgical training.
Further, bright, high quality images with the VRD will make it excellent for use
in augmented vision applications, where images are superimposed on the real
world.
