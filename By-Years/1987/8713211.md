Palynology and paleolimnology will be used to reconstruct the climatic history
of the Western Amazon basin since the last glacial maximum. Sediments cores will
be raised from Amazonian crater Lake Kumpaka, from an ancient Amazonian riverine
lake, Zancudococha, and from the lakes in the southern Ecuadorian Andes.
Fossiliferous Amazonian exposures shown by radiocarbon dating to be of glacial
age will be sampled and explored. Pollen and diatom and analyses will be
undertaken to reconstruct histories of vegetation and lake levels in order to
test the hypothesis that glacial climates of the western Amazon were cooler
rather than drier than Holocene climates. This project is important because it
will delineate the paleoclimate history of this vast tropical region, a region
critically important to our understanding of climate change and one virtually
unknown. The research will be carried out in collaboration with Professor Paul
Colinvaux at Ohio State under NSF grant number ATM-8709685.
