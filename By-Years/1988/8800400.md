The objective of this research is to analyze theoretically and experimentally
the nonlinear material characteristics, structural responses and optimization of
motor cycle helmets and other protective devices. It will be conducted in
conjunction with a parallel study, which will be funded by the Air Force Office
of Scientific Research, on the generic experimental and theoretical analyses of
impacted crushable shells. This particular research will start with two major
thrusts involving the impact responses of crushable half cylindrical/semi-
circular shells and the development of a model which simulates a human head.
These two research thrusts will be combined during the third year for the
optimization study. The two principal investigators are highly respected
researchers in their respective fields of impact mechanics, which includes head
injury studies, and structural mechanics.
