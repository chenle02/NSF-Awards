This RAPID project from the NRC's Board on Science Education (BOSE) proposes to
convene a day and one-half long workshop of national experts to develop a
conceptual framework for how to recast science standards around a limited set of
core scientific ideas in order to establish content priority for science
educators and policymakers. The workshop will integrate reserach on children's
learning, drawn from several NRC synthesis studies, into the new conceptual
framework. This body of research, along with commissioned workshop papers will
form the background materials for the workshop. Participants will include
scientists, learning scientists, science educators and those familiar with
practice and policy. The workshop is tied to a recently initiated effort of the
National Science Teachers Association (NSTA) Science Anchors project.
