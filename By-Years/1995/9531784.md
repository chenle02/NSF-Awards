CTS-9531784 Renato Bautista United Engineering Trustees, Inc. The conference on
"Emerging Separation Technologies for Metals II" is organized by the Engineering
Foundation. The meeting will take place in Kona, Hawaii from June 16-21, 1996,
and focus on the separation of metals. Technical sessions will address both the
fundamentals and engineering applications. Specific topics include
thermodynamics, population balance and reaction engineering of metallurgical
processes, multi-phase flow with multiple reactions, adsorption and extraction
using multiple phases, electromagnetic filtration, metal extraction and
environmental control. The conference will provide a forum for discussion of the
emerging technologies in the separation of metals.
