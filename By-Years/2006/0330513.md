Abstract CTS-0330513 S. Friedland, UCLA

The PI has requested travel support for the participants to the Nanoaersol
workshop to discuss and identify the research needs in this important area. The
workshop is scheduled for June 27-28, 2003 at UCLA. Various sessions, as
outlined in the proposal, are planned and groups of experts are assigned to
report in each group.

The workshop is designed to encourage collaboration between researchers in
various field with the common interest in nanoaerosol science and engineering. A
good mix of academe and industry participants adds to the effectiveness of this
workshop.
