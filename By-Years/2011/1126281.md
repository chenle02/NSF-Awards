1126281&lt;br/&gt;Sun&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation
grant supports acquisition of an inductively coupled plasma optical emission
spectrometer (ICP-OES) for elemental analysis. The ICP-OES will support faculty
and student research that will benefit from rapid, high precision and low
detection limit analysis of alkaline earth, transition metals and halogen
elements in water, soil, minerals, rocks, and plant
tissues.&lt;br/&gt;Applications to studies of the biogeochemistry and weathering
processes in soils, stream water chemistry and the impacts of road salt in
watersheds, beach sediment composition and provenance, the catalytic behavior of
transition metal oxides, and phytoremediation of heavy metal impacted soils will
be facilitated. The ICP-OES will support student research training at this non-
Ph.D. granting institution and the PIs plan outreach activities with local
community colleges. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***
