A radically new approach to stationary phase design for liquid chromatography is
proposed. A stationary phase consisting of yarns, which are otherwise
compressible, can be packed in a manner which permits high fluid velocities,
without compacting the support. First indications are that rapid separations may
be possible. Preliminary results with a cellulose based material gave promising
results for separating bovine serum albumin from salt. This research proposes to
quickly explore the potential for selected protein separations.
