9523073 Dunn Interfacial failures pose a serious challenge in manufacturing
reliable piezoelectric actuators and transducers. The proposed research
addresses this important problem by using a tightly coupled theoretical and
experimental program to study the singular behavior of electric and mechanical
fields at the free edges of bonded piezoelectric materials. The singularities
are to be estimated analytically using an asymptotic analysis and these
analytical results are to be then used within a finite element analysis to
predict the response of a practical piezoelectric geometry. Free edge stress
intensity factors are then to be determined. The free edge stress intensity
factors are functions of geometry and the applied loading and will fully
characterize the electrical and mechanical fields at the interface corner in the
region dominated by the singular fields. Experimental studies are proposed to
validate the use of stress intensity factors in predicting failures. ***
