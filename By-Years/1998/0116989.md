SGER: Biocomplexity: The limits to ecological understanding

A theory of ecological complexity must take into account limitations on
predictability, observability, controllability, and even knowability as well as
the critical role that humans play in influencing ecosystem dynamics at multiple
spatial and temporal scales. This project will involve an examination of the
applicability of Kolmogorov complexity theory to ecological complexity in the
categories of structural, embedded, and dynamic complexity. Various nonlinear
mathematical and physical systems will be examined including networks, chaos,
cellular automata, and artificial life. The goals of the project are to: 1)
identify the central questions that relate ecological complexity to
predictability, controllability, and knowability; 2) develop a definition of
complexity for ecosystems; 3) develop a methodology for estimating how complex a
given ecological system is; and 4) organize current knowledge of complexity, and
develop the elements of a coherent theory of ecological complexity. The PI also
plans to organize a symposium for a national meeting to stimulate thinking about
complexity.
