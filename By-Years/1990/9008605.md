The overall goal of this proposal is to extend present steady, laminar flow
experiments by characterizing the response of anchorage-dependent cells to shear
stresses varying at the frequencies encountered in a bioreactor environment.
Idealized single frequency cyclic stresses will be tested as a way of
understanding the different responses caused by the spectrum of turbulent shear
stresses. These will be compared to the responses to actual turbulent stresses
to validate the fluid mechanical simplification. The categories of experiments
to be done are: - Comparison of cell response to laminar versus turbulent flows
in a flow chamber. - Comparison with cells grown in a turbulent stirred
bioreactor. - Effects of low frequency (&lt; 1 Hz) flow changes in the flow
chamber. - Effect of high frequency (&gt; 1 Hz) uniaxial shear stresses in a
zero-mean-flow system. - Effect of rotating shear stress vectors of various
constant magnitudes.
