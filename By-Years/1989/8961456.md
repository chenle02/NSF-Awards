The goal of this project to integrate a powerful interactive software
environment for scientific computing and visualization with suites of high-
quality numerical subroutine libraries, including parallel and vector routines.
The advantages of the proposed system include rapid and efficient prototyping of
scientific calculations, interactive access to numerous state-of-the-art
subroutine libraries, and the creation of a common platform for workstation and
supercomputer based scientific computing. For the scientific user, this system
will allow interactive computing within a powerful matrix-based environment
including hundreds or thousands of pre-defined operations. The proposed system
will function as a high-level front end to efficient supercomputer and parallel
applications, and will include X Window System network graphics and symbolic
debugging facilities.
