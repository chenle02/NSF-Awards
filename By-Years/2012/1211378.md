For fifty years, the Tibetan Plateau has been recognized as the largest
topographic feature that perturbs atmospheric circulation. It serves as an ideal
field laboratory for understanding the geodynamic processes that build high
terrain. Accordingly, the growth of the plateau should have altered atmospheric
circulation and therefore written an evolving paleoclimatic signature not only
on eastern Asian regional climates, but on global climate as well. Despite many
recent studies, we still do not know precisely when the Tibetan Plateau reached
its current dimensions and how it perturbs atmospheric circulation. This project
brings together geodynamicists, atmospheric scientists, and paleoclimatologists
in a multidisciplinary study of the when and the how.

One of the major goals of the project is to quantify the extent to which Tibet
has grown by crustal thickening, by thrust faulting and folding, by flow within
the crust that redistributes material there, or by replacement of cold mantle
lithosphere with hotter material (all in a state of isostatic equilibrium). Such
quantification will take big steps toward the understanding of how high plateaus
are built and how continental lithosphere deforms, topics at the forefront of
geodynamics.

Determining how Tibet has grown will require determining when crustal shortening
and thickening occurred, using basic field methods and modern laboratory
techniques, and quantifying paleoaltitudes with new isotopic tools. Applying
such paleoaltimetric techniques, however, requires an understanding not only of
how the atmosphere transports isotopes, but how the evolving high terrain
affected surface temperatures at times in the past.
