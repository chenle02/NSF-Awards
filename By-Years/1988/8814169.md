The Telecommunications Policy Research Conference series, now in its sixteenth
year, continues to serve as the principal forum for the telecommunications
community for those doing both theoretical and applied research on
telecommunications topics. The Sixteenth Annual Conference is to be held October
31 . November 1, 1988 in Airlie, Virginia. The Conference brings together
researchers of varied disciplines from universities, research institutes,
industry and public interest organizations with government policymakers in a
setting conducive to open and fruitful exchange of information and ideas. The
Conference will facilitate the development of rational, coherent
telecommunications policy by presenting the results of the best available
research on a wide range of key telecommunications policy issues, by clarifying
the policy research agenda, and by stimulating new research that will be useful
for policy purposes. The topics to be addressed at the Conference reflect the
broad range of key policy issues that confront the nation in its transition to a
services.based, market.oriented information economy. The dissemination of the
very best current research relevant to these issues ensures that the
policy.making community has at its disposal the most recent and the highest
quality intellectual capital to aid its deliberations in this most important and
controversial industry.
