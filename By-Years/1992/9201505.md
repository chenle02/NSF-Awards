This award will provide supplementary support to enable Dr. Dorothy Rountree of
Duke University to conduct collaborative research with Dr. Sho Sakurai for 12
months at Kanazawa University in Japan. Rountree and Sakurai will utilize
Rountree's expertise in molecular endocrinology to investigate ketoreductase and
its role in regulating insect physiology and development. Insects are encased by
a chitinous exoskeleton which is shed or molted when the insects grow. This
molting process is controlled by a family of steroid hormones known as
ecdysteroids. Synthesis of these ecdysteroids in the insect's prothoracic glands
is triggered by the release of a prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH), ecdysone,
from the insect's brain. Recently another ecdysteroid, 3-dehydro-ecdysone, was
discovered to be the PTTH secreted by some insects. This PTTH is reduced to
ecdysone by an enzyme, ketoreductase. Dr. Sakurai is currently the world's
premier investigator of ketoreductase and Dr. Rountree's experience with
molecular and endocrine techniques will facilitate the study of ketoreductase at
the molecular and genetic level, providing information on the enzyme's vital
regulatory role in insect development.
