The "Successful Aging through the Eyes of Alaska Natives" project will support
the dissertation research of the CoPI Jordon Lewis. Lewis will investigate what
aging means for Alaska Natives both from an individual?s subjective point of
view and through their role in a community. The research will shed light on what
it means not only to be elderly but to be an Elder in Alaska Native communities.
This project has the potential to provide new insights into a highly
underrepresented group in research on aging. For decades our understanding of
the experiences of the elderly has been based on majority culture data and
models. As a result, public services to Alaska Native communities for their
older residents have been less than optimal. The research undertaken by CoPI
Lewis has the potential to transform the way we think about the aging process
cross culturally and through this new understanding affect public policy for
elder Alaskan residents.
