A central issue in developmental neuroscience is the identification of
molecules that guide nerve cells during axonal growth and final target
recognition. Molecular genetics will be used to identify genes in the fruit fly
that code for cell-surface labels or other molecules which neurons use to
recognize specific pathways and synaptic partners. The subjects are eight large
neurons mediating the escape response in the fruit fly. These neurons have been
extensively characterized physiologically and anatomically. Mutant flies have
been developed in which specific connections between these neurons are
disrupted. The mutation, Pas, blocks a key link in the escape response. This
gene has been cloned. Some mutations in the region of the Pas gene are lethal,
while others cause only neurological defects. The relationship between these two
phenomena will be studied. Two transcripts have been found in the Pas region. A
molecular analysis of these transcripts will be undertaken to determine the
basis for lethal or neurological defective development. These studies promise to
provide information generally relevant to the molecular mechanisms regulating
the development of synaptic specificity.
