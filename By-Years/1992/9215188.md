The object of this research is the simulation, by numerical means, of the
initiation and growth of hail using two and three dimensional cloud models
incorporating various microphysical structures and processes. The study will
focus on proving or disproving a series of hypotheses developed for the
Hailswath II field program. The hypotheses involve the origin of ice and
hailstone embryos in the storms, the growth of hailstones, and the development
of feeder cells and the main updrafts of the storm system. Several well-observed
case studies will be used to test various hypotheses. Cases from the Cooperative
Convective Precipitation Experiment (CCOPE), the North Dakota Thunderstorm
Project (NDTP), and the Alberta hail study have been published and provide
outstanding insights into the development of hail and the dynamics of the
hailstorm. Some of these cases have been simulated in our two-dimensional bulk
water and 20-category hail models. Further simulations using these models and
the Clark three- dimensional cloud model will be used to compare with the
observations. An important development of the model will be the addition of
hailstone growth equations to the basic microphysics of the 3D cloud model.
