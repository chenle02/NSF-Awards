This project will focus on three aspects of finite automata. 1. The role of
randomness in finite automata. The class of functions computed by two-way
probabilistic finite automata will be studied. Techniques for proving non-
membership will be developed, and different notions of acceptance will be
considered. 2. Succinctness of representations. Techniques for proving lower
bounds on the size complexity of finite automata will be developed. 3.
Complexity of minimization problems. The computational complexities of several
conversions of a finite automaton of one type into a minimal automation of
another type will be determined. Of particular importance is the diversity-based
representation of an automaton, which has applications in the theory of
learning. In addition, some problems on program instance checking will be
investigated.
