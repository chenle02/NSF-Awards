It is the object of this study to further increase the fundamental understanding
of the behavior of high velocity fluidized beds so that their attractive
features may be more readily utilized on a commercial scale. These beds are
utilized at present in catalytic cracking for gasoline production, acrylonitile
production, the production of gasoline from coal in South Africa, and many other
applications in the chemical, metallurgical, and petroleum industries. The focus
of this research is to determine the structure and operating characteristics of
these beds using x-ray imaging, solid and gas tracers, and pressure transducers.
Understanding the behavior of the bed as a chemical reactor will be stressed.
