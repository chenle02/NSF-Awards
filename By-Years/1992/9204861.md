The goal of this project is to continue development of a "work in preparation"
(PREP) editor to study collaborative writing relationships. The proposed work
builds on previous work that resulted in design of a prototype editor that
supports some important cognitive needs of social Interaction such as (1) the
recognition of individual contributions to a collaboration and (2) the detection
of change from one version to another. While the project continues to address
further issues in supporting the cognitive needs of writers working together,
the project also begins to work on supporting the social needs of writing
groups,needs such as flexible sharing of partial products and managing parts of
the writing task. For example, to support flexible sharing of partial products,
the project defines a set of parameters that will allow users to control what
they exchange (character, paragraph, column, document), when they exchange it
(automatically, upon request) and the speed of exchange. The work on this front
makes a theoretical and practical contribution to computer science. The work on
supporting the cognitive needs of collaborative writers leads to embedding in
text and graphic editors more general, coherent an consistent models for
annotations. The work on supporting the social needs of collaborative writings
groups leads to the development of new protocols for collaborative documents,
modeled as distributed, disconnectable databases.
