9452609 Lahamer Berea College will modernize an instrument-based physics
laboratory for physics students. The laboratory work will be coordinated with
two two-semester courses covering topics in mechanics, electricity and
magnetism, waves and optics, and modern physics. Emphasis of this project is on
modernizing and adding new experiments in modern physics including nuclear
spectroscopy and installing computer-based data acquisition systems for
measurement, control, and analysis of physical systems with direct interfaces to
the phenomena under investigation. These systems will allow voltage measurements
at up to 60 kHz sampling frequency, interval timing, and curve fitting and
graphing. The requested equipment will greatly enhance the basic goals of
developing an appreciation of the scientific method, demonstrating basic
physical principles, teaching the practice and theory of measurement and
providing the opportunity for students to use laboratory instruments. Our
implementation of these goals will have the additional benefit of introducing
the students to current analytical techniques for materials analysis, and to
computer data acquisition and analysis.
