9601813 Kevan Instrumentation to characterize organic and inorganic solids and
polymers will be acquired by the University of Oregon. The instruments are a gel
permeation chromatography system, a cross- polarization with magic angle
spinning probe for solid state nuclear magnetic resonance, and an x-ray powder
diffractometer. Research efforts that will use this instrumentation encompass
the areas of molecular self-assembly, polymer synthesis and photodegradation,
organic conducting materials, fabrication of non-linear optical devices, and
superlattices and nanostructured materials. Students and faculty from the
Department of Chemistry and from the Materials Science Institute participate in
the research. %%% Organic and inorganic solids possess unusual optical,
electronic, and mechanical properties that are of fundamental and technological
importance. The instrumentation will allow for a detailed knowledge of the
chemical composition and microscopic structure of these solids that is key to
understanding and exploiting the properties of these materials in such fields as
superconductivity, catalysis, and semiconductor processing. StudentsO
experiences gathering and analyzing data with this new instrumentation will
strengthen their training in the area of materials and surface science. ***
