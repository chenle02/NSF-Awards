There is an urgent need to determine structures for Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome Coronavirus (CoV)-2 (SARS-CoV-2) proteins. CoVs are enveloped viruses,
assembled from four major structural proteins: membrane (M), spike (S), and
envelope (E) and nucleocapsid (N). Researchers supported by this award will
focus on the CoV E proteins to understand how the proteins facilitate, through
their interactions with cellular membranes, the budding process as the viral
genome is enveloped. The studies will facilitate identification and design of
molecules for use in structure-function studies and may structural information
that is critical for the design of therapeutics. Postdoctoral and graduate
student trainees, including members from under-represented groups, will be
integrally involved in the research effort. Results from these studies will be
published in peer-reviewed journals, presented at scientific meetings, and made
available through shared data repositories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
goal of the research supported by this award is to solve atomic structures of
CoV E proteins from highly pathogenic human CoVs: Middle East respiratory
syndrome (MERS), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the recently
emerged SARS-2. CoV E proteins are viroporins - small, hydrophobic integral
membrane proteins that oligomerize to form channels that transport
physiologically important ions during infection. The proteins are
multifunctional, in that they play important roles in virus assembly and
pathogenesis. Studies supported by this award will use of cutting-edge
technology approaches for membrane protein structural studies, including
heterologous expression systems, crystallization in lipid cubic phase (LCP), and
time resolved femtosecond crystallography (TR-SFX). The rationale to crystalize
in LCP is that the lipids provide a more native-like environment that may
facilitate reconstitution of normal oligomeric states of viroporins and in turn,
formation of well-diffracting nanocrystals that can be analyzed using X-ray free
electron laser (XFEL) capabilities. This RAPID award is made by the Division of
Biological Infrastructure using funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and
Economic Security (CARES) Act.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
