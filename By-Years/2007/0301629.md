This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial Biology for
FY2003. The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of
protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are
not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides
opportunities for recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in
microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of
established scientists, and to broaden their scientific horizons beyond the
research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These
fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their
research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves
of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign
locations.

The research and training plan is entitled "Microbial energy sharing during
pyrite formation." Pyrite formation from iron sulfide and hydrogen sulfide has
been hypothesized as an early microbial energy metabolism but only recently has
it been associated with microbial activity. This research uses syntrophic
enrichment cultures that catalyze this reaction coupled with methane formation
to characterize the nature of this novel sulfide transformation and the spatial
organization of the partner microbes.
