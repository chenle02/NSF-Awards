The MSRI Undergraduate Program (MSRI-UP) is designed to provide the opportunity
as well as the long-term support and mentorship that talented undergraduate
students need in order to have access to research careers in science and
mathematics. Each year, 18 students will participate in an intense six-week
summer research experience where they will work in teams to complete a research
project. The students will be led by a research director, a post-doc and two
graduate student assistants. Students will also make a final presentation at
MSRI. The topics for the summer program are of current mathematical interest and
importance, and represent part of faculty research leader's research program.
These include areas of combinatorics, finite geometry and computational
algebra.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MSRI-UP aims to increase the number of students
from underrepresented groups in the mathematical sciences Ph.D. programs. The
primary objective is to identify students with an interest in mathematics, and
provide necessary experiences, tools, information and long-term support for them
to have a viable option to pursue a graduate education in the mathematical
sciences. In addition to the research component, the students will attend a
series of professional development workshops and colloquia, including graduate
school program information. After the summer, students will present their work
in poster sessions at national conferences such as the Joint Mathematics
Meetings and the annual meeting of the Society for Advancement of Chicanos and
Native Americans in Science (SACNAS).
