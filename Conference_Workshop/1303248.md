The second annual KUMUNUJr conference will take place April 6-7, 2013 at the
University of Nebraska--Lincoln. KUMUNU is an annual weekend conference anchored
by the University of Kansas (KU), University of Missouri (MU) and University of
Nebraska (NU), which focuses on current research in commutative algebra,
algebraic geometry and related areas of mathematics. KUMUNUJr is geared toward
graduate students and recent PhDs working in these fields and provides an
opportunity for young mathematicians studying commutative algebra in the Midwest
to share their research and expertise with one another. Commutative algebra is
an active discipline, with connections to algebraic geometry, cluster algebras,
combinatorics, homological algebra, representation theory, statistics and other
disciplines. Midwestern commutative algebra research continues to reflect the
activity and diversity of the larger commutative algebra research community.

Regular interaction with other researchers is essential to a mathematician's
professional development, and participation in research conferences is a crucial
part of the development of a mathematician's research program. KUMUNUJr will
provide an opportunity for these young mathematicians to exchange ideas, to
encounter new ideas, to develop new collaborative research projects, and to find
mentors among their peers. The relatively small size of the meeting and the
focus on work carried out regionally will create an atmosphere that will enhance
each of these research and mentoring activities. To register or learn more,
