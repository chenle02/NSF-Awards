The subject of the proposal is to understand the underlying physics of the
standard model of particle physics, which unifies the strong and electro-weak
forces but treats the gravitational force separately leading to a hierarchy of
scales. to treat the forces from a more unified perspective we will look at the
implications of formulating the laws of physics in higher dimensions and try to
understand the implications of how the low energy theory contrains and leads
insight into the higher dimensional theory and how the higher dimensional theory
yeileds new ways of looking at field theory and cosmology in the more familiear
three-space and one time dimensional universe we are familiear with. the hope is
to have a better understanding of the hierarch of energy scales as well as
cosmology from the study of geometries in extra diementions and the existence of
extended objects (branes) in these higher dimensional spaces and their relevance
to the universe we live in.
