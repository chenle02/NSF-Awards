Inferring Topology and Geometry for Dynamic Shapes

ABSTRACT Many applications in science and engineering deal with three
dimensional shapes that move, deform, and/or evolve with time. These
applications need computational methods to simulate such shapes in motion for
visualization, inspection, prototyping, and further developments. We propose to
focus on the problem of inferring topology and geometry of a dynamic shape from
an appropriate representation. We argue that the user can be given a choice of
maintaining a data structure of appropriate complexity depending on the goal of
the simulation. A lighter data structure can be used if the goal is to capture
only topology whereas a more complex data structure can be chosen for capturing
both geometry and topology. This view point generates a plethora of mathematical
and algorithmic questions that we propose to investigate in this project.

Topology and geometry inference of shapes in motion with theoretical guarantee
is a difficult but important problem. A key challenge is to keep the update
costs for the maintained data structures low. Recent developments in topological
analysis of different types of complexes in the context of surface
reconstruction and data analysis have opened up the possibility of representing
a shape at different levels of complexity depending on the need. An efficient
use of these representations in a kinetic setting is
