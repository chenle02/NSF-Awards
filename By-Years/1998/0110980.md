Neurotransmitter-mediated signaling is one of the basic forms of communication
between neurons and their targets. The release of neurotransmitters from
neuronal cells is controlled by the so-called SNARE proteins (soluble N-
ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein attachment protein receptor). The SNAREs
are multiple proteins that form a large complex that leads to the fusion of
neurotransmitter-containing vesicles with cell plasma membranes. In this
application, Dr. Yuechueng Liu proposes to dissect the events that involve the
assembly and disassembly of the SNARE proteins at the molecular level using
engineered fluorescent SNARE proteins. By measurement of fluorescence changes in
cells during neurotransmitter release, the interaction of the SNARE proteins can
be monitored and studied. This research will provide us with fundamental
knowledge regarding how neuronal cells communicate with each other, and it will
ultimately help us to understand many normal and abnormal brain functions such
as learning and memory, depression, and schizophrenia.
