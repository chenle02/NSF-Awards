This research project will carefully examine and develop a cognitive
description and analysis of certain generative aspects of mathematical thinking
- posing problems and formulating conjectures in the form of problems to be
solved - as these processes are used by persons at varying levels of
mathematical experience and maturity, ranging from sixth-grade students to
secondary school mathematics teachers. Careful attention will be paid to
individual differences among and within the various subject populations and also
to the effects on the frequency and/or effectiveness of use of the processes of
support mechanisms, such as the use of computer software support or paired
problem solving. The understanding of these processes obtained from
observational studies during the first two years will be operationalized in the
third year of the project in an instructional study in which a set of
instructional activities, based on the descriptive analysis and devised to
promote the development of these generative processes, is used with middle
school students. The proposed research is directed at important extensions of
extant scientific findings related to mathematical thinking and problem solving.
Moreover, the work proposed here is related to current efforts to reform
precollege mathematics instruction to make it more intellectually stimulating
for students by increasing the amount of instructional time given over the
student conjecturing and investigation. Thus, the results of the proposed
research program should be significant not only for the contribution they can
make to the growing scientific knowledge base concerning mathematical cognition
and problem solving but also for their practical relevance for precollege
mathematics education.
