Combining Hardware and Software Monitoring for Improved Power and Performance
Tuning

Abstract

This research will develop state-of-the-art virus detection and recovery
mechanisms that will be directly integrated into the microarchitecture of
microprocessors. The project will initially focus on addressing stack-smashing
attacks, the most common form of malicious code intrusion. The project will
explore how to utilize multiple threads to perform lightweight virus detection
and recovery. This project will also look to develop new architectural features
that support the efficient execution of anti-virus software.
