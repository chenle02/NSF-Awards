9203004 Berry We propose the development of portable numerical software (Fortran
and C) and management tools for the application of the latent semantic indexing
approach to data retrieval from scientific databases. The software will
implement state-of-the- art iterative numerical methods (Lanczos-based and
Subspace Iteration-based) for computing the sparse singular value decomposition
as needed on a full spectrum of computer systems ranging from low-end
workstations (Sun-4, Machintosh II) to high- end supercomputers (CRAY
Y-MP,CRAY-2S).
