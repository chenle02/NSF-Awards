This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
will assist the Department of Chemistry at Wake Forest University in the
purchase of a single-crystal x-ray diffraction. This instrument will be used to
provide structural data critically needed for the advancement of knowledge in
five significant chemical research areas: chiral catalysts, stereochemistry and
absolute configuration of new organic compounds and metal chelates, new solid
state materials with extended structures, fluorinated-imide ion conductors, and
new classes of organometallic compounds useful in organic synthesis. The X-ray
diffractometer is used to make accurate and precise measurements of the full
three- dimensional structure of a molecule. The information obtained gives the
precise values of all the bond distances and bond angles of a given molecule and
it gives accurate information about the spatial arrangement of that molecule
relative to the neighboring molecules.
