9528391 Mayer This collaborative multidisciplinary research project addresses
metallization and contact formation in silicon- based systems: investigation of
the properties of Ag films as interconnecting metallization in comparison with
Cu, and silicide formation for shallow contacts to Si on insulator(SOI)
structures. The objective is to investigate the fundamental properties of Ag-
based formation of self- passivating layers, adhesion, and diffusion barriers
utilizing refractory metal additions in comparison with an extensive series of
investigations of Cu metallization with Ti addition conducted previously.
Silicide formation on Si on insulator(SOI) structures has stringent materials
requirements for the self-aligned-silicide(SALICIDE) technology, and the
objective of this study is to investigate the CoSix(x&gt;1)/Ti system to bypass
the formation CoSi, thus reducing void formation, to investigate the use of Pd
rather than Ti as an interposing thin layer to form epitaxial CoSi2 layers, and
to investigate the stress in thinner layers of the Si epi-layers in the SOI
structure. Transmission electron microscopy, ion beam analysis(RBS and
channeling), and electrical diagnostics will all be employed routinely to
characterize films and structures synthesized and fabricated during the course
of the research. %%% The proposed basic investigations of metallization and
contact formation are expected to contribute basic materials science knowledge
of technological relevance to advanced microelectronic devices and circuits. The
knowledge and understanding gained from this research project is expected to
contribute in a general way to improving the performance of advanced devices and
circuits used in computing, information processing, and telecommunications by
providing a fundamental understanding and a basis for designing and producing
improved materials. An important feature of the program is the integration of
research and education through the training of st udents in a fundamentally and
technologically significant area. ***
