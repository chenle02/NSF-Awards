This investigation focuses on the collection and study fossil plants from the
Dry Valley region of Antarctica. To date there has been no systematic attempt to
collect and describe these floras in detail, although fossil plants have been
noted by geologists working in the area. Floras from the area range in age from
Devonian to Jurassic and are preserved as compression/ impression fossils with
some examples of petrified wood. The investigation will include systematic and
detailed collections from 38 localities over two field seasons. Since the floras
from Antarctica are some of the most poorly known in the world, a systematic
study of these fossils provides a unique opportunity to compare floral diversity
and composition over a large span of geologic time. An evaluation of these
floras in the context of the geological setting in which they occur will provide
an important source of data that can be used in wide-ranging studies, including
biostratigraphy, paleoecology and paleoclimatology.
