This award provides partial support for the Computational Neuroscience meetings,
CNS*2009, 2010, and 2011, to be held in Berlin, Germany; San Antonio, Texas; and
Stockholm, Sweden. The conferences will bring together a large body of
international scientists working across scales (molecular to systems) and
disciplinary perspectives (e.g., biology, computer science, engineering,
mathematics) on various aspects of computational and theoretical understanding
of the nervous system. This award will contribute to an expanded tutorial
program, a new Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience Lecture, and travel
support for women and minorities.
