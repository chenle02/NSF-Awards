The goal of this research is to characterize the properties of crystals doped
with optically active ions and pumped by laser excitation. The research can be
divided into two thrust areas: characterizing the properties of long range
energy migration among the doping ions and determining the rates of
radiationless transitions between excited electronic states. The major
experimental technique to be used in this work is four-wave mixing (FWM)
spectroscopy. For the energy transfer studies this will be supplemented by time-
resolved site-selection (TRSS) spectroscopy measurements, and for the
radiationless decay studies this will be supplemented by picosecond pulse-probe
measurements and by accumulated photon-echo measurements. The experiments will
be performed on several chromium doped crystals that are important for laser
applications. By correlating the information obtained in both of these areas, it
will be possible to begin developing a detailed understanding of the spectral
dynamics of optically pumped laser materials. By comparing the results obtained
on each of the materials investigated, it will be possible to relate these
characteristics to the properties of the host crystal. The knowledge gained from
this type of detailed, systematic study is important to the continued
development of laser and electro-optic technology.
