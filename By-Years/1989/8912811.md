This dissertation research project will support an anthropology student's
project in Thailand. The student will study how economic and social change has
affected traditional family behaviors associated with caring for dependent
elderly in a developing, but rural area of Thailand. The methods will include
intensive interviews with care providers, participant observation, and surveys
of households in three villages, varying on dimensions of access to urban
services and infrastructure such as electricity and potable water. %%% This
research is important because we know little about how traditional communities
care for their elderly, and about how these patterns of care vary with economic
development. An in depth study of the actual patterns of change in response to
specific socio-economic developments such as electrification and health service
provision will help us understand the pattern of change in other areas.
