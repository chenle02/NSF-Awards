Faculty members from the physics, chemistry and engineering departments at the
University of California at Santa Barbara are collaborating with teachers in the
Santa Barbara School District to improve articulation of hands-on, minds-on
learning in physical sciences in the middle grades. This program builds on
existing teacher and school outreach efforts of these departments. Fellows are
selected from outstanding research-experienced graduate and undergraduate
students in the participating departments. Teachers are selected from those who
already have interacted with the university through participation in such
outreach programs as Research Experience for Teachers. Activities to be designed
and implemented by the teacher/fellow teams are based on the California State
Standards. A grade appropriate model for small group investigation of physical
science concepts is being developed, pilot tested and disseminated. This project
is receiving partial support from the Directorate for Mathematics and Physical
Sciences.
