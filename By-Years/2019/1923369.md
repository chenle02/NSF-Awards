This proposal will address the K12 Pathways strand and will develop sustainable
computer science (CS) pathways in rural and tribal schools. The goal is to
introduce CS to all students early in school and provide multiple opportunities
to engage with CS during K12 and achieve identified learning outcomes, with
emphasis on underrepresented groups. Project team members have an existing
research-practice partnership, specifically a networked improvement community,
with the National Center for Computer Science Education as the hub and Fond du
Lac Ojibwe School (FDLOS) and Hermantown Community Schools as network
nodes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the researchers will engage in three
distinct project activities to achieve the above goal. These include: 1)
Creating a computer science implementation plan for each district based on a
scope and sequence for all K12 students, in alignment with Minnesota and CS
Teachers Association student standards; 2) Designing sustainable CS professional
development programs for rural and tribal schools, leveraging the involvement of
tech integration specialists and administrators; and 3) Identifying needs of and
supporting underrepresented students, in particular those in low socioeconomic
status, special education, and Native American groups. Hence, the proposed work
will explore school context, such as student cultural backgrounds, district size
and available resources and their impact on students' CS learning. These are
critical factors in the CSForAll discourse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
