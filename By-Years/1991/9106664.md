An International Conference on Spin and Isospin in Nuclear Interactions will be
held at the Telluride Conference Center, Telluride, Colorado, on March 11-15,
1991. The subject matter will cover new results from major US, Canadian, and
European intermediate energy nuclear physics user facilities on a variety of
subjects, including: effective nucleon-nucleon interactions, Gamow-Teller
excitations, charge and spin exchange reactions with pions and nucleons,
polarization studies with high energy leptons, polarimetry techniques, neutrino
physics, and astrophysics. The meeting is fifth in a triennial series.
