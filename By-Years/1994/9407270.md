9407270 Sytsma This is a project to perform a detailed molecular historical
analysis of the tropical plant families Myrtaceae (myrtle, eucalyptus, guava)
and Melastomataceae (melastomes) and of the evening primroses (Onagraceae) using
gene sequence from chloroplast DNA. The project addresses questions involving
genealogical relationships of important tropical and worldwide families and an
important model plant in comparative studies. It examines striking examples of
adaptive radiations in floral biology, permits a comparison of the utility of
morphological and molecular data in historical reconstructions, and allows for
detailed analyses of genetic and DNA change through time.
