The work supported by this award is a continuation of ongoing research in
computational astronomy. In the area of radio pulsar searches, highly-successful
work in detecting globular cluster pulsars, with emphasis on very deep searches
of globular cluster cores, wide area searches of globular cluster halos, and
greatly improved searches for short-period binary pulsars will be pursued. In
the area of diffraction-limited imaging, improved algorithms for bispectral
imaging including use of maximum entropy methods and extension of the algorithms
to radio interferometers will be developed. In addition to these specific
efforts, the potential of future high-performance parallel computers for
observational astronomy research will be investigated. In particular, Caltech
plans to acquire a next-generation Intel parallel supercomputer which will have
-100 times the computing capability of current- generation machines. Such a
computer will provide significant new possibilities for astronomical research.
Promising new applications for this machine, and specific hardware and software
tools needed for astronomical computing will be identified. //
