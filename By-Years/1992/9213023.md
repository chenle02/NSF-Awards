We plan to use a powerful combination of technique - High- Resolution LEED,
scanning tunneling microscope (STM) and diffuse light scattering (DLS) to study
the kinetics of interfacial processes from the atomic to the sub-micron scale.
Included will be the growth, morphology and kinetic roughening transition of
metal films on metals and of metal films on semiconductors from sub-monolayer to
many layers thick. The goal is to better understand and to control the
interfacial processes at the atomic level.
