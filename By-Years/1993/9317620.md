Solid modeling is a critical enabling technology for mechanical CAD/CAM because
it provides geometrically complete representations of parts and products, and
enables important manufacturing processes to be modeled. Today's industrial
systems operate far below the technology's potential because solid modeling
requires enormous computing resources, and because current algorithms and
representations cannot handle several important applications. This project is
designing new implementations of ray-casting representations for the solid
models used in mechanical CAD, and extending the models to new applications. New
implementations for ray-casting engines are being developed, using both custom
hardware and software running on massively parallel machines. Using the new
hardware, new applications of ray representations are being explored, including
the solution of boundary-value problems, computation of medial axis transforms,
methods for representing mechanical tolerances, and representation of solid
objects.
