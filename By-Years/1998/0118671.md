This project will continue modeling studies of the dynamics of flow in the
oceanic upper mantle. The emphasis ofthese studies will be shifted to
intraplate, off-axis processes, exploring mechanisms of oceanic matle dynamics
that can explain intraplate volcanism and tectonics. Numerical and labratory
experiments will be carried out. Initially, three mechanisms will be explored;
convective instability, tensile cracks in the lithosphere, and viscous fingering
of low-viscosity mantle into higher viscosity mantle during return flow.
