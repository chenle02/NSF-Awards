The objective of this research is to create a "wearable" information system
device that can be used by supervisory personnel that provides up-to-date
project information such as budget, schedule, and change order details and
enables the supervisor to easily and accurately record job progress and
construction site conditions. The research will focus on the creation of a
prototype apparatus using commercially available components such as a portable
micro- computer, a miniature display monitor, a voice recognition system, and a
bar code reader. The interfacing devices( monitor, microphone, and speakers),
will be fitted to a standard construction hard hat. Additionally, a voice-
activated menuing system will provide the field supervisor with an array of site
management applications. Finally a detailed set of design specifications will be
developed which can be used to construct the next generation of wearable
information systems for construction sites.
