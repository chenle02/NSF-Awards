The theoretical computer science community has recently witnessed a significant
expansion in research interest at the intersection of algorithms and game
theory. As part of this trend, there has also been a resurgence of interest in
ordinal matching problems, where one seeks to pair up elements in two or more
sets, with the quality of a solution characterized in game theoretic terms by
ranked preference lists of the individual elements participating in a matching
problem, rather than in terms of a global objective function involving explicit
numeric costs. Ordinal matching problems arise in a diverse number of
applications in practice, including matching medical school graduates to
residencies at hospitals, maximizing the number of donor matches in kidney
exchange networks, and efficient load balancing on the Internet. Dr. Dean will
develop improved algorithms for a broad range of ordinal matching problems,
helping to bridge the gap in complexity between methods for ordinal matching and
traditional cost-based matching problems.

Dr. Dean is an award-winning teacher and also serves as the associate director
for the USA Computing Olympiad (USACO), where his training initiatives increase
the enthusiam and algorithmic problem-solving proficiency of students at the
high-school level.
