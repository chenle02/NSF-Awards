The proposed research by Robert Wolfe, in partnership with Mary Pete, William
Simeone, and Cheryl Scott, is designed to examine Alaska Native household
specialization of subsistence production. Through an analysis of over 3,500
household surveys in 76 communities, representing seven cultural groups, Aleut,
Alutiiq, Athabascan, Inupiat, Tlingit-Haida, Yup'ik, and Euroamerican the
research team will test the validity of the "30-70" rule a standard of social
science analyses of subsistence among these groups. In addition, the research
team hopes to uncover the how and why of subsistence specialization in the late
20th century among Alaska Natives.
