This award provides funds to the Department of General Science at Oregon State
University to purchase nine microcomputers and essential peripheral equipment
for developing and implementing new, inquiry-based investigations for use in a
large, non-majors biology course. Over 2,000 students will use the computers
each academic year. Using computers to simulate experiments has several
advantages over traditional laboratory exercises: experiments can be designed,
conducted, and interpreted in less time; complex research problems can be
brought into the classroom; opportunities for students to participate as
"scientists" are enhanced; and many limitations related to space, equipment, and
finances can be overcome. The Department has already created two new, highly
successful programs that have allowed students to design and conduct experiments
and manipulate variables. Additional new programs will be developed. At present,
only one computer is linked to four monitors. This requires the entire class to
work in a lockstep process: consequently, independence and opportunities for
student creativity are severely restricted. The grantee is matching the award
from non-Federal sources.
