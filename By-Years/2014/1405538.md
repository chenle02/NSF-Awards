The team from the University of Michigan has developed a new technology that
allows purification of cells, based on the simultaneous antibody detection of
any two distinct surface features, called two-particle activated cell sorting.
This is important because biological cell research and medical technologies
require efficient cell separation techniques to advance basic research of cells
and for medical research and clinical treatment. Current approaches include
fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) and magnetic activated cell sorting
(MACS). FACS requires expensive instrumentation and MACS lacks
specificity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Being able to enrich low levels of cells to a
high degree of purity from complex samples is recognized as being a significant
missing component in many areas of life science. The proposed work plans on
meeting this need through a combination of two-surface marker isolation
(currently only possible with expensive instrumentation) with the ease of use
and cost of magnetic separation (currently only possible to perform single-
parameter separation). This technology may have a potential to shift the market
landscape creating a niche opportunity between FACS and MACS, only taking the
advantage of both.
