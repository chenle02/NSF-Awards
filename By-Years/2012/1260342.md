This project develops and elaborates theories of status generalization. These
theories describe how status characteristics that confer advantages and
disadvantages in the larger society (such as gender, education, or age) get
"imported" and affect dimensions of power and prestige (such as participation
rates, influence, and leadership choices) in face to face task groups. The work
has led to theoretically guided interventions to reduce or eliminate unwanted
status generalization from race, gender, ethnicity, and other status
characteristics in schools and organizations. A previous NSF funded grant
developed this research by adding effects of behavior patterns (such as
deference and assertiveness) to status effects. This new project further expands
the scope of this line of inquiry to include interactions of cultural beliefs
(such as appropriate behaviors associated with gender) with status and behavior.
The research will investigate how various combinations of status and behavior
affect the formation of performance expectations within task work. The study
will employ a complex experimental design to explore these relationships.
Participants in the experiment will be male and female paid volunteers recruited
from large classes.

Broader Impact

Results of this research contribute to the status generalization theoretical
research program and can lay a foundation for further investigations of beliefs,
structure and behavior. They will suggest new ways to control status effects by
adding behavior and making cultural beliefs salient. They also help track
changing cultural beliefs, such as possible decline in the significance of
gender for task focused interaction. Findings also have implications for
developing new experimental techniques that will be used by other investigators,
training a graduate student in all stages of theory building, experimental
design and operations, and data analysis and archiving. The project also will
train undergraduates in recruiting, computer scheduling and face to face
interviewing.
