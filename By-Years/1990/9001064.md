Professor Bendersky intends to use the machinery of elliptic genera to study
geometric problems. He plans to study the problem of vector fields on Spin
manifolds from the point of view of elliptic genera. He also plans to continue
his investigation of the implications of the rigidity of elliptic genera on the
Brown-Kervaire and Atiyah invariants of Spin manifolds with circle actions. This
project will also study the interaction of the unstable Novikov spectral
sequence and the unstable Adams spectral sequence. Using recent work of Davis
and Mahowald, he plans to compute many of the James numbers. Both parts of this
project involve highly intricate algebraic constructions which lend themselves,
surprisingly, to understanding the geometry of some very natural geometric
objects, namely the Spin manifolds.//
