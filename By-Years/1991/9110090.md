The goal of this research project is to develop a new approach for the
modelling, analysis and design of stochastic discrete event dynamic systems
(DEDS). The proposed approach is based on obtaining the Maclaurin series of the
performance measure as a function of a decision parameter. Our objectives are
(i) to develop efficient recursive expressions for the Maclaurin coefficients
for a large class of stochastic DEDS and (ii) to investigate the theoretical and
practical implications of the obtained Maclaurin series. The results of this
project would form a powerful complement to existing methodologies for
stochastic DEDS. In particular, we will develop simple closed form
approximations of the performance measures for the purpose of analysis and
design, as well as some stochastic DEDS modelling guidelines analogous to those
in the classical Bode-Nyquist methodology for modelling continous variable
dynamic systems.
