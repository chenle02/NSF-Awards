With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
(CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Denver will
acquire a laser flash photolysis system. This equipment will enhance research in
the following studies on a) conformational changes in proteins and their
relationship to gated electron transfer reactions; b) photocleavage of
supramolecular scaffolds as a means of modulating molecular recognition; c)
bacterial signal transduction systems; and d) the pathways of electron flow in
multi-redox center proteins. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the major users of
this instrumentation is from the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center;
therefore this grant will serve the needs of two research and education
institutions in central Denver. In addition, this spectrometer will be
incorporated into an advanced laboratory course at the University of Denver.
