This award to Brigham Young University is made in response to a proposal
submitted to the NSF's Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement Program, a
program whose goal is to extend support for undergraduate instructional
instrumentation. The award will provide one-half of the funds needed to acquire
a geoscience computer laboratory system for the computer modeling of geological
processes. The University is committed to matching the NSF contribution for this
equipment. The instrumentation will be used to enhance the undergraduate
curriculum in geology and to improve computer literacy.
