Funds are requested to purchase two computer workstations needed to pursue
research on mantle flow and convection and the modeling of magnetohydrodynamics
in the Earth's core. This area of geophysical research is totally dependent on
the availability of modern computing and imaging tools. The workstations are to
be installed in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at Harvard
University where there is research emphasis on problems such as the three-
dimensional flow in the mantle associated with plate motions, geomagnetism and
core dynamics, deformation of lithospheric plates, and the viscosity of the
mantle.
