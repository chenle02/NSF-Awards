9311425 Formby This is a joint U.S.-Taiwan workshop on growth, equity, and the
distribution of income proposed by Dr. John P. Formby, University of Alabama and
Professor Chao-Cheng Mai, Academia Sinica. The invited participants for this
workshop are the top current researchers in the income distribution area. They
plan to compare data and to discuss studies of growth and income distribution in
Taiwan and the U.S. This is an important and opportune subject as drastic
changes in income distribution have been taking place in many developing and
developed economies. The comparison of data on earnings distribution between the
developed economy (U.S.) and rapidly-developing economies such as Taiwan can
improve our understanding of the underlying mechanisms, which lead to changes in
income distribution and their relationship to economic growth. This workshop is
to be held on July 22-24, 1994 at the East-West Center, Honolulu, Hawaii.
