8901600 Olver This project is a continuation and deepening of research into
various algebraic and geometric aspects of the equations of continuum mechanics
and mathematical physics. The principal areas of concentration are Hamiltonian
methods, equations of nonlinear elasiticity, and Cartan equivalence problems.
Particular applications include: Hamiltonian structures and conservation laws
for quasilinear hyperbolic systems, including gas dynamics and nonlinear elastic
models, 2. multi-Hamiltonian systems and quantization, 3. nonlinear dissipation
and normal forms for ordinary differential equations, 4. conservation laws,
symmetries, canonical forms and invariants for planar elastic materials, 5.
equilvalence problems from the calculus of variations, 6. Lie algebras and
equivalence of differential operators with applications to molecular dynamics,
and 7. classical invariant theory. Although the project covers a wide range of
material, the different subjects inter-connect and reinforce each other in many
ways, and the resulting combination of algebra, differential geometry and
physical applications has proved to be an extremely fertile area of research.
