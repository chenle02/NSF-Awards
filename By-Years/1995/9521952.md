As part of an NSF Consortium for Research on the Human Dimensions of Global
Change, this award provides support for the Methods for Integrated Regional
Assessment Project (MIRA). This project, developed by the interdisciplinary
Human Dimensions Program of Penn State's Earth System Science Center (ESSC) in
collaboration with researchers from the University of Arizona, focuses on the
development of innovative methods for assessing the regional consequences of
global change. MIRA will develop methods for linking global processes of climate
and economic change to impacts, individual perceptions and behavior, and
institutional and economic responses at the local or regional scale. These
methods include climate downscaling, multilevel and regional modeling,
vulnerability assessment, and surveys of individual and firm perceptions,
valuation, and response to environmental change and policy. In addition, NSF
support will provide a modest level of long-term institutional capability for
the Human Dimensions Program within Penn State's Earth Systems Science Center.
