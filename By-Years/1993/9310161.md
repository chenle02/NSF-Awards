9310161 Walker This workshop entitled "International Workshop on Advances in the
Modeling of Aerodynamic Flows" will be held in Poland July 12-14, 1993. It will
bring together approximately forty scientists from the former Soviet Union and
forty from Europe and the USA to discuss the latest advances in the modeling of
aerodynamic flows. One of the main objectives of the workshop is to initiate and
foster scientific collaborations between scientists in Russia and the West in
this field. This project fulfills the program objectives of advancing scientific
knowledge by enabling leading experts in the U.S. and Russia to combine
complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and
competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.
