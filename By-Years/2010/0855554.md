In this project, interactions between ultracold Rydberg atoms will be explored.
Ultracold rubidium atoms, at temperatures less than one thousandth of a degree
above absolute zero, will be prepared using laser cooling techniques. These
atoms will then be transferred to highly-excited Rydberg states with lasers.
Such states are unusual in that the electron lives very far from the nucleus,
making them very fragile and easily perturbed by other atoms, even when the
atoms are far apart. Various manifestations of these strong interactions between
Rydberg atoms will be investigated. Specifically, the formation of very large
molecules comprised of Rydberg atoms will be explored. Also, novel ion-pair
states, where one atom steals the electron from its partner, will be probed.
Finally, various exchange processes, where the interacting atoms trade their
states of excitation, will be studied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In performing this
research, students and postdocs will receive valuable professional training in
laser-based atomic and molecular physics, ultimately enhancing the high-tech
workforce. Results of the research will be disseminated through journal
publications and conference presentations, thereby informing the scientific
community of our findings. Regarding scientific impact, very large Rydberg
molecules are an exotic form of matter, exhibiting novel types of binding. Also,
interactions between Rydberg atoms are the key mechanism in a number of possible
schemes for quantum information processing. Finally, ultracold Rydberg atoms are
closely related to cold plasmas, which have been used to form cold antihydrogen
atoms in Rydberg states.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
