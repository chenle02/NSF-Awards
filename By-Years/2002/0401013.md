ABSTRACT International Workshop on Advances in Predictive Modeling Project
Summary, NSF Proposal # 0401013

A workshop for advancing the understanding of composite materials is proposed
with an emphasis on modeling, analysis, and design of advanced fiber-reinforced
composites (FRCs). The workshop is to be held in the US in September 2005. The
following research areas are cited as areas ripe for discussion and possible
workshop topics: (1) microstructure designed, optimal design and computer-
designed materials, (2) micro-architectured materials, (3) nano-technology and
nano-structure designed materials, (3) MEMS and smart materials, and (4)
information technology materials. Technology gaps in modeling FRCs through the
continuum of their length scales will be addressed; from individual fibers
(micron level) to test coupons (centimeters) to complete structures (tens or
hundreds of meters), extant models do not fully capture FRC behavior. The format
of half-day plenary sessions followed by afternoon workshops offers a venue in
which substantial progress can be made in gaining an in-depth, physics-based
understanding of composite material behavior.
