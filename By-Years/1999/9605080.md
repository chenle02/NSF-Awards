Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will focus on the dynamical
properties of the heavy quarks, namely the beauty, charm and top quarks. Among
the central mysteries of the so-called Standard Model of High Energy Physics are
the questions of how do the basic constituents of matter - namely quarks and
leptons-acquire their masses and why do they come in so-called families, i.e.
exact triple replications of each other except for their masses. The mass
generation process can be probed in the most sensitive way by studying
limitations of microscopic time reversal invariance. Violations of this
invariance are an essential ingredient when one tries to understand the observed
baryon number of the universe as a dynamically generated quantity rather than as
an arbitrary initial condition.
