The incorporation of a 300 MHz Fourier transform nuclear magnetic resonance
spectrometry will demonstrate to students the unique power of FT techniques in
spectroscopic applications. The theory and practice of NMR will be introduced in
organic chemistry and advanced FT NMR topics and experiments in the instrumental
analysis course. FT NMR will also be included in the laboratory programs of all
of the advanced courses. New laboratory experiments will illustrate multinuclear
resonance, homonuclear and heteronuclear correlation spectroscopy, relaxation
phenomena, and variable temperature studies. Advanced students will use the
instrument in undergraduate research, which will greatly strengthen the program.
The grantee will match the NSF award from non-federal sources.
