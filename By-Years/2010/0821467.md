This award to a non-Ph.D. granting institution is for the acquisition of a high
resolution 1.3-&lt;br/&gt;m optical monochromator system with fast gated CCD
camera for incorporation into the Laboratory for&lt;br/&gt;Plasma Physics at
Troy University. This instrument will expand the current research capabilities
of the PI's&lt;br/&gt; Laboratory into high resolution spectral line broadening
measurements for high-velocity plasmas, which &lt;br/&gt;requires linewidth
resolution on the order of 0.01 nm or better. Spectroscopic studies in basic
plasma&lt;br/&gt; sciences will also be conducted with the help of the
instrument in determining plasma density and temperature information.
&lt;br/&gt;The high resolution monochromator system with fast gated ICCD
camera&lt;br/&gt;fills a crucial void in the PI?s Laboratory. The instrument
will make possible the investigations of the&lt;br/&gt;effects of a weak shock
wave (Mach 1-5) on plasmas as well as of plasmas behind a strong
ionizing&lt;br/&gt;shock wave (Mach 20 or higher). This research will provide
new insight into fundamental plasma&lt;br/&gt; processes involved in the
electronic layers formed at the shock-front. The high resolution
spectroscopic&lt;br/&gt; line broadening data measured in the laboratory plasma
behind a strong ionizing shock wave&lt;br/&gt; (Mach 20 or higher) can have
potential use for space and inter-stellar plasma diagnostics.
