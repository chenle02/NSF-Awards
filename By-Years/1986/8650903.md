The goal of this project is to assemble the essential components of a versatile
laser spectrometer to enable students of physical chemistry to carry out
experiments in Raman spectroscopy, time-resolved absorption spectroscopy, and
time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy. The total system includes both a pulsed
Nd:YAG laser and a dye laser, as well as a monochromator, a signal processor,
and a laboratory computer to store and analyze the data. The spectrometer will
be used to introduce students to several phenomena and techniques which are
important to current research in chemistry. These include (a) principles and
applications of lasers, (b) techniques for measuring very fast processes, (c)
manipulation of a sophisticated optical-electronic system, and (d) computer
interfacing and control of experiments. This system will also provide an
opportunity for chemistry majors to use state-of-the art laser equipment for
independent research projects. An important outcome of this project will be the
eventual publication of a variety of well-tested, documented experiments for
undergraduates using state-of-the-art laser systems. Thus this project can serve
as a national model, and contribute to the improvement of chemistry education on
the national level.
