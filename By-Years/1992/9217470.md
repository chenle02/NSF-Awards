This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in Theoretical
Physics between Antal Jevicki of Brown University and Jean Avan of the
Laboratory for Theoretical High Energy Physics, University of Paris VI. The
investigators propose to solve a series of problems in string theory and quantum
gravity. The objectives are to understand the symmetries of two dimensional
string theory and explore its relationship to higher dimensional integrable
theories. Specifically the research involves exotic matrix models, quantum
symmetries, interacting theory of tachyons, topological fields and the nature of
w- infinity algebra, which appears throughout matrix models and topological
fields. The U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in
theoretical physics. This is complemented by the French investigators experience
in mathematical physics. The investigators have already progressed on some key
aspects of string theory and the nature of w-infinity algebra. This project will
enable them to expand their efforts and ultimately apply their results to the
physics of black holes, early cosmology, and ultra high energy physics.
