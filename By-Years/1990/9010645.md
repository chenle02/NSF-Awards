This work focuses on the study of coordination between AI systems. One objective
is to take techniques developed for different aspects of coordination and unify
them in a single computational theory. Initially, the work will develop a
formalism and computational theory that can lead to novel coordination
techniques by drawing together the separate approaches of planning,
organizational design, and scheduling. This theory provides a powerful framework
for improving performance, reducing overhead, increasing reliability, and
flexibly managing distributed resources among AI systems. The work will lead
toward a generic coordination framework for developing AI systems, because we
believe that reasoning about interactions with others is fundamental to
intelligence. A second objective of DIAL is to build an experimental
infrastructure for validating coordination theories and discovering new
theories. To facilitate comparisons between alternative theories both within
DIAL and elsewhere, a versatile, portable simulation testbed will be developed.
Techniques will also be integrated into actual mobile robots to investigate the
interplay between sensing, acting, reasoning, and communicating in real-time
physical systems. The research will help pave the way for introducing
intelligent, cooperating robots into real- world environments.
