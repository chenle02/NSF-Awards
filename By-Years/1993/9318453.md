9318453 CALDWELL Oregon State University's College of Ocean and Atmospheric
Science requests continued support for a mentoring and research- participation
program for Native American undergraduate students. The long-term goal of this
program is to increase the number of American Indian and Native Alaskan
undergraduates who complete degrees in science, continue to graduate school, and
enter the professional scientific work force. This goal will be achieved by
providing the financial support and mentoring necessary for these students to
continue their higher education, and by widening their career choices through
meaningful and active participation in on-going research projects at OSU during
the regular academic year and in the summer. This research experience will 1)
educated them in the science and 2) overcome cultural barriers to career
possibilities.
