This project on large-scale optimization has two main objectives: to gain better
theoretical understanding of the effectiveness of sequential and parallel, and
deterministic and randomized structure-exploiting methods, and to conduct large-
scale experimentation leading to fast and numerically- robust implementations
for solving various types of block- structured problems. A wide class of methods
for general block-structured linear and convex optimization problems will be
studied. The development of these methods draws upon ideas of potential-function
reduction, block-coordinate descent, adaptations of scaling techniques of
interior-point methods, and hybrid approaches. Theoretical emphasis will be on
the complexity analysis of structure-exploiting procedures. Practical emphasis
will be on the approximate solution of large-scale problems with various blocks,
including special types of blocks amenable to efficient combinatorial
algorithms.
