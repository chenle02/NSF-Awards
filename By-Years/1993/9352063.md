This project affords undergraduate students in the animal sciences a unique
opportunity to obtain experience in developing and applying a new technology,
ultrasound, to solve problems in the livestock industries. Students are
introduced to the basics of ultrasound technology in a required meat animal
evaluation course and are then given an opportunity to enroll in a study program
consisting of intensive training in physical properties of the technology
coupled with hands-on training in measuring and analyzing animals with the
equipment. After completion of a proficiency program and certification, students
are available to producers for measurement and analysis of animals.
Undergraduate students are involved in research attempting to develop and apply
high technology to agriculture problems.
