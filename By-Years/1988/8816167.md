We have generated a quantitatively valid dissolution index for modern sediments
in the west-equatorial Pacific, which is tied to carbonate saturation values. We
wish to apply this index to a series of long cores, taken across the lysocline
on the slope of Ontong-Java Plateau, in order to reconstruct the saturation
history of deep waters in this region, for the last 450 kyr. The time scale will
be provided by a fit of oxygen isotope stratigraphy to the Imbrie et al. (1984)
standard. Absolute rates of dissolution will be derived from comparison of
synchronous instantaneous accumulation rates of cores from above and below the
lysocline, checked against dissolution indices. In conjunction with data on the
isotopic compositions of benthic foraminifera, the calibrated saturation curves
will allow determination of probable pCO2 of deep waters, and provide useful
contraints on the reconstruction of the late Pleistocene carbon chemistry and
circulation. Our focus is on the contrast between middle and late Brunhes time,
and on that between the extreme states (glacial-interglacial) and the extreme
rates of change (glacierization-deglaciation).
