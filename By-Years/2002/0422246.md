This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project proposes to develop an
inexpensive, automated, highly sensitive biosensor chip that would detect small
quantities of nucleic acids directly without the need for either a reporter
molecule reaction or a PCR expansion reaction. It is expected that the proposed
molecular detection platform will provide unparalleled specificity and
sensitivity while decreasing sample preparation time by a factor of twenty five,
capital costs by a factor of twenty, and the cost of disposables, including the
chip, by a factor of five.

The commercial application of this project will be in a number of markets,
including biological and biomedical research, diagnostics and forensics.
