The focus of this research is radical kinetic and mechanistic studies. Dr.
Newcomb will carry out several projects that involve both direct, laser flash
photolysis and indirect kinetic measurements of reactions of a variety of
radicals. One aim is to create kinetic scales for substituted carbon radicals
and heteroatom-centered radicals that complement the highly developed scale for
simple alkyl radicals, and part of the work is directed at specific important
targets such as the kinetics of DNA radical reactions. In addition, emphasis
will be placed on studies of ultrafast radical rearrangements. With this renewal
award, the Organic Dynamics Program is supporting the research of Dr. Martin E.
Newcomb of the Department of Chemistry at Wayne State University. Professor
Newcomb will focus his work on probing the kinetic and mechanistic properties of
carbon radical intermediates. A better understanding in these areas will lead to
expanded methodology for synthetic chemists and knowledge that will bear on a
number of vital biological processes.
