9303522 Valdman This dissertation research project will contribute significantly
to scholarly knowledge in two fields in which the need for greater documentation
is well known: the sociolinguistic study of language death, and the
documentation and analysis of Cajun French (CF). The research will involve two
techniques, participant observations in the CF community in and around Houma,
Louisiana, and the oral administration of questionnaires and a translation task
to 40 members of the community falling into four age ranges: over 60, 40 to 59,
20 to 39, and under 20. The question of language death in this community will be
approached in two ways. First, the questionnaire is designed to determine the
functional domains in which CF is still used. By administering it to
representative members of the different age groups, it will be possible to
identify changes in the functional distribution of CF. Secondly, the participant
observation and the translation task are designed to study six specific
linguistic variables as a means of identifying intergenerational differences in
language skills. An additional time dimension will be added to the study in that
some of the variables to be examined have been looked at in previous studies
from the same areas of francophone Louisiana.
