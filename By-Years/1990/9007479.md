Most plants compete for resources: competition has been shown to limit growth
in both agricultural and naturally- occurring plants. Many studies have
investigated the importance of competition (e.g. yield-density relationships,
effects of weeds on crops). However, very little is known about the evolutionary
importance of competition. To what degree has competition been important in the
evolution of plant morphology, physiology, and phenology? There are four
evolutionary alternatives or outcomes for competing plants: resource
partitioning, increased uptake of resources, increased efficiency of resource
use, and interference mechanisms. The investigator has predicted which
alternative is most likely to occur in different types of competitive
environments. The proposed research directly follows the evolution of plants in
different competitive environments. Brassica rapa L. will be grown at high
densities for ten discrete generations. Environments will differ in the presence
and absence of interspecific competitors and fertilizer. Each generation, the
largest 20% of the individuals will be selected to be pollinated and to provide
seed for the next generation. The investigator will monitor competitive
characteristics of individuals of each generation for changes in plant
performance and traits. The results will demonstrate which of the four
evolutionary alternatives are most likely to occur in different conditions.
