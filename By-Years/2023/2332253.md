The Arctic is experiencing rapid environmental changes that present challenges
to the natural environment, built environment, and social systems that have
sustained Arctic peoples and ecosystems for generations. These changes are
strongly evident in Arctic coastal systems. New research on Arctic coastal
systems has been supported through both the Navigating the New Arctic (NNA)
program and the Coastlines and People (CoPe) program. However, coordination and
synthesis among these Arctic coastal projects and new perspectives are needed to
fully understand these rapid changes. The project team will convene an Arctic
Coasts workshop to bring together several large, convergent research project
teams, Indigenous and local community members, and decision makers focused on
Arctic coasts.

The goal of the Arctic Coasts workshop is to bring together a diverse set of
people to exchange knowledge and information about coastal hazard impacts,
enhance collaborative networks, and deliver tangible products that support
community priorities and lead to outcomes beyond the single workshop. The
workshop will produce a report that: (1) enhances knowledge exchange across
multiple groups for effective communication and collaboration; (2) identifies
and documents key strategies to address natural/social/engineering issues
resulting from environmental changes in the Arctic; (3) builds collaborative
teams and identifies convergent research topics prioritized by community
members; and (4) identifies educational needs, challenges, and opportunities for
students in Arctic coastal communities. Ultimately, the Arctic Coasts workshop
contributes to the NNA goal of empowering new research partnerships from local
to international scales, diversifying the next generation of Arctic researchers,
enhancing efforts in formal and informal education, and integrating the co-
production of knowledge where appropriate.
