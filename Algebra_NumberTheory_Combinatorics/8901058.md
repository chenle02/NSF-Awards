This award supports the research in Ramsey Theory of Professor Neil Hindman of
Howard University. Dr. Hindman's research will center on investigations relating
combinatorial partition theory and the theory of left-topological semigroups.
This research falls in the broad category of Combinatorics, which is one of the
most active fields in today's mathematics. Fundamentally, Combinatorics
represents a systematization of the very first of all mathematical activities,
counting. In its modern development, however, Combinatorics has gone beyond just
counting to make use of a wide variety of advanced mathematical techniques, and
although its roots go back several centuries, the field has had an explosive
development in the past few decades because of its importance in communications
and information technology.
