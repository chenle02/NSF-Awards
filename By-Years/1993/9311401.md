This project in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division is involved with a study of electronic non-adiabatic effects
in state-to-state chemical reaction dynamics. Considerable use is being made of
massively parallel supercomputers. Special attention is being played to the role
of the "geometric phase" in influencing the reaction probabilities for such
reactions as that between a hydrogen atom and a hydrogen molecule. %%% The
theoretical description of very simple gas-phase chemical reactions such as that
between a hydrogen atom and a hydrogen molecule is being advanced in this
computational study which makes use of the latest in supercomputers.
