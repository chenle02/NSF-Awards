Britt&lt;br/&gt;0404262&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research aims to develop a
two-dimensional imprint and molecular vise method for creating nanoscale sol-gel
membranes for protein recognition. In-plane imprint sites are formed in floating
monolayers of polymerizable alkyl-silanes co-spread with functionalized "target"
silanes and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) bearing lipids. The lateral diffusivity
of monolayer components facilitates a matching of amphiphile functional groups
with residues on the adsorbing proteins through complementary interactions
(hydrogen bonding, electrostatic), preserved upon monolayer polymerization. The
Langmuir monolayer technique allows functional group density, lateral mobility,
polymerization rate, gelled film morphology, PEG conformation, and protein
insertion to be precisely controlled. Contraction of the imprinted monolayer
upon alkyl-silane hydrolysis and condensation accompanied by barrier compression
adds a "molecular vise" aspect to imprinting, where PEG chains that initially
explore a large area in the "mushroom" phase are forced into the more ordered
and conformationally restricted "brush" phase. This induced assembly of PEG
bearing amphiphiles around proteins adsorbed to target silane head-groups builds
binding pockets, while weakly adsorbed proteins (poor imprints) are squeezed
out, improving binding site affinity and homogeneity. The PEG brush layer
surrounding the in-plane imprints also reduces non-imprint mediated protein re-
binding. The proposed collaborative research will help establish a nanoscience
based partnership between the Biological Engineering department at Utah State
University and the Bioengineering and Metallurgical Engineering departments at
the University of Utah, leading to infrastructure enhancement and cooperative
graduate and undergraduate student involvement from both universities&lt;br/&gt;
