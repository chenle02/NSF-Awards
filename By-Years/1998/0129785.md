This project explores the synthesis and physical and chemical characterization
of a new class of materials, viz., ternary chalcogenides of the group 3 and
group 4 transition and lanthanide metals. Many of these condensed cluster phases
appear to be uniquely stabilized by strongly bound, late transition metals as
interstitials in nominal clusters of the early metals, which is a new concept in
solid state chemistry to be explored in this project. These cluster-interstitial
combinations also allow insight into local interactions present around
impurities in enigmatic intermetallic and pure metal systems, which is a new
direction in chemistry. Physical properties of these will be defined by crystal
structure studies, electronic conductivity, and magnetic susceptibility
measurements, and with parallel extended-Hckel and density functional theory
(band) calculations. Explorations for new examples of aperiodic quasicrystals
and a new method for their direct structural definition are also planned. These
studies afford advanced students training along new frontiers in techniques and
chemistry. Participating undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students will
get valuable training and experience in advanced methods in solid state
chemistry. Half of the personnel have been women in recent years, and the
proportion is presently two-thirds. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The discovery and
development of new materials, utilizing synthetic explorations to uncover new
and unprecedented solid compounds, structures and properties is crucial to
advancing materials science. Successful syntheses often involve specialized
techniques, conditions, and exotic containers that are not widely employed and,
since the availability of new materials is a high priority in both industry and
academia, students trained in these areas typically compete very well in the job
market. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
