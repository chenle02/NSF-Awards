This three-day meeting of leading fluid mechanicists at the Scripps Institution
of Oceanography will discuss promising new directions in research. The meeting
will honor Professor John W. Miles on the occasion of his seventieth birthday.
As befits Miles broad interests and range of accomplishments, the participants
will touch upon all aspects of fluid mechanics. The proceedings of this meeting
will be published in a special Scripps Institution of Oceanography volume, and
distributed widely. NSF will help to pay the travel and lodging expenses for
invited speakers who cannot provide their own support. The other costs of the
meeting will be borne by the University of California and the Office of Naval
Research.
