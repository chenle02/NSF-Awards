The goal of the investigation in to study the effects of pore size and pore
size distribution upon development of microstructure of ceramics processed using
solid state sintering techniques. Model final-stage microstructures are tailor
made using ultra-high-purity alumina powders containing latex spheres of
controlled size, size distribution and amount. These model controlled
microstructures include undoped alumina with uniform pore distribution, undoped
and nonuniform pore distribution, and sintering models will be tested.
