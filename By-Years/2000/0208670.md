As modern memory architectures grow in complexity, it is
becoming&lt;br/&gt;increasingly important to design algorithms with high data
locality.&lt;br/&gt;Standard approaches parameterize algorithms by aspects of
the memory&lt;br/&gt;hierarchy, such as the size and block size of each memory
level.&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, this parameterization often leads to complex
algorithms&lt;br/&gt;that are tuned to particular architectures. A promising new
line of&lt;br/&gt;research is to develop memory-hierarchy-sensitive algorithms
that avoid&lt;br/&gt;any memory-specific parameterization. Such platform-
independent algorithms&lt;br/&gt;are said to be "cache-oblivious." If a cache-
oblivious algorithm works&lt;br/&gt;optimally on a two-level hierarchy, then it
works optimally on all levels&lt;br/&gt;of a multilevel memory hierarchy; cache-
oblivious algorithms automatically&lt;br/&gt;tune to arbitrary memory
architectures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research involves maintaining data
locality in irregular and dynamic&lt;br/&gt;settings, where the data flow is
continually changing and unpredictable.&lt;br/&gt;The investigator will design
cache-oblivious solutions for a variety of&lt;br/&gt;fundamental algorithms and
data-structures problems. New algorithmic&lt;br/&gt;models of aspects of the
memory hierarchy will be proposed and integrated.&lt;br/&gt;The investigator
will emphasize solutions that are simple and elegant&lt;br/&gt;enough to
implement. Two verification tools under development at Stony&lt;br/&gt;Brook
will provide testbeds for the project's empirical
component.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
