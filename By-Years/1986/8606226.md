This project will investigate the possibility of creating extreme ultraviolet
and soft X-ray lasers (wavelength 200A - 1200A) Using magnetically confined
recombining plasmas produced by fast capillary discharges. The motivation of
this research is to achieve laser action in these spectral regions with a
relatively compact discharge-pumped devise, as compared with the Kilojoule laser
sources required as pumps in other XUV laser approaches. Dense multiply ionized
plasmas will be created using high power density capillary discharges. When
initially hotter plasmas are required the combination of these capacitive
discharges with pinched electron beams having current densities of several
Kiloamps/mm2 will be used. Magnetic confinement will allow conductive and
radiative plasma cooling without a major reduction in the plasma density. Large
optical gains in the XUV and soft X-ray spectral region are expected to result
from electron-ion recombination of highly ionized species. H-like, He-like and
Li-like species will be investigated as laser candidates.
