The role of immigration in rescuing a population from the threat of extinction
remains to be tested in a comprehensive experiment. By exploiting the
amenability of the housefly for large-scale long-term experiments, the effects
of immigration and selection on the survival of persistently small populations
will be examined. Replicate metapopulations (i.e., interacting sets of small
subpopulations) will be constructed. Over the course of 20 generations, each
metapopulation will be managed under one of six specific treatments for
immigration and selection effects. For the selection treatments, only the adults
with the highest reproductive activity will be allowed to contribute offspring
to the next generation. For the immigration treatments, members from one
subpopulation will be allowed to breed in another subpopulation. Measures will
be made on reproductive activity and on the genetic variation for molecular and
complex traits to assess the threat of extinction. The central hypothesis is
that a low level of immigration will bolster the selection response for higher
mating activity and rescue subpopulations from inbreeding depression. In
agricultural programs to select for economically important traits and in efforts
to save endangered species, immigration is commonly used to relieve the
detrimental effects of inbreeding. Recent studies in laboratories and in nature,
however, have identified gaps in our understanding of the genetic complexities
of near-extinction events. This large-scale long-term experiment is uniquely
designed to explain how populations in nature, agriculture, laboratories, and
conservation projects escape the threat of extinction.
