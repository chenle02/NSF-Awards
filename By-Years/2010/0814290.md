A drifting platform at stratospheric heights presents a unique opportunity to
profile the Antarctic atmosphere that can increase our understanding of upper
atmosphere dynamics in regions that are poorly sampled by conventional
techniques. For example, understanding changes leading up to the breakup of the
polar vortex in spring is important to understanding the impact of carbon
dioxide (CO2) versus ozone induced forcing of Antarctic climate. The Centre
Nationale d'Etudes Spatiales, in France, has developed a stratospheric super-
pressure balloon that flies at constant density at 20 km altitude for deployment
during an Antarctic measurement campaign in September 2009. A modified version
of Haase's airborne radio occultation system will be developed for incorporation
into the balloon payload. This prototype system will record two profiles per
hour for the approximately 90 day journey of the stratospheric balloon within
the polar vortex. These exploratory data will pave the way for future campaigns
that will contribute sufficient data to improve substantially model
representations of the springtime breakup of the Antarctic polar vortex. These
data will contribute to improved methods for assimilating other advanced
satellite sounder data, in particular the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding
Interferometer (IASI).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant will foster close
collaboration with international scientists in France who have unique expertise
in observations from stratospheric balloons. This will be of mutual value to
both nation's scientific activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
