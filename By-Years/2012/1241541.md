The CybercorpsÂ®: Scholarship for Service (SFS) program at California State
University San Bernardino (CSUSB) promotes cybersecurity excellence through a
dynamic curriculum, unique applied learning requirements, and a diverse student
population. The curriculum is designed around the needs of government
organizations seeking well-qualified students. While many SFS programs across
the country focus on policy; management of technology; or secure programming,
design and development; CSUSB has created a curriculum that combines the
elements of various programs, including some elements of national security
studies. A typical CSUSB Cybercorps student is well versed in cyber security
policy, tactics, threat analysis, counter intelligence, networking, database,
offensive and defensive hacking and penetration testing, and forensics, all with
applied professional experiences. All SFS Cybercorps students are challenged in
a variety of ways including SCADA security; cyber defense and forensics
competitions; and extracurricular activities such as social engineering,
physical security, and intelligence gathering. CSUSB's service area is richly
populated with residents from diverse ethnic backgrounds, including those groups
that are currently underrepresented in cybersecurity field. Most CSUSB
Cybercorps students are first generation minority students, transferring from
community colleges, often from low-income and disadvantaged backgrounds, coming
to college less academically and socially prepared than their non-first
generation peers. From tutoring to etiquette to professional behavior, CSUSB
places great emphasis on ensuring this diverse student cohort (50% Hispanic, and
43% female) learns the skills necessary to successfully obtain and retain
professional employment. The CSUSB Cybercorps program's 98% placement rate
supports the federal cybersecurity mission.
