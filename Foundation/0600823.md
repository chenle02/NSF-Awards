Reverse mathematics is a far-reaching research program in the foundations of
mathematics, wherein core mathematical theorems are classified up to logical
equivalence according to which set-existence axioms are needed to prove them.
The degrees of unsolvability are a well known algebraic structure arising from
basic notions of relative computability and algorithmic unsolvability. In the
current research project, some outstanding problems in the reverse mathematics
of measure theory are being addressed in unexpected ways, by applying recent
advances in algorithmic randomness and Kolmogorov complexity. In the realm of
general topology, reverse mathematics itself is being extended far beyond the
standard so-called "big five" equivalence classes, to encompass much stronger
systems. Remarkable relationships are being revealed between, on the one hand,
reverse mathematics and other foundationally interesting topics, and on the
other hand, degrees of unsolvability of mass problems associated to effectively
closed sets of real numbers.

Reverse mathematics is a far-reaching research program in the foundations of
mathematics. The purpose of reverse mathematics is to elucidate the axiomatic
and logical structure of mathematics as a whole. It turns out that many core
mathematical theorems fall into a relatively small number of logical classes,
the so-called "big five" classes. Thus one sees a remarkably orderly structure.
The purpose of the current research project is to further clarify and extend
this structure. Among the technical tools being deployed are algorithmic
randomness, complexity theory, and degrees of unsolvability.
