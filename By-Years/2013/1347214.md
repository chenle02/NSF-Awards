The project conducts formal, basic research into the modeling of "intention''.
This under-researched and ill-understood concept underlies many applications,
including online search, calendars, intelligent dialog systems, security
applications, self-driving cars, military applications, and many more. This
particular project is concerned with domain-independent, formal models
underlying all such applications. 'informational attitudes' such as knowledge
and belief which capture the information available to the agent, and
'motivational attitudes' such as goals, preference and utility which capture
what the agent cares about, have been studied extensively. In contrast, and
despite their importance, "action attitudes" which capture the agent's attitude
towards different actions she might take in light of her motivations and the
information available to her, have been poorly studied. This is true in
particular of intention, perhaps the most basic action attitude, and the focus
of this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The project is grounded in the Principal
Investigator's prior work, in which he laid out a computational point of view,
dubbed the "database perspective''. That work, which offered an axiomatic theory
of the joint revision of belief and simple ('atomic') action intention, is being
extended along multiple dimensions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-- Modeling complex
intentions, using Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL).&lt;br/&gt;-- Modeling
achievement intentions.&lt;br/&gt;-- Modeling teleology.&lt;br/&gt;-- Developing
a quantitative ("probabilistic") theory of intention.
