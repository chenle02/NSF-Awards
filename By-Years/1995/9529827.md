9529827 Warburton This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project
continues development of a highly sensitive and portable vertical gravity
gradiometer. This is based on using two GWR Superconducting Gravity Sensors
(SGS) mounted with their sensitive axes co-linear and configured in a
differencing signal mode. The SGS uses a 1/2" diameter niobium sphere levitated
in a magnetic field produced by superconducting coils. The goal of this research
is to shock harden the instruments during transport and field measurements. The
technical approach uses a mechanical constraint and a clamp to immobilize the
sphere. Investigation includes: the engineering of small structures and specific
materials to minimize mechanical creep, fatigue and hysteresis; and propose
replacing the Nb sphere with Nb compounds to increase pinning forces of magnetic
flux in the sphere's surface. Remote detection an characterization of
underground targets is of great importance in environmental, geologic, mining,
engineering, law enforcement, and strategic arms treaty applications. Using
gravity gradients to determine underground density is a far superior technique
than present day gravity techniques which are time consuming and expensive. The
proposed gravity gradiometer will make measurements more rapidly, will not
require a precise elevation survey for interpretation, and will provide sharper
resolution of underground density features. The portable gravity gradiometer
would have many engineering, environmental and military applications. Examples
include: monitoring fluid leakage from waste storage area or underground tanks
into the soil; locating abandoned mine workings, natural voids, tunnels or
underground bunkers: monitoring natural geologic hazards such as volcanoes; and
reservoir monitoring of petroleum, gas, groundwater or geothermal.
