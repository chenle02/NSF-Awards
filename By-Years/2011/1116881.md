The objective of this project is to develop efficient distributed algorithms for
joint information processing, optimization and coordination of static, pervasive
sensor nodes and mobile, autonomous agents that altogether monitor and act on
the environment. The application scenarios include tracking, searching and
planning mobile agents with the underlying sensor network as a supporting
communication infrastructure, and online resource management and allocation
guided by real-time sensor detections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses
on three research problems: distributed min-cost bipartite matching, kinetic
minimum Steiner tree, and facility location for mobile nodes, by using two non-
trivial technical approaches, namely, embedding of the network metric into tree
metrics, and distributed primal dual framework. There are two central
intellectual questions investigated in this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) How
to make use of the sensor data to best serve user requests? This involves
developing communication efficient schemes for sensors detecting interesting
local events and the mobile users seeking such information to find each
other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) How to best make use of the continuity and
coherence in mobility, either in the presence of mobility enabled sensor data
(e.g., detections of continuously moving targets), as well as the locations of
mobile users? The project provides solutions that adapt to the system
configuration with low update cost, avoiding drastic sudden changes or any level
of reconstruction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project helps to extend the current
Internet to the physical world, encouraging seamless integrations of sensing and
control of the physical environment. The PI integrates the research agenda with
new and existing curriculum development for both undergraduate and graduate
education, and continues her efforts in improving female presence in computer
science and exposure of research for high school students.
