The large collections of plant specimens at Harvard, numbering nearly 5
million, form a major resource for research on Plant Systematics and related
areas. Harvard's collections are broad in their coverage and are historically
important, particularly in the study of the North American flora and the flora
of Asia. Under the previous NSF grant from 1985 to the present, 837 loans were
sent out to various U.S. and foreign institutions. These loans contained 76,225
specimens. An almost equal number were processed after return to Harvard.
152,584 specimens were added to the Harvard University Herbaria and 29,090 were
sent as gifts or on exchange. 60,472 specimens were repacketed, remounted, or
repaired during this period. Continued funding will allow for maintenance and
access to the herbaria; access will be facilitated through the streamlining of
filing and the production of finding guides, the exchange program will be
continued, collections will be annotated and types located, marked, and indexed.
