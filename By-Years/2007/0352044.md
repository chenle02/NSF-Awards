Under this award the PIs will drill the reef at Tarawa Atoll (1N, 172E) in the
central tropical Pacific in attempt to reconstruct El Nino/La Nina (ENSO)
variability over the past 10K years. The PIs propose to measure sea surface
salinity and temperature based on the 18O geochemical proxy. The PIs pilot study
at Tarawa Atoll shows that typical ENSO events occurred as early at 7,760 years
before present, during a time when some researchers say they did not detect
evidence for ENSO in Ecuador lake sediments. ENSO tropical Pacific
ocean/atmosphere anomalies are a dominant source of global climate variability,
sometimes having catastrophic consequences. Instrumental data and intermediate
and coupled models indicate that decadal and possibly millennial-scale sea
surface temperature variability in the tropical Pacific have similar anomaly
patterns to the El Nino/La Nina anomaly fields. A remarkable finding that the
ENSO fluctuations of ocean/climate change were absent in terrestrial climate
proxy records between 5,000 and 12,000 years before present has sparked new
research in the ENSO modeling and paleoceanographic communities. Climate data
for the past century show that some regions have changed their climate response
to ENSO, as the frequency and intensity of tropical Pacific anomalies changed.
