This project supports participation by US-based researchers, particularly
speakers, organizers, graduate students, and recent PhD recipients, at the
conference "Model Theory, Difference/Differential Equations, and Applications"
held at CIRM in Luminy, France, April 7th - 10th, 2015. This conference brings
together researchers in model theory, in difference and differential algebra,
and in allied fields (such as algebraic dynamics) in which theorems from model
theoretic algebra have been applied. This workshop will foster research
interactions and will provide an informal setting for graduate students and
younger researchers to learn of the newest trends in this research area and
interact with some of the most prominent researchers around the world.

In particular, this project will provide financial support to a substantial
number of graduate students and young researchers from the United States.
Differential algebraic geometry, differential Galois theory and, more recently,
algebraic dynamics have benefited from the close interaction with model theory,
especially the model theory of fields with operators. The conference aims to
catalyze further developments in this area. Details about the conference may be
