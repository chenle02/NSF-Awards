A workshop, ?US-Japan Future Network Research Collaboration Workshop?, will be
held Dec 4-6 in Honolulu, Hawaii to assemble leading network researchers from
the U.S. and Japan. This workshop is a sequel to an NSF-supported workshop with
the Japanese held October 31 and November 1, 2008 in Palo Alto California. Both
countries, through CISE/NSF and Japananese research funding agencies, have major
research efforts in networking research and in infrastructure development to
support research activities. For NSF the major efforts are NeTSE/NeTS/FIND, and
GENI and other infrastructure development awards. For Japan the initiatives
include AKARI, the Japan Gigabit Network (JGN2). Increasingly, our Nation
depends on high speed networks for national defense, commerce, and for
interactions among out citizens. Research is continually needed to lead to new
technology to improve the bandwidth, efficiency, security, and reliability of
the networks we do so much rely on. Cooperation with Japan will accelerate the
development of advanced networking technologies.
