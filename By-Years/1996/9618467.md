Bansil 9618467 This research will investigate the kinetics of phase separation
in physical and chemical gels and pre-gel branched polymers with varying degrees
of crosslinking. The work with the physical gels will focus on the role of
simultaneous phase separation and aggregation/gelation in controlling the
morphology of polymeric membranes prepared either via thermal quenching or
solvent exchange. The studies with chemically crosslinked gels will focus on the
effects of network elasticity and crosslinking on the phase separation kinetics
via the mechanisms of nucleation and growth and spinodal decomposition.
Theoretical work based on both linear and non-linear theory of spinodal
decomposition kinetics will also be done. A novel SAXS experiment is proposed to
determine the growth in the size of the precipitated particles in order to test
the applicability of nucleation and growth mechanisms which are generally
believed to be responsible for the formation of Liesgang bands in gels, and to
examine reactions under conditions where instabilities lead to the formation of
stationary patterns, known as Turing patterns. %%% This work has both
fundamental and practical implications, since phase separation mechanisms play
an important role in determining the properties of composite materials. Gels
provide a useful model system to investigate diffusion controlled reactions,
which has implications for a wide range of phenomena in chemical and biological
systems. ***
