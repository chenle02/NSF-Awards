9400171 Costa In order to understand how the brain works, it will be necessary
to decipher the codes used when one nerve cell "talks" to another. With this
award, Dr. Erminio Costa will receive support for a symposium on the topic of
undrestanding the coding of information by brain cells. The symposium, titled
"Dynamics of Neural Processing", will be held in Washington in June of 1994, and
will attract both senior and junior researchers from around the world. With NSF
support, Dr. Costa will be able to defray travel expenses for some promising
younger neuroscientists.***
