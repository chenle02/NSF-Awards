The removal of deleterious gas components is usually expensive and necessary to
limit environmental impacts. This is especially true in the use of low quality
fuel feedstocks. Social concern and Government regulations are causing industry
to support research addressing these problems. An Industry/University
Cooperative Research Center on Gas Cleaning is a possible approach for industry
to support this university research. This planning grant is studying the
feasibility and viability of forming such a Center. This planning grant is
studying the organizations, policies, and operational alternatives for an
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Gas Cleaning through a
consortium composed of New Jersey Institute of Technology, West Virginia
University, Ohio State University, and the University of Illinois at Urbana-
Champaign. A study of the research that industry would consider supporting as
part of a university research program is also being made. The Principal
Investigator and his colleagues are experts in their fields and have the
experience and industrial interfaces necessary to conduct this study. This
planning grant has been coordinated with Dr. Tapan Mukherjee, CES The Program
Manager recommends that the New Jersey Institute of Technology in collaboration
with three other universities be awarded $132,000 for a one (1) year planning
grant.
