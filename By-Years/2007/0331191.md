Abrams 0331191 The goal of this project is to gain a quantitative understanding
of the behavior of migrating cells in synthetic porous materials. Specifically,
this requires understanding the simultaneous effects of (i) the porous
microarchitecture (mean pore size, internal surface area, pore-pore correlation
length), (ii) molecular transport of stimulants, such as growth factors and
other cell-to-cell signaling molecules, via diffusion (diffusivities), (iii)
cell transport (maximum speed, persistence, dispersion), and (iv) cell response
to stimulants (chemotaxis and chemokinesis), on the observed migration speed of
a cell population through the porous medium. This will be achieved through the
development of a discrete, probabilistic model of cell motion in spatially
inhomogeneous 3-D domains, incorporating cell response to and influence on time-
dependent concentration fields of stimulant molecules. The model will be applied
to simulation of angiogenesis in three-dimensional porous matrices, where
specific goals are understanding the sensitivity of the likelihood of
anastomosis (i.e., fusing of two sprouts to form a loop) on microarchitectural
parameters and parameters describing cell signal production and reception.
Results and conclusions from the project will be incorporated as course modules
in advanced transport and numerical methods courses.
