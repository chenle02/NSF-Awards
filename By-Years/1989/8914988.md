The cosmic microwave background radiation (CBR) comes to us from further away
than any other astronomical signals. Hence it carries unique information about
the Universe early in its history and on the largest scale. In particular, the
angular distribution of the CBR can tell us about the origin and early evolution
of large structures in the Universe, such as galaxies, clusters, and
superclusters. Hence many efforts have been made to detect angular variations or
anisotropies in the CBR. Except on the 180 degree (dipole) scale, none have
succeeded. This research continues the search for CBR anisotropies on three
different angular scales, between 10 and 40 arc seconds, between 2 and 10
degrees, and between 10 and 180 degrees. Three separate techniques are used to
achieve sensitivities some three times greater than previous measurements. The
CBR also provides a way to reveal and map the density and temperature of
intergalactic plasma in clusters of galaxies (the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect);
this measurement may be combined with X-ray maps to help determine the distance
scale of the Universe.
