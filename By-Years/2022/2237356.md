Quantum computers have the potential to revolutionize the paradigm of computing
by offering a substantial advantage compared to classical computers for certain
high-impact computational tasks. The main obstacle to unleashing the full power
of quantum computers is their extreme susceptibility to noise and decoherence.
Despite the significant progress in designing fault-tolerant protocols over the
last two decades, the fundamental limits of the permissible noise on quantum
devices and the required overhead to correct the errors are not fully
understood. This project aims to develop mathematical frameworks to design and
analyze low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum computing schemes. In addition, the
project also explores the minimum requirements for reliable quantum computation.
The multidisciplinary nature of the research provides a unique educational
environment for both graduate and undergraduate students who will be trained and
mentored during this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is
to develop mathematical models to describe error propagation in quantum circuits
and use them to construct resource-efficient computing subroutines. The approach
will enable the application of classical data compression and error correction
codes in designing low-overhead reliable quantum computers. The developed
framework will be used to understand the minimum resources required for reliable
computation and to discover resource-efficient protocols by directly
incorporating the hardware constraints of quantum processors. The systematic
approach will provide an opportunity to perform computer-assisted search to find
optimized constructions. The applications of the developed procedures to protect
key fault-tolerant quantum operations such as code-switching will be
investigated. The successful completion of this effort will make progress in
lowering the hardware requirements to build reliable quantum processors capable
of accurate large-scale quantum computation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
is jointly funded by the Foundations of Emerging Technologies core research
program in the Computing and Communication Foundations Division and the
Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research
(EPSCoR).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
