This research centers on extensions and refinements of large deviations theory,
especially motivated by applications to problems of communication and control,
to comparative analysis of molecular (DNA and protein) sequences, and to studies
of queueing processes and sequential experimentation. Among the expected results
are new limit theorems for distributions conditioned on rare events of
exponentially small probabilities, and the novel analysis of the empirical law
of segments of Markov processes and Markov random fields that are selected by
means of appropriate stopping times. Another promising new approach is based on
using association inequalities (of the FKG type), and exchangeability as tools
for obtaining large deviations bounds. These bounds are applicable for the
estimation of time-varying parameters and for comparing sampling schemes in
terms of rare events probabilities. This research centers on estimating the
chances for rare events to occur, in areas where such events are of fundamental
importance. Examples include assessing statistical significance of unusual DNA
sequence segment compositions, analysis of long waiting times in complex
queueing systems, and analysis of parallel computer systems.
