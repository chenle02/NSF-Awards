While stratification researchers typically focus on education and the family as
primary institutions affecting inequality, a new institution has become of
central importance for racial stratification: the criminal justice system. With
lifetime probabilities of incarceration nearing 30 percent for young black men,
experience with the institution of criminal justice has increasingly important
consequences for racial inequality. Yet, research has only begun to examine the
social and economic consequences of large scale incarceration, and to assess the
implications for racial disparities. This project investigates the effects of
incarceration on the socioeconomic attainment in employment, occupational
status, and earnings of white and black men. It uses data from the National
Longitudinal Survey of Youth to obtain quantitative estimates of these effects
on racial stratification. It then uses in-depth interviews with a sample of
Milwaukee parolees to purse a deeper understanding of the mechanisms that
generate the quantitative effects. Together, the quantitative and qualitative
data provide for a comprehensive analysis of how race differences in
incarceration affect race differences economic success later in life.
