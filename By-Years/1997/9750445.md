This project is instituting the broad application of GPS to the analytical and
environmental tracks of the geography undergraduate programs, which serve majors
and a large number of interdisciplinary students, particularly environmental
studies students majoring in environmental planning. The institution has focused
on the development of a GPS component that links the geographic information
systems (GlS) cartography, and air photography laboratories with the
physical/environmental laboratory by revising specific coursework in these areas
to include laboratory and field experiences. The curriculum is being modified to
incorporate GPS in a logical progression of courses that start with introductory
cartography and GIS courses. These courses are followed by the use of the new
technology in several of the physical geographical courses that culminate in a
capstone course in environmental planning and decisionmaking. *
