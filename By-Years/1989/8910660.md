This planning grant issued to Rockefeller University is for the purpose of
convening a workshop to help develop a national research agenda in the area of
collaboration technology in support of scientific research. The NSF's
Information Technology and Organizations Program has recently established the
first federal government program explicitly designed to support research on
"computer supported cooperative work" and on related issues of coordination
theory and technology. This workshop will help to further develop this program
and also will define collatoral research needs in technology development,
development of group interfaces, needed research on networks to enable these
activities, and other research requirements. Of special interest for this
workshop is a research and development program leading to an electronic
"collaboratory", a "center without walls," in which the nation's researchers can
perform their research--interacting with colleagues, accessing instrumentation,
using data and computational resources, accessing information in digital
libraries--without regard to geographical location. The workshop will bring to
bear on this assignment thirty of the nation's best minds on the subjects of
concern. Rockefeller University hosts this workshop on March 12, 13 and 14,
1989, in New York City. The workshop results in a report containing the research
agenda and recommendations for organizing to accomplish the research.
