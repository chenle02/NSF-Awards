Research on the application of advanced chemical process control will be
conducted. In one project, predictive control will be applied to simple
distillation towers, to towers with sidestreams, and to trains of towers. The
use of variable combinations such as the separation factor instead of the
product purities directly as control variables also will be tested. In a second
project, short cuts on simple approximate dynamic models will be investigated.
Correlations will be attempted between the tower time constants and the key
process variables. These notions will be extended to include the control loop as
well as the dynamics of the system.
