This proposal outlines an approach for developing better methods for building
learning curves in industry and for understanding the process of learning in
manufacturing. The topic is considered to be important and the researchers well
qualified, with an unusual mix of theoretical and applied skills. In particular,
the researchers' prior experience should provide access to industry that is
necessary to successfully test their ideas. The specific focus of the proposed
research addresses some of the most critical practical roadblocks to the use of
learning curves for cost estimation, and thus the project could yield important
results for engineers and decision makers working in this area. In addition, the
basic theory behind the proposed research has been quite well worked out, with
funding requested for an investigation of the applicability and validity of the
learning rate budget concept. This mix of operational and theoretical relevance
is very appealing to the DRMS program and is considered to be necessary if
learning rate concepts are to become a practical tool for increasing the
efficiency of industry.
