The organic compound, isoprene, is an extremely important, naturally emitted
species that contributes to the chemistry of the troposphere on regional and
global scales. The details of the photochemical degradation have been studied
for some time, but there remain gaps in our understanding of rate coefficients
and mechanisms of specific processes, particularly under conditions of low
oxides of nitrogen (NOx) concentrations. This study will link expertise at two
institutions (State University of New York College of Environmental Science and
Forestry, and Mississippi State University) in (1) producing specific isoprene
derived peroxy radicals (RO2) with (2) new detection methods based on cavity
ring down spectroscopy (CRDS) in the near infrared spectral region. The tasks of
this project are to produce peroxy radicals that are generated from the attack
of hydroxyl radicals (OH) on isoprene, assign spectra to particular isomers, and
determine absorption cross sections. Then rate coefficients for the reactions of
these peroxy radicals with NO (nitric oxide), HO2 (hydroperoxyl radicals), as
well as the radical self reaction, will be quantified. From these kinetic data,
branching ratios to various product channels will be assessed. In addition,
results of detailed quantum chemical calculations will be compared with the
experimental results in order to develop predictive structure-activity
relationships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this research will lead to
improved chemical mechanisms for isoprene degradation in the atmosphere, thereby
improving chemical transport models of various degrees of sophistication. The
chemistry of related compounds (e.g. 1,3-butadiene, 2-methyl-but-3-en-2-ol, and
terpenes) will also be better understood through results of this research. The
oxidizing capacity of the global atmosphere will thus be better constrained,
given that these species together have an extremely large influence on it. In
short, this work will improve understanding of the atmospheric chemistry of
isoprene and related species. The educational aspects are significant, since a
graduate student, a postdoctoral fellow, and several undergraduate students will
be trained in areas of laser spectroscopy, kinetics, atmospheric and quantum
mechanical modeling, and biosphere-atmosphere interactions. In addition,
collaboration between the investigator's institutions (SUNY College of
Environmental Science and Forestry, and Mississippi State University) will be
fostered.
