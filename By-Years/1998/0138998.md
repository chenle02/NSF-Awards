EIA-0138998-Genevieve Giuliano-University of Southern California-SGER: Better
Freight Flow Data for Analysis and Planning&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant will
support preliminary explorations in integrating 10 datasets, some digital and
some paper, related to the modeling of the flow of freight carried by trucks,
rail, and ship in the greater Los Angeles area. The collaboration will be
between information scientists and experts in transportation planning and policy
and will involve the collaboration of several government agencies.&lt;br/&gt;
