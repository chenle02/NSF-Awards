The Library of Natural Sounds is part of Cornell University's Laboratory of
Ornithology. The Library is one of two large U. S. collections of animal sounds,
mostly bird songs. These recordings are of the highest quality, and they provide
an unmatched resource for research scientists interested in animal behavior. The
Library has an active program for adding new and unique recordings to the
collection. The collection has an international reputation for the diversity and
quality of its representation of tropical species. Dr. Christopher Clark,
Director of the Library, plans continued improvement in the services offered to
researchers and the recording capabilities used in copying and archiving
recordings. New digital tape recorders will be added to the Library's studios,
allowing exploration of this promising new technology. Animal sounds are
important components of research projects in ecology, reproductive biology,
behavior, physiology, developmental biology, and evolutionary biology. The
Library of Natural Sounds provides an indispensable service to the research
community by providing a rich and accessible source of high- quality recordings.
