9313560 Branchini The Chemistry Department of Connecticut College has been
housed in Hale Laboratory since 1953, and the building no longer provides an
appropriate environment for research and research training. The College will
renovate the structure, installing: a new heating, ventilating, and cooling
system; new laboratory spaces for faculty research; new research training
facilities for the undergraduate curriculum; facilities for biomolecular NMR
research and other computer-intensive activities; and building features that
provide access by persons with disabilities. The renovation of Hale Laboratory
will have a significant impact on the quantity and quality of research and
research training that takes place in the Chemistry Department. The department's
faculty members have an active program of research, and the building renovation
will remove several obstacles to greater research productivity. State-of- the-
art instrumentation will now have appropriate environments, and experiments that
could not be performed previously will be possible in the renovated laboratory
spaces. The research training that is integral to the undergraduate curriculum
will be expanded and modernized as a result of this renovation. Giving
undergraduates access to research environments and experiences such as these
will attract a greater number of students to careers in chemistry. ***
