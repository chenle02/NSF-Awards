The National Association of Biology Teachers (NABT) will conduct a project
using the Life Technologies, Inc.(LTI): GIBCO BRL Training Center laboratories
in Germantown, Maryland. Two-year college faculty in partnership with high
school teachers from across the nation will be updated on cutting-edge
biotechnological research and procedures. Teamed with scientists and technicians
from industry, these teachers will develop an innovative educational model to
rapidly adapt the advanced techniques and sophisticated equipment of modem
biotechnology to inexpensive, hands-on, investigative classroom activities.
These activities will allow two-year college and secondary schools with limited
budgets to provide future technicians and scientists with an excellent
scientific background in the techniques and concepts of biotechnology.
Additionally, a strong articulation between two-year and high school programs
and industry will be established to ensure that students pursuing careers in
biotechnology have the ability to enter the industrial or research work
environment, as more than competent technicians, or to pursue higher degrees at
four-year institutions. These activities will seek to involve all students in
learning biotechnology, including women, minorities, and persons with
disabilities. Emphasis will be placed on the role of biotechnology in the future
of the human environment and medicine and the effect of biotechnology on
preservation of plant species and enrichment of agriculture. Activities from
this workshop will be refined, reviewed for scientific accuracy and pedagogy,
and field-tested nationwide. Field test and review panel input will be used to
modify the activities for compilation into a monograph for nationwide
distribution. Project results will be disseminated through training and in-
service workshops at national, state, regional, and local levels.
