Partial support is provided for travel and registration fees to allow
scientists from the former Soviet Union to attend the Second International
Workshop on Materials Processing at High Gravity, to be held at Clarkson
University in Potsdam, New York. Centrifugation is proving to be a potentially
important new tool in processing of materials, particularly in the crystal
growth of semiconductor, superconductor, optical and detector materials.
Currently, many surprising experimental results have been obtained but not yet
explained. The conference follows the First International Workshop, which was
organized and held at Dubna in the United Soviet Socialist Republic in 1991 and
for which Professor Regel was the prime organizer and chair. If the growth of
crystals under enhanced gravity fields can be better understood, the potential
exists for producing semiconductor and other crystals of superior quality.
