Mathematical Sciences (21) This special project is laying the groundwork for a
collaborative effort of the Mathematical Association of America (MAA), the
American Mathematics Association of Two Year Colleges (AMATYC), and the National
Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) to lead the mathematical sciences
community in reconceptualizing and restructuring courses before calculus, so
that the needs of students in those courses may be better served. Thirty leading
mathematics educators representing these three major professional societies, as
well as eight MAA committees, are jointly identifying the challenges that must
be overcome and the strategies to do so. These include influencing the
mathematics community, developing faculty training efforts, enlisting the
support of other disciplines and business, industry, and government for the
effort, and influencing state agencies that dictate general education
requirements.
