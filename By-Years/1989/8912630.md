The project will develop the theoretical foundation for the integration of
statistics of extremes, the conditional - low probability/high consequences -
risk function f4, and the generalized concept of return period for the
management of extreme natural events such as rare floods. Four tasks will be
undertaken: a) sensitivity analysis of risk functions associated with extremes;
b) classification of Gumbel types for various risk functions; c) the application
of distribution-free results to dam-safety problems; and d) trade-off analysis
in risk management based on multiple risk information. The results will have
wide application to the mitigation of natural hazards impacts.
