Abstract

Award: DMS-0407583 Principal Investigator: Craig R. Guilbault, Fredric D. Ancel,
Dennis J. Garrity, Frederick Tinsley, Gerard A. Venema

This award provides partial support for active research mathematicians and
graduate students participating in three meetings in an ongoing series of
workshops on geometric topology. The 2004 workshop will be held in Milwaukee,
Wisconsin at the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee, with Peter Teichner of the
University of California, San Diego as principal speaker. The 2005 workshop will
be take place at Colorado College in Colorado Springs, Colorado and the 2006
meeting will be hosted by Oregon State University in Corvallis, Oregon. These
workshops are designed to focus on recent work, reported by one of its leading
investigators, and to provide a serious but informal research atmosphere in
which graduate students can meet and learn from others in geometric topology.

An additional component of this award supports work to edit, type, and
distribute several unpublished works of longtime workshop participant Bob
Edwards. These important contributions to topology include seminal work on
double suspensions of homology spheres and approximations of cell-like maps by
homeomorphisms, and will be posted on the workshop Web pages as a step toward
more formal publication.
