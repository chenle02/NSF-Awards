This award will support the participation of graduate students and postdocs in
the "Sixteenth Riviere-Fabes Symposium" that will be held at the University of
Minnesota-Twin Cities from April 19-21, 2013. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This annual
conference, of which the 2013 meeting will be the sixteenth in the series,
celebrates the mathematical legacy of Nestor M. Riviere and Eugene B. Fabes by
focusing on recent developments in analysis, especially in the field of partial
differential equations. The 2013 program will feature two principle speakers
(Mihalis Dafermos and Assaf Naor), each of whom will give a two-hour lectures,
and a number of one-hour talks delivered primarily by four mathematicians,
including two females (Marianna Csornyei, Andrea R. Nahmod, Fedor Nazarov, Peter
Topalov). The program allows ample time for informal discussion among the
participants.
