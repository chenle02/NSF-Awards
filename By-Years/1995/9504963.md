The focus of this research includes three specific areas. First, the study of
long-lived carbocations will be extended to the preparation of chiral
carbocations for use as asymmetric catalysts for the Mukaiyama reaction. Second,
Carbodications and polycations of theoretical, structural and synthetic interest
will be studied by both experiment and theory. Third, gitonic protosolvation of
alkyl cations, of carboxonium and acyl cations and dications, and of onium ions
will be studied in superacidic systems. With this renewal award, the Synthetic
Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr. George A. Olah, winner of the
1994 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, from the Department of Chemistry at the
University of Southern California. Dr. Olah continues to focus his work on the
study of organic ions and their reactions. Theoretical studies, the search for
catalytic activity , and preparative reactions will be carried out
