This award will support the participation of invited speakers, junior faculty,
postdocs, and graduate students at the Seventh Annual Red Raider Mini-Symposium
and the follow-up workshop on complex analysis and special functions that will
be held at Texas Tech University from October 31 to November 3, 2007. The theme
of the event is complex analysis, circle packing, and applications.

The mini-symposium program will feature five one-hour plenary talks by
established senior scientists (Mario Bonk, David Minda, David Mumford, Ken
Stephenson, Nick Trefethen), while the workshop?s lecture program will consist
of roughly twenty invited talks on recent developments in the thematic areas of
the conference by a mix of junior and senior mathematicians. The program will
also include a special reception at which Texas Tech undergraduates engaged in
REU-style mathematical projects will have an opportunity to meet and converse
with the plenary speakers.
