9526885 Davis The PIs propose to constrain mantle viscosity and ice history from
data obtained from project BIFROST (Baseline Inferences of Fennoscandian Rebound
Observations, Sea Level and Tectonics). GPS measurements from several permanent
networks will be used to determine the three dimensional site velocity to
constrain models for mantle viscosity and ice history. Inverse modeling methods
will be used to map out allowed combinations of ice and earth models. ***
