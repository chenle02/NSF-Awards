While implementing temporal data models can dramatically increase the expressive
power of a database management system (DBMS), processing efficiency is critical
to its success. The potentially enormous sizes of historical data, coupled with
the complexity of many temporal operators, pose challenges to the practical
implementation of a temporal DBMS. In this project, key issues related to the
optimization of temporal database processing are investigated. The focus of the
work is on joins which are found in the most common and costly queries.
Optimization algorithms for the various join operators, data organizations, and
data structures are be developed. An essential component of the optimization
process is estimating the size of intermediate results. Temporal relations are
distinct from snapshot ones, and conventional estimation techniques are
inadequate. Consequently, a new mathematical approach to estimating
selectivities for temporal data need be developed. As part of this project the
alternative algorithms are first be simulated and analyzed. Then two prototypes
(one on top of an existing relational DBMS, while the other is a direct
implementation of important temporal operators) are built to further evaluate
the optimization concepts. The results of this research will have an impact on
database technology by providing a methodology for development of efficient
temporal database systems.
