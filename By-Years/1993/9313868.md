9313868 Landolt This grant will support the continuation of a long term program
to establish standard stars for broad band photometry. These stars are needed
for the calibration of stellar photometry and are used by many investigators.
During the duration of the present grant the standard star sequences will be
extended to fainter stars and as many stars with extreme colors will be included
as possible. ***
