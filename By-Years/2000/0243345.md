ABSTRACT

Geometric methods in representation theory

Representation theory of groups of Lie type is a central part of mathematics. It
is concerned with understanding systems with symmetry by representing them in
matrix form. One of the most difficult areas of representation theory is that of
groups over p-adic fields, which has strong connections with number theory. One
of the main tools in the study of these groups is the use of affine Hecke
algebras. G. Lusztig proposes to continue the study of affine Hecke algebras
with unequal parameters and in particular to establish a geometric
interpretation for their canonical basis. Also it is proposed to establish the
existence of the corresponding asymptotic Hecke algebras. This should give new
information on the representation theory of groups over p-adic fields. It is
also proposed to further investigate the analogue of the Deligne-Lusztig theory
in the case where finite fields are replaced by certain finite rings. This again
should have applications to the representation theory of groups over p-adic
fields. It is proposed to further investigate the canonical bases of quantized
enveloping algebras from the point of view of perverse sheaves. It is also
proposed to continue the study of character sheaves on reductive groups.
Progress in these topics is expected to have applications to various parts of
mathematics and theoretical physics.

The theory of group representations attempts to study the idea of symmetry by
means of matrices, which are more amenable to computation. One of the oldest
applications of representation theory is the theory of Fourier series, widely
used in engineering and applied science. More recently, ideas from
representation theory have been used in chemistry (study of crystals) and
physics (theory of elementary particles). G. Lusztig's research is concerned
with applications of methods of algebraic topology (study of shapes by means of
algebra) and algebraic geometry (geometric study of equations) to obtain new
results on group representations which could not be obtained by other methods.
