Fluidized beds are one of the most efficient heat transfer processes. In the
proposed research, a fluidized bed will be used to add heat to an energy storage
system consisting of particles which undergo solid-state transitions. The
combination of the fluidized bed and this type of storage medium should give
rise to an unusually efficient heat storage system. The research will have both
experimental and theoretical portions. As by-products of the work, greater
understanding will be obtained about fluidized beds in general.
