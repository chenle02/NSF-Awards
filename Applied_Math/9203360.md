The principal investigators will work on problems in stochastic differential
equations and stochastic control with applications to mathematical finance. This
will include a study of the problem of general equilibrium in complete markets
and how market characteristics are affected by the preferences of the individual
agents. Mathematical studies of investment theory are important for
strengthening the infrastructure of the economic sciences. A reasonable theory
of small investor behavior in a continuous time financial market is one example
of how mathematics can successfully contribute to outstanding important economic
problems.
