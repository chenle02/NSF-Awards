Particles of similar size and shape, but different bulk densities fall through a
fluid with different terminal velocities. While this applies to pyroclastic
particles falling through air, the affect is accentuated in water, where lower
terminal velocities tend to produce a higher degree of hydraulic organization in
falling particles. These relationships, plus experimental studies relating grain
size, density and terminal velocity of volcanic particles, were used by Fiske
and Cashman to formulate a model that helps to explain many textural and
stratigraphic relationships of deposits formed by fallout from submarine
eruption columns. This project will test the model through a detailed study of
Mio-Pliocene submarine volcanic deposits now exposed in the Shirahama Formation,
Izu Peninsula, Japan. It will involve the collection of lithic fragments through
single stratigraphic units, and shape analyses of these at either Princeton or
Rutgers. Collaborators are R. S. Fiske (Smithsonian Institution) and I. Kushiro
