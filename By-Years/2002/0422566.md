The proposal requests funding for partial support for the International
Symposium on Multiparticle Dynamics (ISMD) to be held on the campus of the
Sonoma State University July 27 - August 1, 2004. This will be the 34th in the
series and the main topics for this symposium will be hadronic physics at
electron-positron, electron-proton and hadron-hadron colliders, heavy ion
physics and particle astrophysics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The funds will be used
to support students and postdocs and to help in the costs of disseminating
scientific information such as publishing the proceedings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
