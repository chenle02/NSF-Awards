9416630 Small Data collected in 1993 on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge north of the
Bouvet triple junction will be used to study the factors contributing to the
disappearance of the axial valley and the interaction of the ridge with the
proposed Shona hotspot. The objectives are to determine the tectonic history of
the ridge segment, explain the variation in axial morphology, produce a Bouguer
anomaly map, and integrate the geophysical data with geochemical results to
better understand the influence of the proposed Shona hotspot on the ridge.
