A flow metering technique is proposed based on the hydrodynamic phenomenon of
vortex formation in a flow cavity adjacent to a flow bend such as an elbow. It
has been discovered that when a circular cavity is provided at the outer side of
the bend curvature of the flow bend, a vortex will be developed in the cavity
and the strength of the vortex increases monotonically with the rate of the bend
flow. This suggests that the rate of the bend flow can be determined by the
vortex motion in the cavity. The vortex strength is determined by a free
rotatable rotor in the cavity with its rotational axis coincident with the
circular center of the cavity. The rotor so installed turns with the vortex
motion in the cavity and its rotational speed measures the vortex strength.
Thus, the bend flow can be determined by the induced rotor speed. The proposed
flow metering technique monitors a secondary flow to determine the main flow
rate which is conceptually different from conventional flowmeters which measure
directly the main flow and cause interference with the main flow field and
normally a high pressure drop. The advantage of the proposed technique is that
the flow metering element causes little interference with the main flow field.
In fact, the preliminary test shows that the introduction of a cavity and a
rotor to an elbow resulted in a more favorable flow condition and a pressure
drop reduction from the original elbow. This indicates that the proposed
technique, when successfully developed, can measure flow without causing any
additional pressure drop to the piping system or even a pressure drop reduction.
