This award provides funding support to the Conference in Harmonic Analysis which
will be held on March 16-20 on the campus of the University of Wisconsin-
Madison. The conference is devoted to recent developments in harmonic analysis.
It will feature 25 talks by leading mathematicians in the field, as well as a
number of opportunities for junior participants to share their recent work and
learn about open problems. This will be especially beneficial to graduate
students and young researchers. Funding will be available to help defray lodging
and travel expenses for speakers and junior participants. The organizers will
especially encourage the participation of women and members of underrepresented
groups.

The conference will feature recent research results and methods in harmonic
analysis. Topics will include oscillatory integrals, Fourier restriction and
multiplier problems, the role of affine invariant measures, Wolff inequalities
and decoupling, extremizers for inequalities in classical analysis, weighted
inequalities, and problems associated with measures on sets of fractional
dimensions.
