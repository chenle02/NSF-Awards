9706028 Davis A critical unresolved problem in tectonics is in understanding how
intraplate regions deform. The origin of Colorado Plateau structures, especially
folds over reactivated faults, is a primary avenue of approach to this problem
in this type area of intraplate deformation. This study of Davis is aimed at
identifying the role of the newly discovered strike-slip faulting as well as
normal faulting in the evolution of the East Kaibab fault-fold system. In this
study, Davis will map in detail and make detailed structural analysis of
selected portions of the system such that issues of structural and strain
compatibility within an oblique-slip system to be evaluated along strike and
down dip. The results of this study will bear on the relationships of basement
faulting to folding, and of the kinematics and mechanics of the propagation of a
fault zone through a mechanically inhomogeneous stratigraphic sequence.
