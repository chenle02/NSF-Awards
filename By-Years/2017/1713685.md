This collaborative research between the University of Illinois and the National
Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) is aimed at using the Blue Waters
petascale resources to address key uncertainties associated with the numerical
modeling of the Earth's climate system and the ability to accurately analyze
past and projected future changes in climate. The project brings together a team
of scientists to address these issues with well-recognized expertise in the
study of past and future projections of climate and extensive experience in
national and international assessments of climate change, as well as experts in
computer science and information technology. The petascale computing
capabilities will allow the project to pursue climate extremes and analysis of
uncertainties in ways that were impossible before by allowing for completion of
very high resolution atmosphere and ocean fully-coupled climate simulations, a
task that requires a large computing allocation only achievable on petascale
systems like Blue Waters.

This project has two purposes distinguished by the model resolution to be
employed. Both climate model simulations will be conducted with an advanced
version of the NSF-DOE Community Earth System Model (CESM). CESM, one of the
world's best models of Earth's climate system, has been developed by NCAR in
coordination with a community of scientists at universities and national
laboratories. The first purpose is aimed at better quantifying future regional
climate change, focusing on climate extremes, by running century-long, high-
resolution (0.25 degree atmosphere/land, 1 degree ocean/sea ice) global coupled
climate simulations, including multiple ensemble members of 20th Century and
future scenarios. The second purpose will be specific studies that grow upon the
project's existing Blue Water's allocation to further clarify the effects of
small-scale regional features and interactions across spatial scales in climate
through even higher-resolution climate simulations (0.25 degree atmosphere/land,
0.1 degree ocean/sea ice) that will push the state-of-the-art for such analysis.
