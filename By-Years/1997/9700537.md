EEC-9700537 Brennecke Abstract The award provides funding to the University of
Notre Dame, West Virginia University and the University of Nevada at Reno, under
the direction of Dr. Joan Brennecke, for the support of a Combined Research-
Curriculum Development project entitled, "Minimizing Environmental Impact of
Chemical Manufacturing Processes." This project will incorporate the results of
recent and ongoing research on environmentally conscious chemical manufacturing
processes into the chemical and metallurgical engineering curricula. The project
will seek to develop the students' appreciation of the impact of pollutant
release from chemical processes and of the environmental, ecological and long
term economic benefits of pollutant minimization or elimination. It will also
equip students with an active knowledge of the technology being developed to
minimize the environmental impact of chemical manufacturing processes. This will
be accomplished through involving students in the research efforts and by
incorporating the results of that research into two new elective courses and
into instructional modules that will be integrated throughout the chemical
engineering curriculum. This project's ultimate goal is to produce chemical
engineering professionals who are equipped with the awareness, knowledge and
ability to minimize the environmental impact of the chemical manufacturing
processes that they oversee.
