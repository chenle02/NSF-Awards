9615269 WHITING The Mecoptera (scorpionflies) is a small insect order of about
500 species distributed throughout the world. The phylogenetic relationships
among these insects are controversial, and there is some evidence that the two
families currently placed in the Mecoptera should be assigned to their own
orders. It also appears that the fleas (Siphonaptera), whose relationship to
other insects has long remained a mystery, are actually highly modified
scorpionflies. In this research project, Michael Whiting and George Byers will
investigate phylogenetic relationships in Mecoptera by combining data compiled
from studies on the biology, behavior, and morphology of these insects with data
from DNA sequences. Whiting will collect sequence data, and Byers will conduct
morphological studies. These data will then be used to provide a robust estimate
of mecopteran phylogeny, using a range of computational techniques. This
research should answer some long-standing questions of insect phylogeny and
yield a significant revision of insect classification. The project should also
provide an important base for evolutionary and developmental biologists who
study these insects and their genes, and serve as a conceptual and
methodological platform for future work on the phylogeny of organisms.
