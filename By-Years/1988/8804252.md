The growth in complexity of computerized systems now requires professionals who
are not just programmers, but who can also contribute to the advance of Computer
Science and to the implementation of advanced methods in their workplace. To
meet this need The University of West Florida has recently reorganized its
undergraduate programs to emphasize the discipline of Software Enginering and
the methodologies for the analysis and control of software. To complement these
changes more students should have an opportunity to participate in research. We
propose the establishment of a site for undergraduate research in Computer
Science. The initial period of operation would be for two years with seven
students being supported in each year. Students would work on specific projects
defined by faculty with careful structuring to guarantee each student's active
participation. The objectives is to provide the student with an effective
learning experience, both in the specific area in which he is working and in the
methodology of Computer Science research. Student participants will be chosen
competitively; qualified minority and women students will be specifically
encouraged to participate. Equipment and faculty time are available to sustain
the program.
