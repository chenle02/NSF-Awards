9712343 Handel Exploratory research is funded to investigate the practical
applicability of high-( paraelectric and ferroelectric materials as gate
insulation materials in heterostructure field effect transistors. The research
includes verification of stability of high-( surface barrier layers, stability
of the resulting device characteristics, possible quantum 1/f noise enhancement
through remote piezophonon effects, etc. Also included is development of an
analytical description which allows for the optimization of the HFETs. ***
