Many cognitive activities are automatic, in the sense that they are performed
quickly and effortlessly, with little conscious thought. Automatic processing
provides an important basis for a wide range of skilled behavior, from
perceptual-motor skills, such as driving a car, to high-level cognitive skills,
such as chess and mathematics. This research project addresses how automatic
processing is acquired. Understanding of the nature of automaticity has
implications for the design of training programs in education, industry, and the
military. The project concerns a theory of automatization that Logan has been
developing over the past few years. The theory assumes that automatic processing
is based on retrieving past solutions directly from memory, without any
additional computation. Automatization involves a transition from processing
based on a general algorithm to processing based on memory retrieval. The idea
is well illustrated in children's acquisition of skill at simple addition: They
begin with a general counting algorithm, which allows them to add any two
numbers, but after sufficient exposure, they memorize the basic facts and
retrieve sums directly from memory without counting. Logan's past research has
shown that this learning mechanism can account quantitatively for the increase
in speed of processing and reduction in variability that accompanies
automatization, which are the most robust phenomena in the literature on
automaticity. This project will examine the learning process more directly,
investigating the kinds of mental representations people acquire as they develop
automaticity.
