Independent Communications Associates will develop a five-part television public
television series on light, optics, and perception, entitled "Light and Mind."
The series explores both the outer, physical world of light and optics and the
inner world of the mind that processes visual information. The programs examine
the history of the subject as well as the frontiers of current research. The
project is designed to be accessible to a wide range of audiences: the series is
planned as a PBS primetime special aimed at adults while the ancillary
educational materials are targeted to high-school students. During the first
phase of planning the producers will work with their advisors, research and
write a fuller treatment of the five episodes and a full script for the first
program, create a budget, and develop an educational strategy and outline of the
educational materials.
