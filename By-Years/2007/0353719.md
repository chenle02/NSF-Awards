North Carolina Stae University continues operation of a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) Site. The REU Site is affiliated with the Physics
Department. Eleven students are recruited every year for a summer research
experience, with particular attention to recruitment of members of
underrepresented groups in the sciences and engineering. Students participate in
a variety of research projects in the areas of condensed matter and materials
physics, including research projects on nanoscience. Additional student
activities include safety training, a research ethics workshop, scientific
seminars, a graduate school application seminar, group extracurricular
activities and a final research symposium where students present the results of
their work.
