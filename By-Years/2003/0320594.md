This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
develop a novel microscale technology to aid researchers in understanding the
function of proteins in disease. The Molecular Comb technology, invented at the
Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and exclusively licensed by the company,
utilizes semiconductor photoelectrochemistry to transport charged biomolecules
inside a channel - less microfluidic chip. The key innovation of the proposed
work is to demonstrate the feasibility of using a chemically modified
hydrophobic surface gradient in concert with the Molecular Comb biomolecular
transport technology to reproducibly separate proteins on the microscale. While
many of the tools for protein analysis have been in place for decades, current
techniques such as two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, lack the integration,
automation, and speed of analysis required by research scientists. If
successfully developed, the Molecular Comb technology has the potential to
fulfill this unmet market need by providing substantial performance advantages
over competing protein analysis techniques, including automation, improved data
quality, and direct integration with a mass spectrometer.

The commercial application of this project is in the area of protein separation
and analysis.
