Arithmetic lattices in semisimple Lie groups are fundamental mathematical
objects that have deep significance in geometry, topology, group theory, and
number theory. This project considers the way in which these fields interact,
particularly the effect on the geometry of locally symmetric spaces. More
specifically, the PI will apply insights from number theory, group theory,
algebraic geometry, and low dimensional topology to study the geometric and
topological properties of arithmetic locally symmetric spaces. Special focus
will be placed on lattices acting on real and complex hyperbolic space, where a
better understanding of arithmetic lattices can shed light on several open
questions about the geometry and topology of finite volume real and complex
hyperbolic manifolds. Many well-known properties of 2 and 3-dimensional
hyperbolic manifolds lead to analogous questions in higher dimensions, and it is
of significant interest to study which of these properties are peculiar to low
dimensions and which remain true for the more enigmatic higher-dimensional
spaces.

Geometry and number theory are two of the most classical areas of mathematical
study, and the interaction between the two has fascinated mathematicians since
ancient times. This relationship lies behind countless great mathematical
advances from Euclid's Elements to Gauss to Wiles's proof of Fermat's Last
Theorem. Studying this interplay continues to bear deep fruit. Number fields are
objects related to solutions to polynomial equations with integer coefficients
(e.g., the rational numbers), and number fields give rise to an infinite family
of geometric objects called arithmetic locally symmetric spaces, which lie at
the heart of the Langlands program and often parameterize fundamental objects in
mathematics and physics. Invariants of these number fields, like the
discriminant of a polynomial, and properties of associated symmetry groups lead
to deep insight about nature of these geometric spaces. Group theory is one of
the most significant assets in the modern study of geometry and number theory,
which goes back to Lagrange and Galois's study of the roots of polynomials and
their symmetry, and the modern viewpoint originates in Klein's Erlangen program
from the 1870s. Recent years have also seen significant applications of the
geometry of arithmetic locally symmetric spaces to computer science, information
theory, graph theory, and cryptography, and the connections with number theory
and group theory are central to many of these applications.
