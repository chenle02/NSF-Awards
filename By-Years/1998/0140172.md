The investigator studies IIA and IIB superconformal field theories on a Calabi-
Yau variety in an attempt to give a rigorous mathematical definition of the
vertex algebra of the theories. This algebra is expected to be a deformation of
the cohomology of the chiral de Rham complex constructed by Malikov, Schechtman
and Vaintrob. The second aim of the project is to extend the definition of IIA
and IIB models to some singular varieties. The most pressing question is to
connect two existing definitions of elliptic genus of singular varieties, which
is a generalization of cohomological McKay correspondence. The third part of the
project focuses on problems from number theory that arise in connection with the
concept of elliptic genus and are related to products of Eisenstein series.

String theory in its various flavors is a leading candidate for the ``theory of
everything'' in mathematical physics. Its development has led to rapid growth in
several areas of mathematics, in particular algebraic geometry, which concerns
itself with spaces of solutions of polynomial equations. Unfortunately, there is
still a lack of rigorous understanding of some of the underlying rich
mathematical structures, which the project aims to rectify. Such mathematical
understanding is important, because it may be a necessity for future development
of string theory which in turn may yield a more coherent picture of the basic
processes and forces of our universe. A separate part of the project deals with
certain number-theoretical questions inspired by string theory. These are
related to long-standing mathematical problems in the theory of elliptic curves.
The theory of elliptic curves is a crucial part of the proof of Fermat's Last
Theorem and has practical applications to cryptography.
