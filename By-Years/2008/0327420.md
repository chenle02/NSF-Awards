The PIs will drill coral cores off the coast of Cuba to construct paleoclimate
records (d18O, Sr/Ca, radiocarbon). With these records they will address
questions related to the nature of climate variability in the region over the
past 200 year, and its impact on extra-tropical North Atlantic and North
America. With the availability of decadal scale instrumental sea surface
temperature records that can be used to calibrate recent coral measurements, the
record of natural climatic variability can be effectively extended in to the
past. The project will also contain a modeling component to more quantitatively
assess paleoclimatic reconstructions. Two specific objectives are included: 1)
Paleoclimatology and paleotempestology links between climate in the Caribbean/
Tropical Atlantic and continental North America; and 2) Variability in the
contribution of South Equatorial Atlantic and North Subtropical Atlantic surface
waters, which together determine the density properties of the Florida
Current.&lt;br/&gt;
