This research is a continuation of the determination of seismic wave
attenuation within the earth. Preliminary results show evidence for the
existence of a strong degree 2 attenuation in the depth range corresponding to
the upper mantle low Q zone. Data collection will be significantly increased by
including very long period fundamental mode Rayleigh wave data accumulated in
the past 2 years a 20 Geoscope stations and several IRIS stations. 3D models of
attenuation for the earth will be generated with particular attention to the
Pacific Ocean zone where a deep rooted attenuation maximum is postulated. The 3D
models will provide information on uppermantle temperature and viscosity
distributions with a goal of understanding the convective processes in the upper
mantle.
