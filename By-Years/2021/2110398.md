The project will develop algorithms that are useful for modern physics and
quantum information. In particular, the methods developed will be important for
modeling topological lasers which are applicable to photonic chips and quantum
circuitry. These applications pose challenges to the computational science and
in particular to the linear algebra algorithms so they can work with joint
measurement in multivariable setting and incommensurate observables recognizing
the theoretical limits that exist. The project will consider a variety of
multivariable linear algebra algorithms, mainly those filling an immediate need
in computational quantum physics and quantum information, but also those that
can increase the speed and accuracy of computer shape analysis. The project will
involve students and provide training in interdisciplinary projects.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop numerical methods for collections of
matrices and operators arising in quantum physics and image analysis. This
includes algorithms that work with finite-dimensional approximations to
infinite-dimensional systems, leading to better computer modeling of
quasicrystals, amorphous systems and periodic systems with defects. Methods and
algorithms to be developed will be useful in the study of topological
insulators, including periodically-driven systems. The project will study
various forms of spectra, including variations of the local density of states, a
standard tool in many areas of physics and chemistry. The anticipated work on
K-theory is expected to produce new and better tools that can be used by
theoretical physicists in numerical studies. At the core of these methods is the
study of joint approximate eigenvectors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
