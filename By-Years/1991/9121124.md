This travel grant from the Organic Dynamics Program will provide a portion of
the expenses required for US scientists to attend the XIV IUPAC Symposium on
Photochemistry at the University of Leuven in Belgium from July 19-25, 1992. The
conference will focus on various aspects of both applied and basic
photochemistry and photophysics. Issues involved in photobiology, photopolymers,
small molecule photochemistry, interstellar photochemistry, and the
environmental implications of photochemical events will be highlighted by
presentations from a distinguished array of speakers from around the world. The
challenge travel grants provided to US investigators will insure that there will
be an adequate representation from the United States at this strategic
scientific meeting in the field of photochemistry. %%% Formal presentations at
the meeting will range from discussions of the factors which govern the use of
light to make and process silicon chips for electronics applications to the use
of energy from pulsed lasers to probe the way in which many biological processes
are stimulated by the absorption of light. The role of light in the oxidation of
contaminants in water supplies, as well as the reactivity of chemical species in
interstellar atmospheres, will also be discussed.
