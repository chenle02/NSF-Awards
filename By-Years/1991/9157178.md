This is a Presidential Young Investigator Award to Dr. Julian Schroeder of the
Biology Department at the University of California, San Diego. Dr. Schroeder's
overall research goal is the elucidation of molecular mechanisms of ion
transport and primary events in environmental and hormonal signal transduction
in higher plant cells. His pioneering work in the application of techniques of
electrophysiology to plant cell biology has had a major international impact.
Dr. Schroeder also shows great promise as a teacher and mentor in training the
next generation of scientists.
