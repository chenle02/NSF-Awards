A one-day forum is being held In Seattle, Washington on November, 2003, to
discuss changing the research and education culture of the Solid Earth Sciences
(SES) through communication and integration. The forum consists of a series of
updates and presentations that serve as a platform for discussion of research
facilities and equipment, and identification of emerging needs in
cyberinfrastructure to support research and education in the SES. The goal in
facilities and equipment is to ensure sufficient infrastructure in geochemistry,
particularly geochronology, to support the increasing needs of integrated solid
earth sciences research, including research by students. The forum is another
step down the road of synthesis and integration among the solid earth sciences
disciplines. Additionally, future integrated solid earth sciences activities
such as annual forums, summer schools (to educate the next generation of solid
earth scientists within the new integrated science culture), summer retreats
(for junior assistant professors and senior post-doctoral fellows) are being
discussed. Broader impacts of forum will be to point the way to new developments
in scientific infrastructure, develop new educational models for early career
scientists, and formulate research priorities in solid earth sciences.
