With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, Harald Oser
and David L. Huestis in the Molecular Physics Laboratory at SRI International
will develop a Picosecond Resonance Enhanced Multiphoton Ionization (REMPI)
instrument for Trace Species Analysis. The new instrument will consist of a
laser ionization mass spectrometer using a tunable, variable pulse length,
picosecond laser system. The targeted analytes include nitrocompounds; organic
molecules containing halogen, metal, and heavy atoms; aromatic ketones; larger
biomolecules; and chemical warfare agents. Because of their short-lived excited
states, these molecules cannot be detected using conventional nanosecond pulse-
duration laser ionization sources.

This instrument will provide an exception opportunity for training researchers
in the use of laser ionization mass spectrometry and laser ionization
spectroscopy. The availability of an instrument capable of detecting short-lived
chemical warfare agents and explosives will also have a large impact on homeland
security.
