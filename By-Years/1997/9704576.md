9704576 Stringfellow This project addresses fundamental research issues in the
growth of III-V materials by metallo-organic chemical vapor deposition(MOCVD),
in-situ and ex-situ atomic-scale characterization of the MOCVD growth process,
with the scientific goal to understand the basic chemical and physical processes
and the fundamental mechanism of ordering during crystal growth by MOCVD. The
approach combines surface science spectroscopic and microscopic techniques to
measure structure, chemistry, and surface processes within a state-of-the-art
MOCVD reactor. The project emphasizes relating surface features such as
reconstruction and steps to ordering. %%% The project addresses forefront
research issues in a topical area of materials science having high technological
relevance to microelectronics and photonics. The research will contribute basic
materials science knowledge at a fundamental level to important aspects of
electronic/photonic devices and integrated circuitry, in general. Additionally,
the fundamental knowledge and understanding gained from the research is expected
to contribute to improving the performance of advanced devices and circuits by
providing a fundamental understanding and a basis for designing and producing
improved materials, and materials combinations. An important feature of the
program is the integration of research and education through the training of
students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area. ***
