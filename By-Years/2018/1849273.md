This award provides travel support to students from across the country to attend
the 2018 Forum on Infrastructural Resilience to Low-level Seismicity, to be held
in Stillwater, Oklahoma. Undergraduate and graduate students in data science,
geoscience and engineering will be able to take an active role in understanding
the interdisciplinary problems and potential solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
forum includes an opportunity for hands-on interaction with the latest data and
sensing capabilities. Dr. Priyank Jaiswal recently received a
Cyberinfrastructure for Sustained Innovation (CSSI) award (#1835371): Oklahoma
State University and UCSD are collaborating on the comparative characteristics
of earthquakes induced by wastewater injection. The project demonstrates an
approach using multi-sensor geoscience and engineering datasets recorded on
structures on the Oklahoma State University campus and in the field near the
location of the September 2016 Pawnee earthquake.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
