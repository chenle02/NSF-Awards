This award provides funds for a Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site
through the Anthropology Department at Kenyon College. The program is designed
to provide highly motivated undergraduates, especially women, with the
opportunity to develop their skills as archaeological field scientists while
working within the context of the Naco Valley Archaeological Project, NW
Honduras. The project focuses on student conduct of a significant independent
research project, from the enunciation of a hypothesis to final write-up,
supported by in-field class instruction and a living and working situation in
which interaction among students and research leaders is easy and yet intense.
This course of study is founded on the principal investigators considerable
experience in collaborating with and instructing undergraduates within field
settings in the past and, especially, on an NSF-REU site project which took
place during the 1988 Naco Valley season. Ultimately, the goal of the project is
to help students grow from neophyte research assistants to junior colleagues
confident in their ability to make independent research decisions and contribute
to scientific knowledge. The 1988 efforts, which form the model of the current
program, were successful in accomplishing these objectives.
