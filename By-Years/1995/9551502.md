This project dramatically changes the way students learn and use electronic
circuits by creating a hands-on, integrated electronic circuit prototyping
facility. The facility resonates with important industrial and commercial themes
in manufacturing techniques, concurrent engineering, and competitiveness. The
key ability of this facility is that it allows students the means of easily
designing a circuit board using high-functionality devices, simulating the
behavior and response to external stimuli, and quickly producing a prototype
etched/drilled circuit board. The cycle times and cost associated with producing
a high-quality prototype are greatly reduced and, for the first time, are
appropriate for undergraduate instructional purposes. This project brings an
existing, rudimentary facility to its full potential and demonstrate to the
educational community the merits of giving students a new means of expressing
their electronics skills. Included in this project are four design workstations
with appropriate software, an upgrade for an existing mill/drill machine, and
various industry-standard tools. The upgrade of this facility enables a higher
student throughput and brings a new level of electronic-related instruction to
eight core curriculum courses in this division with over 200 electrical-
specialty students. These students are gaining the ability to construct a far
higher level of real-world circuits, opening up new possibilities in solving
system level problems.
