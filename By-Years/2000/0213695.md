&lt;br/&gt;The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) at the
University of Massachusetts Amherst supports an interdisciplinary program in the
area of polymeric materials. The Center is entitled "Materials Research Science
and Engineering Center on Polymers". &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research is
organized into three interdisciplinary research groups (IRGs). Tailored
Interfaces (IRG 1) focuses on controlling the lateral order in thin polymer
films using a variety of chemical, surface structural, and applied field
techniques. IRG 2 on Structured Materials in Supercritical Fluids is concerned
with the incorporation of supercritical CO2 in polymers with emphasis on gaining
a fundamental understanding (diffusion, thermodynamics, interfacial
interactions) of the process. Aqueous Polymer Assembly (IRG 3) investigates the
assembly of polymers in aqueous solutions. The goal is to understand the
contributions of various forces (electrostatic, hydrophobic, hydrodynamic, etc)
in order to predict the final nano structured material.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center has active education and outreach programs with
special emphasis on undergraduate and K-12 teacher education. Effective links to
the liberal arts colleges for women (Smith and Mount Holyoke) have been
established. A total of 8 undergraduates will be sponsored at Smith and Mount
Holyoke. Other ties to undergraduates are developed through faculty links at
Howard U. and Harvey Mudd College. The Center's outreach to colleges is
leveraged by a NSF Research Site on Education in Chemistry award (RSEC) with
Smith, Mount Holyoke and Amherst Colleges. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The MRSEC
operates eleven shared experimental facilities which are also an effective tool
in the education outreach program. The Center has a well developed industrial
oureach program. The Center for UMass-Industry Research on Polymers (CUMIRP)
leverages the MRSEC's outreach efforts by linking industrial sponsors with UMass
research programs, faculty, and students. CUMIRP also fosters education links to
industry in the form of the industrial visitors program (several week visits by
industrial scientists at UMass), industrial scientist speaker program, and
participation of industrial scientists on dissertation
committees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participants in the Center include 34 senior
investigators, 2 postdoctoral associates, 30 graduate students and support for
undergraduates and K-12 teachers. Professor Thomas P. Russell directs the MRSEC.
