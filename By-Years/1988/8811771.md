The use of Lidar techniques has led to important advances in measuring
properties of the atmosphere below 110 km altitude. This is a region where there
is little return from radar probing, especially at night. The lidar provides
density data from the backscattering on air molecules, and thus measures the
background density, density waves propagating through the medium, and from the
rate of density decrease with height, provides data on temperature. Lidars can
be tuned to wavelengths resonantly scattered by specific atoms, and for sodium
Lidars the changes in height and vertical profile are sensitive indicators of
vertical velocity and of the passage of waves through the region 80-100 km. This
award is for upgrading and operating two lidars in a series of cooperative
campaigns with other scientists using radio and other optical techniques to
probe the atmosphere. The capability will be added to measure resonant
scattering from the layers of neutral iron and calcium and ionized calcium, and
to make daytime measurements with the newer high power lidar.
