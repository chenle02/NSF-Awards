Engineering - Civil (54)&lt;br/&gt;Utilization of daylight is one of the most
cost-effective energy-efficient strategies to design and engineer low-energy
architecture. Integration between daylight and electric light in commercial
buildings results in significant reductions in annual energy use and operating
cost. As in other engineered systems, quantification of the performance of
daylighting systems should govern their design. In the US, however, the majority
of students of architecture and architectural engineering, architects, and
architectural engineers currently use inaccurate rules of thumb or simplified
methods to design and predict performance of daylighting systems. Our faculty
team within the Program of Architectural Engineering at OSU has adopted and
implemented the approach of testing scale models to accurately predict the
performance of daylighting systems. Testing scale models has proven to be the
most accurate method in that matter. Our curriculum and laboratory development
efforts have been adapted from curriculum previously developed by faculty
members at Cardiff University in Wales. Our primary goal has been to use a
cutting-edge laboratory, the Artificial Sky Dome, to integrate the engineering
of daylighting systems into the curriculum in order to improve the science and
design skills of undergraduate students. Our secondary goal has been to
disseminate the same knowledge or skills to graduate students, faculty, pre-
college students and teachers, and professionals. The laboratory has been an
effective venue to integrate teaching and research. Expertise developed in the
laboratory is being disseminated through seminars, published papers, and OSU
outreach programs. The expected outcome from the project has been to enable
students, and apparently graduates, of OSU to effectively incorporate daylight
into the design of buildings, which should result in conservation of energy used
to operate buildings, and the mitigation of related environmental
impacts.&lt;br/&gt;
