ABSTRACT OF PROPOSED WORK

Understanding the sequential rupture of faults is one of the fundamental goals
in earthquake science. Simply stated, the question is: How do ruptures repeat on
a fault and on systems of faults? Although this question is at the heart of both
practical and academic aspects of our science, it remains largely unanswered,
mostly because data are difficult to obtain. Three of the most important issues
are 1) How regular are intervals between fault ruptures? 2) How repeatable is
the pattern of slip on a fault? 3) How does geologic structure influence fault
rupture? These are questions we propose to begin to tackle through paleoseismic
and neotectonic studies in Taiwan. During our first year, our reconnaissance
work would focus on paleoseismic investigations along the 1999 rupture of the
Chelungpu fault and on preparation of a neotectonic and earthquake source map of
all of Taiwan. The record of prehistoric seismicity along the Chelungpu at one
site we hope to begin to test a few plausible hypotheses, ranging from
unpatterned or random recurrence to highly clustered behavior. If successful,
our work will justify continued work on understanding of earthquake faults and
provide constraints on theoretical models of fault interaction. Our neotectonic
earthquake source map will provide the context for future studies of fault
behavior there.
