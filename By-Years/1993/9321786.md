In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry
Division, Continetti will study the dissociation dynamics of small gas-phase
radicals using a negative ion photodetachment apparatus. Continetti will combine
negative-ion photodetachment with neutral-fragment translational energy
spectroscopy. Systems of interest include HO2, CH3O2, C2O, and CH2CHO. The
results will provide insights into the nature of dissociative states,
decomposition pathways, and bond dissociation energies of these species. %%%
This research project will examine the molecular structure and electronic
composition of a number of unstable and transient molecules which are difficult
to study by other techniques. Possible applications of information obtained from
this research include combustion chemistry, atmospheric reactions, chemical
vapor deposition, and supercritical water reactors.
