This project involves research in computability theory (recursion theory) and
its connection with other areas of mathematics, especially combinatorics and
algebra. A particular focus will be Ramsey's theorem from combinatorics, which
asserts the existence of infinite sets which are homogeneous with respect to
certain partitions. Methods from computability theory will be used to analyze
the complexity of these homogeneous sets relative to the complexity of the
partition, both for single partitions and families of partitions. Also, the
logical strength of various versions of Ramsey's theorem and related principles
will be studied, again largely using the methods of computability theory. Other
topics of investigation include the conditions under which a Boolean algebra has
a computable copy and the conditions under which a group has a finitely
presented expansion.

The purpose of this work is to achieve a better understanding of what can in
principle be computed and of relationships among noncomputable sets of numbers.
Many proofs of mathematical results show the existence of certain sets without
giving a procedure (or algorithm) for determining membership in the sets. This
work involves an attempt to come as close as possible to giving an algorithm.
This is closely related to finding what axioms are needed to prove the result
and finding the consequences of the result. The particular result this work is
centered on, Ramsey's theorem, states, roughly speaking, that in the midst of
patterns which may be very complicated, there must be patterns which are very
simple. However, it may be impossible to compute where the simple patterns
occur, even when the original complicated patterns can be computed. In this
work, the possibilities for finding optimally simple descriptions of the places
where the pattern is simple will be investigated, as well as the consequences
that can be obtained from various versions of Ramsey's theorem in restricted
logical systems.
