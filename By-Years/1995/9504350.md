This project involves the study of polarized electron collisions with chiral
molecules, metastable states of noble gas targets, and ground-state targets of
the same atoms. The proposed experiments will address basic physics questions
about the dynamics of electron-molecule and electron-atom scattering, and may
provide the first unambiguous evidence for an electron analog to the well- known
phenomena of optical activity. Another aim of the program is new, compact
sources of polarized electron, a "turnkey" source.
