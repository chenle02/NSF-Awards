Support for a Rapid Scan Fourier Transform Spectrometer is requested. They are
requesting this equipment at this time because of the recent growth in the
fields of semiconductor and superconductor science at the University of Maryland
and throughout the world. The FTS will be used for basic and applied research in
these two areas. The work will range from materials characterization to research
on the fundamental Physics in these materials. A unifying theme will be the
study of the basic physical processes in semiconductor heterostructures and high
temperature superconductors. Processes that relate to infrared electro-optical
materials and devices will be emphasized.
