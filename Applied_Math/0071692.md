This project concentrates primarily on the investigation of mathematical
problems that arise in the study of molecular quantum mechanics. The nuclei in a
molecule have large masses. Consequently, their motion is approximately
described by classical mechanics. By comparison, electron masses are very small,
and electrons adjust their quantum mechanical states rapidly in response to the
much slower motion of the nuclei. This intuition is the basis for Born-
Oppenheimer approximations. Professor Hagedorn, his graduate students, and his
collaborators will study situations where Born-Oppenheimer approximations are
not sufficiently accurate to describe all the phenomena of interest. For
example, they plan to develop accurate "surface hopping models" to include the
possibility of electrons making quantum mechanical transitions. Models of this
type have been proposed in the chemistry and physics literature, but they have
not been derived from first principles. The main goal of this project is
rigorously to derive and implement such a model.

Motion of electrons and nuclei in molecules are well described by solutions to
the Schrodinger equation. No one has ever solved the Schrodinger equation for a
molecule, and our theoretical knowledge of chemistry and molecular physics has
come from approximations to solutions. The principal goals of this project are
to study the several commonly used approximations and to develop improved
approximations that will be useful to chemists and physicists. In addition to
theoretical understanding, potential uses of this basic research are the
synthesis of new chemical compounds, the design of new catalysts, or the design
of new drugs.
