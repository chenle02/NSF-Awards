AST-9619516 Global Statistical Models of the Galaxy. Drs. Kochanek and Di
Stefano, at Harvard University, will integrate a wide variety of observational
data sets in order to derive a model for the structure of the Galaxy. They will
use a combination of distance estimators, dynamical data, and microlensing data
in a well-defined statistical analysis. The elements of the Galactic model to be
determined include the distance scale to the Galactic Center, the rotation
curve, the disk mass and shape, the properties of the bar, the halo structure,
and orbital characteristics of Galactic satellites. The advantage of global
models, as compared to modeling isolated pieces of data on the Galaxy, is that
the constraint that all data must agree on a common mass distribution is an
extraordinarily powerful constraint. Such models and realistic estimates of
their uncertainties are the key to estimating the dark matter distribution of
the Galaxy, limiting or determining the amount of non-axisymmetry, interpreting
the results of gravitational microlensing surveys, and understanding the
distribution of Galactic components. ===============================
