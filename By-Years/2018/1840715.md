The Lake Erie Center for Fresh Waters and Human Health is a five-year, multi-
institutional effort aimed at understanding the environmental factors and
ongoing changes that influence the growth and toxicity of cyanobacterial harmful
algal blooms (cHABs) in Lake Erie. The Center will support three research
projects. Specifically these projects address the following aims: first, how
environmental cues promote or constrain the proliferation of cHAB species in
mixed populations; second, how environmental cues influence toxin production by
cHAB species; third, how other member of the microbial assemblage influence cHAB
growth and toxicity. The Center will provide a Community Engagement Core to lead
outreach activities that will inform the general public on the effects of cHABs
by efforts that include: (1) a community engaged scholarship training for
scientists associated with the Center, (2) community-engaged scholarship
training for practitioners or community members associated with the Center, and
(3) a stakeholder needs assessment for Great Lakes and environmental health
literacy to inform general outreach information needs. A citizen science
engagement with charter boat captains will further develop a near real-time
database on cHAB severity in Lake Erie, and the Facilities Core will provide
metadata that not only serve the three stated research projects, but also yield
a database available to all Great Lakes scientists. The outcomes are to involve
community stakeholders and researchers in the Great Lakes on issues regarding
human health, climate change and awareness of threats to our fresh water
resources. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center is jointly supported by NSF and by
the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences
(NIEHS).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
