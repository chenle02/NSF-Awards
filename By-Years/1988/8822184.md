Dr. David Jewitt will do an observational study of the properties of the nuclei
of comets at large distances from the Sun. The incorporation of very sensitive
charge coupled devices (CCD) into the instrumentation now makes detailed
investigations of these very faint Solar System objects practical. Most cometary
phenomena originate in the nucleus of the comet, which is a 1 to 10 kilometer
sized conglomerate of ices and dust grains. The desire to study the nucleus
stems from the need to understand how its properties influence the coma and the
tail of the comet and from the widely held view that the nucleus is a primordial
body which carries information about physical and chemical conditions which
prevailed when the Solar System formed. The most promising route to an improved
understanding of the nuclei of comets as a group is through ground based
observations. The principal scientific objective of Dr. Jewitt's investigation
is to determine the statistical physical properties of a group of comet nuclei.
