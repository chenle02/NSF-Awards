The fourth Solar Cycle Workshop will be conducted at Sacramento Peak, New
Mexico, during October 15-18, 1991. The conference is concerned with various
aspects of solar cycle variability including study of such pulsations in solar-
like stars. This is a subject of major interest to the STR program, since it
could lead to better understanding of the historical variability in our sun,
including estimated of frequency of such events as the Maunder and Sporer
minima. Funds are requested for invited participants and students.
