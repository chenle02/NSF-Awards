This project explores improved and expanded methods that allow optical crossbar
switches to be used more effectively in multiple switch mesh networks over large
distances. The primary research objective is to develop new control methods for
wide area optical network (WAON) configurations using the techniques of packet
switching, global status tables and out-of-band control. The anticipated results
of the work include the ability to expand the size (number of nodes) and extent
(distance between nodes) of supercomputer networks tasked to solve large scale
computing problems. Applications include gigabit LANs, supercomputer networks,
and avionics networks.
