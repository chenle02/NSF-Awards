Distributed applications comprising components from
multiple&lt;br/&gt;administrative domains, pose scalability and availability
challenges&lt;br/&gt;because of the lack of a central administrative authority.
This&lt;br/&gt;project investigates, in the context of the Web Services
architecture,&lt;br/&gt;whether application-level intelligence on the network
path between&lt;br/&gt;clients and services can help address these challenges.
The&lt;br/&gt;intelligence is embodied in modules for inspecting client
traffic,&lt;br/&gt;making decisions about service actions such as replication,
request&lt;br/&gt;redirection, or admission control, and finally realizing
these&lt;br/&gt;actions. The project combines a system architecture for
executing&lt;br/&gt;service-specific actions at intermediate routing nodes
with&lt;br/&gt;application-neutral algorithms for servicing client requests
closer to&lt;br/&gt;the network edge. Both the architecture and the algorithms
work with&lt;br/&gt;a semantic framework, which treats service requests as
structured&lt;br/&gt;accesses against a (physical or virtual)
database.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merits of the activity include
(1) development of&lt;br/&gt;novel techniques and algorithms for automatically
scaling&lt;br/&gt;component-based services in response to adverse client and
network&lt;br/&gt;load conditions; and (2) investigation of architectures for
securely&lt;br/&gt;and efficiently realizing service-specific actions on client
requests&lt;br/&gt;closer to the network edge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
impacts of the activity include (1) techniques for improving&lt;br/&gt;the
resilience of the nation's cyber-infrastructure against
malicious&lt;br/&gt;attacks; and (2) integration of the research results into
an&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate-level course that will train students to
build&lt;br/&gt;component-based distributed systems.&lt;br/&gt;
