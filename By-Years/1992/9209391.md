This research program addresses the problem of anomaly detection and
identification in solid mechanics. There are two objectives in this proposal.
The first is to develop robust operational procedure for detecting mechanical
anomalies in solids based on a continuous monitoring of surface strain
measurements. The second is to develop a method of identifying the
characteristics of the anomaly for the special case of a single growing crack or
a system of microcracks. These objectives can be achieved by developing and
using a new concept of signatures and testing the procedures using numerical
experiments. The concept of signatures is related to the idea of path-
independent integrals but are based on a discrete number of measurement points
and hence are a-priori aimed at experimental implementations. The numerical
experiments will use the Boundary Element Method (BEM). A technology of anomaly
detection and identification would have various applications. For example,
critical structures approaching their design service life may adopt this
technology in order to have an early precursor of possible failure. This
technology would also be an important ingredient in the development of
intelligent structures where an efficient self-monitoring system is valuable.
