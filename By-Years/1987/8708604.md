This project involves detailed experimental studies of crystal- fluid-melt
equilibria for natural melt compositions in equilibrium with C-O-H fluids.
Specific objectives of the project include the determination of mineral-melt-
vapor relationships for a Mt St Helens andesite and for the Fish Canyon
(Colorado) tuff and the development of these and other phase equilibrium data
for use as geothermometers, geobarometers, and geohydrometers. The results of
these studies will enhance our understanding of the evolution and behavior of
volatile-rich calc-alkaline magmas. These data are essential to our
understanding of eruptive cycles of explosive volcanos such as Mt St Helens.
