9309286 Wang, Allen This award supports collaboration between researchers at the
University of Wyoming and the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of Systems
Science, Beijing, in development and study (both theoretical and experimental)
of methods and techniques which allow computation of an approximation to the
solution of a differential equation in an efficient way. The work proposed will
draw on the complementary skills of the Chinese group, headed by Professor Lin
Qun, in numerical analysis, particularly on finite element method, and the
skills of the Wyoming group in large scale computation and mathematical
modeling. Mathematical models and scientific computations are playing an
increasingly important role in many applied fields such as weather prediction,
energy conversion analysis and design, contaminant transport, etc. The proposed
research has important implications for contributing to practical solution of
such problems through advanced numerical methods. The combination of theoretical
strengths of the Chinese participants and the practical experience of the US
participants should produce results which neither group could accomplish without
the collaboration.
