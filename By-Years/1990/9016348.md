The rapid development of fiber-optic technology has made possible data
transmission speeds of gigabits per second. This research explores routing
algorithms for such high speed networks. It is believed that the development of
high speed networks will proceed in two phases. In phase one, the topology of
current networks will remain the same,but the relatively low speed links will be
replaced with optical fiber links. In phase two, new network architectures
specifically suited for high speed links will be developed. This research will
develop routing algorithms for both phases. In particular, optimization-based
routing and network reconfiguration algorithms are to be developed for phase one
and deflection routing for networks with regular structures for phase two.
