This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project proposes to optimize
and commercially apply a newly discovered carbon material that simultaneously
exhibits high gas-phase adsorption of mercury and low wet-concrete adsorption of
organic surfactants. Such a material is necessary if coal-fired power plants are
to inexpensively retrofit sorbent-injection technology to comply with new limits
on mercury emissions while continuing to sell their fly ash wastes as
substitutes for cement in concrete construction applications. The material will
be tested at both the pilot and full scales, paving the way for product
commercialization.

The broader impact that could be achieved from this project will be a solution a
serious pending economic and environment problem. The substitution of power-
plant fly ash for manufactured Portland cement in construction applications is
one of America's biggest recycling successes. Fly ash could lower the
construction-industry concrete costs, increase the technical performance of the
concretes, and preserve the environment by conserving energy and reducing both
waste disposal and CO2 emissions.
