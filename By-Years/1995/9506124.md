This research will focus on interactions of phosphatidylinositol-specific
phospholipase C (PI-PLC) and sphingomyelinase with various lipid membrane
systems. The major points to be addressed are the mechanisms of action of these
enzymes, substrate specificities, the way in which the enzymes interact with
lipid surfaces and the nature of activation by the lipid interface. With this
RUI award the Biophysics Program is supporting the research of Dr. Gary O.
Spessard of the Department of Chemistry at St. Olaf College. Professor Spessard
will focus his work on understanding the interactions of enzymes with lipid
substrates at an interface. The research will study the recognition processes,
the mechanisms for enzyme binding at an interface, the activation processes at
the interface, the regulation of enzyme activity and the mechanism of catalysis.
