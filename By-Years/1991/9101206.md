This workshop will contribute to developments in both practical and theoretical
statistics. Its contributions to practice will be dissemination of experience in
applying Bayesian methods and the identification of specific theoretical and
implementation tools that can aid in the convenient, routine use of Bayesian
methods. It will contribute to theory by providing a collection of concrete,
contextually grounded research problems in the light of which actual and
potential theoretical developments can be examined. The workshop will be held in
September, 1991 at Carnegie- Mellon University. It will include those who use
and develop statistical theory and methods, and several applications will be
presented in length, with a thematic focus on the contribution of the Bayesian
theory of statistics. This conference has the potential for great impact in the
field of statistics. Bringing together good statistical theory and computing
power to solve a real problem is the direction of future research.
