The National Science Foundation will support a special session on sign language
to be held in conjunction with the thirty-fifth annual meeting of the North
Eastern Linguistic Society, hosted by the Department of Linguistics at the
University of Connecticut, Storrs, from October 22nd to 24th, 2004. The annual
conference provides an international forum for the dissemination of current
research and exchange of ideas in generative linguistic theory. The special
session will bring researchers on sign languages together with theoreticians
whose empirical basis has largely been data from spoken languages. The main goal
of the conference is to offer a venue for cross-pollination among groups of
researchers who might not typically be exposed to each other's research
results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Studies of sign languages provide an important
perspective on the study of the human capacity for language. It is now
established that these languages have the formal properties (such as syntax and
the formal elements characteristic of phonology) of other natural languages, as
opposed to other communicative systems, such as gesture. Research into sign
languages thus provides not only an additional range of data for testing the
hypotheses of linguistic theories, but in particular permits investigation of
the degree (if any) of the modality-dependent character of linguistic
principles. In addition to the research interactions that conferences provide,
this conference will contribute to promoting an understanding of the nature of
American Sign Language, and sign language more broadly.&lt;br/&gt;
