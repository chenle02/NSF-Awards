Undergraduate research experience is available in all disciplines within civil
engineering in coordination with sponsored research conducted in the department.
Direct research experience is reinforced by the special twice-a-week research
seminar and final paper requirements. Appropriate research projects are chosen
by the coordination committee. Continuation and expansion of student interest is
enforced by yearly visits to regional campuses by the program coordinator and
presentation of the students' paper at their home campus student chapters of the
American Society of Civil Engineers.
