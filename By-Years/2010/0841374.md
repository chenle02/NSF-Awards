Abstract: Sustainability Science for Sustainable
Schools&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project teams faculty and graduate-student
researchers from Arizona State University?s School of Sustainability with high-
school teachers, students, and administrators to address the challenge of
becoming a ?sustainable school.? &lt;br/&gt;Fellows, guided by faculty members,
will help teachers and students use scientific methods and tools to collect data
on sustainability indicators on food, energy, water, waste, landscaping, and
quality of life at their schools. Students will collect, analyze, and
graphically represent scientific data and then communicate their findings and
solutions at community forums and science fairs. &lt;br/&gt;?Sustainable
Schools? will influence the curriculum and practices of three large school
districts in Greater Phoenix. School districts, teachers, and students across
many city boundaries will gain access to original research in a new and
exploding field of inquiry of sustainability science.&lt;br/&gt;In turn, the
K-12 community will greatly assist graduate students in the world?s first School
of Sustainability. The project will: 1) enhance graduate training and career
trajectories; &lt;br/&gt;2) sharpen collaboration, problem-solving, and
interdisciplinary skills in real-world contexts; &lt;br/&gt;3) empower Fellows
to be better teachers by training them in curriculum and science-based
instruction; 4) help school districts integrate sustainability research into
curriculum and operations; 5) improve teachers? ability to integrate
sustainability concepts into their teaching; 6) expand teachers? ability to
develop interdisciplinary curriculum; 7) increase awareness of high-school
students about global and local sustainability challenges and encourage them to
pursue careers in science, engineering, math, and technology.&lt;br/&gt;
