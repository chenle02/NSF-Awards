Physical characterization of turbulent flow with suspended particles has
remained a challenge requiring much effort in both direct computational analysis
as well as accurate high resolution measurements. The holographic particle image
velocimetry (HPIV) technique has been applied effectively for investigation and
characterization of single phase flows seeded with tracer particles (small
Stokes number). Extension of this method to particle-laden flows for 'high-
resolution' characterization of the behavior of the carrier fluid as well as
characterization of the suspended particles (with large Stokes number) and
particle dynamics has remained a challenge.

This proposal makes use of the unique HPIV facilities developed by the PI at the
host institution in an attempt to develop an extended HPIV technique for full
characterization of the particle-laden turbulent flow. If successful, the
approach is particularly effective since the measurements can be at the spatial
resolution comparable to the resolution in direct numerical simulations (DNS).
This will allow direct comparison with DNS results, as well as complement the
more engineering based models and large eddy simulations.
