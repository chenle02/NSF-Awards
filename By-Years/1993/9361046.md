9361046 Livesey The objective of the project is to determine whether full
thickness composite skin can be reproduced in a relatively short time. The
investigator aims to culture keratinocytes onto a processed dermal matrix,
AlloDerm, which is currently under investigation as a foundation for a thin
split- thickness skin graft. Investigations will focus first on optimizing
growth under standard conditions and then in co-culture with dermis. Co- culture
conditions will be assessed for the impact on wound healing in the nude mouse
model. ***
