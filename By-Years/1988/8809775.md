The Topical Meeting on Short Wavelength Coherent Radiation will bring together
the most active scientists in the development of short wavelength lasers, free
electron lasers, laser-plasma radiation sources, and ultra fast short wavelength
sources, as well as those using such developments in other areas of physics and
engineering. This conference fills a particularly useful role in these areas,
and is an internationally-recognized meeting place.
