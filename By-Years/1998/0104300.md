This grant supports theoretical research on the dynamics of physically adsorbed
layers of atoms and molecules on solid surfaces. The goal is to achieve a
quantitative understanding of the interaction of atoms and molecules with
surfaces in examples where the adsorbate and substrate are weakly modified by
the interactions. The work is a combination of analytically-based theory and
computations which can be performed using work stations. The topics include the
analysis of the normal modes (phonons) of solid layers and of processes which
contribute to the dissipation of energy initially in the layer, such as
vibrational damping and sliding friction. %%%
