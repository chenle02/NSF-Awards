The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) at Harvard
University supports an interdisciplinary research program that includes faculty
participants from the Division of Engineering and Applied Sciences, the
Departments of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Physics, Earth and Planetary
Sciences, and the Medical School. The MRSEC research is organized into four
interdisciplinary research groups (IRGs). IRG1, Multiscale Mechanics of Films
and Interfaces, investigates the mechanical properties of thin films at scales
intermediate between atomistic and continuum. IRG2, Engineering Materials and
Techniques for Biological Studies at Cellular Scales, focuses on understanding
the mechanical properties of the cell and its structural components. IRG3,
Interface-Mediated Assembly of Soft Materials, explores innovative ways to make
self-assembly of soft materials by using interfaces as template for growth. The
Center also supports seed research projects in potentially high-risk areas.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center's research benefits from extensive shared
experimental facilities that provide research support and training of students.
The MRSEC operates a broad education and outreach research program that includes
summer research experiences for undergraduates and teachers, activities for K-12
students, and a new program to enhance the participation of members of
underrepresented groups in science and engineering at the graduate and
postgraduate level. The Center also has research collaborations with industrial
and national laboratories, and runs research workshops that include participants
from industry and teaching colleges in the New England
area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participants in the Center currently include 30
senior investigators, 7 postdoctoral associates, 14 graduate students, 2
undergraduate students and 6 support personnel. Professor David Weitz directs
the MRSEC. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt
