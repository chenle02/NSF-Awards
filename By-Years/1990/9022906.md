This project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division is a
study involving six experiments dealing with various topics in photochemistry
and chemical dynamics, each designed to provide new insight. Among the
experiments are a three-dimensional sub-Doppler spectroscopy applied to the
photodissociation of water; looking at the reaction CN + HCN going to CNH + CN
using isotopically labeled reagents; a test of the inversion mechanism in the
reaction of H with SiD4 or CD4; Rydberg atom chemistry in the Cs + H2 reaction;
looking for spin-aligned products from Hg* + H2; and an intramolecular reaction
in 3-fluoropropanol initiated by photodissociation of the OH (or OD) bond to
give HF (or DF). %%% One of the goals of a chemist is to elucidate
experimentally the elementary mechanisms of a chemical reaction as simply and
directly as possible. Chemists are constantly proposing new methods to reach
this goal. This project covers six types of elementary chemical reactions which
will be investigated by new methods or which will be studied for the first time
to illustrate a general principle. The results of such an investigation will
allow chemists to gain valuable insights into how chemical reactions occur on
the atomic and molecular level.
