While archaeologists have studied site building processes in the American
Southwest, less is known about the use-life of buildings and abandonment
processes. Understanding these processes is critical because they link site
occupation and the structural remains and artifacts left in the archaeological
record. In the course of this project, the researcher will study the
architectural changes and sequential abandonment of houses at Old Oraibi, Hopi
reservation, Arizona to test a model of structural abandonment. The research is
novel in its use of photographic, cartographic and ethnographic information.
This project will enable anthropologists to better understand the abandonment
processes at prehistoric and historic Southwestern pueblos. In addition, the
data will provide new information on architectural change in contemporary pueblo
societies.
