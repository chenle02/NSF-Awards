This support is for a conference titled "Interfacial Structure, Properties and
Design." The purpose of the symposium is to provide a forum for discussion of
structure-property-composition relationships for grain boundaries and two phase
interfaces. Researchers in the behavior of interfaces in metals, ceramics and
semiconductors will interact with counterparts in the development and
manufacture of these materials. Increased understanding of localized deformation
and fracture at interfaces and new insights into the role of grain boundaries in
ceramics should result.
