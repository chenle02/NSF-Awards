This project improves undergraduate construction education through the
development of a computer-driven video-editing system which will enable students
to collect time-based data from field operations and analyze it in the
laboratory. The importance of the system lies in its ability to compress the
playback time and reduce the amount of data viewed to the required level of
detail. The equipment used for the development of the above system includes: (1)
a video camera, (2) two VCRs, (3) an IBM compatible PC, and (4) an erasable
optical disk. The system is used to provide undergraduates with direct
experience in design and improvement of construction operations. Students record
construction operations, develop data for presentations or as input to
simulation models, and prepare recommendations for improvement.
