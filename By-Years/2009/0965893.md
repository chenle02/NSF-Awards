Delaware State University's DSU-STEM project is integrating seamlessly with the
university's NSF-funded HBCU-UP program. The DSU-STEM project is supporting
cohorts of 5-6 students for 2 years in each of the first four years of the
project. Prior to the start of their freshman year, DSU-STEM Scholars
participate in a one week summer training camp that focuses on developing
problem solving and analytical reading skills. On campus, each DSU-STEM scholar
becomes part of a freshman learning community. This cohort of 5-6 students is
lead by a peer mentor trained in intrusive mentoring and a faculty advisor who
holds biweekly meetings with the students and the peer mentor. Each entering
cohort of DSU-STEM Scholars takes a one-credit-hour professional development
class that is team taught by the DSU-STEM staff. The staff also meets monthly
with all Scholars for a workshop, career seminar, or scientific talk. In
partnership with the Science Resource Center supported by DSU's HBCU-UP and
LSAMP projects, the DSU-STEM Scholars receive assistance in applying for funded
research internships at DSU or another university.
