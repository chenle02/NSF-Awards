This Symposium is aimed at a theme of "computationally intensive methods in
statistics". It will be held on April 21-23, 1988 in Washington, DC metropolitan
area and hosted by the center for Computational Statistics and Probability at
George Mason University. The keynote speaker is Brad Efron who will speak on
computationally intensive methods in statistics. The program includes a
collection of sessions on computationally intensive methods in statistics, a
section on computing science related to these methodologies and two new
features, an interdisciplinary session and a session focusing on the work of
recent PH.D's. A newly formed, non-profit, educational corporation is sponsoring
this Symposium. The corporation is established to make more efficient use of
funds, to wean the symposium series from dependence on federal funding and to
provide in an orderly way carryover funds for initiating subsequent Symposia.
