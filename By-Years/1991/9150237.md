This, three year, nationwide program provides opportunity for middle and high
school biology teachers to spend a summer doing research, full-time, in a
college or university laboratory engaged in research in cell biology. This
program emphasizes the identification of highly motivated teachers who will
return to their home school and have the opportunity to have a continuing impact
on the quality of science education through the design of innovative laboratory
exercises and through the provision of in-service instruction for other
teachers. Participating teachers will share classroom activities and information
regarding issues in pedagogy and science education reform at a meeting held in
conjunction with national NABT meetings. Emphasis will be placed on the
involvement of female and minority teachers and on school systems that serve
large numbers of minority students. It is expected that this program will have
an impact on science education at the secondary level and have at least an
indirect impact on career choices made by some secondary students. An amount
equal to 23.1 % of NSF costs will be provided as cost sharing.
