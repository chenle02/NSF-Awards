This research project concentrates on the biology of the hydrothermal vent
tubeworm, Riftia pachyptila. This animal contains symbiotic chemoautotrophic
bacteria which appear to supply all of the nutrition for this gutless host. It
is the only member of the phyla Vestimentifera and Pogonophora accessible for
detailed ecophysiological studies. Studies will concentrate on the ways this
species is able to utilize the inorganic carbon dioxide of the surrounding sea
water to produce directly a major portion of the biomass of this community. The
3 major research areas to be investigated are: a) metabolic pathways involved in
the transport of carbon dioxide from the plume to the symbiotic bacteria in the
trophosome, b) the excretion of reduced organic compounds by the symbionts, and
c) the possible role of bacterial cell wall material in the transfer of carbon
to the host. To accomplish these research goals studies will utilize whole
animals maintained in high pressure aquaria immediately after collection,
perfused tissue preparations, and purified symbiotic bacteria. The main tool
used in this research is incubation with radioactive markers (and sometimes
metabolic inhibitors) with a subsequent identification of the metabolites in
which these markers have been incorporated.
