As a result of increasing demand for chemicals, the industrialized world faces
the problem of release of these often toxic substances in the environment. There
is therefore a need to assess the impacts of these toxicants on the environment.
The major objective of this research project is to develop an enzymatic toxicity
testing method. The enzymatic activity of betagalactosidase in E. Coli will be
used as the toxicity testing mechanism. Various toxicants including inorganic
and organic substances will be used for study. The toxicity assay will be
further studied to better understand the effects of toxicants on enzyme
induction by a gratuitous inducer such as isopropylthiogalactoside (IPTG). The
development of a miniaturized test and the use of immobilized E. Coli cells will
also be considered. Various means to: sensitize E. Coli cells to environmental
toxicants will be explored. The principal investigator is highly qualified to
perform this research. A two year continuing grant is recommended. This award is
for $90,198 for the first year.
