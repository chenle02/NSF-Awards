This is funding to support 10 of 14 promising doctoral students who will take
part in a two-day doctoral research consortium (workshop) that will be held as
part of the 2023 ACM SIGCHI Conference on Designing Interactive Systems (DIS
2023). The conference will be held in Pittsburgh July 10-14 with the doctoral
consortium taking place July 10th & 11th. The annual Designing Interactive
Systems (DIS) conference, sponsored by the Association for Computing Machineryâ€™s
Special Interest Group on Computer Human Interaction (ACM SIGCHI), is the
premier international forum where approximately 350 interdisciplinary HCI
researchers and practitioners from around the world come together each year to
debate and shape the future of interactive systems design. Research
contributions are peer-reviewed and widely cited.

The ACM DIS Doctoral Consortium is an important forum to help strengthen and
advance diverse contributions to scholarship and practice from young and
emerging researchers from a range of backgrounds. Students selected to
participate in the event will have the opportunity to present, discuss and
receive feedback on their research with a panel of five senior, internationally
recognized, and distinguished researchers. They will be able to take part in the
entire conference, will present a poster of their work, and will interact with
an international audience of interdisciplinary researchers and industry
professionals in HCI, design research, and interactive systems. The 2023 event
will be the first opportunity for an in-person and in-situ workshop since 2019.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
