Two dynamic allocation problems are considered in this research. The first is
the so-called "Multi-Armed Bandit Problem" (MABP), which has applications to
scheduling in job shops and in optimal replacement of parts. It has been shown
that the general N dimensional MABP can be reduced to N one-dimensional problems
involving a single project, the solution of which is the dynamic allocation
index value for the current state of the project. The principal investigator
proposes a new approach for calculating the dynamic allocation index value and
will investigate how this approach can be applied to several problems in
sequential statistics and stochastic scheduling. The second part of this
research deals with the relationship between closed (no arrivals) and open
(arrivals) stochastic scheduling problems. The aim is to understand the role
played by the arrival process on the optimal policies.
