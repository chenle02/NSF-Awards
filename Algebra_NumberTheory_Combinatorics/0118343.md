This award funds a conference in algebraic geometry at the University of
Missouri-Columbia, April 5-6, 2002. The conference focuses on Hilbert schemes,
vector bundles and their interplay with representation theory. It has two main
goals. The first is to provide a forum for algebraic geometers to meet with
colleagues and learn of recent research developments in these focused areas. The
second is to give graduate students, recent Ph.D's and women an opportunity to
broaden their mathematical horizons. The conference includes 8 hour-long invited
talks addressed by leading mathematicians, and about 20 shorter communications.

The focused areaes of the conference are at the central stage of recent
confluence between mathematics and physics. The mathematical achievements in
these focused areaes provide solid mathematical foundation to the physics
theories which are vital to explain the universe. In addition, the conference
will have a high impact on diversity, as well as scientific and educational
activities.
