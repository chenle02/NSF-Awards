This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) program entitled,
"Nano/Microtechnology Undergraduate Course," at Loyola Marymount University,
under the direction of Dr. Rafiqul I. Noorani, is jointly funded by the
Directorate for Engineering (ENG), Division of Bioengineering and Environmental
Systems (BES), the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS),
Division of Physics (PHY), and the Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO).
The proposed project will: 1) develop and disseminate a new interdisciplinary
sophomore course on nanotechnology, combining biology, chemistry, physics,
materials science, electrical/mechanical engineering; 2) develop new research
projects for undergraduates; and 3) teach a nanotechnology workshop to high
school science teachers.
