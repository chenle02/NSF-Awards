Proposal: 1445342&lt;br/&gt;PI: Mirov, Sergey&lt;br/&gt;University: University
of Alabama at Birmingham&lt;br/&gt;Title: EAGER: Portable photoacoustic platform
for glucose sensing&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI proposes to develop and build a
working prototype of a true noninvasive, portable hand held, low cost device for
blood glucose level monitoring in home or clinic settings. If successful, this
device will substantially improve the quality of life of millions of people with
diabetes by eliminating discomfort and pain associated with the necessity to
puncture fingers, and reduce the probability of developing chronic diabetes
complications due to poor management of blood glucose levels. The device could
be also used for continuous blood glucose level monitoring in clinic and
hospital settings. The proposed platform can also be used for development of
other applications such as detection and monitoring of chemicals of interest in
aqueous solutions for environmental studies, and in industrial
settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The device will be based on a wavelength
modulation (WM) photoacoustic (PA) spectroscopy in the near-infra-red (IR)
spectral region. It will consist of a portable acoustic cell, a portable broadly
tunable diode pumped Cr:ZnSe laser, pioneered by the PI group, and a smartphone
for measurements control and data analysis. This novel wavelength modulation
technique is essentially a zero background method, which will substantially
improve sensitivity of current photoacoustic methods for glucose level
monitoring. The absence of a strong background due to water absorption will not
only improve sensitivity of the device, but also eliminate the necessity to
perform arduous data treatment algorithms for extracting weak glucose absorption
signals masked under a strong background. This will enable the use of devices
with low computational power, such as smartphones.
