9523403 Nowlin This project wi1l address the need for a new approach to making
current meter measurements in remote locations. PIs at Oregon State University
have developed various components of an expendable current meter mooring that
will, at a present time, release its mooring, rise to the ocean surface, and
transmit data via the ARGOS satellite system. In this exploratory project, three
of these systems will be purchased, and three entire configurations will be
tested in an accessible location prior to committing to a purchase of ten for
deployment in the Antarctic. If successful, ten systems will be deployed in the
Indian Ocean region of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current during a WOCE cruise on
the R/V Palmer in 1996. The primary justification for this cruise has been
determined in an already-reviewed proposal that will be recommended for support
in FY96. While the current meter arrays will add crucial information to the WOCE
Indian Ocean Survey, further testing is an essential precursor to actual
deployment. ***
