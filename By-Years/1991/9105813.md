The Beckman Institute at the University of Illinois will purchase three
machines, one high power color graphics workstation, and two lower-power
workstations. The equipment will be used for three primary research projects:
(i) Studies of weak turbulence in two model systems, the Ginzburg-Landau
equation and the Zakharov system; (ii) Control of weakly turbulent systems using
a technique that requires no feedback; (iii) Forecasting high dimensional
chaotic dynamics using a learning algorithm that discovers predictable regions
of a system's state space.
