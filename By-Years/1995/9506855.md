9506855 Wray Enormous strides have been made recently towards understanding the
molecular genetic basis for body pattern development in animals. With the
breakthroughs, however, have come new questions. In particular, the expression
of many patterning genes is remarkably conserved among morphologically distinct
animals. Dr. Wray proposes to examine the expression, function, and evolution of
several patterning genes in echinoderms, a phylum with a highly modified, radial
body organization. His analysis will focus on genes whose expression is
conserved in insects and vertebrates, but likely to be modified in radial
animals. He will first characterize their timing, spatial domains, and
transcript sizes. Genes expressed during radial body development will be
selected for a detailed comparative analysis among phylogenetically diverse
echinoderms. These data will be used to reconstruct the evolutionary history of
expression changes during the origin and diversification of the phylum. He will
manipulate the timing of adult development using environmental cues to test the
hypothesis that the timing of patterning gene expression in this phylum is not
"hardwired". Together, these studies will ad d considerably to our understanding
of the developmental and evolutionary significance of genes with roles in body
patterning. ***
