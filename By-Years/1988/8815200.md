Dynamic mechanical analysis is an essential characterization technique for a
wide variety of materials. Cooper's current dynamic mechanical testing is
performed on an aging and increasingly unreliable instrument. This grant will
permit the purchase of a dynamic mechanical analyzer with expanded capabilities
over his current instrument.
