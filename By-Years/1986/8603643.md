This proposal addresses studies of nonlinear dispersive wave propagation using
experimental, theoretical and numerical methods. Solitary waves are pulses that
can travel without distortion in nonlinear media. The aim of the work is to
provide heuristic methods of derivation in place of abstract mathematical models
to describe the evolution, stability and propagation of soliton pulses. These
approaches can enable rapid assessment of the existence and nature of solitons
that a given physical system can support. The studies will be applied to the
effects of self-refraction on the propagation of high power laser beams in
nonlinear media and will aid in the understanding of pulse propagation in
nonlinear optical fibers. They will also be applied to problems of high
resolution acousto-optic beam deflection.
