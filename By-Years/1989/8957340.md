This Presidential Young Investigator award is to support research into the
molecular biology of membrane proteins in the department of Biological Sciences
at Stanford University. The specific class of membrane proteins under
investigation are the anion transporters, which catalyze the exchange of
chloride and bicarbonate across the cell membrane and are also a site of primary
attachment of the cytoskeleton of the cell to the membrane. The ultimate aim is
to determine the structure- function relationships among several related anion
transporters and to determine their physiological function, for instance, do
they regulate intracellular pH. This research has fundamental importance to our
understanding of the role of the plasma membrane and its component parts on cell
function. The relationship of membrane structure and function will be
investigated using molecular biologic techniques.
