One of the oldest questions in modern astronomy is: what is the percentage of
stars accompanied by planetary systems? The bridge between low-mass stars and
giant planets, such as Jupiter, is a class of objects called "brown dwarfs."
Brown dwarfs shine at infrared (IR) wavelengths from energy released by slow
gravi- tational contraction. During the next three years the Principal
Investigator (PI) and his Co-Investigator will continue a long-term and
previously NSF-supported survey to search for brown dwarfs. Because brown dwarfs
are not too much fainter than white dwarfs, they will obtain electronic images
of several hundred white dwarfs with an IR camera and estimate the number of
brown dwarfs among them. They will also continue to monitor previously
discovered brown-dwarf/white-dwarf systems to determine their orbital charac-
teristics and ultimately the masses of these objects. It is expected that this
and related studies will contribute significantly to our understanding of the
formation of stars and planets, and in particular whether all these objects are
products of the same formation process.
