The International Colloquium on Dynamics of Explosions and Reactive Systems has
become the designated international forum of the Combustion Institute in the
areas of fluid dynamics relevance. It meets on odd years, as a supplement to the
general Combustion Institute meeting, which meets on even years. The publication
of its proceedings, in English, has been a valuable addition to the World
literature during its twenty years of existence.
