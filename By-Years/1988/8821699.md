Testosterone is one of the three major female steroid hormones (along with
estrogen and progesteron). Testosterone is important in female reproductive
function for its effects on both folliculogenesis and sexual behavior. Yet,
despite demonstratations that testosterone levels change under a number of
differenct ecological conditions, testosterone has not received much attention
in studies of reproductive ecology. Assays of salivary testosterone offer
several advantages, including non-invasive collections techniques and a measure
of the non-bound fraction of the hormone levels is an appropriate means for
analyzing ovarian function. Daily salivary samples will be collected for a
single menstrual cycle from Boston women between the ages of 20 and 40. All
samples will be assayed for testosterone, and for estradial which will be used
to align the cycles. The results of the research will further our understanding
of gonadal function in women. The data will not only demonstrate the use of
salivary assays of testosterone as an indictor of ovarian function, but may have
implications for changes in sexual behavior, such as coital frequency. This will
be the first step towards incorporating the measurement of salivary testosterone
into field studies of reproductive behavior and ecology.
