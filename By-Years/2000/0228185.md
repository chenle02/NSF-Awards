Professor Michl proposes to oirganize the "Quilmes Nanoscience Workshop:
Electronics and Molecules and Quantum Dots" at Quilmes near Tucuman, Argentina,
on May 16-20, 2003, combining forces with his US colleague, Professor Kubiak of
the University of California, San Diego and two Argentinian colleagues,
Professors Ernesto Calvo (Chemistry) and Oscar Martinez (Physics) of the
University of Buenos Aires. The subject is related to photophysics, charge
transport, and rod-shaped molecules.
