The acquisition of a digital processing oscilloscope by the power electronics
research group introduces a substantial capability in instrumentation and
measurements of power electronics circuits. Specifically, it will be useful for
three projects initially. These projects are on 1) the reduction of rectifier
line currents harmonics through application of simple ferroresonant circuits, 2)
the evaluation of a composite Magnetic Material for Use in Economical
Manufacture of Inductor and 3) investigation of Nonlinear Magnets Elements for
Control of High-Frequency Resonant Dc-to-dc Converters.
