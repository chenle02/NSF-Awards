Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;The 2012 FASEB meeting on Yeast Chromosome
Structure, Replication and Segregation will be held July 15-20, 2012 in at the
Steamboat Grand Resort in Steamboat Springs, CO. The meeting is unique in that
it brings together scientists doing basic research involving chromosome behavior
in two yeast models, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The
meeting covers a wide range of topics, including: DNA replication, chromosome
structure and evolution, chromatin structure and gene expression, telomeres and
silencing, recombination and chromosome rearrangements, mitosis and meiosis,
cell cycle regulation, kintechores, spindles and
cytokinesis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;Attention has been
paid to recruiting a diverse group of speakers, including both senior and early-
career investigators. Support will be provided as scholarships to students and
postdoctoral fellows chosen based on need; scholarships will be limited to one
per research lab, to ensure broad use of the funds. Priority will be given to
underrepresented minorities.
