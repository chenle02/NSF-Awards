Implanted sensors will enable the next generation of healthcare by in-situ
testing of abnormal physiological conditions, personalized medicine and
proactive drug delivery. These functions require energy efficient communication
of data between implants through the body tissues, which is difficult to achieve
via radio frequency (RF) waves owing to their high attenuation within the body.
The project involves the design of a network protocol stack using weak
electrical currents as the underlying communication mechanism, instead of
conventional RF waves to connect the implants. This paradigm results in energy
savings of two orders of magnitude compared to RF. This research will help in
realizing diverse applications arising out from a network of connected implants
that benefit athletes, military personnel, and other at-risk populations. The
ability to proactively report physiological changes within the body will
increase longevity of human life. The project incorporates outreach components
targeting K-12 students, design of computer-simulation based projects, and
demonstrations at public venues like science museums.

The research planned in the course of this project is the first effort to
systematically devise networking protocols based on galvanic coupling of
electric signals. It has the following goals: (i) explore the impact of the
transmission frequency and power on signal reflection and refraction at the
tissue boundaries for multicast communication, (ii) design of interference-free
medium access schemes that take into account heat generated at the crossings of
the signal paths for all simultaneously active transceiver pairs, for both CSMA
and TDMA-based approaches, (iii) research new strategies and conduct performance
analysis for optimal placement of on-skin relay nodes for retrieving the sensor
data from locations in the body that minimize the data gathering latency while
being constrained by feasible on-body locations, and (iv) the first simulator
and testbed for galvanic coupled communication using ns-3, and will also propose
ways to charge the implanted sensors through contact-less magnetically coupled
coils.
