Population dynamics are determined by the demographic summation of individual
reproductive success. Reproductive success (that is, fitness) is measured by the
representation of descendants in the next generation. Many offspring disperse;
therefore, the reproductive success of an individual cannot be known without
determining the survivorship and reproductive output of their dispersing
offspring. The investigator will continue a 28-year study of age, sex, social
behavior, reproductive output, pattern of space-use, social organization, and
survivorship over the lifetime of males and females from four colonies of yellow
bellied marmots. In addition to collecting the basic demographic data necessary
for continuity of this longitudinal study, Dr. Armitage will be analyzing data
collected over the lifetime of the research. Many rodent populations require
control. Control measures are ineffective if those animals that are killed or
removed are quickly replaced by immigrants. Because yellow-bellied marmots
frequently are agricultural pests, knowledge of the fate of dispersers will
contribute to the preparation of effective control measures.
