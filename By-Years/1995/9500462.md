9500462 Madanshetty This research aims at advancing the technology of cleaning
semiconductor chips and devices by ultrasonics. The current research builds on
prior research on "Ultrasonically Induced Fluid-Particle Interactions at
Nanometer Length Scales", which led to the discovery of "acoustic coaxing",
whereby microcavitation can be induced on liquid borne microparticles by
superposition of a strong acoustic field with a weak field at a very high
frequency. By lowering the threshold needed for microcavitation via acoustic
coaxing and combining with micro-streaming, a process to clean semiconductor is
proposed. By advancing the fundamental understanding of acoustic coaxing induced
microcavitation, it is expected that key process control parameters will be
identified to realize a practical manufacturing process. An additional benefit
of the research is expected in developing a new way of detecting liquid borne
particles for ultra clean liquids. As the semiconductor industry drives towards
packing of more and more information on a chip using finer and finer details,
the barrier to manufacturing technology becomes the state of cleanliness.
Successful completion of this project can lead to building of ultrasonic
equipment with a knowledge based process control that has the potential of
achieving ultra clean manufacturing environment for semiconductor. In fact, two
small companies are partnering with this researcher based on this promising
technology to develop instrumentation for detecting liquid borne microparticles.
