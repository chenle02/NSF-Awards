The principal investigator will study equilibrium configurations, instabilities
and waves in fluids and plasmas. In particular, he will focus attention on fluid
structures known as vortex rings with swirl and their plasma counterparts known
as plasma tori. Such equilibrium configurations are derived from a variational
principle, and the principal investigator will employ the venerable method of
geometric optics to study the stability properties of these equilibrium states.
In order to study accurately the behavior of fluids within the core of the earth
one must appreciate the fact that under many sets of circumstances the fluids
within the core act more like plasmas (ionized fluids) than ordinary gases and
liquids. In this project the principal investigator will first make a
comparative study of equilibrium structures and their stability in both fluids
and plasmas. Then he will apply these results to describe the long-term
evolution of small-amplitude perturbations to stable vortex rings and plasma
tori of the type found in the earth's core.
