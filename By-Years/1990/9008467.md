This is a Research Opportunities for Women research planning award, which will
allow the PI to spend a sabbatical working on the processes of eruption,
transport, deposition and induration of Snake River Plain tuffs. It will involve
field mapping with members of the Idaho Survey, as well as microscopic and SEM
study of the tuffs. The PI hopes to define objectives for further study of Snake
River Plain materials which will lead to a four- dimensional overview of the
volcanic/hydrologic evolution of the entire field.
