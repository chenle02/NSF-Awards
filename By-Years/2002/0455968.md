In this award, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Prof. Dor Ben-Amotz of Purdue University and his graduate
research students will study the aqueous solvation of hydrophobic species with a
combined experimental and theoretical study. The aim of the program is to
critically test aspects of recent theories on solvation that emphasize the
importance of solvent expulsion around non-polar molecules (dewetting). The
results of these studies should help to explain a broad variety of important
processes: from the formation of biological membranes to self-assembly,
molecular recognition, chemical separation and environmental remediation.

Besides the broad impact of the research on several areas of science, Prof. Ben-
Amotz will continue to provide his research students with excellent training in
experimental as well as theoretical methods.
