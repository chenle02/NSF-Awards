0140592&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Simon will
continue his research focusing on direct and inverse&lt;br/&gt;spectral problems
for Schrodinger operators and their discrete analogs. He&lt;br/&gt;plans to
explore the impact of sum rules for spectral theory both for
Jacobi&lt;br/&gt;matrices (where he and Killip recently solved several long open
conjectures&lt;br/&gt;from the Orthogonal Polynomial community using sum rules)
and Schrodinger&lt;br/&gt;operators. Other problems he expects to look at
include the structure of&lt;br/&gt;the isospectral manifold for problems with
discrete spectrum, resonance&lt;br/&gt;counting in higher dimensions, and the
study of mixed singular continuous&lt;br/&gt;and point
spectrum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fundamental problem in wide swaths of science
is determining the relation&lt;br/&gt;between some object that can only be
observed indirectly and the information&lt;br/&gt;you can observe indirectly.
There are two sides of issue: determine what&lt;br/&gt;is indirectly observed
for a given state of the system, called the direct&lt;br/&gt;problem, and trying
to induce properties of the system from the indirect&lt;br/&gt;observations,
called the inverse problem. Professor Simon will study&lt;br/&gt;various aspects
of direct and inverse problems in quantum mechanics. While&lt;br/&gt;the focus
will be on the equations of quantum theory, there are
potential&lt;br/&gt;spinoffs to tomography and radar/sonar direct and inverse
problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
