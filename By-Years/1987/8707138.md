This proposal describes an experimental study of the forced convection heat
transfer on a surface in the neighborhood of a blunt body. Such situations
occur, for example, in gas turbines where the airfoil-like turbine blades attach
to their base surface. The velocity distribution will be measured as a
supplement to the heat transfer measurements. In certain of the experiments, a
film of air will be injected in the blade- surface attachment region. The film
protects the surface from the hot gases passing through the turbine. The
expected end result of the work is a set of guidelines for gas turbine designers
for minimizing the heating of the surface by the hot gases.
