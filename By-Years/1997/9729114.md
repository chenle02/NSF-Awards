This project will initiative a process for integrating emerging perspectives
relevant to several NSF-based initiatives that revolve around the development
and broad application of network-based information systems. The NAS/CSTB will
organize a roundtable to bring togehter executives from NSF and other federal
agencies, private foundations, and other sources of private sector research
support to facilitate interactions and possible collaboration. Its near-term
goal is to foster information exchange and promote broader and more effective
development of support for relevant research programs across key public and
private sector organizations. In part this activity is convened to maximize the
potential and new National Science Foundation Knowledge And Distributed
Intelligence initiatives including knowledge networking, learning and
intelligent systems, as well as the multi-agency Next Generation Internet,
digital libraries, and universal access initiatives. Many relevant research
programs rooted in information technology also embrace a variety of scientific
and engineering disciplines, which complement computer science and engineering
with insight into how people do or might use information technology.
