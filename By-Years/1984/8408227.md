This project continues research on innovative methods to predict strong ground
motions and evaluates site parameters including geologic discontinuities. The
method provides the advantage of combining the mathematical modeling of site
effects with strong motion prediction techniques. This project work will
emphasize site effects (including geologic discontinuities) for strong motion
prediction. A deterministic simulation of strong ground motions will be made to
establish the sensitivity of selected site dependent parameters, including local
stresses and discontinuities for predicting strong ground motions. The results
will provide a unified interpretation of strong motions and earthquake
recurrence for evaluating seismic site hazards.
