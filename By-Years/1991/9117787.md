This award will provide for half the funds needed to acquire a theta-theta
diffractometer. The additional funding necessary for this acquisition has been
committed by Harvard University. The requested instrument- a high precision
theta-theta diffractometer with associated X-ray generator,counting
electronics,and computer for control and data analysis- will replace obsolete
powder diffractometers(25-30 years old) for both routine and precision
measurement of powdered samples of minerals,rocks,and other materials. The PI is
an experienced researcher with a fine track record. He and a large number of
faculty and student users should benefit greatly by having a state-of-the-art
instrument available.
