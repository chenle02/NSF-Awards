9623433 Harte Global warming and soil organic matter dynamics: an experimental
investigation of the effects of climate on soil carbon pool structure. Results
from an ongoing warming manipulation in a high-altitude meadow ecosystem
indicate that warming may be reducing the stock of carbon in the bulk soil
organic matter. Since such an effect would constitute a positive feedback
mechanism to the global warming predicted to follow from current greenhouse gas
emissions, understanding it is important to fully understanding global warming
itself The funds requested by this proposal will provide for a further
investigation of the structure of the soil carbon pool in the study ecosystem.
The aim is to better quantify the magnitude of the soil carbon loss, identify
the pools of soil carbon from which it comes, and understand the underlying
dynamics that will determine the timescale over which it might operate.
Specifically, the PIs propose to apply: 1) recent advances in soil organic
matter fractionation techniques, and 2) new methods being developed to quantify
the structure of microbial decomposer communities, to soils from the warming
manipulation. Organic matter fractionation divides soil carbon into pools
according to turnover time (thereby revealing structure essential to predicting
the long-term response to warming); identifying any potential shifts in the
microbial decomposer community that might be associated with changes in the soil
carbon structure will help illuminate biological mechanisms important in
ecosystem response to warming.
