This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site award to the University
of Michigan, located in Ann Arbor, MI, supports the training of 10 students for
10 weeks during the summers of 2020-2022. In this program, funded by the
Division of Chemistry in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate,
participants pursue interdisciplinary, problem-based research projects across
the contemporary chemical sciences, ranging from the life sciences to
biophysics, organic synthesis to computational theory, environmental to
analytical measurement. Participants also take part in a professional
development program that includes preparation for graduate school or industrial
careers, communication skills, and responsible conduct of research. Through a
thorough immersion in a mentored and research-active environment, this site
develops students' self-confidence and deepens research skills, particularly
with students from less researchâ€“intensive settings, thereby broadening
participation in STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The students join an active research
group, undertaking individual mentored projects encompassing all fields of
interdisciplinary chemistry, including organometallics, energy storage,
sustainability, surface science, sensors, optics and imaging, RNA biochemistry,
and ultrafast dynamics. The weekly professional development series includes a
general seminar on a scientific research area not already featured in the REU
program along with a special topic, such as writing personal statements and
research reports, poster and oral reports of research, public outreach,
cv/resume/interview best practices, and issues of inclusiveness in STEM. To
increase diversity in the STEM pipeline, this site actively partners with
programs and institutions from which it can recruit underserved and
underrepresented populations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
