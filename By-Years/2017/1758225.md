The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to accelerate
and control gene delivery, and to allow researchers to find novel solutions to
challenging diseases. Gene delivery, also known as transfection, is a promising
approach to treat diseases such as cancer and, thus, could provide a profound
benefit to society. Using gene therapy and immune-therapy, gene delivery allows
for the efficient introduction of a new gene into cells. The specific technology
employed offers a photo-responsive, nanoparticle-based technique with the
advantages of higher efficacy, controlled gene-release, and faster transfection
rates. This has the potential to dramatically decrease the time required for
transfection, as well as greatly reducing the required amount of gene and/or
drug. Thus, along with providing researchers the unique ability to control the
process through a simple light trigger, this technology could provide
substantial commercial impact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is a
gene delivery tool that utilizes two biocompatible surfactants which associate
spontaneously into light-sensitive nanoparticles when dissolved in water.
Nucleic acids (DNA/siRNA) can be loaded inside of the nanoparticles to protect
the nucleic acids until they reach the interior of cells. Similarly,
hydrophobic/hydrophilic drug molecules can also be carried within the
nanoparticles. Subsequent exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light leads to
nanoparticle dissociation, resulting in the triggered release of nucleic acids,
which can then modify the DNA of the cell or stop disease-associated protein
production. Researchers would be able to utilize this gene delivery technology
in two different ways: (1) substitution of new genes to the cell, or (2)
inactivation of existing genes. The combination of lower costs (of both the
carrier components and the nucleic acids due to higher efficiencies) and faster
delivery/transfection rates with our technology compared to current gene-
delivery technologies could have a considerable impact throughout the industry.
