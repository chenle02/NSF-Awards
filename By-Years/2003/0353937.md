Harvard University establishes an interdisciplinary Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) Site. The REU Site is affiliated with the Center for
Imaging and Mesoscale Structures at Harvard, which includes thirty-four faculty
members from a wide range of disciplines. Twelve undergraduate students, with
backgrounds in chemistry, physics, biology, engineering or geophysics, are
recruited every year for a 10-week summer research experience. The REU Site
especially encourages participation of members from underrepresented groups in
science and engineering. Students participate in research activities spanning
various areas of materials science, such as self-assembly of soft materials,
mechanical properties of thin films, and the development of materials and tools
for biology. Additional career development opportunities at the REU Site include
an ethics component.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The REU Site also supports three
teachers each year for a six-week summer research experience. In addition to
involvement in research activities, teachers develop peer instruction techniques
and curricular materials for their classrooms.&lt;br/&gt;
