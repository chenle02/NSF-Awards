Our project will study the role of monotonicity in low dimensional geometry and
topology, in the context of a number of specific problems. Firstly, we will
study actions of (topologically natural) groups on 1-dimensional manifolds,
especially actions on the line and the circle, but also on non-Hausdorff
1-manifolds. Such actions are closely related to the theory of foliations and
laminations in dimension 3. Our tools will include the theory of foliations and
laminations, recent results in gauge theory, computational tools, and
constructions of new topological objects associated to such actions. We will
also study the question of existence and classification of such actions when one
passes to finite index subgroups, in analogy with the Virtual Haken conjecture.
Related to this, we will investigate the problem of whether a random 3-manifold
group has a faithful action on the line. Finally, we will expand the range of
these techniques from dimension 3 to dimension 4 by studying 4-manifolds with
pairs of transverse 2-dimensional foliations. By varying the analytic quality of
these foliations, we hope to arrive at a different point of view on some of the
mysterious geometric inequalities arising from gauge theory. We will do this by
exploiting old and new results about bounded cohomological properties of groups
acting on the plane with good analytic qualities.

Monotonicity is an important principle in analysis, geometry and topology. The
best known examples are essentially 1-dimensional in origin; monotonicity lets
one define such objects as the real numbers in terms of the order structure of
its elements. More generally, such order structures provide a bridge from
geometric problems to algebraic language, and permit one to perform experiments
and construct certificates with the use of computers. Monotonicity becomes
increasingly hard to apply as dimension goes up; consequently it is most
powerful when used in the context of certain dynamical systems which reduce the
study of the manifold to two complementary problems of smaller dimension: the
study of the orbits of the system, and the study of the parameter space of the
orbits.
