This two-year standard grant, supported by the Chemistry and Molecular and
Cellular Biosciences Divisions, facilitates investigations into the structure of
enzymes that have been modified with polyethylene glycol. Spectroscopic studies,
including circular dichroism, uv-visible, and electron spin resonance will be
used to characterize the structure of the modified enzymes as they exist in
organic solvents. Horseradish peroxidase, and the related enzyme, cytochrome P
450, will be the focus of these investigations. These studies should permit the
characterization of enzyme intermediates that are not easily studied in aqueous
environments, due to their extremely short lifetimes, and will allow enzymes to
be used for targeted synthesis in organic solvents. Professor Mabrouk and her
students will characterize the structure of enzymes that have been modified with
polymers, which allow for stabilization of these species in organic solvents.
One of the enzymes to be characterized in this study, cytochrome P 450, is an
important partner in the biochemical pathway for conversion of oxygen to carbon
dioxide. The implications of this research include the ability to characterize
normally inaccessible intermediate structures, and the development of viable
commercial catalysis methods based on enzyme chemistry.
