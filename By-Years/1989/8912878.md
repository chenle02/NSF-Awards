This award partially supports an international workshop on the reproductive
biology of South American vertebrates to be held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil from
August 6-11, 1989. Support will be given to U.S. and Chile an participants who
will meet with Brazilian scientists supported by the World Wildlife Fund. It
will be held in conjunction with the XIII Federative International Congress of
Anatomy in Rio. The U.S. organizer is William Hamlett of the Medical College of
Ohio at Toledo and his Chilean counterparts are four researchers from the
University of Antofagasta and the University of Chile in Santiago. The workshop
will focus on reproduction in South American vertebrates, rare or endangered,
and on a potentially economic species, the shark. All the major vertebrate
groups will be discussed. This is an opportunity for South America scientists
active in vertebrate reproduction to meet with U.S. scientists and other
participants at the Congress for an exchange of ideas and information. There is
also the potential for future cooperation in this area, an important goal of the
Science in Developing Countries Program.
