The UC Berkeley Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences
&lt;br/&gt;(EECS) proposes a suite of projects to deal with the challenges and
risks from &lt;br/&gt;the widespread adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in
areas such as marketing, &lt;br/&gt;finance, law enforcement, health care and
entertainment. With the successes &lt;br/&gt;and benefits of AI come great
risks. These Research Experiences for Undergraduates &lt;br/&gt;(REU) projects
tackle many of the challenges in the responsible development &lt;br/&gt;of AI
systems. Leading researchers in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science will
&lt;br/&gt;mentor students on their REU projects. Faculty identified as mentors
have excellent &lt;br/&gt;track records of mentoring undergraduate research.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The projects in this proposal cover many key challenges in
responsible AI &lt;br/&gt;including: fairness in machine learning algorithms,
safety in human-robot &lt;br/&gt;interaction, fairness in law enforcement,
provably-safe AI systems, defense &lt;br/&gt;against adversarial attacks,
managing unpredictability in AI-engineered &lt;br/&gt;artificial proteins, and
AI-enhanced neural sensors. The research team consists &lt;br/&gt;of leaders in
these respective areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
