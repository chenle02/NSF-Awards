The goal of this collaboration between the PI and Klaus Friedrich of the
UniversitÂªt Kaiserslautern is to study micromechanisms of delamination in novel
laminated compounds with nanoreinforced interfaces. A mat of nanofibers produced
by electrospnning is used to suppress delamination and microcrack propagation.
The interlaminar fracturing will be studied by state-of-the-art acoustic
emission analysis and in- situ scanning electron microscopy. The PI's group will
manufacture laminated composites with nanoreinforced interfaces, perform
acoustic emission studies, and derive theoretical descriptions of crack
propagation. The Kaiserslautern group will conduct microstructural and
thermomechanical characterization of materials, perform in situ experiments in a
scanning electron microscope chamber, and conduct fractographic experiments.
