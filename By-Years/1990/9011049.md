Description: This project provides funding for four U.S. scientists to
participate in a five day conference in New Delhi, India in the second week of
January 1991. The conference will focus on MOS Analog VLSI Circuit Engineering.
The Indian organizer is Dr. A.B. Bhattacharyya, Chairman, Center for Applied
research in Electronics at the Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi. Topics
to be covered will include: CMOS process technology and analog circuits; MOS
device modeling; sensors and transducers micropower design; conversion circuits;
filters; design methods and automation; mixed mode simulation; automated
physical layout; and emerging research topics. Scope: The primary emphasis in
this conference is on bringing researchers in academia with technical people
engaged in research and development in industry and to address questions in
design and automation. In addition, areas where potential collaboration can
result and would be beneficial will be identified. A number of U.S. electronic
companies with branches in India will be represented in the conference.
