The purpose of this project is to study the role of funded initiatives and
investments as they impacted computing research, infrastructure and education.
It explores and documents the important milestones in the NSF support of
computing, providing a thematic framework for NSF development of organizations,
programs and initiatives that catalyzed the fledgling field of computer and
information science and engineering. The project also explores the NSF role in
the context of national and federal investments in information technology. This
study will document and describe the arc of computing history in terms of
institutional evolution and programmatic thrusts that have served to move
computing forward in the Nation. It will bring together in one place public
documents relevant to the organizational history of CISE from FY1985 to
FY2016.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcomes of the Study (milestones,
organizational history, relevant documents and thematic framework) will provide
a resource for historians and policy experts in a publicly accessible manner.
The data collected will enable and simplify the future work of historians of
science, national study committees, and policy makers. The narratives will
simplify the work of some of these groups, as well as to serve as useful sources
for a wide variety of educational usages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the
study will:&lt;br/&gt;1. Examine how the roles of NSF's Computer and Information
Science and Engineering (CISE) programs have evolved as other NSF units, federal
agencies and industries have modified their focus and level of support for
computing research, education and infrastructure;&lt;br/&gt;2. Identify
national, federal, NSF and CISE special initiatives with background and context,
including the reports that help define or assess these initiatives;&lt;br/&gt;3.
Describe the role of organizations and individuals in implementing programs and
initiatives;&lt;br/&gt;4. Develop a series of evolving themes that characterize
NSF's investment strategy for computer and information science and engineering
research, education and infrastructure;&lt;br/&gt;5. Develop a series of
accessible narratives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project team will establish a
Study Advisory Committee, which will review interim reports, databases, and
other artifacts developed during the study.
