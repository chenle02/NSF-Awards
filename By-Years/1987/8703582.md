Portland cement is one of the most widely used materials in the construction
industry. One of its inherent characteristics is shrinkage upon drying which may
lead to formation of cracks. In response to this concern, expansive cements have
been developed and used in the field for several decades. When mixed with water,
expansive cements expand and create tensile stresses in the reinforcing steel.
This generates compressive stresses in the concrete which reduced the cracking
potential. However, the current procedure for preparation of expansive cements
is based on trial and error. The objective of this research is to evaluate the
physico-chemical, microstructural, and micromechanical properties of expansive
cements. The research consists of both numerical modeling and experimental
evaluation to obtain an understanding of the mechanical properties of expansive
cements.
