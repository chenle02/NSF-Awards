A request is made to fund improvements to the HiSeasNet capability in the UNOLS
fleet. The proposal is to enhance HiSeasNet by improving Ku-Band coverage in the
Atlantic to include virtually the entire North Atlantic, from the US and
Caribbean to Europe, and the Mediterranean. In addition, the proposed work will
significantly bolster the performance of the available bandwidth through the use
of accelerators to be installed on all of the ships at low cost.

13 ea accelerators will be recommended at cost of $51,949

Broader Impacts: The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use
instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab
access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost
of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.
