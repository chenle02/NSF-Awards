Theory will be developed for the electronic and vibrational properties of
metals, insulators and superconductors, especially crystalline oxides such as
copper-and bismuth-oxide superconductors and vanadium-oxide based metal-
insulator systems. The underlying motive is to explore the still obscure
mechanism for high temperature superconductivity. A secondary motive for the
research is to improve understanding of the diverse and poorly understood
electrical transport properties of these materials. As a model system barium-
bismuth-oxide will be studied in detail. The charge carriers in this insulator
are bipolarons. A continuous evolution through an exotic superconducting state
to a normal metallic conductor occurs as bismuth is replaced by lead. Polaron
and bipolaron models will be developed and tested to model resistivity, Hall
coefficient, and superconductivity. Other model systems to be studied are
niobium-oxide and vanadium-dioxide. The latter has a metal-insulator transition
at a temperature convenient for device applications such as memory elements. The
effect of lattice distortion and phonons on the transition will be studied.
Thermal conduction will also be studied in a model of amorphous silicon.
