This project is focused on sulfate reduction rates in the anoxic water column
and superficial sediments of the Black Sea. In combination with measured
organic-carbon burial-rates in the sediment column, and input rates determined
by ongoing sediment trap studies, the results will provide important
quantitative information of rates and depth distributions of both carbon and
sulfur cycling. Additional measurements of short-chain organic- acid-
concentration distributions plus in situ radiotracer turnover rates in the water
column and sediments should provide new insights concerning the roles of organic
acids, particularly acetate, and other potentially significant intermediates.
Water column rate measurements will be conducted by a field- tested instrument,
the Sampler Incubation Device (SID), that is capable of performing all
operations of sample procurement, radiotracer introduction, incubation, and time
series withdrawal and fixation of subsamples directly in situ. Sediment rate
measurements will be conducted using free-fall tripod vehicles. These vehicles
will be equipped with newly developed sediment injectors that will permit the
accurate in situ introduction of radiotracers in a continuous track from a depth
of 10 cm through the surface and into the overlying fluff layer.
