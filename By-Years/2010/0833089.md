The partnership between the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) and the
Chicago Public Schools (CPS) has demonstrated an increasing ability to recruit,
prepare and retain well qualified, content-rich science and mathematics teachers
(career changers and undergraduates) in high-need schools. This Phase II Noyce
project continues work begun in the previous Noyce grant with secondary
mathematics teacher candidates and expands its potential impact with the
addition of an enhanced mentor program for new Noyce recipients. This new mentor
program involves previous Noyce awardees and inducts new ones into a Noyce
mentoring network. Second, the project extends the Noyce applicant pool by
adding three new science certifications and introducing a one-year M.Ed. program
option for secondary science, which is available for secondary science teacher
candidates in biology, earth and space science, environmental science, chemistry
and physics. The project supports the recruitment and retention of career-
changers with strong STEM backgrounds and STEM undergraduates who want to teach
in high-need areas in CPS. These goals will be attained by awarding stipends
based on academic merit, with attention to diversifying the teacher workforce
and a commitment to serving high-need schools. Over a three-year period the UIC-
CPS Noyce II project is offering 40 recruitment stipends to students in UIC STEM
secondary teacher preparation programs who commit to teaching in Chicago Public
Schools. New teachers have the opportunity to conduct action research during
their induction phase as they work to construct a defensible and inclusive
practice.
