9510263 Asmerom This project will enable Asmerom to test the concept that
isotopes in the Thorium-Uranium series, if they can be measured accurately in
young volcanic rocks, will add a new dimension to our understanding of the
relationship between the mantle and the continental crust, the origin of alkali
and tholiitic basalts, depth of melting, and the time frame in which various
things happen. This award will provide for the PI and a graduate student to
collect a few representative samples from three suitable volcanic fields, and
then carry out the appropriate analyses at the University of Minnesota.
