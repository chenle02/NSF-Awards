9420787 Nathan Research will be carried out in high energy electron scattering,
photonuclear reactions, and in fundamental properties of the muon with the goals
of determining the spin and flavor structure of nucleons, observing
manifestations of quark degrees of freedom in nuclei, and in probing the
hadronic structure of the muon (a twenty-fold improvement on the determination
of the muon's anomalous magnetic moment). Research in these areas will advance
our understanding of the nucleon in terms of constituent quarks and sea-quarks
(quark-antiquark pairs surrounding the constituent quarks) and probe TeV mass
scale hadrons and how they affect electro-weak processes through radiative
corrections. These topics are among the most exciting in nuclear and particle
physics. Development and construction of major state-of-the-art equipment,
including laser-pumped polarized gas targets, specialized detectors, and
spectrometers, is integral to this activity. Education of graduate students and
postdocs is a strong component in every aspect of this umbrella grant for the
Illinois Nuclear Physics group. ***
