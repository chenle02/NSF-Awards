Integrating humans with their naturally developed control algorithm and robots
with their extended capability of applying forces and torques into one system
offers multiple opportunities for creating a new generation of assistance
technology for both healthy and disabled people suffering from neuromuscular
diseases and neuro-degenerative disorders. The exoskeleton is a wearable robotic
arm. It is worn by the human as an orthotic device and acts as a human-amplifier
allowing the operator natural control of the device as an extension of his/her
body while sharing an external load. One of the primary innovative ideas of this
research is to set the human machine interface at the muscular level of the
human physiological hierarchy using an expression of body's own control command
(surface electromyography - sEMG) signals as one of the primary command signals
of the exoskeleton for improving the synergy between the operator and the
exoskeleton. The goals of this research are to design, build, and experimentally
study the integration of a powered exoskeleton controlled by myosignals (sEMG)
for the human arm with healthy people. It is anticipated that the scientific
activity involved in this research will integrate and fuse multidisciplinary
knowledge by promoting dialogues and collaborative work between students and
faculty members from different disciplines with a long-term goal of improving
the quality of life of the physically disabled community.
