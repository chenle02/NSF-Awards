Robotics and Human Augmentation
Program&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal
#: 303750&lt;br/&gt;Title: Multi-Finger High Fidelity Haptic
Exploration&lt;br/&gt;PI: Hannaford, Blake&lt;br/&gt;U of
Washington&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Haptic interfaces apply ideas from
robotic manipulation science and technology to human interfaces and human
augmentation. Current haptic interfaces have proven their feasibility for a
variety of applications. Better haptic interfaces could dramatically improve
medical training through high fidelity simulators for invasive medical
procedures. Such procedures must be taught today on human patients.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, the richness and fidelity of most haptic
interfaces is still limited. It is very difficult to engineer a haptic interface
with many degrees of freedom (DOF) and also the high bandwidth and low friction
necessary for rendering subtle but important details. Before we expend this
effort, we should know what if any perceptual benefit is provided by multiple
fingered/multi DOF devices. This project will study how human performance in
haptic perception and exploration varies as increasing number of fingers are
supported through increasing degrees of freedom. An existing high fidelity
haptic device for the index finger will be duplicated to support haptic
exploration with up to four fingers and two degrees of freedom per finger. This
will allow independent variation of number of fingers and number of DOF. A
preliminary evaluation of the device will measure performance in detecting small
haptic features, and demonstrate haptic exploration of novel surfaces. We will
learn whether and how haptic perception performance and strategies vary with the
number of fingers and number of fingers per DOF.&lt;br/&gt;
