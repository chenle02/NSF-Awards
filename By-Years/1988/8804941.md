An REU Program will be initiated in which ten undergraduate students will
participate in research with faculty associated with the Tennessee Tech Center
for Electric Power. The areas of research include power plant diagnostic
techniques, dispersed generation, pulsed power, power system analysis, and
instrumentation associated with nuclear fusion. In addition to performing the
analysis and experimentation required for the research project, the student will
do a literature syrvey; attend a series of seminars on electric power research,
and obtain a fundamental background in the area of the research. A very well-
structured faculty team has been assembled to administer the program and conduct
the research.
