This grant is in support of the 1989 Gordon Research Conference on Nonlinear
Optics and Lasers to be held at Brewster Academy, Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, July
24-28, 1989. As in previous years, the purpose of this conference will be to
provide an informal forum for the presentation and discussion of new work on
selected topics in nonlinear optics, quantum electronics, and lasers, and their
applications to physics and chemistry. An informal atmosphere with a strong
emphasis on discussion is intended to encourage the exchange of ideas in a
manner not possible at regular meetings of professional societies. A total
attendance of approximately 135 scientists from universities and industry is
anticipated. Total expenses for the conference will be shared by the National
Science Foundation, the Office of Naval Research, the Air Force Office of
Scientific Research, and the Chairman's Special Fund of the Gordon Research
conferences. The National Science Foundation grant will be used to provide
partial support for invited speakers and selected junior faculty and students
who, because of limitations of their own source of funding, require financial
assistance to attend the conference.
