This purpose of the proposed research is to examine how situational awareness
(or its other similar outcroppings) develop within work dyads and teams required
to behave very reliably, as in high reliability organizations (study 1). A
second purpose is to examine what, if any, relationship exists between
situational awareness and other local global processes (study 2). The
investigators are particularly interested in contexts where errors of judgment
or inference can lead to catastrophe. The investigators also intend to provide
some theoretical rigor around the psychological constructs guiding the first
part of the research, and embed those constructs within group processes (study
2), deepening our basic knowledge of the ways individual and group cognitive
processes interact with contexts. Study 1 will focus on the Oakland Police
Department's Emergency Dispatching Service (911), while Study 2 will take place
at the Stanford anesthesiology simulator, which provides a situation in which
distributed cognition can be more thoroughly investigated, and in which actors
are tied to technologies long ago invented to solve an anesthesiology or
operating problem.
