The physical properties of the high temperature cuprate superconductors are
investigated on the basis of Holstein-Hubbard theoretical models which include
local Coulomb correlations, antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations and electron-
phonon interactions in a unified theoretical framework. Our basic approach
combines classical and quantum Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics techniques,
exact Lanczos electron groundstate energy and spectral function calculations,
mean-field/variational and self- consistent diagrammatic techniques in a novel
simulational method. The objective of this research is to study the interplay
between Coulomb correlations, antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations and electron-
phonon coupling in doped cuprates, including cooperative effects such as
Coulomb-and spin-fluctuation-induced polaron formation, the polaronic tunneling
dynamics, polaronic large- amplitude lattice displacement fluctuations, and
their manifestations in the observable normal and superconducting state
electronic and structural properties at finite dopant densities. The results of
this research will provide us with a detailed quantitative understanding of a
possible, qualitatively new low- energy physics which can arise from such
cooperative effects. %%% The proposed theoretical research deals with models for
the new high temperature superconductors. Detailed, highly complex, models of
these materials which take into account the electronic, structural and magnetic
properties and their interactions are used to predict the behavior of the
materials in both the superconducting and normal states.
