Keizer The long term objective of this project is to understand the molecular
mechanisms that control secretion of hormones from cells in response to various
types of stimulatory events. These mechanisms, which are currently being
uncovered by experimentalists, least to complex phenomena involving oscillations
and waves that require the use of mathematical and computational analysis for
their understanding. Of particular interest are 1) the mechanisms controlling
calcium oscillations and waves in secretory cells; 2) the mechanism involved in
agonist stimulation of G protein events, especially, control of ion channels in
the pancreatic beta cell; 3) the mechanisms underlying the 2 5 minute period
calcium oscillations in insulin secretion from pancreatic secreting cells that
are under the control of glucose metabolism; 4) the mechanisms involved in the
control of electrical activity and calcium levels in anterior pituitary
gonadotrophs; and 5) the mechanisms responsible for the 15 30 period
oscillations in insulin secretion from pancreatic islets in vitro. The method
employed by the principal investigator involve the development and analysis of
ordinary and partial differential equations corresponding to mechanisms
uncovered by experiment. Sufficient quantitative information regarding the rates
of these five mechanisms is available to justify these calculations, which will
continue to be interfaced closely with experimental work. The computational work
will be done on a parallel architecture platform. This proposal is being jointly
supported by the Cell Biology, the Computational Biology, and the Applied
Mathematics programs. ***
