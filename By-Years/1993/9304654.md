PIs will document environmental changes in shallow-water fauna, associated with
emergence of the Isthmus of Panama. Using stable isotope analyses of surface-
and bottom-dwelling foraminifera, they will 1) determine age of final closure of
the seaway; 2) document environmental divergence on either side of the isthmus,
and 3) generate chronologic profiles of environmental conditions across the
shelf through the period of circulatory restriction and cutoff. Study will be
integrated with ongoing work on mollusks and deep-sea forams. Together studies
should provide framework for interpreting evolutionary and ecological patterns
associated with this event.
