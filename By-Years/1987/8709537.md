This project deals with the manufacture of integrated circuits. Specifically,
it deals with the bonding of wire between proper junctions on the chip and
terminals on the supporting lead frame. The bonding wire is heated by an
electric discharge, melts, forms a ball and is pressed to the contacts to form a
bond. Insecure bonds can result from improperly formed balls. Despite the
ubiquity of the process in semiconductor chip fabrication, no fundamental study
has yet provided understanding of the discharge and heat transfer phenomena
involved. The object of this study is to provide a clear picture of the
mechanisms involved and to establish the relationship between discharge
parameters and ball quality parameters. Two undergraduate students will
participate in this research.
