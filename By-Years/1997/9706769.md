ABSTRACT Lakic This project addresses problems concerning metric and analytic
properties of infinite dimensional Teichmuller spaces. Properties of some
recently introduced new Teichmuller spaces will be explored. These new spaces
appear to have interesting applications to the study of complex dynamics. Three
closely related areas will be considered in this project. The first concerns the
classical Teichmuller theory, and it is based on classifying the automorphisms
of infinite dimensional Teichmuller spaces and on studying uniquely extremal
Beltrami coefficients. The second area focuses on two recently introduced
Teichmuller spaces, the Teichmuller space with asymptotic conformal equivalence
and the Teichmuller space of a closed set in the plane. Finally, some
applications will be considered. A special emphasis will be placed on studying
the invariant line fields on a Julia set, and on exploring the smoothness
properties of the mapping by heights for quadratic differentials in the disk.
Recently, scientists have been able to apply several new analytic and geometric
methods to a number of important nonlinear problems in dynamics, ranging from
physics and chemistry to ecology and economics. In particular, the methods of
Teichmuller theory have contributed to the depth and scopes of research in
complex dynamics and renormalization. A special emphasis will be placed on
studying the Julia set, that appears in the iteration theory of holomorphic
functions that gave birth to the Mandelbrot set and to fractals.
