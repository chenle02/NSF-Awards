Support is provided for the U.S. Committee on Tunneling Technology. Major
activities of this committee are related to the technical issues involving the
stability of subsurface openings. Past activities by the committee have helped
to achieve a national focus on geotechnical research for earthquake lifeline
engineering. The committee plans to address several key issues in subsurface
tunneling, hazards associated with subsurface openings, and the earthquake
impact of tunnels and underground openings.
