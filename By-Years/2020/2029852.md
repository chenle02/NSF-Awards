The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development of a novel anti-fouling coating for ship hulls and keels to reduce
the environmental impact of current coatings. Although copper has been reported
to be effective as an antifouling agent, it is toxic and poisonous to marine
organisms and alternatives are sought. The proposed innovation is copper-free,
fouling-resistant, and non-biocidal with a life expectancy of five times that of
current commercial antifouling coating and will contribute environmentally to
the water quality and restoration of rivers, seas, and ocean. It will offer
resistance to slime layer formation on ship hulls and keels to reduce drag,
subsequently reducing fuel consumption while protecting marine organisms and
reducing toxic emissions. This coating could offer an estimated $3.5M/year per
ship in cost savings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the
development of a novel fouling-resistance (FR) nanocomposite coating to solve
problems of biofouling in the hulls and keels of ships. Current challenges
include copper leaching, slime formation, low adhesion, stronger regulations,
maintenance costs for the ship hull and keel, costs associated with down time,
and high fuel consumption resulting from bioaccumulation. This project will:
a)advance the understanding of the required performance for factors such as the
contact angle, surface tension of normally and functionalized nanopatterned
surfaces; b) outline future studies such as interactions between surface energy,
wettability, film thickness, and rheology; and c) determine future
characterization needs. Potential outcomes include the reduction of copper
leaching below 9 Âµg/cm2 and reduction of copper loading to less than
0.005%.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
