Many physical and social phenomena can be modeled mathematically using partial
differential operators. The Laplace operator is a differential operator that has
long played an important role in mechanics, physics, and mathematics. The
complex Laplace operator is a natural outgrowth of the classical Laplace
operator in complex analysis of several variables, a branch of mathematics where
algebra, analysis, and geometry intertwine. This research project investigates
analytic and geometric properties of the complex Laplace operator, in
particular, its spectrum. Spectral analysis is a major tool in scientific
research, and spectral properties of the complex Laplace operator are known to
be closely related to certain quantum phenomena in physics. The goal of this
project is to understand how algebraic, analytic, and geometric structures of
the underlying complex space interact with each other. The project combines
ideas and methods from several branches of mathematics, and the techniques under
development could potentially have applications in other areas of mathematics
and physical sciences. This project involves undergraduate students in research
activities and broadens participation of underrepresented groups in mathematics.

The complex Neumann Laplace operator is a prototype of an elliptic operator with
non-coercive boundary conditions. Since the work of Kohn and HÃ¶rmander in the
1960's, there have been extensive studies on regularity theory of the complex
Neumann Laplace operator that led to important discoveries in both partial
differential equations and several complex variables. The main thrust of this
proposal is to study spectral theory of the complex Neumann Laplace operator,
with emphasis on the interplay between the spectral behavior of the operator and
the underlying geometric structures. Among the problems studied in this project
are stability of the spectrum as the underlying structures deform and
characterization of complex manifolds whose complex Laplace operator has
discrete spectrum. Also investigated are regularity theory of the Cauchy-Riemann
operator on complex manifolds, reproducing kernels, invariant metrics, and their
applications to problems in complex algebraic geometry. This project supports
research activities of undergraduate and graduate students, facilitates the
development of new courses that attract students into mathematics, and fosters
interdisciplinary research.
