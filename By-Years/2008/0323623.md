&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an experimental program centered on the
implementation and investigation of continuous-variable (CV) quantum
information. This program is based on the use of ultra-stable optical parametric
oscillators (OPO) above threshold, emitting bright entangled fields. Significant
experimental challenges associated with these systems, such as the need for
exquisite frequency- and intensity-stability of the OPO, have been overcome
recently by our group by use of brute force approaches involving sophisticated
optical design and electronic servo-stabilization. The objectives are the
generation of CV GHZ states, the realization of a quantum optical teleportation
network (including CV entanglement swapping), and the implementation of quantum
error correction. These studies fit in the broader scope of applying quantum
optical CV to quantum computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the
proposed activity comprise graduate education in Physics and the development of
interdisciplinary collaborations with other Departments and Schools at the
University of Virginia, in particular in the context of the University of
Virginia 2020 Initiative for the Sciences. In addition, the PI is active in the
teaching and dissemination of quantum physics and quantum information in
Virginia high schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
