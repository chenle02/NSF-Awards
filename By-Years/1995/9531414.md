Dr. Lorraine Deck and other members of the Chemistry Department at the
University of New Mexico are being supported to continue a Research Experiences
for Undergraduates (REU) site in chemistry. For the period 1996-98, ten
undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in
basic research projects drawn from the traditional areas of chemistry and
biochemistry. The site encourages participants from small institutions in the
southwestern United States, particularly minority students from the Native
American and Hispanic communities.
