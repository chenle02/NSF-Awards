A consortium of community colleges in Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky and Tennessee
plan for a National Center of Excellence in Automotive Manufacturing. The
automotive manufacturing sector has changed dramatically from reliance on
assembly-line workers to a decentralized, "lean manufacturing" model using
multiple suppliers and computer-based technologies. The goal of the Center is to
improve the capacity and capability of community and technical colleges to
attract and educate high skill, multifaceted technicians for the automotive
manufacturing industry, about 80% of which resides in the geographic area of the
consortium. The planning activities are to develop a common vision based upon
the experience and expertise of colleges and individuals involved and an
organization for a virtual center to implement the vision using Internet based
techniques and media to facilitate communication. A major conference and
regional workshops are used to obtain descriptions of workforce needs from all
constituencies and determine their level of commitment. An industry-based
advisory board guides the development and information is sought from research
and consulting groups specializing in the automotive manufacturing industry.
