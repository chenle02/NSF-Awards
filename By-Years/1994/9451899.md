conditioning systems which enhance the program in animal behavior. The equipment
is used mainly with upper level undergraduates for laboratories, classroom
demonstrations, and independent research. The program has various specific
goals, including an increase of student interest in research and technology,
opportunities for more advanced and creative student projects, and fostering
critical thought and understanding of research design. Also, student's who have
hands-on experience with modern equipment are better prepared for science
professions and for life in an increasingly technological society.
