The Graduate Student Combinatorics Conference (GSCC) will be held April 6-8,
2017 at the University of Texas at Dallas. This will be the 14th annual GSCC,
which is traditionally organized by graduate students and has benefited greatly
from NSF support in the past. The GSCC focuses on graduate student research
presentations and will include keynote addresses by Catherine Yan (Texas
A&amp;M), Karola Mészáros (Cornell), Fan Chung Graham (UCSD), and Po-shen Loh
(Carnegie Mellon). The GSCC provides a unique and invaluable opportunity for
graduate students in combinatorics to experience the benefits of taking part in
a research conference. Giving their own presentations allows graduate students
to develop their teaching and presentation skills, helping them succeed as
junior researchers. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Combinatorics is a vibrant field of
mathematics with applications to many disciplines including algebra, geometry,
topology, probability, computer science, and analysis. This conference will
inform junior investigators of recent advances made in this lively and exciting
field, and provide them with a setting to present their own original research.
The GSCC provides a great opportunity for graduate students to network, and has
led to joint research projects among participants in the past.&lt;br/&gt;
