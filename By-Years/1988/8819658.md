Two key issues hindering the incineration of chlorine containing hydrocarbons
are addressed: the difficulty of detecting trace chlorine species in exhaust
streams, and the lack of quantitative combustion kinetics for chlorinated
hydrocarbons. A nonintrusive probe with fractional part per billion sensitivity
will be studied by first producing fluorescence measurements. Various uv
excitation and monitoring wavelengths will be explored to optimize the
sensivity. The second issue will be addressed by assembling a kinetics mechanism
for chlorinated hydrocarbon combustion and testing it in a methane/methyl
chloride/oxygen flame at 100 torr. The problems being attacked are of critical
importance to waste incineration technology. The research will lead to a more
fundamental understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the fate of
chlorinated species during combustion, and will hasten the development of a
Cl/HCl monitor for industrial source applications.
