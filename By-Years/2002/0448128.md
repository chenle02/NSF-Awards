CCF CAREER 0448128&lt;br/&gt;William R. Cook&lt;br/&gt;University of Texas at
Austin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Integrating Programming Languages and Databases
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Programs that use databases are central to our information
infrastructure. But building efficient and maintainable data-oriented systems is
difficult because procedural languages and relational databases are based on
different semantic foundations and optimization strategies. In addition,
databases and programming are taught separately so that developers trained in
one domain may not be expert in the other domain. Finally, there has not been
sufficient evaluation of the performance of different integration approaches.
The goal of this project is to create methods, languages and tools which enable
application programmers to readily develop efficient and well-structured
programs for applications that integrate database processing&lt;br/&gt;into
procedural programs. Programming languages will be extended to specify modular
and type-safe database operations, while leveraging database query optimization
and concurrency control. Near-term research will focus on defining queries as
type-safe classes within the context of existing systems. Longer-term research
will focus on extracting database queries from procedural programs. In
additional to traditional performance benchmarking, open-source applications
will be used to test the effectiveness of proposed solutions. The project will
also explore ways to integrate database and programming courses. Taken together,
these results can significantly improve the development of software systems that
combine procedural programming with&lt;br/&gt;relational databases.
