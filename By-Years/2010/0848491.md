In this project the PI will measure the permeability of the lacunar-canalicular
bone porosity and will develop a poroelastic model to predict the interchange of
interstitial fluid between the lacunar-canalicular porosity and the much larger
pore size vascular porosity in normal, cyclic, whole body motion (e.g.,
walking). The techniques for accomplishing these measurements have been explored
in a pilot study. The development of a poroelastic model to predict the
interchange of interstitial fluid between the lacunar-canalicular porosity and
the much larger pore size vascular porosity in normal, cyclic, whole body motion
introduces a new concept of nested pore space structures. Understanding bone
mechanotransduction is fundamental to the understanding of how to treat
osteoporosis, how to cope with microgravity in long term manned space flight and
how to design prostheses that are implanted in bone tissue to function for
longer periods. The research project will involve CCNY and City Tech students,
students at the CCNY High School for Math, Science and Engineering as well as
students at M.S. 319, the Maria Teresa Maribal School. The NYC professional
community interested in bone health will be kept abreast of research
developments in the public NYC Bone Seminar Series.
