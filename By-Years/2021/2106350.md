Implementation Projects in the Historically Black Colleges and Universities -
Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) provide support to design, implement, study, and
assess comprehensive institutional efforts to increase the numbers of students
and the quality of their preparation by strengthening science, technology,
engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education and research. This implementation
project at the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff (UAPB) seeks to enhance the
capacity of the university’s STEM faculty in high impact practices that engage
students and leverage the institution’s resources for sustained collaboration.
Specifically, the project aims to establish a STEM Academy for Research and
Entrepreneurship. It is anticipated that students who participate in the
proposed activities will be well-suited to attend graduate school and/or enter
the STEM Entrepreneurship workforce. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The UAPB STEM Academy
for Research and Entrepreneurship integrates science and business disciplines to
create a synergistic approach to solving today’s society of complex problems by
utilizing technology at the forefront. The goal of the project is to fast-track
the number of STEM graduates who attend graduate school or enter STEM
entrepreneurship and thereby increase the number of STEM researchers and the
talented graduates who engage in STEM entrepreneurial leadership. The overall
goal of the project is anchored to three objectives: (1) increase in the
graduation rate of STEM four-year graduates, (2) increase the rate of entry to
graduate school, and (3) increase the number of students who enter
entrepreneurial endeavors. The attainment of the measurable objectives is
organized on the principles of socialization theory and social learning where
human behaviors and mindset develop based on ideas, beliefs, values, and social
experiences transmitted by informal and formal groups of reference (family,
neighborhood, friends, schools) surrounding the individuals.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is jointly funded by the Historically Black
Colleges and Universities - Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) and the Established
Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
