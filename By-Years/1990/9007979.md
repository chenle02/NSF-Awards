Over the past 25 years, advances in the biological sciences have resulted in
dramatic improvements in the understanding of biological processes, especially
at the molecular level. However, great opportunities also exist in plant science
research. Because of the great research opportunities in the plant sciences, the
National Academy of Sciences - National Research Council propose to conduct a
five-month study to provide a general assessment of plant science research and
funding programs in the United States and make recommendations on how they can
be strengthened.
