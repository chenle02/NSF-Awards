Ecological and genetic theory predict that there should be trade-offs between
life history traits such as reproductive output and lifespan. Genes that result
in greater reproduction should also produce shortened life span. This theory, if
correct, supports the idea that senescence has a genetic basis and that
senescence is a consequence of normal processes that favor increased
reproduction at the expense of shortened lifespan. Furthermore, this theory
points a way, in principle, to genetic modification of fertility and lifespan.
While some experimental observations support this expectation of trade-offs,
many do not. The absence of trade- offs in a number of experimental studies may
be a consequence of the testing of organisms in environments to which they are
not adapted, as would be the case when wild-caught organisms are brought into
the laboratory. Under this hypothesis, some individuals will carry genes that
fortuitously are favorable in a new environment. Those individuals will be
generally more vigorous than other individuals that by chance carry genes that
are not favorable in the new environment. This situation will produce a pattern
of positive associations between life history traits, rather than a pattern of
trade-offs. However, the positive associations should be a transient phenomenon,
and as populations adapt to their new environment, the expected pattern of
trade-offs should be reestablished. These experiments will test the robustness
of basic theories underlying the evolution of characters such as lifespan, and
the predictive value of the theory in novel environments, such as would occur
during global climate change.
