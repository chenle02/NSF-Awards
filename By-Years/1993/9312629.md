Technical Narrative: This proposed conference and workshop, organized by the
Foundation for African Education and Development in Berkeley, California and the
University of Abidjan, Ivory Coast, is scheduled for 20-27 January 1994 in
Abidjan, Ivory Coast. This activity will bring together highly regarded experts
representing a number of fields in pure mathematics and mathematical physics
with the overall objective of building international networks between African
scientists and their U.S. counterparts. This project supports the participation
of approximately seven U.S. and nine African scientists. Conference participants
will present papers that will be compiled and published as a conference volume.
This conference/workshop in physics and mathematical sciences fulfills the
program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts
in the United States and Africa to combine complementary talents and present
research results in areas of strong mutual interest and competence. This
activity has an educational and outreach effort that has the potential for
generating new scientific activity and new international linkages.
