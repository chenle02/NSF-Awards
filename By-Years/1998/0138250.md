A comprehensive analysis of sub-synoptic-scale variability of aerosol properties
will be carried out. For this purpose, the PIs will assemble and merge data from
a large number of field campaigns, including ground-based and airborne
measurements of aerosol physical, chemical and optical properties relevant to
direct climate forcing. Instrumental noise and uncertainty will be quantified.
Then the merged data set will be statistically characterized to determine
patterns of variation and covariation that apply across multiple regions and
aerosol types. A general statistical model of aerosol variability will be built
and used to interpret and design future field
experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project, if successful, will provide new
information about patterns of aerosol variability and covariances of aerosol
parameters. This information in turn will be useful for designing future field
experiments as well as satellite instruments.
