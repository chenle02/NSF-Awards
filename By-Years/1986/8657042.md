Dr. Lybrand will be developing and applying computer modeling techniques to the
study of ligand-biomolecule interactions. The project is multidisciplinary in
nature, drawing on computational techniques from theoretical chemistry and
interactive computer graphics modeling methodology from computer science,
coupled with basic science components of biochemistry and pharmacology.
Collaborative efforts will be made with specialists in complementary fields such
as computer science and theoretical chemistry. This will greatly enhance the
research in computer simulation by drawing from state-of-the-art methodologies
and resources in various disciplines.
