Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is a technique that uses
absorption of infrared energy to probe molecular structure. The presence of an
FTIR system is crucial for enhancing the research environment of the modern
chemistry department. In the Chemistry Department of the North Carolina State
University, the acquisition of an FTIR system will be supported by an award made
jointly by the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program and the Instrumentation
for Materials Research Program. The areas of research that will be enhanced
include: 1) Studies of the spectroelectrochemistry of heme protein electron
transfer reactions. 2) Studies on intramolecular and intraligand charge
localization in electrochemically reduced di- and triimines and their d-6 metal
complexes. 3) Studies on very fine films of the dielectric silicon nitride and
semiconductor silicon carbide prepared by laser and electrochemically confined
plasma techniques.
