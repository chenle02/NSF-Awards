This award will help support a three-year project to study young exoplanets
(planets around other stars), along with the debris disks out of which the
planets formed. The observations will use a combination of high angular
resolution and dynamic range imaging. There will be three components to this
effort: (1) direct imaging of exoplanets and their associated debris disks
determine the composition, size distribution, and porosity of the grain
populations in the disks; (2) an optical survey of exoplanets using a new, high
precision polarimeter to detect scattered light from exoplanet atmospheres; and
(3) preparation for future exoplanet surveys with the Gemini Planet Imager by
identifying young stars and measuring approximate
ages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is designed to find planets at large
separation from their parent stars, which will test planet formation theory and
help decide if core accretion or gravitational disk instability are valid
paradigms. Measurements of planetary diameters will provide information about
the behavior of matter at extreme pressures. Many of the debris disks in this
study may be in a stage similar to the late heavy bombardment era in our own
Solar System; during this era, scattering of small bodies brought water to the
terrestrial planet zone and enabled life on Earth.
