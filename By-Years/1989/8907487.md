Dr. Robert T. Kennedy has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Kennedy's doctoral degree was from the University of North
Carolina under the supervision of Professor James W. Jorgenson. Dr. Kennedy
intends to continue research at the University of North Carolina under the
sponsorship of Professor Mark Wightman. Dr. Kennedy's area of postdoctoral
research will be the development of an electrochemical sensor capable of
monitoring glucose and oxygen in the brain. The Postdoctoral Fellowships in
Chemistry Program is viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to
broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D's and attract them into
meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and teaching.
