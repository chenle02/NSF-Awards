9602246 This award provides additional support for a BIO Research Training Group
in the Analysis of Biological Diversification first established in 1991. During
this course of this second award, NSF support will be phased out as other
sources of funding are secured. The 24 member faculty group is drawn from 6
departments and 2 divisions at the University of Arizona. The funds awarded will
provide stipends for undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral trainees,
purchase computational equipment, and to bring investigators from other research
and academic institutions to the campus for seminars. University resources will
augment the funds provided by NSF in most of these and in other categories.
Molecular, developmental, and population biologists, as well as systematists,
ecologists and paleontologists, have developed distinctive approaches to the
study of biological diversity. Owing to the way in which students have been
trained traditionally, the connections among these approaches have not been
explored in detail. While their individual research interests are as diverse as
the list above, the faculty have formed this group with the aim of using
phylogeny, which can be viewed as the history of diversification, as an approach
to the integration of these disparate perspectives. ***
