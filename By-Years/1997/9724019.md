In this GOALI program the PI's will explore novel techniques for the joint
spatial and temporal characterization of fast- pulsed electric fields. These new
techniques are based on interferometric, as opposed to spectrographic, methods.
A major long-term objective of the program is to develop measurement tools that
are simple to implement and flexible enough to be used for a wide range of pulse
energies, wavelengths and time duration. Such tools would have potential
application in a broad range of scientific disciplines, including physics,
material science, chemistry, and biology. The research is conducted in
collaboration between the group at the University of Rochester and the co- PI
from Clark-MXR. Experimental efforts will be divided between the two locations,
with students working partially at Rochester and partially at the laboratories
of Clark-MXR. Partial funding is provided by the Office of Multidisciplinary
Activities (OMA).
