Almlof 9404902 The self-consistent-field (SCF) method is severely limited by the
computational cost of assembling the Fock matrix. This research will address
this problem by separating the long-range, classical electrostatic contributions
to the Fock matrix from those involving local, quantum interactions. A portable,
scable SCF code will be developed which will, for the first time, systematize
the most demanding part of an SCF calculation.
