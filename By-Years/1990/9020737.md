This is a project the objective of which is to assess the current status of
environmental biotechnology with particular reference to technical and
environmental issues involved in the development of biodegradable plastics. It
will involve assessment of the "state-of-the- science/engineering" associated
with biodegradation, photodegradation and recycling of plastics. The project
will involve interviews with academic researchers, persons associated with the
plastics industry, and governmental agencies concerned with the use and
regulation of technologies involved in the management of waste plastics. Results
of this project are expect to provide a basis for determination of future
research needs. The three undergraduate students who will be working on this
project are Emin Abufele, Jodi Pisinski and Christ Sparages. Faculty advisors in
addition to the Principal Investigator include WPI Professors Rollings and
Ljungquist. This project is jointly supported by the Environmental Systems
component of the Environmental and Ocean Systems Program and by the
Biotechnology Program in the Division of Biological and Critical Systems.
