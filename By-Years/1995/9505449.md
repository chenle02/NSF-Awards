The PI will study the phenomenon of mesospheric clouds, their atmospheric
environment, and their role in middle atmospheric global change. The PI will
combine (1) data analysis of existing data gathered by spacecraft, rockets and
ground-based radar; and (2) theoretical modeling of the microphysics of
mesospheric ice particle evolution, and of the atmospheric environment,
including coupled dynamics, radiation, and photochemistry of the mesosphere and
lower thermosphere. The research will increase understanding of physical
processes occurring in the upper mesosphere, an atmospheric region which is
still poorly understood because of its complexity and inaccessibility.***
