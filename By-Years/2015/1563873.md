This project leverages techniques from the real-time systems domain to construct
a scalable Network Function Virtualization (NFV) platform that can provide
latency and throughput guarantees in a cloud computing setting. Real-time
systems have been successfully providing performance guarantees on a wide range
of devices, including critical ones such as airbags and pacemakers, where even
small delays must be carefully avoided; hence, this technology
can&lt;br/&gt;provide a solid foundation for an NFV platform with predictable
performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the proposed
research is 1) the development of novel, scalable real-time scheduling
techniques suited for NFV platforms, 2) the integration of elasticity and run-
time adaptation with these scheduling techniques, 3) the application of
declarative networking and query planning techniques to analyze and efficiently
schedule virtual network functions, and 4) the development of suitable
diagnostic primitives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the proposed
research lies in the development of next-generation NFV platforms&lt;br/&gt;that
will both simplify network management in data centers and support emerging
performance-critical applications.
