This Research Opportunity for Women Career Achievement Award will support a
cultural anthropologist who has had a productive research career in studying
tropical indigenous hunters and gathers in the Bolivian Amazon. This award will
allow this scientist to develop her expertise by studying tropical ecology at
the University of Florida, and by putting her knowledge of new ecological
techniques to immediate use by continuing her research in lowland Bolivia on the
foraging activities of two indigenous groups. This project is important because
it will expand the scientific expertise of a female cultural anthropologist,
allowing her to serve as a role model for women considering a career in science.
In addition the new knowledge she will gain on ecological methods will allow her
to collaborate more productively with biological ecologists. Knowledge of the
foraging activities of indigenous peoples is important because they may have
adaptive procedures that will help us understand how to conserve to tropical
forest.
