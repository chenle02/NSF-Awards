This research is to study the problem of obtaining an accurate description of
the probabilistic behavior of sums of dependent random variables. Essential
tools for the proposed work will be recent results in the area of decoupling
inequalities. A decoupling inequality transforms problems on sums of dependent
random variables to problems on sums of conditionally independent random
variables. In the proposed work, particular attention will be focused on
developing tail probability approximations for randomly stopped sums, quadratic
forms of independent random variables, and the general problem of sums of
arbitrarily dependent random variables. This research is to study some important
problems in probability theory. In particular, the investigator will look at the
behavior of sums of dependent observations. These sums will be studied by
comparing them to appropriate sums of independent observations.
