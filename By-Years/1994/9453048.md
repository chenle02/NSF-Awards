9453048 Semper ABSTRACT: The Exploratorium is developing the pilot for a
Saturday morning science-oriented, live-action, film and animation, national
network television series for teens aged 13 to 17. The half-hour show will
present everyday science and the process of problem solving in a fast-paced,
hip, and challenge-oriented format. Two teams, each of three teenagers, will
compete in a series of challenges which require the application of common sense
knowledge, observation, experimentation, and problem-solving strategies useful
in science. The object is to demonstrate that real-world problem solving makes
use of many skills and may have more than one solution. The Exploratorium will
administer the project and will be responsible for the science content.
Production will be done by Colossal Pictures, a San Francisco production studio
experienced in animation and youth-oriented programming.
