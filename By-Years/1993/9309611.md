9309611 Oberdick The cerebellum is a brain region that is critical for the
coordination of movement. Much is known about the structure and function of the
cerebellum. One striking characteristic of the cerebellum is that it is divided
into a series of modules. Each module has a unique set of input and output
connections with other brain regions. Each module appears to subserve a specific
movement function for a discrete part of the body. This project will seek to
understand how the different modules become delineated during development.
Specific genes will be identified that are responsible for this process in the
cerebellum. The results of this study will offer new insights into how regional
differences develop in the brain. *** tspool NETWORK ERROR windows devices ports
