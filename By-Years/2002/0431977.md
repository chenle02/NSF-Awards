This award provides partial support for the acquisition of a bead-based
genotyping instrument. The instrument will permit high throughput, low cost
genotyping of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) by a consortium of users at
several Southern California institutions, including: UCLA, UC Irvine, UC San
Diego, and the University of Southern California. The system will be used for
genome-wide association studies and intensive study of selected genome regions
in numerous populations and different organisms. Projects that will benefit from
the acquisition include: (1) determining if linkage disequilibrium mapping can
be used as an extremely efficient method for understanding the molecular basis
of variation in plants, (2) development of general methods for improving
cultivated crops, (3) understanding wing eyespot patterning in butterflies, (4)
dissecting postzygotic isolation in copepods, (5) characterizing economically
important oysters, and (6) mammalian conservation efforts.
