There is a large disparity in the gender of researchers in robotics. As the
field of robotics becomes more integrated in every aspect of our society it is
important that there be more women roboticists. This award helps US graduate
students travel to attend the Women in Robotics workshop that will take place at
the Robotics Science and Systems conference. This workshop will highlight the
work of important female roboticists and by raising their visibility hopefully
encourage more women to pursue robotics research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Robots
are anticipated to be an integral part of meeting societal needs in domains like
healthcare, space exploration, and education. To meet the growing demand for
robotics technologies in these domains, the pool of capable roboticists will
need to grow in kind. However, the number of female roboticists entering the
field continues to notably lag behind male counterparts. This gender disparity
presents a significant hurdle for adequately meeting the demand for experienced
robot scientists. The Meet the Women in Robotics Workshop (WiRW) is focused on
reducing the gender gap in the robotics domain by providing an opportunity to
feature the work of prominent female roboticists. The fifth Meet the Women in
Robotics Workshop (WiRW) aims to (1) raise the visibility of women in robotics,
(2) strengthen the community of female roboticists and provide an opportunity
for networking, and (3) connect junior robotics researchers to senior mentors in
the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
