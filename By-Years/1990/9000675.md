This project will establish an NSF Research Experience for Undergraduate site in
aerospace and mechanical engineering. The Recruitment of student candidates for
this program will concentrate on universities within 500 miles of Notre Dame,
Indiana. Several universities outside of the area that do not have graduate
programs will also be contacted. With the assistance of the National Consortium
for Graduate Degrees for Minorities, Inc., minority students will be encouraged
to apply to the program. The students selected will participate in a meaningful
research experience for two summer month eliminating in a presentation of the
results of their efforts. The program is designed to increase the awareness of
qualified undergraduate students in engineering or science of the opportunities
afforded by a career in research for those who pursue graduate studies. Student
research projects include camera-assisted manipulator placement precision
structural design of flight vehicles, trajectonics of micron-size droplets used
for low thrust propulsion in space, shockwave/turbulant boundary lay
interactions, and interferometer mapping of three dimensional temperature
fields.
