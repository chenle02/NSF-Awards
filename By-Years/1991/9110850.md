The objective of the research is to determine the stability characteristics of
multi-layer internal flows in configurations relevant to coextrusion processes.
The primary interest is to study the effect of non-parallel channel walls on the
two mechanisms for instability: the mechanism associated with the presence of
fluid-fluid interfaces and the mechanism associated with the presence of solid
walls. The baseline geometry to be studied is a two-dimensional channel
consisting of two constant width sections joined by a converging section. The
stability of steady isothermal flow of three layers of Newtonian fluids of
different viscosities and densities will be examined using local linear
analysis, global linear analysis, and direct numerical simulation. The direct
numerical simulation will be based on time- accurate integration of the
spectrally discretized (spectral elements) full unsteady Navier-Stokes equation.
The study will be extended to non-Newtonian fluids and will incorporate thermal
effects. The long term goal of the project is the development of a reliable
method for the (1) prediction of stability characteristics of coextrusion
processes and (2) design testing, and analysis of coextrusion dies. The research
will lead to improved manufacturing process for coextrusion of polymers.
