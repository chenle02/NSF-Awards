HRD-9702034 Howell Through committed leadership and an innovative use of
resources, The South Carolina Alliance for Minority Participation (SCAMP) has
been effective in increasing the participation of underrepresented students in
science, mathematics, engineering and technology (SMET) fields. An
underrepresented level of collaboration among Alliance partners has fostered the
development of new outcomes that have increased student success as demonstrated
by the gains in enrollments and degrees awarded since the project's inception.
Support from the business sector, State Government and other strategic
partnerships have made SMET education a reality for all students. Building on
foundation of the first phase of NSF funding, SCAMP will achieve greater success
through expansion of its programs and activities to include greater numbers of
participants. An increased emphasis on two-year transfers and transition to
graduate school will be featured in Phase II. The curriculum reform efforts will
be extended to a new target disciplines such as chemistry, physics, and computer
science. Linkages with business and industry will be expanded to sustain success
beyond the Phase II funding period. The high level of cost-sharing in Phase II
represents the strong commitment by institutional leaders. New legislation and
policies that call for increased accountability for student success and
performance will foster greater institutionalization of SCAMP programs and
activities and will create new opportunities for involvement from all sectors.
