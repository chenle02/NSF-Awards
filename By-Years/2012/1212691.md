In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor Timothy D. Lash of the Department of Chemistry at Illinois
State University will explore the synthesis, characterization, and reactivity of
porphyrin-like macrocycles, including neo-confused porphyrins and other
carbaporphyrinoid systems. Specifically, syntheses of heterobenziporphyrins and
heteropyriporphyrins will be developed using a "3 + 1" strategy. The chemistry
of previously prepared monocarbaporphyrins will also be studied. A strategy for
synthesizing carbaporphyrins and carbachlorins from a cyclopentene dialdehyde
and a new route to benzocarbaporphyrins from 6-methoxyazulene will be developed.
General approaches to the synthesis of a new class of porphyrin isomers known as
neo-confused porphyrins will be investigated. In addition to
dicarbaporphyrinoids, tri- or tetracarbaporphyrinoid systems will be
studied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will not only lead to more efficient
routes to carbaporphyrinoid systems but will also allow access to new classes of
porphyrin analogues. This project is important to improve our basic
understanding of fundamental chemistry concepts such as aromaticity. It also has
practical applications for the synthesis of fine chemicals, since the target
compounds can be used to construct catalysts for chemical synthesis. In
addition, the target compounds are important in medicines, as they have
potential applications in photodynamic therapy. These projects not only provide
an excellent environment for training undergraduates and master level graduate
students in the field of organic synthesis, but they also expose them to the
multidisciplinary nature of modern scientific research.
