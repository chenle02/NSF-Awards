This project will study monsoon circulations with a view to the complex
interplay between the dynamics of the atmosphere and land/sea boundaries, and
the role of monsoon depressions in the overall behavior of monsoon systems. This
research will address the structure and dynamics of idealized circulations,
using a general circulation model with a full representation of moist processes,
but in equilibrium simulations and in idealized situations as far as boundary
conditions are concerned. There will be a focus on the existence of thresholds
demarcating different types of behavior, the dynamics of cross-equatorial flow
driven by remote forcing, and the role of eddies in monsoon circulations. A
graduate student will participate in this research.
