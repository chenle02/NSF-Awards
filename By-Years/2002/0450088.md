This project will offer a program of professional development to scientists who
are engaged with K-12 education. By focusing on scientific inquiry in the
classroom, it will help scientists understand how to apply their deep knowledge
of the scientific process to their education and outreach activities. The goals
of the project are 1) to increase the involvement and effectiveness of
scientists participating in K-12 education, 2) to draw scientists into
additional professional development experiences that will further enhance their
ability to contribute to education, and 3) to identify the knowledge,
motivations, and needs of scientists working with K-12 education, and to
understand how they respond to and act upon professional development
opportunities in education. The goals will be met by 1) a workshop that will
travel to several geoscience professional society meetings, 2) providing
materials and doing follow-up with participating scientists, 3) a web-based
collection of annotated resources, and 4) an evaluation-with-research study of
the readiness, response, and needs of this community for professional
development.
