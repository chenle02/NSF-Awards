This project is collaborative with SES 9109809 (Lawler). This project continues
and extends a theory of bargaining and deterrence studied under previous NSF
grants. The theory tested here integrates theories of bilateral deterrence with
those of unilateral positive initiatives. The most important new idea under test
is that power relations between parties - in par- ticular, high ability of both
parties to punish each other - condition the success of conciliatory
initiatives. The extended theory is tested in a series of laboratory experiments
in which parties bargain, exchanging offers and counteroffers, while also having
the capability to levy punitive damage on each other. Results identify abstract,
general conditions under which con- flicting parties can produce conciliation
without intervention of mediators or arbitrators.
