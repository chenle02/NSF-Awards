Two of the major threats to freshwater ecosystems worldwide include water
diversions and exotic species. Scientists working with natural resource managers
are developing methods for restoring stream ecosystems and evaluating whether
native species, including fish and invertebrates will respond positively to
restoration actions. This research uses Fossil Creek, Arizona as a model system
for studying whether restoration actions can restore native food webs. Upcoming
restoration projects include returning full flows by decommissioning a large
hydropower dam and chemical removal of exotic fish. This study will combine fish
and invertebrate surveys with stable isotope analysis of food web structure
prior to and following the restoration treatments to evaluate whether rivers can
be restored following a century of disturbance. Results from this case study
will be applicable to other large restoration projects throughout the
country.&lt;br/&gt;
