The PI will use knowledge of the time-varying magnetic field at the core-mantle
boundary to further the understanding of the kinematics and dynamics of the
secular variation, and to provide useful constraints on theories of the
geodynamo. Specially, he will work in three areas: 1) the continuation of work
on developing more reliable methods of determining the pattern of fluid flow at
the top of the core, aiming, initially, to confirm recent tentative findings
concerning the dynamics of the flow; 2) the continuation of forward modeling
techniques providing simple explanations of observed phenomena in the magnetic
field; 3) and the investigation of wave-like phenomena observed in the magnetic
field, and the development of new techniques for separating waves from the
background field.
