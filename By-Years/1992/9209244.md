Neuropeptides are signals that are released by nerve cells to transmit
information to other nerve cells and to other cells in the body, like muscle,
glands and skin. Very often within a single neuron, neuropeptides are released
along with specific neurotransmitters and modulate their subsequent action.
Indeed, the nervous system is designed to received and transmit information and
neuropeptides are central to those basic processes. While it is estimated that
100's of neuropeptides are made by nerve cells, only 1% of all nerve cells
express a given neuropeptide gene. Dr. Taghert will use an innovative molecular
genetic approach to examine the fundamental mechanisms underlying the expression
and release of neuropeptides. He will create and recover loss-of-function
mutations in a specific gene for a precursor protein that encodes 13 related
neuropeptides. By studying individuals that are chronically deficient in the
production of these molecules, Dr. Taghert will determine function and whether
other neuropeptides share overlapping roles. In addition, he has developed
methodology to put genes back and thus, will assess the specific capacity of
subsets of encoded neuropeptides to restore lost functions. These experiments
will lead to a better understanding of the roles played by the neuropeptide gene
in individual neurons. Since Drosophila is used as the model system,
demonstrating the lethal nature of mutations in the neuropeptide encoding gene
may help stimulate research into insecticides that act by inhibiting
neuropeptide synthesis or neuropeptide stimulated neurotransmission.
