This proposal is concerned with the development of a Geographic Information
Systems (GIS) /Image Processing Laboratory. Although GIS and Image processing
are complimentary analytical "tools" which are commonly used in geography,
geology and other fields, they rarely have been operationally linked and
integrated into a single system.Students in eighteen classes will have a direct
hands-on opportunity to utilize the proposed multi-user, multi-task laboratory
for classroom and research projects. Hard copy products from the GIS/Image
processing Laboratory will be utilized as demonstrating models in several other
classes. The proposed hardware and software package represent state-of-the-art
technology in the GIS and Image processing fields. Access to such technology and
hands-on experience will enable our students to effectively compete for the
burgeoning employment opportunities in fields utilizing GIS/Image processing
services.
