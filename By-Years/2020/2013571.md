Quantum computers hold out the promise of revolutionizing the landscape of
computing and society. UC-Berkeley is deeply committed to playing a major part
in this revolution, by rapidly scaling its existing effort in this field,
leveraging its existing interdisciplinary centers, BQIC (Berkeley Quantum
Information and Computation Center) and CQCS (Center for Quantum Coherent
Science), as well as close proximity of the Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory (LBNL)---home of the $30M DOE quantum testbed effort. The new Quantum
Computing &amp; Information Science Faculty Fellow (QCIS-FF) hire in computer
science, funded by this award, will expand the exploration of novel quantum
algorithms and protocols for benchmarking and verifying quantum computers. It
will also help to meet an exploding student demand for courses in QIS.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UC-Berkeley is poised at a singular moment in the field of
quantum computing, with small to medium-scale quantum computers on the verge of
becoming a reality. Moving forward, what is called for is an interdisciplinary
effort that brings together experimental and theoretical physicists and computer
scientists working on the full stack from experimental realization to
benchmarking and quantum error correction, to designing quantum algorithms and
applications and protocols for verifying quantum computations. The QCIS-FF award
will help coalesce this interdisciplinary effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
