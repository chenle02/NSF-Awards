A classical result in the theory of income accounting is that for the case of a
time-autonomous technology with no uncertainty and a constant real interest
rate, ideal Green NNP exactly equals annuity-equivalent consumption. In this
case, a theoretically appealing measure of economic activity exactly forecasts a
theoretically appealing index of potential future power to consume. This
research will extend the basic model beyond its classical assumptions to
investigate four important extensions: (1) technological progress, (2)
uncertainty, (3) welfare foundations, and (4) empirical applications. The main
theoretical part of project will provide a rigorous connection between the
following five concepts: (1) Sustainable Equivalence, meaning the level of
sustainable-equivalent utility the economy can provide, evaluated at the rate of
pure time preference; (2) Annuitized Consumption, meaning the hypothetical
stationary-equivalent consumption the economy can deliver, evaluated at the
prevailing rate of interest; (3) Green NNP, meaning the most inclusive
consumption-based measure of NNP that can be assembled in practice with
reasonably accurate efficiency prices on investments; (4) Incompleteness,
meaning the degree to which the list of available capital goods fails to account
for all sources of growth, as measured by the relative strength of the residual
factor; (5) Linearized Hamiltonian, meaning an affine scaling procedure that
makes utility-based and consumption-based systems be comparable. The main
empirical part of the research evaluates numerically the loss of global welfare
from running out of each of the major non-renewable resources, including
petroleum. The research will provide actual numerical estimates of how much
final consumption the world loses on average from finiteness of the earth's
resources.
