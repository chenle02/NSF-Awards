The University of Iowa will initiate two identical, three-week, institutes as
part of a residential Young Scholars project in Engineering for 60 students
entering grades 11,12. These engineering institutes, offered successively during
the summer of 1991, will include a directed creative engineering design
experience involving all the students as a team to find a solution to a real-
world, social-technical problem for an identifiable client. The project also
will include a follow-up program which involves a mentor at each participant's
high school and a number of activities to be completed during the 1991-92
academic year. This project is based on a pilot program held during the summer
of 1990.
