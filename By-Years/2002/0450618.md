This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project focuses on the
development of new pharmaceutical agents to selectively enhance tumor imaging
using gallium 67. A photo-degradation product of nifedipine, nitrosipine, has
been found to selectively enhance the uptake of Ga67 by tumor cells. A specific
derivative of nitrosipine has an even better selective uptake of the radioactive
imaging agent. This project will synthesize and test other nitrosipine
derivatives and determine the efficacy of Ga67 uptake in animal models using
these complexing agents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial application of this
technology is in the area of diagnostic imaging. The use of Ga67 in tumor
imaging is currently very limited due to poor selectivity of the agent for tumor
cells. Enhanced uptake in tumor cells relative to normal cells would expand the
types of tumors that could be effectively imaged and possibly replace the more
costly and complex PET scan imaging using radioactive fluorinated
sugars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
