9312647 Mileti The project will bring together existing natural hazards
knowledge from all relevant fields. It will examine what is the level of the
available knowledge, how all the pertinent disciplinary research is being
integrated, and what should be the future research agenda with the purpose of
maximizing natural hazards mitigation for sustainable growth and development. A
full range of experts and students will assemble and codify existing
information, analyze it and make research recommendations. The examination of
issues such as risk management and the increased globalization, complexity and
interdependence of environmental, physical and socio-economic systems will be
part of the project. The results of the work will influence the nation's hazards
research agenda, change research priorities and encourage the creation of a new
generation of natural hazards experts. ***
