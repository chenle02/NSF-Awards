This project involves a series of experiments with interacting cold atoms in
far-off-resonance optical lattices. Arrays of coupled and independent one-
dimensional (1D) gases of bosons will be prepared and studied to help resolve
some outstanding mysteries of quantum statistical mechanics and quantum phase
transitions. Prior experiments by the group have explored the physics of Bose-
gases in one dimension, demonstrating that these gases never thermalize. In
order to explore the crossover between one-dimensional and three-dimensional
behavior, new experiments will relax the conditions that make 1D atomic gases
not thermalize, and will apply new tools to measuring the onset of
thermalization. In particular, a low energy 1D atom collider will be developed.
These experiments will address a long open theoretical question of the existence
of a threshold for chaos in a many-body quantum system, as there is in classical
mechanics. This project may clarify how irreversibility of macroscopic behavior
arises from the reversible behavior of individual atoms. In addition, 1D gas
momentum distributions will be measured for the first time, and two-dimensional
(2D) gases with variable interactions will be studied. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
broader impact of this work lies in the ability of cold-atom experiments to
provide answers to long-open questions in nonlinear dynamics and mathematical
physics. These experiments will train undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral
researchers in this technologically-important area of physics.
