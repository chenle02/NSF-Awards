This award supports a program to perform paleomagnetic and stable isotope
measurements on deep-sea sediment cores from the Northwind Ridge, Central Arctic
Ocean. This region appears to offer considerably higher sedimentation rates than
most areas of the Arctic Ocean. Consequently, it offers a higher likelihood of
success for producing a reliable magnetostratigraphic framework for
interpretation of a benthic-foraminifera based oxygen isotopic record. This
research will provide a valuable proxy climate record for a part of the Arctic
about which very little is known.
