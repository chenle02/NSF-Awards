9802558 Wu It is a common practice to use lower dimensional objects as tools for
studying manifolds. For example, a manifold containing some embedded essential
surfaces, but no essential spheres, is called a Haken manifold. The geometric
structure of Haken manifolds is well understood, but unfortunately many
manifolds are not Haken. One is thus forced to consider other lower dimensional
objects in studying them, such as laminations and immersed surfaces. The
objective of this project is to understand the role of immersed essential
surfaces in 3-manifolds, particularly the issue of whether such surfaces will
lift to embedded surfaces in a finite covering. This would be an important step
toward a clear understanding of the topological and geometric structure of
3-manifolds. Manifolds appear naturally in physics and other sciences, since a
manifold is an object for which each point is surrounded by a small neighborhood
the same as one in the solid ball in a Euclidean space. If the Euclidean space
in question is of dimension three, we call such a manifold a 3-manifold. This
being the dimension in which we live, it is not surprising that 3-manifolds have
attracted a great deal of attention in mathematics and physics. What is perhaps
more surprising is the extent to which 3-manifolds have shown themselves
resistant to analysis, generally more so than manifolds of dimensions above
five, where our 3-dimensional intuitions flounder but other tools come to the
rescue. Most of these tools are not available in dimension three, and that is
what is at issue here, finding alternatives that do work in the critical
dimension three. ***
