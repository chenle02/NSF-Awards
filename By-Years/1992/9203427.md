The transistor that makes the modern computer memory possible works as an
electronic switch. When there are no electrons on the transistor no current can
flow and the transistor is turned off. When the voltage on a gate electrode is
increased, electrons are added to the transistor and it turns on. In a
collaboration between MIT and IBM it was recently discovered that very small
transistors behave in a very unusual way. In contrast to conventional
transistors which have only two possible states, either on or off, a very small
transistor turns on and off again every time one electron is added to it by the
gate. The single-electron behavior has so far been observed only at very low
temperatures. In order to make devices that are potentially useful for
electronic applications, a much higher temperature must be reached. The
operating temperature is determined by the energy necessary to transfer an
electron from one of its leads onto the transistor. The work proposed will
isolate the parameters that determine this energy scale, making possible single-
electron devices operating at practical temperatures. Experiments to test the
ultimate speed of single-electron transistors are also planned.
