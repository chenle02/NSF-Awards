9353908 Caverly The workshop focuses on introducing undergraduate electrical
engineering faculty to analog VLSI design principles as a natural outgrowth of
the digital VLSI design process. These faculty are prepared to bring these
design principles back to their universities for introduction to undergraduate
electrical engineering students. The week-long workshop is a unique mix of
analog design concepts, circuit simulation and laboratory measurements on
typical CMOS analog circuits. User groups will be formed with the participants
as a means to share information and provide leadership in bringing analog VLSI
design concepts to an undergraduate audience. ***
