This award provides one-half the funding for the acquisition of a computing
system for the International Seismological Center (ISC). The ISC has committed
the remaining half of the funds required. The International Seismological Center
is the organization charged with the task of assembling final seismological
observations, deriving definitive hypocentral solutions and magnitudes of
earthquakes on a world-wide basis. The hypocenters and observations are archived
on magnetic tape. The new computer system will be used to store readings,
compute focal parameters and to prepare files of data on magnetic tape and in
printed form for external users, including over 80 institutions in the U.S. The
data are used as the basis for studies of earthquake mechanisms, earth structure
and global seismicity.
