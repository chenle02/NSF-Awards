Soft materials are often viscoelastic, displaying characteristics of both a
fluid and a solid. Often one behavior dominates, and the material is dominantly
either a fluid or a solid; however, this can depend sensitively on the
measurement. For example, a glassy material can be solid at frequencies
typically measured, but fluid at very low or very high frequencies. Thus, the
transition between fluid-like and solid-like behavior can be quite subtle, yet
it can provide great insight into the behavior can be quite subtle, yet it can
provide great insight into the behavior of the material. This transition between
fluid-like and solid-like behavior is the overarching theme of the work proposed
here. Experiments proposed include investigation of colloidal crystals, glasses
and gels with confocal microscopy to look at individual particles, scattering to
measure average effects, and rheology to measure bulk effects. A shear cell will
be built for a confocal microscope to probe the motion of particles when
subjected to shear, and laser tweezers will be used to probe local perturbations
of structure. These experiments will provide insight into important fluid to
solid transitions in soft materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many materials that
are important in nature and in technology have a dual character they have both
solid-like and fluid-like when squeezed from the tube or smeared on teeth, but
maintains its shape and form like a solid when spread on a toothbrush. This
research will investigate the nature of a wide class of materials that have this
dual character, and will focus on the transformation from the fluid-like
behavior to the solid-like behavior. The work will search for general features
that can describe this behavior in wide classes of materials, and will
investigate the structural properties of the materials that cause this behavior.
The research will be highly leveraged through interactions with industry,
ensuring that problems of practical and technological importance and addressed,
in addition to problems of fundamental importance. In addition, the research
will be coupled with educational efforts, through seminar and workshop series
that enhance the researcher community for scientists in the local area, through
projects that will engage undergraduate students and high school teachers for
summer research, and through the design of a new course to explore creativity in
scientific research.&lt;br/&gt;
