9322506 Gladstone The proposed work involves investigating the chemical response
of the upper atmosphere and ionosphere of Jupiter in the aftermath of the impact
of the comet Shoemaker-Levy 9. Specifically, after characterizing the chemistry
of the comet prior to the collision, a time-dependent study will be conducted as
to the effect on the abundances of observable hydrocarbons of an injection of
cometary material into the jovian upper atmosphere. Investigators will also
study the effect of injecting into the upper atmosphere substantial amounts of
usually tropospheric species, such as ammonia, that might be entrained in a deep
impact fireball. Finally, the changes in ionospheric composition in response to
the event will be separately examined. ***
