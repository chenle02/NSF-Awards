An intensive laboratory course is being created for chemistry and biology majors
to learn techniques in cellular and molecular biology. Three projects of five
weeks duration are being developed, the first in population genetics, second in
molecular genetics, and third in protein purification, characterization, and
cellular location. This course will develop the skills and self-confidence
necessary for effective participation in senior research projects and
internships. The major instruments purchased for this project include a
fluorescence microscope, a refrigerated high-speed preparative centrifuge and
assorted rotors, two UV/visible spectrophotometers with capability for data
analysis, and four electrophoresis systems. The college will provide 50%
matching funds.
