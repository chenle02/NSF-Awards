To characterize and understand fully the microscopic magnetic properties of the
CuO2 materials as a function of hole density in the hope of thereby arriving at
a detailed understanding of high- temperature superconductivity. Secondly, high-
resolution, magnetic x-ray-scattering studies of diluted magnets in an external
field.
