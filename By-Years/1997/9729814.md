Accurate Control of Underwater Manipulators Using Inertial Sensors This research
instrumentation grant contributes to the purchase of two MotionPak inertial
sensors, two digital gyro compasses, and one water speed sensor, which will
enable the following projects:- Coordination of an Underwater Vehicle and an
Onboard Manipulator, and - Traction Control of an Autonomous Ground Vehicle on
Rough Terrains. The objective of the proposed research projects is to
investigate control and coordination of an underwater vehicle-manipulator
system. An inertial sensor, water speed sensor, and digital compass are
integrated to provide accurate estimates of vehicle motions. A novel nonlinear
feedback control algorithm is developed to compensate for vehicle-manipulator
dynamic interactions. Because of the uncertain nature of undersea environments
and lack of hydrodynamic modeling data, it is crucial to validate theoretical
algorithms by physical experiments. The proposed instrumentation makes it
possible to conduct physical experiments using the proposed half-dry half-wet
approach. The experiments not only validate the control algorithm proposed in
this research, but also establish an entirely new, cost-effective underwater
experimentation procedure. The integrated sensor system (replacing the water
speed sensor by wheel encoders) is also applied to an all-terrain land vehicle
for wheel slip estimation and for improved traction control.
