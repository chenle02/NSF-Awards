In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division,
Prof. Marjatta Lyyra of Temple University will investigate the long range
interactions, at separations in excess of 10 Angstroms, between pairs of alkali
atoms in order to map out the potential surface near the dissociation limit of
alkali diatomic molecules. The sodium molecule is the principal species to be
investigated. The molecules are prepared in their long range states by multiple
laser excitation. A new multiple resonance technique, stimulated radiative
dissociation, will be used to study photodissociation dynamics state selectively
as function of molecular rotation and and energy in order to achieve full
understanding of long range nonadiabatic mixing of states. The correlation of
the initial internuclear distance prepared as dissociation begins with the
strengths of the nonadiabatic couplings will also be studied. As part of this
work new methods will be developed to enhance the detection of continuous wave
multiple resonance signals. This research contributes to the understanding of
behavior of atoms at large internuclear separations at the onset of chemical
reactions. At large internuclear separations many electronic energy states are
often closely spaced, making for couplings betwen them which affect the bond-
breaking photodissociation, and bond-forming associative ionization processes.
The information gathered in this work will be of assistance in understanding the
results of contemporary research on atomic collisions at ultra low temperatures.
