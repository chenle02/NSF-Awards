9561410 Dai This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project concerns the
chemical modification of hard carbon coatings through reaction with radical
species in order to improve their tribological performance. These modifications
can also lead to the realization of wear resistant solid lubricant coatings. Two
complementary approaches will be examined in parallel, fluorination and
nitridation. Fluorination of hard carbon surfaces can reduce their friction,
while reaction of hard carbon with active nitrogen species may produce nitrogen-
containing carbon films with excellent thermal stability and hardness. This
Phase I project will investigate pathways to improving the tribological
properties (friction, striction and wear) of hard carbon coatings through
chemical modifications of the surface region. The goal is to define the
mechanisms of fluorination and nitridation using novel sources and to establish
quantitatively the relationship between the surface chemical composition,
surface morphology and the tribological properties. X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy will be
used in conjunction with Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) to characterize the
modified films' chemical composition, surface structure, morphology and their
tribological performances (friction, striction). In addition, a wear rester will
be used to characterize the wear resistance of the modified films. This project
is designed for the development of solid lubricant coatings in the areas of
precision tooling, magnetic recording, space technology, etc. A major market
that would be affected would be magnetic disk media. As recording density
increases, the distance (fly height) between the read/write head and the disk
has to be decreased; full contact operation is under consideration. As a result,
the tribological properties of the hard carbon overcoats directly affect the
dualibility of the disk and the read/write head.
