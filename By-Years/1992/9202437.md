This collaborative award is made in the Special Projects Office of the Chemistry
Division and the Chemical and Thermal Systems Division under the Materials
Synthesis and Processing Initiative. The research will be directed towards
developing a CVD silicon nitride film process which will proceed at temperatures
as low as 450 C, i.e temperatures where aluminum connections are not adversely
affected. Kinetics of the elementary reactions, e.g. silylene intermediates with
ammonia, leading to gas phase Si-N bond formation under CVD conditions will be
studied. The catalytic effect of free radical precursors on the formation of
silicon nitride films from diethylsilane and ammonia will also be explored. %%%
The development of a low temperature process for depositing clean silicon
nitride films will permit the capping of microelectronic devices using aluminum
interconnects. Currently used low temperature plasma enhanced CVD processes
produce poor quality films.
