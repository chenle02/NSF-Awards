This project supports participation of students and early career researchers in
a short course "Microstructural Analysis and EBSD Applications in Earth
Sciences" to be held at San Francisco State University. The short course will
provide a brief introduction to a unique mathematical approach to analyze
integral X-ray, neutron or synchrotron diffraction pole intensity data as well
as individual orientation data from electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), Ice
Fabric Analyzer or optical universal stage, and hands-on exercises with
Windows/Mac/Linux systems applying the free and open MATLAB toolbox MTEX for
texture analysis. In particular, estimation of an orientation distribution
function and its properties as harmonic coefficients, volume portions, texture
index, entropy, calculation of anisotropic properties, for example,. from the
different kinds of data and grain reconstruction from EBSD data will be
included. An MTEX workshop has never been offered in the U.S. Workshop
participants will leave the workshop with some preliminary results from
practical sessions under expert instruction and will be able to immediately
start using MTEX.

Quantitative microstructural analysis is an increasingly important aspect of
many fields in the earth sciences including structural geology, experimental
rock deformation, and seismology, for example. The wider availability of EBSD,
in particular, presents researchers with much larger and more complex data to
analyze. Training the next generation in the software tools necessary for such
analysis is critical.
