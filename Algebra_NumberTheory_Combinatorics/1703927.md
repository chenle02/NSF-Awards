The 15th International Conference on Permutation Patterns will be held at
Reykjavik University in Iceland, from June 26 to June 30, 2017. The conference
will provide a high quality program of speakers in the area of permutation
patterns with opportunities for collaboration between junior and senior
researchers, as well as between participants from around the world. The
conference will feature two plenary one-hour speakers and a number of
contributed talks, each of thirty minutes long. Researchers will present their
new results and there will be time for open discussions to explore unsolved
problems in the field. This award supports travel to the conference by students
and early career mathematicians from the United States. This conference is part
of a series of annual conferences devoted to the area of permutation patterns.
Ever since the first conference in 2003, which was hosted by the University of
Otago in New Zealand, it has been held every year at different institutions
around the world: in North America, Europe, Asia and Australasia. About 70
participants are anticipated, with about 35-40 contributed talks with no
parallel sessions. The conference has been publicized through distribution
lists, AMS and other mathematical event calendars, and related conference
websites (the conference website is at https://pp2017.github.io/).

The conference will feature current research in the area of permutation patterns
and its applications. Major themes in the conference include the structural
theory of pattern classes, asymptotic behavior of pattern classes, generalized
pattern avoidance, packing densities, and algorithmic and decidability problems.
Research in the area is influenced by theoretical computer science, and traces
its historical origins to the study of sorting machines. Combinatorial interest
in permutation patterns focuses on centrally important enumeration and packing
problems, for instance the extremal problem to determine how one pattern can be
embedded as often as possible in a permutation. The statistics of permutations
also enters into the picture, garnering attention from probabilists. The
conference is expected to have a wide impact on a variety of different research
areas in mathematics and computer science.
