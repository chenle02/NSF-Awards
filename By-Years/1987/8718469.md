This grant from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program supports
development of new methods for obtaining approximate solutions to the
mathematical equations governing molecular electronic structure and the
application of such techniques to a variety of important prototype chemical
problems. Method development will focus on analytic calculation of derivatives
for correlated wavefunctions, allowing for more complete characterization of
potential energy surfaces. Applications will include studies of the structure
and dynamics of conformers of 1,3 butadiene, the equilibrium geometry of the
ammonia dimer, and reaction pathways for the formation of diketene and two
closely related isomers. These studies will improve our qualitative
understanding of how chemical reactions occur.
