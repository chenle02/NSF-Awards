The process and consequences of natural selection in wild plant species will be
pursued in three specific and complementary research projects. In the first, the
causes and evolutionary significance of variation in life history and
reproductive traits within and among different populations of several sympatric
wild plant species in the eastern Sierra Mountains will be investigated. Another
project will continue ongoing experimental studies of the constancy of genetic
parameter estimates (heritability and genetic correlation) in wild radish in
which growing conditions will be manipulated to evaluate the rate and direction
of evolution under diverse environmental conditions. The third project will
involve work to establish the relative importance of seed dispersal and post-
dispersal events as determinants of the species distributions of economically
important trees in a Peruvian rainforest.
