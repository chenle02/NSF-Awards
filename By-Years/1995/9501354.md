This CAREER award supports research and instruction in the empirical evaluation
of software inspection methods. Software inspection is a widely used, but very
expensive validation process. Initial research has demonstrated that many of the
assumptions underlying this process are incorrect and, therefore, this research
involves the following three families of experiments. (1) Comparing defect
detection techniques. This experiment compares the cost-effectiveness of
systematic inspection techniques with that of the standard Ad Hoc and Checklist
approaches. Its hypothesis is that systematic inspection techniques are more
effective that the nonsystematic ones currently being used. (2) Cost-benefit
studies. This experiment is conducted on a live development project to compare
the tradeoffs between minimum inspection interval and maximum effectiveness for
several different inspection approaches. Its hypothesis is that several recently
proposed methods significantly increase interval, but provide only a slight
improvement in effectiveness. (3) Inspection entry criteria. This experiment
attempts to establish whether or not an artifact's quality affects inspection
effectiveness. Its hypothesis is that traditional inspections are not effective
for artifacts with very high or very low defect density. This research is also
producing materials that enhance both graduate and undergraduate teaching. This
includes a 4-week teaching module in which students perform experiments, collect
and analyze data, and test hypotheses as part of a graduate software engineering
course. An undergraduate software development course is being developed in which
all students work together to develop one large-scale application, for real
customers with real needs.
