The research included in this proposal will investigate the low- temperature
theoretical behavior of several systems that display macroscopic quantum
properties. Laughlin has recently suggested that particles obeying half
fractional statistics would exhibit superconductivity. They will continue their
study of this model for high-Tc superconductors, focusing on the excitation
spectrum and the effect of a repulsive short-range potential, the screening of
the long-range gauge forces, and the response to an external magnetic field,
both at zero temperature and at finite temperature. The behavior of precessing
dissipative domain walls in superfluid 3He-A will be investigated with the
hydrodynamic model of orbital dynamics, with particular attention to the
stability of these dynamic textures, the response to external magnetic fields,
and the effect of dipole unlocking. The quasi- classical formalism will be used
to extend their previous studies of superfluid 3He in severly confined
geometries beyond the Ginzburg-Landau regime. They initially plan to analyze
planar boundaries, but they eventually seek to treat flow through a constriction
as a model for a weak link.
