The secretory system of eukaryotic cells transports macromolecules to the cell
surface and lytic compartments of the cell. This transport requires the physical
movement of secretory products in membrane-bounded carriers from their site of
synthesis to their site of action. In most species, these carriers are small
vesicular or tubular transport containers. Plants cells are unique among
eukaryotes in that they display rapid, actomyosin-based movements of entire
Golgi stacks. This movement raises the possibility that the plant Golgi, a major
organelle of the secretory system, also provides long-distance transport
functions, in addition to its well-established roles in synthesis, modification,
and sorting of secretory products. This project pursues two central goals. The
first is to establish the mechanistic basis underlying Golgi stack movements.
The second is to test the hypothesis that rapid Golgi stack movements are
necessary for proper functioning of the secretory system of plant cells and
indirectly play a role in growth and development. The experimental approaches
can be broken down into four parts. (1) Identification of myosin motor proteins
that localize to Golgi stacks using fusions to fluorescent proteins and isoform-
specific antibodies. (2) Isolation of myosin mutants that lack Golgi movements
created by reverse genetics, i.e. T-DNA insertion and RNA silencing. (3)
Analysis of the phenotype of mutants in Golgi myosin gene(s), particularly the
transport efficiency within the secretory system by following marker proteins.
(4) Identification of the proteins that mediate cargo attachment for Golgi
myosin by both a targeted approach, testing candidate Rab G-proteins, and a
general screen using co-immunoprecipitation or the yeast-two hybrid system.
Taken together, this project will identify the molecular basis for Golgi stack
movement in plant cells as well as test its functional relevance.
