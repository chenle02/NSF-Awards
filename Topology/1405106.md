Polyhedral surfaces are produced at an alarming rate ranging from 3-D scanning
to medical imaging in the digital world these days. Almost all surfaces appeared
in any computer screen are polyhedral surfaces. An urgent task is to produce a
coarse categorization and classification of these surfaces. A mile stone result
in mathematics dealing with surfaces is the classical uniformization theorem of
Poincare-Koebe. It is an extremely powerful tool to classify smooth surfaces in
the 3-space up to angle preserving diffeomorphisms (i.e., conformality).
However, to algorithmically implement the classical uniformization theorem is
very difficult. The PI and his collaborators introduced a discrete counterpart
of conformality and proved a discrete version of uniformization theorem for
polyhedral surfaces recently. This proposal investigates theoretically whether
the discrete conformal geometry converges to the smooth conformal geometry as
triangulation meshes become finer and finer. The numerical evidences for the
convergence are very strong. The successful resolution of the convergence issue
will have impacts on the applications of the discrete uniformization theorem in
many fields.

The classical uniformization theorem of Poincare and Koebe is the most powerful
tool to classify smooth surfaces with Riemannian metrics according to conformal
diffeomorphisms. This theorem is one of the pillars of the 20th century
mathematics and has a wide range of applications within and outside mathematics.
However, it is very difficult to use it algorithmically for categorizing
polyhedral surfaces. Luo and his collaborators introduced a notion of discrete
conformality for polyhedral surfaces and proved a discrete uniformization
theorem recently. Two main features of the discrete conformality are the
following. First, the discrete conformality is algorithmic and second, there
exists a finite dimensional (convex) variational principle to find the discrete
uniformization metric. The goal of the proposal is to investigate several major
remaining issues in the discrete conformal geometry of polyhedral surfaces. For
instance, there are strong numerical evidences suggesting that the discrete
conformality converges to smooth (classical) conformality when the
triangulations are suitably chosen. However, a theoretical proof of it is still
lacking. This is the main problem to be resolved in the proposal. Luo plans to
use the finite dimensional variational principles that he developed in the past
10 years to approach the convergence problem.
