The research planned for this 1 year grant seeks to answer three questions using
the pitcher-plant mosquito, Wyeomyia smithii. 1) How does the average growth
rate (size at adulthood + days to reach adulthood) of individuals in a
population predict fitness (rc= capacity for increase)? 2) Are growth rate and
its underpinnings of size at the time to adulthood heritable traits; are these
traits independent or interdependent (genetically correlated)? 3) Can variation
in fitness between nearby and distant populations be explained by genes acting
independently (additively) or is interaction within genes (dominance) and/or
between genes (epistasis) an important component of genetic differentiation of
populations? The ability of mosquito populations to transmit disease (their
vectorial capacity) depends upon their adult size and longevity, traits which
should be predictable from growth rate and its components. Answers to the first
two questions will then have application for mosquito control. If, as they
suspect, gene interactions are important in population differentiation, isolated
populations may be harboring greater genetic variation than is presently
appreciated. Answers to the third question will then bear on the recovery of
rare or endangered species that persist only as fragmented populations.
