This project will investigate the causes for low frequency variability of North
Atlantic sea-surface temperature in the latter half of the 20th century by
employing a novel global climate modeling approach. The research will set up and
test a framework that makes the diagnosis of observed variability possible for
the first time in a coupled global climate modeling context. The model is to be
forced by "observed weather noise" surface fluxes which are derived by removing
an estimate of the forced atmospheric response from the total surface fluxes, as
represented by the reanalysis produced by the National Centers for Environmental
Prediction and the National Center for Atmospheric Research. The coupled model
will utilize the interactive ensemble configuration to filter out the "weather
noise" from the fluxes generated by the atmosphere and forcing the ocean, while
fully simulating the coupled atmosphere-ocean
feedbacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts:&lt;br/&gt;While the focus of
this work is confined to the region of the North Atlantic, the technique could
be allied to other regions and used to address a range of science questions. The
project will also educate future climate scientists in the use of coupled
general circulation models for studying climate.
