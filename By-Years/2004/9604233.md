IBN-9604233 Curras The task of the nervous system is to receive, send, process,
store, and retrieve information. Communication between neurons are accomplished
through electrical and chemical signals. Glutamate is a neurotransmitter which
serves as a chemical messenger in transmitting excitatory information between
neuronal connections known as synapses. It is released into synaptic space,
diffuses across the narrow gap, and binds to specific protein receptors. NMDA
(N- methyl-D-aspartate) is a class of glutamate receptor that is involved in
fundamental processes like development of the brain and learning and memory as
well as brain disorders such as epilepsy and excitotoxic neurodegeneration.
Recently, molecular cloning studies have identified five subunits which can be
used to form NMDA receptors. Dr.Curras is using state-of-the-art
electrophysiological, molecular-pharmacological, and anatomical technology to
first identify the subunit composition in individual neurons and then to
delinate each subunit's contribution to the NMDA receptor function and NMDA-
mediated processes. She will examine the NMDA receptor properties in
magnocellular neurosecretory neurons located in the supraoptic nucleus of the
hypothamus. This brain region produces and releases vasopressin, an antidiuretic
hormone essential for body water regulation. Dr. Curras will determine the
changes in subunit expression of these neurons under various physiological
conditions. These results will provide novel information on how specific NMDA
receptor phenotypes contribute to the plasticity displayed by these neurons in
order to adapt to different physiological processes. It will not only lead to a
better general understanding of how neurons communicate but will help define the
relation between NMDA receptors, neuroendocrine function and regulation, and
water balance.
