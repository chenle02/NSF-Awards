0106677 Yin & Horton Current hypotheses concerning the formation of the Tibetan
plateau are widely different in terms of their predicted strain distribution and
temporal evolution of the plateau. If the uplift involved little upper crustal
shortening and was passively uplifted, shortening strain should be small and
synchronous. If the uplift was due to large shortening that doubled the upper
crustal thickening, strain should be significant and diachronous across the
plateau. This project will attempt to evaluate upper crustal deformation and
therefore test these two models for the evolution of the Tibetan plateau.
Results are expected to provide new constraints on how and when the Tibetan
plateau was constructed and allow various mechanisms for uplifting the plateau
to be quantified.
