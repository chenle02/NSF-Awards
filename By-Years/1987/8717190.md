This investigation will prepare superconducting Y-Ba-Cu-O films by spray
pyrolysis processing (SPP) of organometallic solutions. Characterization of the
microstructure, phase stability and evaluation of superconducting behavior as
function of SPP variables will be major research objectives. SPP parameters
including droplet atomization, spray dynamics, spraying chamber atmosphere, and
nozzle to substrate distance will be optimized to determine conditions for
producing films with the best superconducting behavior.
