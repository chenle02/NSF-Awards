Empirical questions in economics are studied via econometric models. These
models contain unknown parameters, which are typically the object of interest in
empirical applications. For instance, one might be interested in learning about
the average propensity to consume, or the marginal effect of a tax increase on
labor supply, and researchers use data and econometrics analysis to estimate
that parameter. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clearly, one would like to use methods of
data analysis that allow one to learn as much as possible about these unknown
parameters. And for a large set of models, it is well understood how to do so,
at least approximately. With many observations from a well-behaved model, the
problem of not knowing the parameter is effectively equivalent to the "standard
problem" of observing a single Gaussian (bell-shaped) observation with known
spread and a mean that corresponds to the unknown parameter. For a non-
negligible subset of models, however, there is only an approximate equivalence
to a different, "non-standard" problem. These unknown correlation patterns make
it impossible to perfectly learn about the spread of the parameter estimator,
which leads to a non-standard approximately equivalent problem where the spread
of the single Gaussian vector observation is unknown. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
proposal studies such non-standard problems, and seeks to develop ways of
learning about the unknown parameters. The derivation of nearly efficient
methods involves the development of appropriate analytical results, such
accurate upper bounds on the potential quality of inference in non-standard
problems, as well as numerical methods that determine a nearly efficient
procedure, that is one with an inference quality close to the upper bound.
