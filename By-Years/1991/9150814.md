A unique modular materials education package is being developed which will be
used by chemical engineering faculty and other instructors to teach junior and
senior undergraduate students materials science, processing and engineering as
it pertains to chemical engineering. Each module of this package includes a
background information section, main references, solved problems, class
demonstrations and larger experiments that can be performed in a classic
undergraduate laboratory course. This educational package is being developed in
response to the need of most Departments of Chemical Engineering to develop
modern materials-oriented laboratory experiments and to integrate materials
processing in their curriculum. The subjects covered include a wide range of
materials, from polymers and ceramics to microelectronics and information
storage materials. In addition, symposia will be organized at AIChE and ASEE
meetings to disseminate the results on materials and the approach to curriculum
development to other departments and faculty.
