A major unresolved issue in the study of noncooperative games is the appropriate
refinement of the Nash equilibrium concept. A "refinement" is a theory with
equilibrium outcomes that are a proper subset of the set of Nash outcomes. A
sequence of successively stronger refinements has been proposed, many of which
are motivated by specific examples of simple games in which the weaker
refinement permitted equilibria which were thought not to be sensible. In this
literature, discussions about what behavior is sensible are typically based on
the author's subjective opinion about how "rational" individuals would play the
game. Even though game theory is sometimes said to be a normative theory about
how rational agents ought to behave, the theory is widely applied in industrial
organization and other areas of economics to analyze specific issues, so the
positive (empirical) content of game theory is also relevant. In addition the
discussions of intuitive and unintuitive equilibria are often in the context of
examples that are inspired by market applications. The contribution of this
project comes from using carefully designed laboratory experiments to test
competing refinements. In these experiments financial rewards are used to induce
players' preferences in a manner such that competing theories give distinct
predictions. The results of the experiments will provide badly needed empirical
evidence on which of these refinements repeatedly fail to predict the results of
controlled laboratory experiments.
