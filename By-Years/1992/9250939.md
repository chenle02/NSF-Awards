This project will make possible interactive, process-oriented laboratory
instruction. Experiments will emphasize observation, measurement, organization
and analysis of data, and hypothesis formulation and testing. Students will
employ electrophoretic equipment to investigate topics in biotechnology, and
spectrophotometry to study enzyme kinetics and microbial population growth.
Students will use computer- based, pre-laboratory simulations to prepare for
actual lab work, and post-laboratory simulations to reinforce lecture and
laboratory activities. The new laboratory environment will foster scientific
inquiry and will aid students in their development of critical thinking skills.
