This workshop addresses current important scientific issues related to
materials science, surface physics, and chemistry. It will be held in
Washington, D.C. from April 18 to April 21, and is organized in the style of a
Gordon Research Conference. It is designed to cover a wide range of surface
microscopies: Transmission Electron Microscopy; Reflection Electron Microscopy;
Low Energy Electron Microscopy; Low Energy Transmission Microscopy; Scanning
Transission Electron Microscopy; Magnetic Imaging Microscopy; Scanning
Reflection Electron Microscopy; X-ray Apsorption Microscopy; Photoelectron
Electron Microscopy; Field Ion Microscopy; Scanning Tunneling Microscopy; and
Reflection High Energy Electron Diffraction. In addition to providing a review
of current techniques, the workshop will address the directions that these
techniques will be headed in the future in terms of the scientific data that
they can provide. A report will be prepared for publication in the open
literature.
