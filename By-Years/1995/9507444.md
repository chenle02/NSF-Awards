9507444 Rouch On a long-term basis, the most important organ in the body for
controlling blood pressure is the kidney. Although many people believe that only
the heart is important for regulating blood pressure, it is the function of the
kidney which assures that the body maintains the correct amount of blood for the
heart to pump. The kidney also functions to maintain an adequate supply of total
body fluid so that all bodily organs including the brain, stomach, liver,
intestines, muscles, etc., are surrounded by the proper amount of water,
electrolytes, and nutrients to function properly. For the kidney to adequately
perform these critically important responsibilities, nerves send signals to the
kidney and these signals, in effect, tell the kidney what to do with respect to
water, electrolytes, and other substances. The physiological mechanism of nerve
action on the kidney is not well-understood, and innovative research is required
to uncover the mysteries of the interaction between nerves and kidneys. The
proposed research project is designed to study this important interaction by
measuring various properties related to salt and water transport in the rat
kidney in response to nerve action. The rat kidney has been studied quite
extensively in the past and thus, provides an excellent experimental model for
the proposed research study. Specifically, this project will be an investigation
of how nerve receptors in the kidney function to control the renal handling of
salt and water which is very important in the maintenance of normal blood
pressure. The information gained from this study will add significantly to body
of knowledge involved with the how the kidney controls blood pressure and what
role the nerves play in this very important function. ***
