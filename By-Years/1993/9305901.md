For 20 years, studies of microwear patterns on teeth of humans and other
primates has promised to reveal new ways of discerning dietary habits of those
animals and also fossil ancestors, since dental microwear patterns are
recoverable. However, because of the complexities that researchers uncovered,
this early promise has gone largely unfulfilled. This project will be the first
to study microwear patterns on teeth and relate those patterns to observed
patterns of eating by the particular animals concerned. The physical traits (eg
hardness) of the foods consumed will be established and related to these and
other findings. This study will be of importance to physical anthropology,
animal behavior, and dentistry.
