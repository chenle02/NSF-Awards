This project tackles an emerging and inevitable problem within computing: how to
explicitly manage computers that use different types of memory technologies. The
project's novelties are new programming language mechanisms for managing these
machines, with associated improvements in performance. The project's impacts are
the simpler and more efficient management of these machines from the
programmer's perspective. The inevitability of these mixed memory machines,
along with their deployment as a common computing platform in the data center,
means that their efficient use is matter of national import, with varied
applications in academia, industry, and defense (e.g. genetic sequencing,
weather prediction, economic model simulation, and counterterrorism monitoring).
By innovating programmatic and educational tools for these machines, this
project serves to enhance the architecture's utility and performance across
numerous economic and national security applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project's aims tackle the problem of programming heterogeneous memory machines
from specific angles, namely, the language level interface and associated
compiler and runtime techniques. The project will proceed by (1) developing a
flexible type system that can express data stored across the heterogeneous
memory machine, (2) develop compiler optimizations customized to the problems of
heterogeneous memories and their associated semantics, and (3) integrate runtime
techniques for mitigating performance problems of heterogeneous memory
machines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
