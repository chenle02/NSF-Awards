Gel electrophoresis has been used to fractionate macromolecules for studies in
all fields of biochemistry. However, the sieving of gels during electrophoresis
is not understood physically. Sieving can be used to determine the size of
spheres and, in some cases, the molecular weight of random coils. Drs. Serwer
and Griess propose to: (a) obtain and use data for the testing of previously
proposed hypotheses that quantitatively describe the sieving of gels and (b)
determine the effect of a particles's shape on its sieving during gel
electrophoresis. These objectives are components of a research program for
understanding the assembly and purposeful motion of macromolecules, using
bacteriophages as model systems. It is anticipated that achieving these
objectives will also serve as a foundation for utilization of gel
electrophoresis in several areas of biochemistry, microbiology, colloid
chemistry and cellular biology.
