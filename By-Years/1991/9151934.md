This project provides for the implementation of a microprocessor-based materials
testing apparatus in the Structural and Materials Testing laboratory.
Installation of modern microprocessor-based materials testing equipment
significantly enriches the engineering laboratory course, and allows support of
a much broader range of senior thesis projects related to the use of composite
materials in the marine industry.
