A program of experimental investigations is carried out on ion-atom collisions
in which the projectile (ion) is left with two of its electrons moving with near
zero velocity in the projectile frame of reference, barely bound to the ion.
These studies will provide information about various aspects of the three-body
Coulomb problem, an area of current active interest.
