With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, Professor
Rongson Pongdee from University of the South and colleagues Robert Bachman, Deon
Miles and John Shibata will acquire a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. The award will
enhance research training and education at all levels, especially in areas such
as (a) glycodiversification of angucycline antibiotics, (b) study of condensed
phase platinum(II) complexes containing bipyridine ligands modified with Guerbet
alcohols, (c) surface characterization of water-soluble, monolayer-protected
quantum dots, and (d) studies of motion dynamics of
peptides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is
one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the
structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to
characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the
dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-
art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier
research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic
organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This
instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research.
