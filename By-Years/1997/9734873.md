ABSTRACT Support for International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis This
three year grant to the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis
(IIASA), a multilateral research institute located near Vienna, Austria, will
provide partial, continuing support for a policy-relevant research program
related to environmentally sustainable economic development. Within this
context, research will focus on three themes: (1) global environmental change,
(2) global economic and technological transitions, and (3) systems methods for
the analysis of global issues. Particular emphasis will be placed on the topics
of transboundary air pollution, land-use change and land-cover change, links
between greenhouse gas emission and other environmental factors, population-
environment interactions, the dynamics of technological change, and impediments
to growth in the transition economies of Central and Eastern Europe. Research
will result in publications in peer-reviewed journals, international conferences
and workshops and, where appropriate, will provide a scientific basis for
international policy making on the issues associated with global change,
economic transitions, and sustainable development. The United States is one of
17 countries that provide support for IIASA through their national member
organizations. Other national members include organizations in Japan, Russia,
and several other European countries.
