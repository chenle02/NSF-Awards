The University of Miami, Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences
will operate two research vessels: R/V ISELIN, a 170' general oceanographic
vessel constructed with NSF funds in 1971; and R/V CALANUS, a 63' research
vessel constructed by the NSF in 1970. The ISELIN is capable of ocean-going
operations and operates primarily in the North Atlantic and South Atlantic. The
CALANUS is intended for near-shore coastal oceanography in shallow waters. These
vessels are part of a fleet used by the National Science Foundation to support
oceanographic research projects. Most oceanographic research projects require
highly specialized equipment and extensive support from a ship's crew members.
An increasing number of research projects require equipment that must be
permanently installed on a ship and for which the ship must be specifically
designed. Such equipment also requires highly trained crew members for
maintenance and operation. These vessels do not operate in the same manner as
general cargo or fishing vessels, and therefore, NSF supports the operation of a
variety of vessels specifically dedicated to oceanographic research. These
vessels are operated by universities and research institutions around the
country.
