The workshop will be held in conjunction with the International Conference on
Neuromorphic Systems (ICONS) 2022. Neuromorphic information processing seeks to
develop artificial neural systems, whose design principles are based on
biological nervous systems. Advantages of this paradigm including low-energy
fault-tolerant computing and life-long learning make this technology logical
candidate for the next generation of AI systems at the edge.&lt;br/&gt;The
present project is a half-day research workshop on large scale neuromorphic
computing infrastructure. This workshop will bring together globally recognized
leaders in neuromorphic computing and its application domains as well as
nationally recognized HPC leaders to initiate discussions on the opportunities
and challenges in developing large scale neuromorphic computing systems and
merging them into heterogeneous cyberinfrastructure. The proposed workshop is
intended to establish a continuous dialog between experts in academia, industry,
application sectors, and national research labs, to shape the direction and
accelerate neuromorphic research activities towards addressing the future
cyberinfrastructure needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
