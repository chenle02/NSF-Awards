With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at the University of North Carolina in Charlotte will
acquire a 400 MHz NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will enable researchers to
carry out research on a) organometallic reactions; b) polymer materials
research; c) polymer supported chiral catalysts for asymmetric synthesis and
electrochemically-promoted catalytic asymmetric hydrogenation; d) fluorinated
poly(mercaptoimidazolyl)borates; e) characterization of substrate analogues and
reaction with glycosylasparaginase; f) studies of toxic metal ion complexes in
aqueous environments; and g) the development of novel sol-gels and silicon
containing species.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools
available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is
used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential
to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR
studies will have an impact in synthetic organic chemistry, polymer chemistry
and environmental chemistry.
