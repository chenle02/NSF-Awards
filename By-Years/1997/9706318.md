9706318 Freymueller This research will address two important problems in the
active tectonics of Alaska, the slip rate on the Denali fault, and the
relationship between the Denali fault and zones of active seismicity to the
north. Past measurements of the slip rate on the Denali fault are in conflict.
Line length measurements from 1975-1988 showed barely significant right lateral
shear strain in two networks crossing the Denali fault, yet geologic estimates
of the Holocene slip rate on the Denali fault are 8-12 mm/yr. Seismicity North
of the Denali fault is concentrated in NE trending zones, with left-lateral slip
on steeply dipping NE to NNE striking planes. These left-lateral, strike-slip
faults have been interpreted as secondary faults bounding elongated crustal
blocks in a broad shear zone between the Denali and Tintina (right-lateral)
strike-slip faults. The PIs will measure the slip rate on the Denali fault and
place some initial constraints on the strain rate across the active seismic
zones to the north of it, using data from GPS (Global Positioning System)
surveys and permanent GPS sites. They will also survey an extensive network
across the active seismic zones that can be re-occupied in the future to more
fully characterize the active deformation. ***
