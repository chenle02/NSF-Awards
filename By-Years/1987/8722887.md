This award will enable collaborative research between Dr. Manuel Lerman of the
University of Connecticut and Dr. Rodney Downey of the Victoria University of
Wellington, New Zealand. Their research in mathematical logic will focus on the
area of recursion theory. They will use the technique of priority argument to
study the structural properties of algebraic systems which are defined in terms
of the notion of oracle computability. The aim of the project is to gain a
better understanding of how information coded by a set is reflected in and can
be recovered from algebraic structures. Drs. Lerman and Downey and their
associates have a history of productive collaboration. Research in the area of
recursion theory will be further enhanced through the "face-to-face" interaction
provided under this project.
