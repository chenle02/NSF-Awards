The process of accretion of tectonic terranes to the western margin of the
North American plate during the Early Mesozoic will be studied through
structural and thermochronological analysis of two terrane boundaries: the
Yukon-Tanana and the Slide Mountain terranes in Alaska and Canada. Field work
will provide a structural map and samples for pressure-temperature-time path
analysis for these mid-crustal, terrane boundary rocks. The results will be
integrated with related studies along the strike of the orogen to provide
fundamental new understanding of plate boundary processes.
