This proposed research aims to improve understanding of functional diversity of
microbial populations and the influence of microbial diversity on carbon cycling
in soils. Linkages between microbial community structure, functional diversity
of microbes, and the relations of microbial community structure and diversity to
soil carbon cycling will be explored using (1) measurements of the stable
isotopic composition of soil organic matter fractions, (2) biomarkers specific
to different microbial functional groups, and (3) microbially respired carbon.
These approaches will also be used to evaluate microbial and carbon cycle
responses to a changing atmosphere in creosote bush (chaparral) ecosystems under
ambient and experimentally elevated CO2 at the Nevada Desert FACE (Free Air
Carbon Enrichment) Facility. The information derived from this research could be
of use in elucidating general principles of carbon-microbe interactions useful
for understanding controls on soil biogeochemical processes in a range of
ecosystem types in response to changing atmospheric CO2. The results could also
improved ecosystem- and regional-scale estimates of carbon storage under
elevated CO2.
