This SGER is an outgrowth of a proposal that was reviewed by the MG&amp;G
program last year. Reviews of the initial proposal were mixed and the proposal
was declined because of the mixed reviews. It is clear that the use of Mg/Ca and
Sr/Ca ratios in marine carbonate microfossils are emerging techniques that are
being used more and more in paleoceanography studies. It is also clear that
there can be major diferences in results on the same or similar materials
between laboratories or in some cases seven within laboratories that complicate
the interpretation of the measurements. Based on the mixed mail reviews and
limited panel comments, Program concluded that work was need to determine if
differences in laboratory procedures and methods were causing the discrepancies.
This issue needs to be resolved soon because a number of investigators are
starting to use this new proxy and data from the new laboratories are bein
generated at a rapid pace. Thus Program invited the PI to develop a modest SGER
proposal to run an inter-laboratory comparison that involved a number of workers
that existing labs are setting up labs or are setting up labw to do Mg/Ca and
Sr/Ca measurements for paleoceanography. The current SGER responds to the
Program request. The PI has included a wide range of laboratories in the text
and has arranged for a neutral investigator to evaluate the results of the
text.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
