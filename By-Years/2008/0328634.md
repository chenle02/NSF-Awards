The history, philosophy, and social studies of science too often operate in a
vaccum,&lt;br/&gt;separate from the public realms that they study. The policy-
making and decision-making&lt;br/&gt;worlds often need the perspectives these
fields offer, but may not even know how to&lt;br/&gt;discover the possible
connections. We propose a workshop to develop a network of
scholars&lt;br/&gt;who will generate a working document that identifies existing
research, opportunities, and&lt;br/&gt;challenges for these fields in the public
realm. We will also begin communication with&lt;br/&gt;the policy analysts and
develop a plan for extending these discpiplinary efforts into
the&lt;br/&gt;wider disciplinary and public realms.
