It is proposed to develop ultraviolet laser induced conductivity into a viable
technology for the semiconductor industry, and to investigate the mechanisms for
these large conductivity increases in organic materials. An investigation of the
crucial laser and materials parameters necessary to optimize laser induced
conductivity in polymers will be undertaken. Initially, a hierarchy of simply
devices such as resistors and vias will be fabricated by direct laser
irradiation of polymers. Later, integrated structures such as ROM's are of
interest. A technique has been developed to produce sub 100 nm lines in
polyamide by direct laser patterning. It is proposed to investigate the
electrical properties of such structures.
