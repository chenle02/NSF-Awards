Many applications running on smart devices generate or request sporadic data
packets. Future wireless communication systems are required to accommodate such
devices and also provide connectivity for emerging networks such as the Internet
of Things. For such sporadic data, orthogonal resource allocation or request-
approval based multiple access schemes are inefficient. There is need for
designing a new type of grant-free multiple access mechanism that allow a large
number of devices to share the communication medium for the delivery of
infrequent and small-sized packet data. Desirable features include the ability
to accommodate a large number of users, high bandwidth efficiency, high
reliability, low latency, and high energy efficiency. It is also desirable that
the transmissions can be asynchronous, be robust to multipath propagation and
Doppler frequency shift, and require low processing complexity at the
receivers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this need in mind, the objective of the
project is to design novel signaling schemes for such uplink multiple access
transmissions and efficient and reliable detection algorithms. The project will
design non-orthogonal multiple access schemes including linear precoding based
multiple access and coded multiple access that eliminate the need of signaling
and scheduling overhead. Low-complexity detection algorithms will be developed
that incorporate features of the wireless communications including channel
fading and error control coding. The performance of the designed schemes and
receiver algorithms will be evaluated using theoretical analysis and
simulations. The resulted novel multiple access schemes and detection algorithms
can improve the efficiency and throughput of future wireless networks and will
be useful for applications such as Internet of Thing and metropolitan area
networks.
