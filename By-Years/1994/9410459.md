9410459 Lobo The increased need for realism in fluid modeling in computer
graphics calls for physically-based techniques. In addition, these techniques
cannot be as resource-demanding as those on computational fluid dynamics. This
proposal concerns the development of an approach that promises real-time
performance while providing physical authenticity in modeling the 3D behaviors
of the surface of fluids. THe approach is based on solving the full 2D
incompressible, viscous, Navier-Stokes equations using a staggered marker-and-
cell, to yield the pressure and 2D velocity throughout the modeled 2D finite
difference grid. Then, the computed pressures are used to raise the surface of
fluid, thus providing the 3D effects and behaviors pf fluid flow, without the
exorbiant expense of full 3D computation. As our initial results show, this
approach is capable of achieving realistic real-time fluid simulation on a
commonly available workstation such as a Silicon Graphics Indigo. Based on our
promising intital results, research is proposed to develop this appproach
further. To make this approach more useful, we are proposing to improve its
flexibility, its stability, and its capabilities. We are also proposing to use
the approach in developing algorithms that model blending of different fluids,
fluids, that slosh in moving containers, and modeling liquid metals. ***
