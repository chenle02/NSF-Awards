A production quality radio-frequency sputter deposition system will be used
collaboratively by three separate engineering laboratories to support
experimental exploration of the properties of various thin film structures
useful in data storage and micro- electronics, and to develop specialized micro-
miniature sensors and control devices. A common theme of the proposed research
is to achieve sufficient fundamental understanding of plasma deposition
processes to develop novel thin film technologies. The understanding will be
achieved by analyzing the relationships among various deposition process
parameters and significant optical, magnetic, electrical and mechanical
properties of the sputtered films. The principal system application will be
deposition of magneto-optical Kerr effect media by sputtering thin films of rare
earth-transition metal alloys.
