Despite the common conception of nature as "red in tooth and claw," almost all
organisms, from soil bacteria to primates -including humans-, must cooperate
with others to survive and reproduce. How such cooperation persists
evolutionarily despite conflicts of interests is a central question in biology.
The problem is exacerbated when individuals face uncertainty about factors
affecting their payoffs, because this creates incentives for deception that
would undermine cooperation. This project will study how incentives for
cooperation and the related social structure evolve when individuals face
uncertainty and have private information. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI and his
colleagues will use a suite of mathematical tools originally developed in
economics, called mechanism design theory. Mechanism design studies how
appropriate incentive structures can be set up to prevent self-interested
individuals from deceiving each other and undermining the desired outcome.
However, classic applications of mechanism design theory, such as the design of
auctions and trading schemes, usually presuppose an agent (such as a government)
with the power of setting the "rules of the game". In contrast, natural
selection acts on individuals that can alter the game only in limited ways by
themselves. Hence, the evolved "rules of the game" represent the outcome of
natural selection working in a decentralized way through individuals. The aim of
this project is to understand how natural selection thus organizes interactions
between individuals to achieve mutually beneficial outcomes.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project's interdisciplinary approach will not only
further our understanding of fundamental evolutionary processes, but also help
in understanding how we in human societies can cooperate without relying on a
central authority to tackle problems such as global climate change. It will also
produce new results in social evolution theory that are sure to capture the
public's attention, and will therefore aid in furthering science education and
public understanding of science.
