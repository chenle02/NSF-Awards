The University of Wisconsin System and Spelman College will use this SGER award
for a series of planning events to develop international networks of scientists
to advance knowledge on the interactions of science and social transformation.
The expertise of social and behavioral scientist in the United States and sub-
Saharan Africa will be pooled to focus on social transformation as mediated
through human resource development. The activities will ultimately impact the
inclusion of groups now underrepresented in science and technology.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Networks of scholars in the United States, South Africa,
Ghana, and Uganda will examine links between policies on the advancement of the
sciences and their impact in institutions of higher education. Specific
institutions have been identified as partners in this research, including
universities as well as national and international organizations. Planning
meetings will be used to create faculty networks with the goal of further
communication, exchange of ideas, and development of research priorities. This
will set the stage for a second phase focusing on transforming higher education
as an instrument of social change leading to greater participation in higher
education.
