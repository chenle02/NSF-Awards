9404934 Tafti This proposal plans to construct a scalable computational fluid
dynamics computer program for use on massively parallel processing platforms.
The parallel algorithm will be designed in a structured modular manner with
emphasis on easy portability to various MPP machines. This will allow the
computer program to be used to evaluate various MPP platforms in solving large-
scale fluid flow computations. The modular and general code structure will allow
one to attack a wide variety of fluid dynamics problems as well as accommodate
supplementary equations. It will focus on understanding and predicting separated
flows in the moderate to high Reynolds number range. Accurate prediction
techniques based on Pade or compact difference schemes will be developed and
used to evaluate subgrid-scale turbulence models in a simple yet fundamental
separated flow configuration. The extraction of embedded two and three-
dimensional structures represents a major part of proposed research.
