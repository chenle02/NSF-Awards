The processes that have initiated and terminated shallow-water carbonate
platforms throughout Phanerozoic time are a focus of the Global Sedimentary
Geology Project. Exposures of an isolated Triassic platform in Guizhou Province,
PRC, provide an excellent opportunity to document its birth and death, its
internal sedimentary and diagenetic facies patterns, and the transitions into
the surrounding deeper water deposits. Other objectives of the field
stratigraphic study include documenting the transition from Permian to Triassic,
apparently conformable but with a major reduction in platform area, and applying
concepts of sequence stratigraphy and cycle analysis to understanding the
history of the platform. Fluid inclusions and conodont coloration will be used
to establish the post-Triassic thermal history of this area and to evaluate
possible trends in heating which may indicate the most favorable areas for
hydrocarbon preservation. Conodonts may help improve intercontinental
correlations, particularly at the Permo- Triassic boundary.
