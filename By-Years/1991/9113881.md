One of the most perplexing questions of game theory is how to analyze potential
deviations from an equilibrium by a coalition of players. This project will take
a "neologistic" approach to the problem, that is, to model negotiating
statements explicitly, and to study their credibility. Based on ideas of others,
the approach is so powerful that even in two player games, it forces one in some
cases to retreat from equilibrium analysis to a rationalizable mode. But in such
cases, additional "natural language" assumptions must be formulated, or else
neologisms are always impotent (unless one player is artificially silenced). The
potential applications to this research are unlimited: theoretical progress on
coalition formation is awaited by researchers in many applied fields, including
industrial organization, law and economics, finance, and international trade.
The project also promises important insight in the understanding of the roles of
communication, signalling and renegotiation in social settings.
