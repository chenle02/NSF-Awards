This project tests the hypothesis that enhanced climate sensitivity to obliquity
forcing, which is known to have begun ~3Ma, can be linked to a change in the
mean state of the tropical Pacific surface ocean and the associated change in
the oceanic heat balance. The PI will compare high-resolution planktonic and
benthic stable isotope and alkenone records from two sites, representing heat
gain (equatorial Pacific) and heat loss (North Pacific) regions. The time period
of interest spans the late Pliocene transition (3.6-1.8 Ma). The project will be
the basis for one PhD dissertation and an undergraduate honors thesis, and the
results will be incorporated into a module of the Deep Earth Academy?s ?School
of Rock?.
