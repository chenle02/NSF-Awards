The research addresses free floating planar manipulator design. In this study,
the free floating characteristic is provided by arranging for the manipulator to
float on a planar surface on a thin film of air. Preliminary investigations
indicate that the nature of design for such devices is far different from that
of corresponding fixed base manipulators. This project completes the design of a
free floating manipulator to be used as an experimental test bed. Specific
research topics include the nature of inverse solutions, the characterization
and optimization of workspace, the number of Jacobian singularities, the
existence of inertially singular configurations, and the nature of control
algorithms. Free floating manipulators are required when the end effector has to
travel over a large workspace. This work should contribute to the fields of
space and underwater robotics. This proposal was determined to be highly
meritorious, and an award is recommended.
