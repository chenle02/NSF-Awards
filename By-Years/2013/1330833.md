This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop "Low Cost
Smart Window Film" that reduces building energy consumption by dynamically
optimizing solar gain. Low cost roll to roll processing techniques will be used
to create unique electrochromic layers. The novel electrochromic layers will be
scaled-up and used to construct insulated glass windows. Systematic
characterization of the electrochromic film stability to UV and high temperature
exposure will be evaluated and their long term reliability performance will be
improved to meet the requirements. Upon successful completion of the project,
the electrochromic windows expect to achieve enhanced solar modulation at fast
switching speeds and manufactured at 2-3x lower cost than the currently
available smart windows.

The broader impact/commercial potential of this project pertains to residential
and commercial buildings represent a prime opportunity to improve energy
efficiency and sustainability worldwide. In the United States lighting and
thermal management within buildings account for 20% of yearly energy
consumption. The economic and environmental benefits of using electrochromic
windows are clear: reducing one quad of energy use would yield an average
savings of $10.6 billion, while eliminating about 21.5 gigawatts of power
produced by fossil fuels and saving nearly 59 million metric tons of CO2
emissions. It is estimated that the use electrochromic windows in building can
achieve a 50% reduction in peak energy demand and a 30% reduction in overall
energy use. Still, current electrochromic windows in the market have not reached
their market potential due to their high cost. Novel electrochromic windows are
based on an innovative material system that increases performance while reducing
production cost. Wide scale adoption of this technology will enhance market
penetration for dynamic windows.
