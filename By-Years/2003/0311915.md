The PI will develop and analyze fast and accurate spectral methods&lt;br/&gt;for
solving a large class of partial differential equations and apply&lt;br/&gt;them
to investigate several important problems of current
interest,&lt;br/&gt;including in particular the inter-facial dynamics of
multiphase complex&lt;br/&gt;flows, stability and dynamics of stratified shear
flows and&lt;br/&gt;micro-structural evolutions in advanced materials
processing. The&lt;br/&gt;proposed research will result in fast and accurate
numerical&lt;br/&gt;algorithms which will allow simulations of three-
dimensional&lt;br/&gt;time-dependent problems within a reasonable turn-over
time, and&lt;br/&gt;provide capabilities to numerically attack challenging
problems&lt;br/&gt;arising from emerging engineering and scientific
applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As computer simulations are playing an ever
increasing role in many&lt;br/&gt;branches of science and engineering and are
rapidly replacing much of&lt;br/&gt;the expensive prototyping and testing phases
in manufacturing and in&lt;br/&gt;science explorations, fast and robust
numerical methods are becoming&lt;br/&gt;an indispensable tool for many
scientists and engineers, especially&lt;br/&gt;for computational scientists in
fluid dynamics and materials science.&lt;br/&gt;It is expected that our
numerical simulations will contribute towards&lt;br/&gt;better understandings of
the complex physical and mathematical&lt;br/&gt;problems, and provide valuable
information for the designs of advanced&lt;br/&gt;materials and of a space
experiment on stratified shear flows.&lt;br/&gt;
