The planned research introduces a new formulation of the categorical Langlands
correspondence. It replaces the `naive' version of the Langlands correspondence,
which is known to specialists to be inconsistent. The principal investigator
proposes to study the new statement and verify that it passes natural
consistency checks. He then plans to verify the new formulation, starting with
some special cases. The investigator also proposes to study the compactified
Jacobians of curves with planar singularities and show that they are self-dual.
In his earlier work, the principal investigator established the autoduality in
the case of reduced irreducible curves; he plans to extend his results to curves
that may be reducible and non-reduced.

The Langlands program started as a series of conjectures proposed by Robert
Langlands beginning in 1967. From its origins in number theory and
representation theory, it developed into a framework connecting and influencing
many areas of mathematics. In particular, the geometric Langlands program is
formulated in terms of algebraic geometry, but can also be interpreted in
physical terms as a duality in quantum field theory. This project introduces new
geometric ideas into the Langlands program that should resolve some long-
standing issues.
