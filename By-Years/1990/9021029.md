This research is concerned with the growth of single crystals of high
temperature superconductors, their materials characterization, and the
measurement of fundamental transport properties. The research will be focused on
three distinct classes of high Tc oxides; namely yttrium-praseodymium barium
cuprate, neodymium- cerium cuprate, and yttrium barium copper-iron oxide. The
past three years of high Tc work has demonstrated the importance of having
quality single crystals. In this program all of the work will be done on single
crystals so that anisotropy effects can be studied studied in both the
superconducting and normal states. Methods developed by this group for
detwinning crystals permit the direct examination of the role of twin boundaries
on the superconducting properties such as, the magnetic flux motion.
