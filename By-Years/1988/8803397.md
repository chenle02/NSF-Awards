The proposed research includes a multi-stage approach to modeling the detailed
faulting processes of three blind thrust earthquakes: the 1983 Coalinga
earthquake, the 1985 Nahanni earthquake, and the 1987 Whittier Narrows
earthquake. We begin by estimating fault orientation by moment tensor inversion
of long- period, teleseismic body and surface waves. Source multiplicity,
changes in orientation in space or time, and other gross details of rupture will
be determined by forward modeling WWSSN long- period and GDSN intermediate- and
short-period, teleseismic data. Slip distribution asperity models will be
derived by simultaneous inversion of the teleseismic data along with strong-
motion data integrated to ground velocity. Finally, details of the asperity
model in terms of static slip, slip rate and rupture velocity variations will be
modeled using a semi-empirical simulation method with local acceleration data.
The models will be interpreted in terms of the rupture processes of blind
thrusts, and compared to events of other types for which detailed faulting
models are available.
