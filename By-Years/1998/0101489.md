This is a project to build upon an earlier NSF funded program Project TEACH I
that focused on pre-service education. It is a collaborative effort of the Green
River Community College, Central Washington University, and six school districts
in the Green River area. This project is expanding those efforts to include in-
service training for current and future teachers, creating a communications
center for coordinating teacher training efforts, and increasing the recruitment
of talented future teachers. Project Teach II is strengthening the existing pre-
service teacher training and recruitment programs by implementing research-
proven activities that integrate pre-service and in-service training. It also
strengthens the interplay of education and industry by providing a forum for
local businesses to participate in teacher training.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
