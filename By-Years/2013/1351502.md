An award is made to the Drosophila Species Stock Center (DSSC) at the University
of California-San Diego (UCSD) to provide the research and education communities
with 1) a repository to maintain and secure standardized genetic resources for
current and future generations of investigators and educators, 2) tools to
perform manipulative empirical studies, not possible with preserved material, to
inform practical applications, and 3) access to relatively inexpensive materials
for engaging students in the Nation's classrooms. The DSSC currently maintains a
diverse collection of over 1600 living specimens from 225 Drosophila
species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Community interest in the collection is broad and
includes both an education and research component. Virtually all fields of
biological inquiry, such as genetics, genomics, cellular and developmental
biology, physiology, neurobiology and behavior, ecology, systematics, and
evolution, benefit from the resources offered by the DSSC. The research products
generated using DSSC stocks can be classified as essential science, an important
focus of the NSF Directorate for Biological Sciences, as well as translational
science that has a direct and positive impact on the well-being of all people.
Furthermore, stock center personnel work with existing infrastructure at UCSD to
facilitate the teaching of concepts related to invasive species, biodiversity,
evolution, and ecology in K-12 classrooms. More information can be obtained on
