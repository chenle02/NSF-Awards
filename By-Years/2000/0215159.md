This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project will demonstrate
the feasibility of producing flexible displays that can be used to make radio
frequency identification (RFID) electronic labels. These labels will be
electronic analogs of paper labels. The innovation will be to combine known
flexible RFID circuitry with flexible displays to create an electronic paper-
like label that can be wirelessly updated. . The Phase I activities will involve
active matrix backplane fabrication on polyimide substrates followed by display
construction using a polymerized liquid crystal mixture.

The commercial applications include retail electronic shelf labels, airline
security luggage identification, and employee identification tags. The use of
these tags for airline security luggage tags and employee identification
represent applications that address issues in homeland security.
