This Biological Facilities Center proposal requests funds to establish a joint
facility for Regional Ecosystem Analysis. Scientists at Colorado State
University's Natural Resource Ecology Laboratory and College of Forestry and
Natural Resources and the University of Colorado's Institute for Arctic and
Alpine Research and Center for the Study of Earth from Space will participate in
this joint facility for interdisciplinary research. The facility will build on
major existing equipment in image processing and simulation modeling but will be
expanded to include new mesoscale remote sensing instrumentation, image
enhancement and analysis systems, and geographic data analysis software, all
integrated into a system that will allow scientists at both institutions to
share this powerful technology and cooperate in regional-scale research. Remote
sensing creates regional data bases, image processing and spatial data analysis
transform and manipulate these data, ecosystems modeling provides a predictive
tool for extrapolation. By combining these into a single facility, these
techniques will enable a quantum leap in research capabilities.
