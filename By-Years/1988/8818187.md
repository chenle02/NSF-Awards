In this project supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic
Chemistry Program, Louis H. Pignolet of the University of Minnesota will
investigate the synthesis, reactivity and characterization of mixed transition
metal-gold and silver cluster compounds. Bimetallic alloys of these metals are
known to be important commercial catalysts. The reactions of discrete cluster
compounds may be useful as models for alloy surfaces and therefore in
understanding the fundamental reaction mechanisms at the catalytic metal
surfaces. Recent advances in the systematic synthesis of bimetallic clusters
will be used as a starting point for the formation of new trimetallic clusters.
Emphasis will be placed on gold and silver clusters which also contain platinum
or palladium. A preliminary procedure which allows a third unligated metal to
add to the external edge of an existing bimetallic cluster will be developed and
the resulting complexes will be examined for catalytic activity. In addition, a
procedure will be developed for the attachment of the metal cluster compounds to
silica and phosphinated polymers, which may have potential use as easily
recoverable catalysts.
