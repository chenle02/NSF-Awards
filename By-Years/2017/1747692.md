The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to evaluate
the commercial potential of a new imaging modality that can reliably measure
blood perfusion. The system will enable surgeons to visualize and analyze blood
flow at a surgical site in real-time, thereby assisting them in making better
clinical decisions in the operating room, reduce the rate of post-operative
complications, leading to overall reduction in healthcare costs. The current
state-of-the-art for blood perfusion imaging is either based on injecting a
contrast agent into the bloodstream and are therefore invasive with potential
side-effects, or based on sophisticated Laser-based imaging device which can be
difficult to operate during surgery. The system developed here relies only on
the video recordings of the observation site to reliably estimate blood
perfusion, and hence is both non-invasive and is easy-to-use. Beyond surgery,
there is a potential of using the system to monitor critical care patients and
also as a point-of-care device in podiatry, especially for the early detection
of diabetic neuropathy.

This I-Corps project further develops a non-contact, non-invasive, camera-based
and clinically accurate blood perfusion measurement system. Using low-cost,
mass-produced hardware, combined with sophisticated signal processing
algorithms, the system can estimate blood perfusion maps in real time. The key
innovation lies in: (i) data fusion from multiple sensors - camera and pulse
oximeter, (ii) a new computational imaging and signal processing algorithm to
recover blood perfusion below the skin, from videos of the skin surface, and
(iii) a novel approach to compensate motion of the imaged tissue surface. The
technology can work not only with video recordings of the external tissue, such
as skin surface, but also internal tissue and organs, such as during a minimally
invasive surgery with a laparoscope. The system has been successfully
demonstrated in detecting small changes in blood perfusion during partial and
full occlusion of the blood vessels.
