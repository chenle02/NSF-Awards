This project will investigate new device structures to monitor atmospheric
gases, which will hopefully lead towards new simple and low-cost devices. The
new structure will utilize a catalyst- adsorptive oxide MIS configuration.
Detection will be based on changes in ionic charge density and/or charge
redistribution in the adsorptive oxide of the MIS structure upon gas adsorption.
A catalyst layer of several angstrom thickness will be used to enhance gas
selectivity and lower device adsorption temperature. The selectivity of the
device will be investigated using several different adsorptive oxide layers
and/or a variety of catalyst layers. The electronic process of the device's
detecting mechanism will be extensively investigated and modeled. The effect of
applied electric field on the device's adsorption and desorption of gases will
be explored.
