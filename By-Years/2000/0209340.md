Dev Thirumalai is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division and the Molecular Biophysics Program
in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences to continue work on
protein folding and protein dynamics. This work is characterized by the
development of algorithms and theories to interpret various topics, such as the
force-induced unfolding of proteins and the assembly of beta-hairpin structures.
These concepts and methods are used to make precise predictions that can be
tested in experiments. This current project focuses on three areas: 1) obtaining
a greater understanding of elementary processes in protein folding, such as loop
formation and beta-hairpin formation; 2) investigating the mechanism of urea-
induced denaturation; and 3) studying the chaperone-assisted folding of
proteins. Much of this work relies on statistical mechanics and simulations that
have been used for the studies of glasses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project
there is a close connection between Thirumalai's theoretical and computational
studies and recent experimental work, a connection that is often missing in
similar computational investigations. The theoretical approach used here will
provide a basic understanding of the folding properties of proteins, such as why
a particular amino acid sequence adopts a particular folded conformation. Such
problems are currently at the frontier of protein research, and a basic
understanding of the factors that influence protein folding could have an
enormous impact on the biotechnology industry.&lt;br/&gt;
