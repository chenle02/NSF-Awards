The objective of the REU Site at UNC Charlotte is to implement effective
practices to engage a diverse group of undergraduate students in computing
research. Undergraduate students will actively pursue research that applies
human-computer interaction (HCI) concepts to advance the state of the art in a
particular field, including pervasive computing, computer vision, data
visualization, social networks, and serious games. Each research project has a
socially relevant theme, providing students with the opportunity to apply and
extend their computing knowledge to address problems that have a real-world
impact. The site emphasizes participation of promising students from
underrepresented groups in computing and from institutions that have limited
research programs. To help students become rapidly immersed in the culture of
research and to prepare them for meaningful research experiences, the site
cultivates an authentic community of practice that values the contributions of
REU students as researchers, and provides REU participants with explicit, just-
in-time training in research skills at a weekly workshop.

The intellectual merit of this project lies in the REU students? contributions
to the discovery and evaluation of innovative, interactive computing solutions
to address problems of interest in society; specific projects may address open
problems in the fields of computer vision, pervasive computing, data
visualization, social networks, and serious games. The broader impact of this
project lies in the opportunity to introduce talented students from
underrepresented populations to computing research and in the potential to
increase the enrollment of domestic students in doctoral computing programs.
