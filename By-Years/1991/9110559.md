It is proposed to collect a four-month time series of high quality
meteorological variables and the structure of the ocean's upper 30 m in the
Western Pacific Warm Pool. The observations will take place in late 1992 to
early 1993 during the Intensive Observation Period (IOP) of the Tropical Ocean
Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean Atmosphere Response Experiment (TOGA COARE). The
goal of the experiment is to understand and describe the oceanic response to
Westerly wind bursts and rainfall.
