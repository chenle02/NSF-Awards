The Emory University has several researchers who would benefit from access to
supercomputing. The campus will be connected to SURANET, a mid-level network
which attaches to the National Science Foundation Network (NSFNET) through
medium speed (56,000 bits per second) communication lines. Six federally-funded
supercomputing centers can be accessed through NSFnet. Consistent with NSF's
policy regarding connection to existing mid-level networks, this grant provides
money for a gateway/router and necessary peripheral equipment. The
communications line to an existing SURANET node will be provided separately by
supplemental funding to the SURANET management.
