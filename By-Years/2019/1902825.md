The goal of the project is to study problems concerning distribution of discrete
random variables, such as random polynomials, random sums, and random matrices.
These problems have many connections to other parts of mathematics, as well as
applications in statistics and machine learning.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI aims to continue his development of a
theory of anti-concentration. This theory has found applications in various
areas of mathematics, including probability, numercial linear algebra, and
complexity theory. He will also investigate an old and natural problem of Erdos
and Moser concerning sum-avoiding sets in the non-abelian setting, following his
recent work with T. Tao concerning the abelian case. In another part of the
proposal, the PI proposes to study several problems concerning random matrices
and random functions. Many of these problems are very basic and easy to state,
but have been major challenges to the mathematics community for a long time, and
&lt;br/&gt;progress on them has been made very
recently.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
