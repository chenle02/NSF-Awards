Each year over 1.5 million US students cross the boundary between elementary and
middle school, a crucial developmental period when students are often permitted
and encouraged to take greater responsibility for their choice of affiliations
and activities. This dissertation research project by a cultural anthropology
student studies what role family and peers play in students' formulation of
agendas during this social transition. The student will follow a cohort of
children during their first year of middle school in a peri-urban Atlanta
community. Combining participant observation, a series of semi-structured
interviews with a sample of 40 students and their parents, and a sequence of
broad school-based surveys, the researcher will examine how students prioritize
short-term agendas, how family and peer networks influence these agendas, and
how students, by choosing who influences them, act as agents in their own
socialization. This study will improve our understanding of how local networks
of social relations serve as mediators of cultural influence and change. The new
knowledge to be created will also be valuable for policymakers to understand how
families and peers serve as informal sources of cultural education during the
middle school transition.
