Muskingum College is developing microcomputer-based laboratory exercises and
equipment that enhances all of its physics laboratory courses. The present
instrumentation is being augmented by precision position monitors, light sensors
and spectrometers connected to Macintosh and MS-DOS computers. Curricula are
being written for using this equipment in all lower division physics courses,
including a new workshop-type course designed for pre-service teachers. Physics
students are constructing and calibrating the spectrometers as part of an upper-
division laboratory course. New microcomputer-based exercises that incorporate a
CCD imaging camera and telescope are being created for the introductory
astronomy laboratory.
