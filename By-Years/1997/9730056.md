Tools for the automatic remote acquisition of electron micrographs will be
developed. These will allow an investigator to design, oversee and manage
protocols for the collection of large number of low dose electron micrographs.
By the judicious combination of automated algorithms and input from an
experienced transmission electron microscope operator, the proposed system of
software tools will provide a reliable method for collecting large numbers of
high quality electron micrographs with a minimum of manual labor.
