9626818 Kania-Bartoszynska This project belongs in the general area of low-
dimensional topology. More specifically, it deals with applications of
topological quantum field theory to classical three-manifold topology. The
investigator will use quantum invariants to construct obstructions to the
embedding of three-manifolds in the three-sphere and to construct invariants for
the detection of lens spaces and Seifert fiber spaces. Additionally, quantum
invariants are to be used to formulate criteria for the existence of symmetries
in three-manifolds. Low-dimensional topology is mainly concerned with
classifying spaces of dimensions three and four, where two spaces are treated as
equivalent if one space can be deformed onto the other without tearing - this is
called a homeomorphic transformation. Such a classification, known as the
topological classification, has been essentially carried out in dimensions other
than three and four. It turns out that these two dimensions provide various
further technical difficulties, some of which are topics of much current
interest as they interface with deep ideas of modern physics.
