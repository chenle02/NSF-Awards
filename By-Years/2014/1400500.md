Holyoke Community College (HCC), the University of Massachusetts Amherst (UMass)
and Hampshire College are implementing a project entitled "Application of Clean
Energy Technology to Sustainable Agriculture Practice," the focus of which is
development and improvement of the clean energy and sustainable agricultural
programs across the three higher education institutions. The agricultural sector
is one of the largest utilizers of clean energy in western Massachusetts and is
a natural fit for the application of knowledge of clean energy through a trained
workforce. HCC, Hampshire College, and UMass are positioned to change the
culture of farming - to make the conversion to more sustainable food production.

The project goals are to: (1) ensure the relevance of the program approach and
course activities and outcomes to both the regional clean energy industry and
the agricultural industry; (2) improve and enhance the academic rigor of the
clean energy and sustainable agriculture programs on all three collaborating
campuses; (3) expand internship opportunities for students in clean energy and
agriculture and provide mentoring opportunities to students in the programs on
all three campuses; (4) expand existing academic/career pathways for students
from vocational/traditional high schools, as well as adults returning to the
workforce in the clean energy/agricultural industries; (5) expand recruitment
efforts in energy/agriculture technology with emphasis on underrepresented
groups, including women, racially/ethnically diverse populations and veterans,
as well as adults enrolled in adult learning programs; (6) expand marketing
efforts to increase the visibility of all three academic programs as models of
the application of clean energy technologies to the agricultural sector; and (7)
disseminate efforts on all levels - local, regional, and national. Outcomes of
the project's evaluation will inform the broader community on the impacts of
enhanced curricula and the expansion of internship opportunities, academic and
career pathways and recruitment efforts on enrollment and workforce development
in clean energy/agriculture.
