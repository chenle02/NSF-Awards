This proposal is to develop a simulation of the spot welding process using
finite element techniques to portray the coupled electrical, thermal, and
mechanical cycles seen during this type of welding. This simulation will allow
study of how variations in process parameters affect weld formation. Of
particular interest are the size of the weld nugget formed and the magnitude of
the residual stresses in the weld zone which can be related to fatigue life of
the weld. This type of analysis to determine the residual stresses in the weld
zone is novel. Experimental work to validate the approach is planned. Spot
welding is an important manufacturing process, especially for the automotive
industry. This research can lead to a better understanding of residual stress
development in this type of welding and to valuable design guidelines.
