9415543 Childress This research is directed at testing the hypothesis that the
remineralization of oceanic carbon by micronekton and zooplankton is a
significant fraction of the oceanic carbon budget. This will be carried out by
applying the data on metabolic patterns to a midwater animals biomass dataset
which has been collected in the California Current in a 4100 m water column and
using the metabolic data to estimate respiratory carbon flux due to this
community and its major components. The research effort will focus on improved
biomass estimates for gelatinous animals, improved estimations of metabolic
rates at the low oxygen partial pressures found in midwater oxygen minimum
layers, and collection of data from rarer and more fragile species. The
significance of this research is tied to the importance of understanding the
immense, global midwater ecosystem. An ecosystem which interacts extensively
with the surface communities, but about which we know relatively little. The
midwater fauna (including both micronekton and zooplankton) is a major factor in
the flux of material through the water column as a result of vertical migration,
predation on vertical migrnats, feeding on sedimenting materials and production
of biomass and feces at depth. The respiratory oxidation of organic compounds at
depth by this fauna is potentially a significant component of the carbon flux in
midwater. To understand the importance of this assemblage of organisms in the
economy of the ocean and in global carbon cycles, it is essential to obtain
information on the rates of biological processes carried out by this fauna.
