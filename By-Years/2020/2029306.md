Pacific Wave (PacWave) is a distributed, Research and Education
(R&amp;E)-focused, open Internet Exchange. It provides for very high-performance
Internet connectivity among US Science and Engineering R&amp;E institutions and
their international partners and is critical infrastructure for high-performance
access to internationally supported instruments and large-scale data sources and
repositories. PacWave enables large-scale scientific workflows to accelerate
discovery in all areas of science and engineering, including high-energy
physics, earth sciences, astronomy and astrophysics, biology and biomedical
engineering, as well as scalable visualization, virtual reality, machine
learning, and artificial intelligence. Its strategic location on the US West
Coast facilitates connection of Trans-Pacific undersea cables to US National and
Regional Research Networks, such as Internet2, ESnet, and others. In
collaboration with Internet2 and other US-based R&amp;E Exchanges (StarLight,
Atlantic Wave, MANLAN, and WIX), the US Science and Engineering community is
also connected to Europe, Central and South America, Africa, and beyond, thereby
supporting a truly global high-performance research
platform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The operation, expansion, and technology of
PacWave with primary points of presence in Los Angeles, Sunnyvale, and Seattle
will be enhanced over the next 5 years, with advanced measurement, monitoring,
and analytic tools. Performance data gathered from passive and active
measurements will help characterize network traffic, monitor incident pathology
and provide alerting messages and visualizations. PacWaveâ€™s enhancements aim to
meet demands for higher data rates (400 Gbps, 800 Gbps, and beyond), making
possible exploration and adoption of newly emerging technologies for improved
performance, security, measurement, and monitoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
