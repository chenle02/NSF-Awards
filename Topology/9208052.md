Two investigators are involved in this project. James F. Davis' main emphasis
is the use of surgery theory to study rational information in manifold theory.
Surgery theory is the main tool for classification of manifolds of dimension
greater than 3, although complexities in homotopy and integral representation
theory make it efficacious only in special cases. However, if one works over the
rational numbers, complete results are available for manifolds with finite
fundamental group. Davis will attempt extensions of these results to manifolds
with infinite fundamental group, and to spaces more general than manifolds, but
which still possess some form of duality. A second and quite different direction
of Davis' research is knot theory. He will study the homology of covers of the
3-sphere branched over a knot, the set of periods of a knot, and their
relationship with algebraic number theory. In related work, Kent E. Orr will
continue to study linking and knotting phenomena in codimension two, as well as
investigate the implications of the recent Cochran-Orr work to Casson-Gordon
invariants and four-dimensional surgery. Among other things, he hopes to answer
the following two questions about the link slice problem: Are all even-
dimensional links slice? Do the presently known homotopy theoretic linking
invariants of links in the 3-sphere (such as the transfinite invariants of
Levine and Orr and the Le Dimet invariant) reduce to classically defined
invariants such as Milnor's invariants and Massy products? The details of these
parts vary, but all are concerned with reducing geometric information to a
subject for calculation or to perfecting the algebraic machinery used for the
calculations. The nature of the geometric information involved is the crux of
the difficulty. While questions about lengths, areas, angles, volumes, and so
forth virtually cry out to be reduced to calculations, it is far different with
what are known as topological properties of geometric objects. These are
properties such as connectedness (being all in one piece), knottedness, having
no holes, and so forth. All systematic study of such properties, for example,
how to tell whether two geometric objects really differ in respect to one of
these properties or are only superficially different, or how to classify the
variety of differences that can occur, all these have only truly been
comprehended and mastered when they have been reduced to matters of calculation,
and two of the principal tools for this are homotopy theory and surgery theory.
