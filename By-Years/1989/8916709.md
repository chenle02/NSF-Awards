Efforts to understand the physics and chemistry of earth materials depend
fundamentally on structural characterization of minerals at high temperatures
and pressures. In this proposal funding was requested for crystallographic
research at the Geophysical Laboratory, which supports the only American
facility engaged primarily in high-pressure, single-crystal, x-ray diffraction
studies of minerals and their analogs. The principal objective proposed was to
perform systematic studies on silicate minerals believed to occur in the Earth's
mantle transition zone. The crystallographic laboratory will also continue to
serve the American materials research community. In 1988, for example, it
examined without charge more than 50 samples, sent from a dozen laboratories.
