Heterogeneity and anisotropy are phenomena encountered in many different
settings: flows in porous media, optical tomography, neutron transport,
radiative transfer, electromagnetics, etc. While the differential equations
modeling these problems may be different in nature, the common feature they
share is that they involve parameters that may be highly heterogeneous (values
may have jumps of many orders of magnitude) or can be highly anisotropic. Under
the usual terminology these problems are degenerate (i.e. there is no uniform
ellipticity) and, as a result, cannot be handled using standard mathematical
methods. The objective of this research project is to analyze degenerate
problems (well-posedness, stability, etc.) and to develop general discontinuous
Galerkin techniques for approximating them. The discontinuous Galerkin that will
be constructed will be stable for all the degenerate cases of interest and will
automatically approximate the physically meaningful transmission conditions
between sub-domains with different parameter ranges without the user having to
identify sub-domains with specific properties a priori. The key is to use the
mathematical framework of Friedrichs systems and to design the operators that
controls discontinuities in the approximate solution appropriately.

The merit of the proposed approximation technique is that it addresses the
problem at hand from a radically different perspective than the usual multi-
domain/multi-algorithmic approaches. The new technique will automatically detect
heterogeneity/anisotropy and will adapt to situations without the user having to
take manual action. The impact of this research project will be broad since the
class of problems addressed touches many fields in engineering, in environmental
sciences, in geophysics, in petroleum engineering, semiconductor industry, etc.
Proposing a novel robust approximation technique for solving problems with
highly heterogeneous and anisotropic properties will eventually benefit many
areas of science and engineering where controlling or dealing with this type of
problem is still a serious challenge.
