The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is a portable
single cell electrokinetic separation platform for healtchare applications. It
can be implemented in hospitals, medical offices, and laboratories to improve
patient outcomes by allowing for a wide array of sample-to-answer biological
tests. This is considered a personalized diagnostic and can be performed in
doctorsâ€™ offices and at the patient bedside, including early diagnostic of
circulating tumor cells or testing for sepsis or heart attack, and also for
improving biopharmaceutical drug discovery and biosynthesis.

This I-Corps project is based on the development of the electrokinetic micro-
and nano-assembly process. The goal of the outlined technology development and
commercialization project is to create a universal portable centrifugal
microfluidic platform that will be applicable for a wide range of tests from
general fluid chemistry assays to biomarker assays and single cell analysis.
This platform could find widespread use in hospitals and medical offices as well
as in scientific laboratories. The proposed compact microfluidic system unifies
sample preprocessing capabilities possible on a centrifugal microfluidic
platform with electrokinetic sorting, separation, and capture of biological
cells and molecules. The proposing team has expertise, capability, and needed
resources to undertake the technical development and commercialization of the
proposed centrifugal microfluidic sample-to-answer platform.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
