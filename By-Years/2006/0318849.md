This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on the
implementation of a blue-light converter based on a novel structure of KTiOPO4
(KTP) crystal. It proposes to integrate quasi-phase-matched (QPM) second-
harmonic generation (SHG) with 90 degrees phase-matched sum-frequency generation
(SFG) in the exclusive partly-periodically-poled KTP crystal. This structure
will be used to achieve blue laser through effective third-harmonic generation
(THG) from the latest technologies in 1.319 micron Nd:YAG, Nd:YVO4 and other Nd-
doped lasers. The proposed blue devices naturally follow our recent
demonstrations. They rely on the advantages of a KTP crystal including large
second-order nonlinear coefficients and large angular and temperature tolerance.
Most importantly, only a KTP crystal can be used in these devices since it can
reach 90 degrees -phase-matched SFG from 1.319 micron and 659.5 nm to 439.7 nm.
Therefore, the proposed blue devices are simple, highly efficient, highly
reliable and low cost. Since the blue-light converter is built from one crystal,
it is suitable for intracavity THG similar to intracavity SHG in Verdi and
Millennia. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blue-Light Converters can be used in a number
of important applications. Some areas of inclusion are health care, photodynamic
therapy, spectroscopy with short-temporal and narrow-spectral resolutions, naval
communications, nondestructive evaluations, and entertainment. &lt;br/&gt;
