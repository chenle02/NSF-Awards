The project provides the principal investigator (PI), an assistant professor of
mathematics, with academic training in biostatistics so that he (1) can develop
a new career that will significantly help his home institution to achieve its
strategic goals in science, (2) can become a significant collaborator with and
resource for his colleagues in the biological sciences, providing a unique
mathematical perspective on significant biological questions and their
statistical ramifications. The grant activity will enhance the teaching of
statistics at the lower division undergraduate level as well as the possibility
of collaborative teaching of a biostatistics course in the upper division. To
obtain the requisite training in biostatistics and life sciences generally, the
applicant will spend one academic year as a visitor at the University of
Minnesota School of Public Health in the Division of Biostatistics. The grantee
will take course work in biostatistics and the life sciences, participate in
departmental seminars, and frame a program of research designed to complement
the biological research of the Science Department at BHSU. This IGMS project is
jointly supported by the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and
the Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS).
