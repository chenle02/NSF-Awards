This proposal is for partial support for a GSA Penrose conference on the topic
of Tectonics, Climate and Landscape Evolution which is to be held in January,
2003 at Taroko National Park in Taiwan (ROC). This proposal represents a request
for funding for the PI and the other conveners to conduct a pre-conference trip
to Taiwan in order to plan and scout fieldtrip stops and conference facilities.
We are also requesting support to subsidize the participation of i)graduate
students, ii) scientists who may have difficulty in obtaining funds to attend,
and iii) the conference and fieldtrip organizers.
