Recent advances in scanning technology and general progress in science and
engineering have made it easy to sample a geometry presented explicitly or
implicitly. In some cases, sampling allows the data to be equipped with values
of a scalar function defined on the sampled domain. The goal is to process the
resulting point cloud data (PCD) for approximating different geometric and
topological structures of the original space and/or functions defined on them.
How can this be achieved is the main agenda of this award.

The extraction of geometric and topological structures from a PCD begins with
the understanding of these structures on the original sampled space. In some
cases one needs to adapt existing mathematical concepts to fit the
discretization inherent in algorithmic development. In others new analysis
techniques and new algorithmic tools need to be developed. PIs expect the more
of the latter to tame the curse of dimensionality and scale. The two PIs bring
their expertise in computational geometry and computational topology to the
board to conduct the project.

A central problem in data analysis is to design computational methods for
representing and retrieving information from massive and high-dimensional data.
Various scientific, engineering, and social studies such as the ones in product
development, medicine, economics, climate, disease control produce data that
presumably sample a hidden parameter space sitting in a high dimension. They
will benefit from the techniques developed in this project. By the very nature
of the problems, this project will enhance a synergy between fields such as
mathematics, theoretical computer science, and data analysis.

Other than standard research forums, results from the project will be
disseminated through course notes, tutorials, and web-pages to reach wider
audience. Graduate students supported by the project will develop skills in
mathematics and theoretical computer science, most notably in geometry and
topology and also in writing robust, efficient and user-friendly software.
