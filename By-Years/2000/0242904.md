This is a continuation of investigations of the kinematics, rheology, and
dynamics of diffuse oceanic plate boundaries. Diffuse plate boundaries are 100's
to 1000's of kilometers in across-strike width, occur in both oceanic and
continental lithosphere, cover 15% of Earth's surface, and accommodate relative
plate motion of up to 15 mm/year. The project will estimate torques from angular
velocities for various plate pairs, fit the deformation profiles across the
Central Indain Basin to obtain more precise estimates of the rheology, and use
the results to quantify with simple physics the strength of faults for some
diffuse plate boundaries.&lt;br/&gt;
