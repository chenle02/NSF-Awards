Every day, millions of people across the world take photos and upload them to
social media websites. Their goal is to share photos with friends and others,
but collectively they are creating vast repositories of visual information about
the world. Each photo is an observation of how the world looked at a particular
point in time and space. Aggregated together, these photos could provide new
sources of observational data for use in disciplines like biology, earth
science, social science or history. This project is investigating the algorithms
and technologies needed for mining these large collections of photographs and
noisy metadata to draw inferences about the physical world. The project has four
research thrusts: (1) investigating techniques for identifying and correcting
noise in metadata like geo-tags and timestamps, (2) developing algorithms for
extracting semantic information from images and metadata, (3) creating methods
for robust aggregation of noisy evidence from multiple photos, (4) validating
these techniques on interdisciplinary applications in biology, sociology, and
earth science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is laying the foundation for
using visual social media as a new source of observational data for a variety of
scientific disciplines. The educational component is preparing students for the
next generation of "big data" jobs through new undergraduate and graduate
courses and online instructional materials. Undergraduate students (particularly
from under-represented groups) are recruited to participate in the research
program and encouraged to pursue scientific careers. An annual workshop is
planned to educate general audiences, particularly senior citizens, about data
mining and social media. Source code, datasets, course materials, and other
results of the project will be disseminated to the public via the project web
site (http://vision.soic.indiana.edu/career/).
