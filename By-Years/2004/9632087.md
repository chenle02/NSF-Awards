9632087 Moroney Unicellular algae, including Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, have the
capacity to concentrate carbon dioxide internally, allowing these organisms to
grow photoautotrophically at very low external carbon dioxide concentrations.
This carbon dioxide concentrating mechanism is inducible; it is present only in
cells that have been grown with limiting carbon dioxide conditions. Dr. Moroney
has shown that cells with the carbon dioxide concentrating mechanism have the
low carbon dioxide-inducible polypeptide, LIP-36, present in the chloroplast
envelope. He also has identified six genes that are specifically induced by
growth on low carbon dioxide. Two of these genes, 1113 ans 215, encode putative
transmembrane proteins. Recently he has obtained the gene encoding LIP-36 and
has identified a gene encoding an internal carbonic anhydrase. In this award,
Dr. Moroney will study the carbon dioxide concentrating mechanism in C.
reinhardtii by using three approaches. In the first approach he will continue to
characterize some of the genes and proteins identified. The second approach will
be to measure inorganic carbon transport using chloroplast envelope vesicles in
collaboration with Dr. Richard E. McCarty, Johns Hopkins University. The third
approach will be to use cellular fractionation and immunolocalization to
localize rubisco and the newly discovered carbonic anhydrase within the
chloroplast of C. reinhardtii. The characterization of the proteins of this
transport system will increase our understanding of the low carbon dioxide
adjustment in algae and the role of the chloroplast in this photosynthetic
adaptation. Algal photosynthesis contributes a major portion of the earth's
energy cycle. Studies of its underlying mechanisms will contribute to our
understanding of global change.
