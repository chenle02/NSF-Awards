Direct studies of melting and cystallization of simple and complex silicate
melts will be performed by high temperature calorimetry and x-ray diffraction at
900-1500oC. The goals are to obtain enthalpies of fusion of minerals present on
the liquidus in silicate systems, to make direct measurements of enthalpies of
mixing in the molten state, to characterize the absorption (release) of heat
during the melting (crystallization) of complex multicomponent systems, and to
directly observe melting and crystallization. The data will be used in models of
heat balance during pluton emplacement, in models of magma crystallization in
lava lakes, and in models of other magmatic processes.
