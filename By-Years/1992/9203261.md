Many key questions in behavioral ecology can be profitably addressed by
applying endocrinological techniques. This research will examine the
physiological basis of plasticity of reproductive behavior in a biparental
burying beetle (Nicrophorus orbicollis). Correlative analyses will be used in
two ways to implicate specific hormones in the regulation of reproductive
behavior. First, titer curves for juvenile hormone and ecdysteroids will be
developed for both males and females across a complete reproductive cycle.
Second, environmental variables will be manipulated to alter the quality and
duration of paternal care; these behavioral responses will be matched to
concurrent hormonal responses. To examine the casual relationship between
hormones and behavior, hormone treatments will be made in an attempt to induce
changes in behavioral patterns. The endocrine techniques that are developed will
subsequently be utilized as sensitive probes to identify the particular
environmental stimuli that influence decision-making in burying beetles.
Hormonal manipulations will also be employed to alter male parental behavior in
order to examine effects on reproductive success, female parental behavior,
costs of maternal care and host selection by a symbiotic phoretic mite. For the
first time, this study will integrate hormonal and behavioral analyses of an
invertebrate species that exhibits biparental care, infanticide and mate
desertion and thus will bring new depth to the study of plasticity of
reproductive behavior.
