This workshop supports travel of 13 scientists (primarily graduate students and
postdocs) from the US, to participate in the ?ISS-09 Conference?, to be held in
Vienna, Austria, June 10-12, 2009. The ISS-09 conference will bring together
scientists and diplomats to address the readiness and capability of the
Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty?s verification regime. The conference will
also address how the verification regime has benefitted from scientific and
technical developments since the Treaty opened for signature in 1996

The global data collection from the IMS represents a tremendous asset to the
scientific community: the International Monitoring System (IMS) is a huge
capital investment with a considerable operating budget, from which US
scientists could greatly benefit. The International Seismic Studies initiative
and associated conference represents a first and important step towards more
open access to the IMS data, in particular those collected from seismic,
infrasound and hydro-acoustic arrays.
