The PI intends to continue to two lines of scientific inquiry currently under
investigation. The first involves studies in ice sheet stability as a function
of basal flow of a deforming bed, where instability caused by marginal melting
triggers ice sheet collapse. Field and modeling work support the idea of a
triggering mechanism, and if correct, can also explain the patterns of ice-
related, sediment deposition associated with glacial movement. In addition the
PI will continue work in the basic physics of glacial ice, its transformation
and implication to the broader field of paleoclimatology.
