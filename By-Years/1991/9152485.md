The Boston University Solar Telescope has been used for over ten years to allow
students to observe sunspots, flares, and high-resolution optical spectra of the
sun. New technology allows the renovation of this telescope with CCD detectors
and cameras, a new optical bench and driving motor, and personal- computer based
driving, recording, and plotting system. With a refurbished telescope, students
can make, record, and take away hard copies of observations of sunspots,
chromospheric emission, flares, and spectra. The spectral resolution is high
enough to see first-hand the doppler shifts of the Fraunhofer lines, at the
eastern and western limbs, relative to reference lines arising in Earth's
atmosphere. Measurements of the doppler shifts plus angular motions of sunspots
allow students to measure the distance to the Sun. Observations of the phases
and angular size changes of Venus with the telescope (which can be done in the
daytime since Venus is so bright) then allow a determination of the size of its
orbit as well. Setting the spectral resolution to a lower level allows first-
hand spectroscopy of stars, planets, and the moon.
