As data in the fields of science and engineering continues to grow in both size
and complexity, existing numerical algorithms face challenges in efficiently
handling large-scale linear algebra operations. The development of high-
performance numerical algorithms has become crucial for enhancing the
performance of data analysis and scientific computing applications on a large
scale. This project aims to develop new numerical algorithms that effectively
leverage the capabilities of high-performance computing to rapidly solve large-
scale linear systems. This project will provide a valuable opportunity for
students to engage in research and training activities at a primarily
undergraduate institution focused on numerical methods and high-performance
computing, which would greatly contribute to their career success in these
fields.

This project investigates the practical use of block Krylov subspace operations
for the rapid solution of large-scale linear systems. Efficiency and cost-
effectiveness are key considerations in optimizing block Krylov subspace
algorithms. This project will explore appropriate matrix transformation
techniques to design block Krylov subspace operations that are computationally
efficient and effective. This project will also implement the block Krylov
subspace operations for high-performance computing and evaluate their
performance using various matrix data derived from real-life applications. The
resulting block Krylov subspace algorithms developed in this project would
greatly benefit domain experts in efficiently dealing with large-scale linear
systems on high-performance computing platforms.
