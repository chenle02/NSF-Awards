DMS-9987434 Alejandro Adem

In this project the principal investigator proposes to use both algebraic and
topological methods to study a number of basic questions in transformation
groups, group cohomology and related topics. In particular he proposes to study
the phenomenon of periodicity in group cohomology via group actions; to analyze
the cohomology of certain Galois groups arising from basic questions in field
theory; to calculate the cohomology of low rank sporadic simple groups; and to
investigate a number of miscellaneous problems where a significant interplay of
algebra and topology is apparent.

Topology measures intrinsic properties of mathematical objects which are
invariant under deformations like twisting and pulling. In particular symmetries
can be fruitfully studied by using topological methods. Examples arise from
physics as well as other natural sciences and obtaining precise mathematical
methods for their study is a challenging topic. This project proposes to use
recently developed mathematical techniques as well as computer assisted
calculations to achieve this in a number of different instances which are known
to be of significant interest.
