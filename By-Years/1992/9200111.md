This U.S.-Chile award will support research collaboration between Mary Willson
of the Pacific Northwest Research Station, Juneau, Alaska and J. J. Armesto and
M. K. Arroyo-Hurley of the Universidad de Chile in Santiago, Chile. The
collaborators intend to quantify the effects of forest fragmentation on
mutualistic animals and on the reproduction of their plant mutualists, and to
examine the effect of perches on rates of recruitment of fleshy-fruited plants
on disturbed sites. Mutualistic interactions between plants and animals comprise
a set of major ecological processes in many terrestrial communities, although
they are much less studied than competition, predation, parasitism, and
herbivory. Because their effects are positive, the continued operation of these
mutualisms is critical to maintenance of ecosystems and community function. The
proposed work will involve a field census of birds, student training, and
setting up a colonization experiment. These studies will prove useful in
carrying our similar studies in the north- temperate rain forests from the
Pacific part of North America, where communities and interactions may be
organized differently.
