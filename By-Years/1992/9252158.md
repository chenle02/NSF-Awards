The aim of the project is to equip teaching laboratories with video-imaging and
recording systems for use in large-enrollment Introductory Biology courses and
an upper-division Parasitology course. This system will allow students to make
class presentations by projecting microscopic specimens (prepared slide and wet
mount) as well as larger scale experimental set ups and dissections. Use of this
video instrumentation is intended to: (1) increase the participation of visually
and/or motor impaired students by allowing them to be mainstreamed rather than
be segregated from their classmates; (2) enhance class presentations by students
in cooperative learning groups; (3) extend the instructional capability of
student microscopes, and (4) produce videotapes and videoexams. The goal is to
embrace diversity in the classroom by helping disabled students overcome the
physical barriers to hands-on learning in the lab and by appealing to the
variety of students' learning styles including those who rely mainly on visual
stimulation for information processing. The implementation of cooperative
learning methods is expected to enhance student learning by requiring students
to take responsibility not only for their own learning, but for their group
members' learning as well.
