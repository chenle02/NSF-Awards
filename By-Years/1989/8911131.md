In his Art of Conjecturing, Jacob Bernoulli applied the theory of combinations
and permutations and the theory of expectations in games of chance by analogy to
political, moral and economic subjects in an attempt to rationalize decision
making in those fields. In this way, he helped to create the modern mathematical
theory of probability, tying together frequencies of physical events and the
evaluation of evidence to provide rational methods of predicting future events
or of acting wisely in conditions of uncertainty. Most histories of probability
have been written by people with mathematical interests and have emphasized
proofs of important mathematical theorems. In studying the early history of
probability theory, Professor Sylla aims to redress the balance by paying
attention not only to mathematical detail, but also to the social or real world
problems that early probabilists such as Bernoulli were hoping to address. A
product of this research will be an English translation of Bernoulli's Art of
Conjecturing, on e of the classic works of early probability theory.
Accompanying that translation will be an introduction, annotations, and
mathematical commentary which put the work in its broadest social and scientific
perspective.
