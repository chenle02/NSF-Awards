Under this award the PIs will develop lipid biomarker proxies that will assist
the study of marine cyanobacteria in both the modern ocean and in the geological
record. The PIs will test the hypothesis that cyanobacteria are a dominant
source of distinctive lipids known as bacteriohopanepolyols (BHP.s) produced in
the marine water column and likely to be recorded in underlying sediments. If
proven, it will provide a sound basis for attributing a specific biological
origin to some of the hopane hydrocarbons that occur abundantly in ancient
sediments and petroleum.
