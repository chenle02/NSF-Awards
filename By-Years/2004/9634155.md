The purpose of this project is to document and explain evolutionary changes in
two critical features of the early hominid cranio-facial complex: 1) the
angulation (flexion) of the cranial base and 2) the position of the face
relative to the cranial base. Although it is often assumed that these features
evolved together, previous studies have not adequately quantified them. New
measurements of facial positioning and cranial base flexion will be collected
from original fossils housed in Kenya and South Africa. Such measurements will
improve our understanding of the pattern of change in these key cranial
features. Previous authors have suggested that evolutionary changes in flexion
and facial positioning are secondary to changes in the shape and relative size
of skull components such as the brain and masticatory apparatus. Using
comparative samples of modern human and African ape crania, hypotheses relating
the overall and relative size of these cranial components to variation in
flexion and facial positioning will be tested. The results of this project will
aid interpretation of variation among fossil crania and will be especially
useful in explaining evolutionary changes among closely related species in our
own genus.
