This award provides support for participants in the research training group in
geometry and topology at the University of Chicago. The program will be led by
six faculty members (Danny Calegari, Alex Eskin, Benson Farb, J. Peter May,
Shmuel Weinberger, and Anne M. Wilkinson) who will work in collaboration with
other members of the Department of Mathematics to build on the department's
successes in the academic year Directed Reading Program and summer Research
Experience for Undergraduates program by further enhancing the training of
undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows. Graduate
students and postdocs will be involved in topics courses taught by postdocs and
in the support of research-oriented summer programs for undergraduates. Shorter,
immersive summer workshops for graduate students and postdocs will build on the
longstanding tradition of the Midwest Topology Seminar and related conferences
that regularly bring together researchers throughout the Great Lakes states.
Group activities for the academic year include a geometric literacy course that
ranges widely in topics, and a topology proseminar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
research training group aims to achieve a greater integration of fields that
have grown apart over the decades and to expose participants to a broader range
of potential applications than has been traditional. Research training will be
anchored by research topics ranging broadly through dynamical systems and
ergodic theory, a variety of topics in and around geometric group theory, the
striking failure of rigidity in arithmetic lattices, homological stability
phenomena, and various topics in algebraic topology, from equivariant stable
homotopy theory through applied algebraic topology and data analysis.
