Religiously affiliated mutual funds represent a unique realm where religious and
financial motivations intersect. These funds combine their Catholic,
Evangelical, Muslim or Protestant beliefs and traditions with socially
responsible investing (SRI) through avoiding certain companies (screening) or by
owning companies in effort to change their behavior (advocacy). While most SRI
research in concerned with the return performance of the funds, this research
will explore how religion influences the financial market behavior of average
mutual fund investors. Existing mutual fund data will be used to test whether
religious fund investors demonstrate more investor loyalty to their funds than
conventional investors. Secondly, a scientific phone survey of a Protestant
fund?s investors will provide individual level detail into the ways individuals
balance their devotion to God and their devotion to money. This intersection of
religion and the financial market makes a significant contribution to the larger
body of sociological knowledge. This research will have a broader impact in the
following ways. Research findings will be shared with the larger academic
community through subsequent publications and conference presentations. This
topic will be of particular interest to sociologists of religion and economic
sociologists, opening up increased communication between these subfields which
rarely interact. These findings will provide important information for SRI
practitioners that operate these types of investment vehicles. Lastly, in a
market climate where curbing greed is a popular market regulation approach, this
research opens the possibility of public policies that reward morality in the
financial market.
