This research project involves a team of scholars involved in the following
topics: (1) applications of group representations, (2) Bayesian statistics, (3)
rates of convergence of Markov chains to their stationary distributions, (4)
regression percentiles using an asymmetric least squares loss function, (5)
using compliance as a covariate in a randomized clinical trial, (6) influence
functions for confidence limits, (7) better automatic confidence intervals for
parametric problems, (8) permutation tests for 'messy situations', (9) minimax
estimation, (10) loss and risk estimation, (11) volumes of tubular neighborhoods
and statistical applications, (12) maximum entropy methods, (13) confidence
regions in semilinear regression, (14) change-point problems, (15) sequential
tests and estimates, (16) the approximate evaluation of expectations, (17)
bootstrap confidence intervals in complex models, (18) bootstrap choice of
tuning parameters and adaptation, and (19) approximate inference for parametric
models via least favorable families. The general aim of this project is the
development of new statistical theory and methodology of interest to applied
mathematics. The research involves a combination of traditional mathematical
statistics and modern computational methods. Particular goals are understanding
more complicated models than are traditionally used and automating insofar as
possible statistical procedures for routine use.
