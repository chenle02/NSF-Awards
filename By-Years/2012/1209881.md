This action funds Michael Okyen of Virginia Tech to conduct a research project,
entitled "Slip and slide: balance control to prevent sliding and twisting of the
feet of humanoid robots," during the summer of 2012 at the Korea Institute of
Science and Technology in Seoul, Seongbuk-gu, Korea. The host scientist is Dr.
Bum-Jae You.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to develop a method to improve
the balance of a humanoid robot. The goal of many robotic systems is to take
over human tasks in everyday environments, where surfaces greatly vary. However,
few can actually adapt to the variations and therefore cannot reliably begin
their role in society.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
