This award is to provide funding to develop a fermentation system with the
capability to monitor and/or control a number of fermentation parameters. The
first project is entitled, " A Study of Bacillus subtilis metabolism." B.
subtilis is an important bacterium for hosting cloned foreign genes and for
production of a number of extracellular proteins. An important engineering issue
is the development of cultivation techniques to achieve high cell density and
efficient conversion of substrate to a product. The PIs have begun examining the
metabolism of B. subtilis under a wide range of growth conditions and a reliable
fermentation monitoring system is required to expand their understanding of cell
physiological responses to culture environment. The second project is entitled
"Large Scale Bioreactor Growth Studies of Bone Marrow Stem Cells." This project
will focus on the development of procedures for growing stem cells and for
studying their differentiation to various cell types. The results of this
research could have important utility in bone marrow transplantation.
