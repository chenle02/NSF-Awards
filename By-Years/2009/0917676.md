This project focuses on the development of mobility strategies
for&lt;br/&gt;Robotic Sensor Networks (RSNs) which are networks of robots
equipped&lt;br/&gt;with communication, computation and sensing capabilities. For
RSN&lt;br/&gt;technology to be utilized in critical applications such as
emergency&lt;br/&gt;response and environmental monitoring, mobility algorithms
for&lt;br/&gt;operation in dynamic and complex environments are
needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, three novel mobility problems
which arise in many RSN&lt;br/&gt;applications are introduced. These problems
are general enough to&lt;br/&gt;capture the interplay between communication,
sensing and&lt;br/&gt;mobility. Yet, they can be succinctly formulated as
geometric&lt;br/&gt;optimization problems. This work will focus on solving these
mobility&lt;br/&gt;problems which will yield provably correct solutions for
numerous RSN&lt;br/&gt;applications. In addition, bounds on the performance of a
given RSN in&lt;br/&gt;fundamental problems such as tracking, collaborative
sensing and&lt;br/&gt;estimation will be established.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
output of this research will be a significant step toward enabling&lt;br/&gt;the
use of fully autonomous RSNs for crucial applications in
emergency&lt;br/&gt;response, energy and environmental monitoring, and health
care&lt;br/&gt;automation. Sensing and actuation play important roles in
the&lt;br/&gt;evolution of information technology. The project will contribute
to&lt;br/&gt;this evolution through the development of novel distributed
sensing&lt;br/&gt;and control algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;
