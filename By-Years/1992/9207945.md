The feeding habits of some planktonic predators make conventional microscopic
application of the gut content analysis almost impossible. This project will
explore the feasibility of using electrophoresis of biochemical markers to
examine prey remains. Electrophorectic techniques offers a rapid and simple
means of tracing food web relationships, particularly with predators that
comsume only soft tissues which cannot be identified by microscopic study. At
present, standard staining methods have already been modified to identify
biochemical markers representative of prey organisms which are present in the
intestinal tracts of predators drawn directly from nature. The method can
potentially be applied to novel environments and to novel biotic assemblages
with minimal advance preparation. This project will develop the methodology
further by using specimens that can be collected on a ancillary basis with NSF
sponsored research during summer 1992.
