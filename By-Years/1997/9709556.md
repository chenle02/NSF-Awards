This project investigates how the deepening international economic integration
in the years prior to World War I systematically influenced the security
politics of the European Great Powers and led to the breakdown of European order
in 1914. This war followed on the heels of a rapid and sustained expansion of
the international economy. As one of the central cases in the international
security literature, it is important to understand whether the changing world
economy contributed to the collapse of the international system in this period.
This project uses a combination of economic data, archival records and case
studies by other researchers to test key hypotheses from models of political
economy. Aside from improving our understanding of the causes of World War I,
this research provides insights into broader implications of international
economic change and global economic integration.
