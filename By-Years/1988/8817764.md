This is a project involving a two-ship and single ship multichannel seismic
survey of the Society and Marquesas hot spot chains in the Pacific ocean. It is
a collaborative project with the French. Work will include wide angle and
expanding spread two-ship profiles and single ship MCS. The study is aimed at
understanding the nature of zero age volcanism at the southeast end of the
chains, the factors contributing to the onset of volcanism at the northwest end
of the chains, and the relationship of the hot spots to the Marquesas Fracture
Zone. A particular objective is to understand hot spotlithospheric interaction
in two different setting--normal lithosphere and weak lithosphere. Mid-plate
volcanism and its interaction with oceanic lithosphere is a process of
fundamental importance in understanding the structure and evolution of ocean
basins. Active source seismic studies such as this one will provide important
detailed information regarding the structure of the lithosphere beneath and
surrounding volcanic loads that is currently lacking. Dr. McNutt and her co-
workers are among the leaders in the study of mid-plate volcanism and
lithospheric structure, as well as multichannel seismics.
