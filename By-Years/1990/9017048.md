The research supported by this award is a collaborative effort at Arizona State
University, Dartmouth College, and the University of North Carolina. The three
astronomers from these institutions involved in this project have been leaders
in the discovery and investigation of large scale deviations from uniform
expansion in the motion of nearby galaxies. In this investigation they will
study the intrinsic properties of 500 elliptical galaxies to determine if their
peculiar velocities, with respect to the general expansion, can be related to
the distribution of visible matter in the regions under study.
