DMS-0206485 Tomasz Mrowka

Mrowka is engaged in number of projects centering around Floer homology. The
first is a book project with Kronheimer giving a detailed and general account of
the foundational aspects of Seiberg-Witten Floer homology using the Morse
complex. It is hoped that this will provide both a route for graduate students
into the field as well as be a jumping off point for more ambitious projects.
The second project also joint with Kronheimer is to use some of the tools
developed in the previous project to relate the Seiberg-Witten and Instanton
Floer homologies. A consequence of this would be the Property P conjecture. The
third project is to give a definition of Floer homology directly using infinite
dimensional cycles.

Mrowka will continue investigations into the study of mathematical models for
space-time. These investigations center around understanding properties of
solutions and spaces of solutions to the various equations of high energy
physics, primarily the Yang-Mills and Sieberg-Witten equations. The beauty of
these equations is that gross properties of the spaces of solutions reflect
subtle properties the space-time that they live on. One application of Mrowka's
previous work is to theoretical biology in particular the knotted properties of
DNA. The mathematical question of estimating the unknotting number give
estimates on the number of times topoisomerase needs to act on a given loop of
DNA.
