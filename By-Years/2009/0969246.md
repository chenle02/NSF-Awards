The PI will investigate the structure of Hilbert modules over C*-algebras, and
its bearing on the structure of the algebras themselves. Hilbert modules have
recently been shown to carry vastly more information than finitely generated
projective modules over C*-algebras, even for simple algebras. This project aims
to use this fact in studying several aspects of C*-algebra theory: the
classification of C*-dynamical systems by their K-theory, the reconciliation of
classical and dynamical covering dimension via a Hilbert module invariant of the
associated C*-algebras, and the pursuit of a tensorial absorption theorem for
nuclear simple separable C*-algebras which will provide a generalization of
Kirchberg?s absorption theorem for purely infinite simple C*-algebras. The over-
arching theme of the proposal is at the interface of dynamics (systems equipped
with a time evolution) and the very natural desire to classify mathematical
objects. We aim to use tools from functional analysis to reconcile and
interpolate between the properties of classical spaces (no time evolution),
periodic spaces (time evolution in which each point follows a finite cycle), and
fully dynamic spaces (arbitrary time evolution). Conversely, we will study how
the properties of dynamic spaces manifest themselves after translating these
spaces into families of operators (infinite-dimensional matrices, if you like),
and will work to determine when two such families are essentially the same.
