Operating procedures for chemical, nuclear, and petroleum processing systems
are important for safe, reliable, and efficient operation. Synthesizing high-
quality procedures is a demanding task that requires the ability to combine
knowledge of the goals of the processing system with knowledge of the
constraints on the operating range of the process equipment, on instrumentation,
and on human operations. The principal investigator proposes to create a
methodology for partially automating the synthesis of operating procedures. To
achieve this goal requires research along two separate, but parallel avenues.
Research is needed both to identify the important parameters and models for a
particular processing system and also to create a methodology for generating
operating procedures that deals with constraint formulation, constraint
propagation, and constraint satisfaction. The research will draw on prior work
in computer science and engineering design on planning and on constraint
propagation. The principal investigator will use an exothermic recycle reactor
system to test the methodology.
