The goal of this proposal is to organize a workshop on Resilience Research in
October 2015. Development of a national innovation strategy to advance a
research and development for critical infrastructure resilience involves
collaborative effort across the federal agencies, universities, and industry
owners and operators, as critical infrastructure resilience involves energy
production and distribution transportation, manufacturing and many other
sectors, that are key elements for national security and the economy. The
National Workshop on Resilience Research (NWRR) will gather leading researchers
from academic, government and private institutions to advance a strategy to
accelerate integrated efforts for developing near-ready-for-proof-of-concept
technologies and applications for critical infrastructure systems.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will include a poster session for NSF
Resilient Interdependent Processes and Systems (RIPS) program awardees. It will
provide a venue for CRISP/RIPS program awardees to interact with each other and
promote cross-fertilization of ideas. The workshop will also identify policy and
economic incentives that can overcome current barriers to widespread deployment
and development of technologies to address resiliency of infrastructure systems.
The workshop participants will gain valuable experience from the interactions
between industry, academic and federal agency participants.
