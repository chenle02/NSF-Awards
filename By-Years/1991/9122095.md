The goal of research on programming environments is to increase the
productivity of the software-development process by providing better tools for
creating, manipulating, and understanding programs. During the week of March
9-13,1992, a workshop on programming environments will be held at the recently
established International Conference and Research Center for Computer Science
(IBFI) at Dagstuhl Castle in Wadern, Germany. The workshop will bring together
about forty active researchers in the area. It will focus on new and recent
developments, with emphasis on the following topics: o Single-programmer
language-based environments o Generation of programming environments o Tool-
integration mechanisms o Debugging o Merging and restructuring of systems o
Projection and understanding of systems o Incremental computation The intention
of the workshop is to stimulate intellectual ferment among the participants. The
workshop's format will make it possible for participants to give more in-depth
presentations than is customary at conferences. Presentations that include
demonstrations of working systems or prototypes will be encouraged. This award
provides funds to cover the transatlantic airfare of the participants from the
United States.
