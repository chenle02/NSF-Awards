ABSTRACT

17 July 2009 Proposal Number: 0917754 Institution: Scripps Institute of
Oceanography PI: B. Appelgate Co-PI: T. Althouse

The proposal requests Shipboard Scientific Support items for the vessels
operated by Scripps Institute of Oceanography namely; the R/V REVELLE, MELVILLE,
NEW HORIZON, and SRPOUL. It includes: (1) an emergency fire and de-watering pump
for NEW HORIZON, (2) a marine sanitation device for SPROUL, (3) new RADAR?s for
REVELLE, and (4) and new shore-side forklift to support all of the vessels
during science mobilizations. All items requested will either enhance safety,
bring vessels into current regulatory compliance, or provide greatly improved
science support capabilities.

Broader Impacts: Scripps vessels support federally funded scientific research
throughout the world?s oceans and routinely expose graduate and undergraduate
students to seagoing oceanography. Scripps participates in a large number of
outreach programs including open house events, student tours, and hosting of
government officials, dignitaries, and science communities while in foreign
ports. All told, Scripps vessels are scheduled to complete over 420 NSF
sponsored days in 2009.
