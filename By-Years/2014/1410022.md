Quantum computation has taught us that, in general, quantum systems are
exponentially powerful. This is a double-edged sword: while making quantum
computers possible, it is also an enormous obstacle to analyzing and
understanding physical systems. Indeed, this is not just an abstract concern;
with the major push in condensed matter physics towards studying and creating
highly entangled states of matter, the computational complexity of these systems
has moved to the fore as a major issue, and this is the main focus of the
emerging area of Quantum Hamiltonian Complexity. Here is a list of three basic
questions in this area:&lt;br/&gt;1. Can "typical" states of ?naturally
occurring? quantum systems be described succinctly (i.e. polynomial rather than
exponential in the number of particles)?&lt;br/&gt;2. Does the exponential
complexity of general quantum systems persist at high temperature?&lt;br/&gt;3.
Is the scientific method sufficiently powerful to be applicable to general
quantum systems?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of these can be formulated as a
precise computational question -- the first is a natural generalization of a
question about the complexity class NP, the second about the celebrated PCP
theorem and the third about interactive proof systems. Over the last few years
the outline of remarkable positive answers to some of these questions has
emerged, and there are in place some of the basic techniques necessary to tackle
these questions. This project aims to pursue this line of
inquiry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is interdisciplinary at the deepest
level. It brings a computational lens to bear on some of the most basic issues
in condensed matter physics and in the philosophy of science. Conversely, it
extends the core concepts of computational complexity theory in important new
directions, at the same time drawing on deep insights from physics to make
progress on fundamental questions.
