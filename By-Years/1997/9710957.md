University of Washington The central objective of this research project is to
examine the relationship between differing regional geographies of cross-border
interdependency, their attendant patterns of transnational governance, and the
implications of both for older forms of national governance. The intent is to
focus on the question: does the emergence of quasi-autonomous transnational
regions represent the erosion of governance or just its political-geographic
reorganization? Using theories of regional agglomeration in part, a comparative
approach is used to determine how transformations of governance relate to the
economic geography of trade convergence, traded interdependencies and untraded
interdependencies in two emerging transnational regions, Transmanche (French-
English) and Cascadia (U.S.-Canada). The research will involve data analysis of
trade flows, in-depth interviews with administrators and planners, and a
questionnaire survey of businesses. The results will bring fieldwork results to
bear on questions of the 'end of the nation-state' and the impacts of
globalization.
