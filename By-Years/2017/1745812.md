The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to generate
technology that improves the accuracy of medical diagnostic tests and eases
restrictions on the collection of tissue from patients. If it can be widely
disseminated through commercialization, this technology will allow patients to
receive a more accurate diagnosis of diseases like cancer, with a more rapid
turnaround time and lower cost to the healthcare system. Moreover, secondary
biopsies or blood draws that are painful and expensive can be avoided. The
project has exceptional potential for commercialization due to the multi-billion
dollar market for diagnostic tests at present and due to clear pressing clinical
needs to fill in technological gaps that limit the accuracy of diagnostic tests
for cancer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The I-Corps project is focused on a new
generation of light-emitting nanoparticles that function as the critical means
to perform measurements in medical diagnostic tests. These new nanoparticles,
called quantum dots, provide the new ability to count individual molecules in
diseased tissue and in blood, which is a major leap forward in diagnostic
testing compared with standard tests that simply provide a qualitative outcome
of "high" or "low." Moreover, quantum dots allow the simultaneous interrogation
of numerous classes of molecules related to diseases, instead of having to
perform repeated tests. Importantly, this technology can be implemented on low-
cost instruments that are already widely available in medical diagnostics labs,
so there are few barriers preventing entry into the market. Outcomes have been
validated in a research laboratory setting, however they must be scaled for
commercialization and finely tuned to meet specific needs in medical diagnostics
settings.
