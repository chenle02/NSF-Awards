This project will undertake the design of a program to improve students'
abilities to think critically, use language, and solve problems using the
natural world as an experimental base. Since urban systems face extremely
complex problems, the science program is specifically aimed at these systems.
Cleveland and San Francisco will collaborate fully in the development effort.
Los Angeles, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, and Boston will provide input and
feedback, to insure that the program meets the needs of a number of urban
systems operating under a variety of state and local mandates. The project will
involve teacher development teams in the design of 24- 36 activity-based modules
for grades K-6. In choosing the natural phenomena to be explored, the project
will try to balance life, physical, and earth sciences, tying the experiential
base to the urban setting where appropriate. The new modules will be informed by
teacher review of existing materials; and will integrate science with the rest
of the elementary curriculum, particularly language arts and mathematics. Boston
College Center for the Study of Testing, Evaluation and Educational Policy will
serve as the outside evaluator. Delta Education, Inc. will publish the materials
as well as assist in the design and dissemination. Delta will invest
approximately $2 M in the project during the 4-year development stage, and
continue to provide marketing assistance and teacher development aid following
development.
