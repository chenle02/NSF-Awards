This award supports the research of Professor Gessel to work in enumerative
combinatorics related to lattice paths, permutations, and symmetric functions.
Many of these problems deal with methods for counting objects, which are in
general very difficult problems. The problem related to lattice paths involves
counting nonintersecting paths according to the number of left-hand and right
-hand turns, and finding a combinatorial interpretation to some generalizations
of the ballot numbers. The research is in the general area of combinatorics.
Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study how discrete
collections can be organized. The behavior of discrete systems is extremely
important to modern communications. For example, the design of large networks,
as in telephone systems, and the design of algorithms in computer science all
deal with discrete objects, and this makes use of combinatorial research.
