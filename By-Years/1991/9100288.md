Professor Kerry K. Karukstis and other members of the Chemistry Department of
Harvey Mudd College are being supported to conduct a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry. For the period 1991-93, eight or nine
undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in a
variety of research projects. Some of the projects involve theoretical studies
of molecular excited states, thermodynamics of liquid crystals, and
electrochemical studies of polymer thin films. Students will write a final
report on their work and participate in research-related and social events
planned by the faculty.
