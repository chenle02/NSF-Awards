9625004 Pines This is a Faculty Early Career Develop (CAREER) award. The project
involves integrating research and education to advance the technology of smart
materials and structures and techniques to remotely monitor damage in large
civil structures. The research focuses on the development of a smart civil
structure with embedded piezoelectric sensors for inferring structural damage.
The research will emphasize the integration of embedded sensors, actuators and
processors into load carrying members of large civil structures for the purpose
of remote damage detection. Throughout the course of the research, analytical
and experimental results will be incorporated into the Clark School of
Engineering interdisciplinary undergraduate and graduate curriculum which
includes courses on structural dynamics, smart structures, earthquake
engineering and nondestructive evaluation. The goal is to develop a parallel
approach that bridges the gap between theory and reality. Students will be
involved at all levels of the program, including analysis, design, construction
and the dissemination of results. ***
