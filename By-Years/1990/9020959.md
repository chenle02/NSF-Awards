The objective of this research is an experimental investigation of the
coalescence of raindrops with respect to drop size, ambient pressure temperature
and relativity, and droplet charge. These measurements will be obtained in the
laboratory where the latter variables will be controlled. The results should
contribute to the physics of natural precipitation, particularly clouds not
containing ice.
