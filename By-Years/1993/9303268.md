Phylogenetic relationships of the basidiomycete family Polyporaceae will be
investigated using DNA and amino acid sequence data. Sporocarps in the
Polyporaceae range from simple, resupinate forms, to complex, pileate-stipitate
forms. Hymenophores may be poroid, lamellate, toothed, etc. This study will
inform the interpretation of fungal morphological evolution by providing a
phylogenetic context. The principal focus is on: (a) the roles of morphological
elaboration, reduction, and convergence in sporocarp evolution, (b) patterns of
switching between hymenophore types. Evolution and homology of decay types and
mating systems will be similarly elucidated. Sampling of diverse genera, with
special attention on type species, will contrast traditional and modern concepts
of the Polyporaceae. Two sources of molecular data will be utilized:
mitochondrial small subunit ribosomal RNA genes and nuclear-encoded vacuolar
ATPase B-subunits. Emphasizing cladistic methods, phylogenetic analyses of the
two regions will permit independent corroboration of gene trees used to
interpret organismal phylogenies. Results from unconstrained phylogenetic
analyses will be compared with those obtained under user-defined topological
constraints, enabling a quantitative evaluation of competing taxonomic and
evolutionary hypotheses. %%% To date molecular phylogenetic studies of the fungi
(with 1.5 million species, the most speciose taxon after the insects) have been
quite limited, making this study an important one since a comprehensive
phylogenetic classification for the group is presently lacking. Some preliminary
data are available for the Polyporaceae, which are hymenomycetes (fungi that
bear their spores on an exposed hymenium). Polypores and other wood decay fungi
play a significant role in global carbon cycling and cause great losses in the
timber industry. The information derived from this research will be of practical
use in studies of wood biodegradation because it will clarify results of
homology and function in wood rot organisms.
