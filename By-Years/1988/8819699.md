This workshop will try to map out the potential for artificial neural networks
(ANNs) in the fields of robotics and systems control. Robotics and systems
control are among the most important possible applications of ANNs, for two
reasons. First, they are of enormous economic significance; higher levels of
factory automation are essential to higher levels of productivity in the
American economy, as well as such areas as military and space applications. The
largest potential applications of ANNs in these areas will not be possible for
many years, because a lot of very fundamental research will be needed first;
this workshop will try to map out what is needed. Second, the difficulties of
ANNs in controlling robots are similar to the difficulties faced by organic
brains in controlling movement to achieve goals over time; it is hoped that a
better understanding of the former will lead to a better understanding of the
latter. This workshop will attempt to bring together a number of scattered
research groups doing work which is important to these areas, and produce a
report on future directions which can guide NSF and stimulate good proposals in
this field.
