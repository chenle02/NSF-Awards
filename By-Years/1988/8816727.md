Cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) are a widely distributed group of bacteria
which carry out oxygen-evolving photosynthesis similar to that characteristic of
higher plants. The studies to be performed are directed at achieving a detailed
understanding at the molecular level of the structure and biosynthesis of the
photosynthetic apparatus in these organisms. The specific areas to be studies
are (a) the unusual light-harvesting proteins (biliproteins) of marine
unicellular cyanobacteria, a recently discovered group of important contributors
to primary productivity in the sea; (b) exploitation of these proteins for the
determination of energy transfer pathways within biliproteins; (c) continued
development of biliprotein-based reagents for multiparameter studies of cells
and molecules; (d) elucidation of the pathways of synthesis and attachment of
the bilin (tetrapyrrole) prosthetic groups that endow biliproteins with the
ability to absorb visible light; (d) the structural and functio use light-
energy transduction in practical ways. Specifically he proposes to study subunit
and bilines of phycoerythrins from marine cyanobacteria, to reconstruct
biliproteins from bilin and apobiliproteins, and to examine the role of N-mentyl
asparagine on phycobilisome function. One criticsm of the proposal is that there
is no discussion of how the results will add to our knowledge of biliprotein
function. Another is that often the experimental approach lacks detail and can
not be fully evaluated. Finally there is considerable concern from the reviewers
that the proposed methylation study that will consime a lot of research time,
may not lead to anything. In light of the excellent background, past
accomplishments and the need to keep this study going, the panel recommends
funding.
