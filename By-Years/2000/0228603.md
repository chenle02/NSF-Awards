0228603&lt;br/&gt;Papautsky&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to
develop a new breed of self-contained microelectrodes that can be used in the
environment to monitor a variety of constituents in contaminated soils and
sediments. These devices will consist of a microelectrode intimately connected
to a microelectronic signal processor to reduce noise and increase robustness.
These devices will ultimately include a transmitter to telemeter the information
to a conventional data storage device and will be powered by a miniature
battery. The goals of the proposed research are threefold: (1) develop the
fundamental science to microfabricate the integrtated microelectrodes, (2)
design, and fabricate, a microprocessor to process and amplify signals from the
microelectrodes and (3) demonstrate integrated microelectrode arrays for
environmental monitoring using proof-of-concept sensors. If successful, this
project will have benefit at the thousands of hazardous waste sites in the US
that require monitoring of the soils, sediments and ground waters for a variety
of constituents, including toxic or hazardous materials and environmental
parameters.
