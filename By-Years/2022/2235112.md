This award provides support for junior researchers to participate in the 7th
Coordinating Panel for Advanced Detectors (CPAD) Workshop to be held at Stony
Brook University in November, 2022. The main goal of the workshop is to explore
and evaluate detector research &amp; design opportunities, needs, and the
challenges ahead for Elementary Particle Physics (EPP) in the US within the
context of the Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel Plan. The Particle
Physics Project Prioritization Panel is a scientific advisory panel tasked with
recommending plans for U.S. involvement in particle physics research. The
workshop will also have topical discussions for instrumentation needs for the
upcoming Electron Ion Collider to be constructed at the Brookhaven National Lab
in the vicinity of Stony Brook. There will be a variety of synergistic topics
that concern both fields of physics, EPP and Nuclear Physics in a similar
matter. Involving junior researchers in this workshop will provide an
opportunity for them to learn about state-of-the art instrumentation and train
for future careers in STEM fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
