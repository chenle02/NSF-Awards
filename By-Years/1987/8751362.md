The focus of this project is building a mechanism for managing intelligent
tutoring discourse and on automating the process of transferring such knowledge
from teachers to the tutoring system. The first research area focuses on
problems of dialogue management for science education and implements a discourse
framework-a virtual machine-that enables tutoring feedback in the form of
examples, analogies, and simulations within interactive simulations. The virtual
machine is being implemented within simulations that allow a student to test
his/her hypothesis about domains such as physics and astronomy, specifically
statics dynamics, and celestial mechanics. The second component of this work is
automation-the process of transferring knowledge from experts, such as teachers,
psychologists, and curriculum developers, to the intelligent tutors. The project
seeks to build programming-free tools for representing tutoring strategies,
domain knowledge, and intervention tactics. These tools are designed to assist
teachers in visualizing their science knowledge in a form amenable to Artificial
Intelligence systems and in encoding this knowledge in the form of examples,
analogies, or remediation techniques.
