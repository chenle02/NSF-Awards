This research program is concerned with the theoretical and numerical study of
systems of nonlinear partial differntial equations which change type by losing
strict hyperbolicity. Specific efforts include the adaptation and implementation
of the emerging shock capturing numerical methods of high accuracy. This
involves the approximate solution of generalized Riemann problems for which
recent theoretical insights obtained by the PI will be used. Constitutive laws
leading to equations of mixed type will also be investigated. Results from this
research program will have applications in the areas of multiphase flows,
elastic solids and magneto- hydrodynamics.
