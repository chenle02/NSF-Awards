The energetics of dislocations moving with acceleration are studied which are
important for the understanding of micromechanisms underlying the dynamic
deformation of ductile materials under high strain rates. The Peierls- Nabarro
model has earlier been succesful for static deformations and is being extended
to dynamic transient motion. Issues of generation and motion of dislocations
near moving shock fronts and the motion of twins are addressed.
