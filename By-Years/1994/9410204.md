Abstract UCAR Cooperative Agreement Carlson, David Subject: TOGA COARE
International Project Office (ITCPO) This award to UCAR will support the
community-wide data management and workshop activities of the TOGA COARE
research project. The funds will be provided to the International TOGA COARE
Project Office, which had the responsibility for implementing TOGA COARE and now
has the responsibility for its data management and for organizing its workshops.
This increment of funding follows earlier ones in FY 1992 and FY 1993 and
reflects an interagency commitment to continue supporting TOGA COARE research.
This work is important because it enables UCAR to develop the data sets
necessary for NSF, NOAA and NASA researchers to perform their TOGA COARE studies
and to interact at PI workshops.
