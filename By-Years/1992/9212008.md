Coordinated arenes can serve as valuable synthons to a variety of mono-and
polycyclic natural products when used in conjunction with an appropriate
dihapto-coordination agent. In order to test and develop this hypothesis, the
research program will address three primary questions: i) what organic
transformations can be accomplished through such a technology that are difficult
to achieve by conventional methods, ii) to what extent can the stereochemistry
of such transformations be controlled by the transition metal, and iii) how can
the nature of the complexing agent be modified to achieve a) greater activation
of the aromatic substrate b) asymmetric induction, and c) a catalytic cycle for
various target reactions? %%% With this award, the Organic Synthesis Program
will support the research of Dr. W. Dean Harman at the University of Virginia.
The research will develop the reactions of coordinated arene transition metal
complexes to form substituted cyclic products which has the effect of shortening
certain synthetic sequences. This new synthetic methodology should benefit
research in biochemistry and medicine as well as in the chemical industry.
