With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program that is
co-funded by Chemistry, Professor Jeffrey Evanseck from Duquesne University and
colleagues Ralph Wheeler, Jeffry Madura, Ellen Gawalt and Tomislav Pintauer will
acquire a large memory computer cluster. The proposal is aimed at enhancing
research training and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a)
subphthalocyanine macrocycles, (b) synthesis and characterization of spin-
crossover complexes, (c) structure property relationships in transition metal
oxysterols complexes, (d) determination of structures of binary and ternary
combinations of cholesteryl esters and oxysterols, (e) synthesis and properties
of tris(pyrazolyl)ethane complexes, (f) enantioselective transformations
mediated by chiral sulfur ylides, and (g) macrobicyclic ligands and their
copper(II) complexes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Computer systems and clusters of
computers are used by chemists and biochemists to investigate reactions and the
properties of chemicals and materials using theoretical models and programs. The
computer calculations are used, often along with experimental data, to model and
better understand many types of complex chemical and biological phenomena. They
are also used to predict results and guide experiments. This resource will be
used in research and in course work by undergraduate students and faculty at
several institutions training them in computational chemistry methodology with a
modern computer system. Besides the home institution there will be participation
of students and faculty from Lincoln, Chatham, Slippery Rock, St. Francis, SUNY
New Platz, Cabrini, Florida Memorial, Prairie View A&amp;M, and Jackson State
University.
