This award supports the International Conference Turbulent Mixing and Beyond.
The goals of this conference are to expose the generic problem of Non-
Equilibrium Turbulent Processes to a wide scientific community, to promote the
development of new ideas in tackling the fundamental aspects of the problem, to
assist in application of novel approaches in a broad range of phenomena, where
these processes occur, and to have an impact on technology. The meeting will
consist of invited lectures by international experts on a broad range of
phenomena, where non-equilibrium turbulent processes occur, tutorials by leading
experts on hydrodynamic instabilities in fluids and plasmas, contributed talks
and poster presentations by participants, round tables and open discussions.
