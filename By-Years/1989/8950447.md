second year chemistry which includes organic chemistry and analytical chemistry.
The HPLC is used in Organic as a preparatory instrument for micro laboratory
techniques. In Analytical Chemistry HPLC is used to determine trace quantities
of pollutants in surface, ground and drinking water. Plans are being made to
implement this instrument in to introductory chemistry and also chemical
instrumentation. The introduction of HPLC gives students the opportunity to have
hands on experience with up-to-date technology. The institution is matching the
NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.
