The inexpensive computation of upper and lower bounds for functionals of large,
possibly sparse, symmetric matrices has received a lot of attention in the last
few years. This proposal is concerned with new methods and new applications, and
discusses extensions that allow the matrices to be nonsymmetric. The computation
of upper and lower bounds for matrix functionals is based on the evaluation of
pairs of Gauss-type quadrature rules. The outlined work proposes to study new
quadrature rules of Gauss-type with properties which make them suitable for
estimating matrix functional of nonsymmetric matrices. The measure associated
with these quadrature rules may be indefinite or complex valued. Applications of
these quadrature rules to the estimation of the norm of the error in the
approximate solutions determined by iterative methods for linear systems of
equations with nonsymmetric matrices will be pursued. Furthermore, applications
to the iterative solutions of nonlinear problems will also be studied.

An important aspect of scientific computations addresses the reliability of the
results. In particular, it is important to know the accuracy, measured by the
error, of a computed result. One class of problems ubiquitous in scientific
computing is the solution of large systems of algebraic equations. Since the
solution of these kinds are equations is so widespread, they represent a class
of problems for which knowledge of the numerical accuracy of the results is of
great importance. This project addresses the issue by developing theory for
computing the upper and lower bounds for certain measures of a system of
equations. One particular application is to get the upper and lower bounds on
the accuracy of approximate solutions of large systems of equations.
