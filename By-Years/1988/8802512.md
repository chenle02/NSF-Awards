This is an innovative experimental program of research to study fundamental
issues in the physics and chemistry of ultra-thin films (one or two atomic
layers). This study will implement atom beam scattering as a new technique to
investigate the structure and chemical bonding of the atomic layers to the
substrate. Materials being studied include metal films on silicon and metals.
Studies include geometry and chemical bonding in heteroepitaxy, strained
epitaxial films, kinetics of film growth, and electronic characterization of
films and interfaces. Low energy electron diffraction and helium ion beam
scattering will be used to characterize the structure of the films and
interfaces. The research is relevant to processing and properties of integrated
electronic circuits. Issues such as doping, Schottky barriers, and metallization
will benefit from the research.
