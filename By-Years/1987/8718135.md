This award is to support US participation in a joint US/Taiwan workshop on
multiple hazard mitigation, to be held in Taiwan in the spring of 1988. This
workshop will be held under the auspices of the cooperative science program
between the American Institute in Taiwan and the Coordination Council for North
American Affairs. Ten US scientists will be supported under this grant; costs of
supporting participation of scientists from Taiwan will be the responsibility of
the National Science Council of Taiwan. This workshop will explore the results
of Taiwan's ambitious five year hazard mitigation program and will define
opportunities for collaborative research. Specific disciplinary areas to be
addressed include earthquake engineering, flood mitigation, industrial hazard
mitigation, and geotechnical engineering.
