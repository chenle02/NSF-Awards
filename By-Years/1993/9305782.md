9305782 Yelon This research explores high performance rare earth/iron-based
magnets. Systematic changes in compositions are explored, band structure
calculations made, and neutron diffraction used to determine atomic site
preferences. A comprehensive study of site substitution in two types of magnetic
structures are examined, R2Fe17 and RFe12-xTMx, where R refers to the rare earth
elements and TM to the transition metals. The materials are synthesized, with
first and second transition row elements along with Al, Si, Ga and Ge with an
aim of optimizing average bond lengths. Properties are characterized by bulk
magnetic measurements and structure by X-ray and neutron diffraction. In
selected cases band calculations are carried out. %%% The ultimate goal is to
determine new compositions for these materials that display superior magnetic
properties for use in a variety of applications. ***
