0323281&lt;br/&gt;Bornhop&lt;br/&gt;The overall objective of this research is to
perform the fundamental studies of a novel optical reporter for further
definition of its interaction with cells and their internal organelles. The
multi-modal probes developed are lanthanide chelates and a peripheral
benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) ligand. These molecules will be used in-vitro for
the detection of specific pathological cells and to lend insights regarding
mitochondria function and its relationship to disease.
