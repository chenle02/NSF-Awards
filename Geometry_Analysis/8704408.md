Bun Wong will continue his research into compact complex manifolds with
negative tangent bundles. Most of the problems to be investigated involve either
the topology, the function theory or the algebraic geometry of such manifolds. A
major problem is to determine the homotopy type of these manifolds. Another
focus of attention will be an attempt to show that these global moduli spaces
are natural generalizations of Teichmuller spaces. He will also look at the
problem of showing that the Kahler structures with negative bisectional
curvature and positive Ricci tensor are exclusive to each other.
