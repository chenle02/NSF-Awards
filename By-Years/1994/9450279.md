9450279 Brazin The Exploratorium Teachers Institute proposes to develop, test,
and distribute three multicultural science and mathematics monographs for use in
middle and high school classrooms. After extensive classroom testing, the three
monographs will be revised and combined into one book for national
dissemination. These publications will (1) present science and mathematics
through tools and designs from a variety of world cultures, and (2) provide
related hands-on, investigatory activities for students. The philosophy and
format of the publications will be based on the successful Exploratorium Science
Snackbook. The initial publications will be self-published and distributed. A
revised product, based upon feedback from initial users, will be published
commercially. The proposed publications are designed to increase awareness of
multicultural issues for all students, while making science more relevant and
approachable to students of color.
