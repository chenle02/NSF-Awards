Transgene silencing is the unexpected lack of expression of a gene introduced
into an organism through recombinant engineering. Many lines of evidence have
led to the realization that gene silencing reflects a series of strategies that
protect the genetic information present in an organism from interference by
extraneous genetic information. Some of these strategies are related to well-
known defense mechanisms that provide protection against infectious organisms,
but others have not previously been recognized and their mechanisms are only
just now being investigated. These considerations are reflected in the goal of
this project, which is to identify genes involved in transgene silencing
mechanisms and to characterize their operation in normal development. In
addition to providing new insight to genetic control systems of transgene
expression, this understanding will lead to the strategic design of future
transgene constructs that will not be sensed by the recipient genome as being
alien and thus be expressed more reliably.&lt;br/&gt;A premise for the
experiments to be undertaken is that inactivation of genes that are responsible
for the silencing machinery will re-activate the silenced gene. Three different
sets of rice lines, in which a transgene is transcriptionally silenced, have
been developed and characterized that are eminently suitable for reactivation
studies. However, because of its rapid growth cycle and its fully-sequenced
genome, Arabidopsis will be used as a model plant to expedite selection of gene
targets for rice. Inactivation of the host silencing system(s) will be
accomplished primarily by an RNA interference (RNAi) approach in which double-
stranded RNA corresponding to the gene target is expressed. Initial gene targets
include rice methyltransferase, chromo domain-containing genes and histone
deacetylase genes. This is because methylation and alteration of chromatin
structure is known to be associated with many gene silencing events. Once a
target gene yields an interesting knock-out (silencing inactivation) phenotype
in Arabidopsis, existing databases will be searched for similar genes in rice.
RNAi-based knock-out constructs of these genes will be made and their ability to
restore transgene expression in the silenced rice lines investigated to evaluate
the role of the knocked-out gene as being one responsible for
silencing.&lt;br/&gt;
