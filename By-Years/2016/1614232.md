Partial differential equations are ideal for developing accurate mathematical
descriptions for many physical phenomena. In the last century, the study of
partial differential equations has grown into an interdisciplinary venture
spanning across the fields of mathematics, computation, physics, biology,
economics and more. This project seeks to develop new computational methods for
solving time-dependent partial differential equations. This research will be
conducted at the University of Auckland under the mentorship of Dr. John
Butcher, a noted expert on time-integration schemes. These new methods will
advance the state of computational science, allowing for more accurate physical
models that use fewer resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;General linear methods are
powerful extensions of classical time-integration techniques as they allow for
multistep, multistage methods. When implemented with adaptive step and order
changing strategies, general linear methods consistently outperform competing
Runge-Kutta and linear multistep schemes. This grant will fund research to
develop an adaptive time-stepping code for a new class of high-order time-
integrators which can expressed as general linear methods. These new schemes are
designed to leverage existing parallel computer architectures, and will
incorporate novel adaptive step and order changing
strategies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award under the East Asia and Pacific
Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student
and is jointly funded by NSF and the Royal Society of New Zealand.
