AST-0456581 &lt;br/&gt;Rosenberg, Jessica&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Jennifer
Rosenberg at the Smithsonian Institution Astrophysical Observatory, and co-PI
Eric Gawiser at Yale University, are awarded funds to organize and conduct the
third annual symposium of the NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral
Fellows (AAPFs). The symposium, to be held January 8-9, 2005 in San Diego,
California, will bring together fellows, faculty mentors, prospective AAPF
applicants, and interested members of the astronomical community. This will
allow the fellows to present their research and educational activities, and
better establish ways to enrich the fellowship experience itself. Additionally,
fellows will obtain opportunities to establish interdisciplinary programs with
colleagues during the symposium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The integration of
educational activities into the research efforts of the fellows provides for a
broad impact of the fellowship program. Many fellows participate in K-12/public
outreach activities, leading to enhancement of the public's interest in science.
The symposium will allow the fellows to share their ideas and experiences, not
only among themselves, but also with faculty mentors and others in attendance.
