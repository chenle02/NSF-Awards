The investigator and his colleagues focus on several fundamental computational
issues involved in the parallel implicit solution of optimization problems with
partial differential equation The goal of the research is to advance the state
of the art in four fundamental topics: (1) the formulation and analysis of
algorithms for large-scale optimization; (2) adaptive mesh generation for
partial differential equations; (3) multilevel partial differential equation
solvers; and (4) parallel computation. Although each of these topics can be
investigated in isolation, the exploitation of their interactions is crucial for
the creation of effective global algorithms. The investigators are members of a
Scientific Computation Group that offers a program of instruction and research
emphasizing the role of scientific computation in the formulation, modeling, and
solution of problems from diverse and changing areas. A major part of the
project involves the development of software and its dissemination within the
manufacturing, engineering, and scientific community. Software developed as part
of the project provides an effective method of technology transfer and extends
the scope and effectiveness of the existing codes PLTMG, MC, and SNOPT developed
by the investigators. Because partial differential equations conveniently
characterize the physical laws of many complex systems occurring in science and
engineering, they also lie at the heart of the mathematical models used to
simulate and predict the behavior of these systems. The need to optimize the
performance of such systems is the common feature of practical applications that
range over such diverse areas as the optimal design of the hull of an America's
Cup yacht, the cleanup of toxic waste sites, the construction of bioartificial
arteries in tissue engineering, and the management of stock portfolios and hedge
funds. Software developed in this project provides engineers and scientists with
instant access to state-of-the-art methods for the modeling and optimization of
complex systems involving partial differential equation constraints. The
resulting improvements in the efficiency, accuracy and robustness of these
models have a substantial impact in areas of manufacturing and engineering that
are vital to US global competitiveness.
