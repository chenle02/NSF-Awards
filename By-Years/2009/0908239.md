Krishtal&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0908239&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The project is dedicated to
creation, development, and&lt;br/&gt;application of a unified theory of matrix-
like representations&lt;br/&gt;for frames, fusion frames, and fuzzy fusion
frames; and causality&lt;br/&gt;theory and regular factorizations of
pseudodifferential&lt;br/&gt;operators. These topics touch upon a large variety
of areas of&lt;br/&gt;fundamental and applied analysis, including frame
theory,&lt;br/&gt;pseudodifferential operator theory, Banach modules
and&lt;br/&gt;representations of locally compact Abelian groups, non-
standard&lt;br/&gt;multiresolution analysis, and signal processing. The
problems&lt;br/&gt;studied in this project address interesting and
important&lt;br/&gt;questions regarding certain mathematical tools on which
modern&lt;br/&gt;signal processing is based. The project is also expected to
lead&lt;br/&gt;to new questions in more fundamental analysis, thus
promoting&lt;br/&gt;cross-fertilization of the fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The investigator and his colleagues develop a mathematical&lt;br/&gt;framework
aimed to address various problems posed by the deluge&lt;br/&gt;of data in the
modern world. Potential applications include&lt;br/&gt;image processing,
wireless communications, and others. &lt;br/&gt;Particular attention is given to
an application for proton&lt;br/&gt;computed tomography. Broader impact of the
proposed activities&lt;br/&gt;includes integration of research and education,
dissemination of&lt;br/&gt;knowledge, and enhancement of interdisciplinary
collaboration,&lt;br/&gt;both domestic and international. &lt;br/&gt;
