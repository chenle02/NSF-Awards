The study to be conducted by Walter K. Dodds is designed to explore the
ecological relationships in a macrophyte-grazer-epiphyte system. If epiphytes
decrease macrophyte growth rate, then grazing of those epiphytes can promote
macrophyte growth. The filamentous green alga Cladophora, its epiphytes, and
grazers of those epiphytes will be used as a model system. Field experiments
will investigate vertical structure in Cladophora mats via profiles of species
abundance, photosynthesis, oxygen, pH and flow in natural mats and mats of
artificial substrate (cotton). Laboratory experiments will demonstrate how
epiphyte cover affects Cladophora growth, how grazing levels affect epiphyte
growth, and if grazers have specific adaptations which suit them for life in
Cladophora mats. The host institution for this two- year postdoctoral research
fellowship is Montana State University.
