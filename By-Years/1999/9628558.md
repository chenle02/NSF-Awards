MARTIN DMS-9628558 The Department of Mathematics at Texas Tech University will
purchase computer equipment that will be dedicated to the support of research in
the mathematical sciences. The equipment will be used for several projects
including in particular: Computational Issues in Biomechanics, Computational
Problems in Complex Analysis and Applications, Numerical Methods for Vlasov
Kinetic Equations and Computational Issues in the Enzyme Activity in Cotton
Seedlings. The four projects listed are computationally and graphics intensive
and the equipment requested is essential for the success of these four projects.
The four projects cover a wide range of pure and applied mathematics ranging
from complex analysis to an application from agriculture, to a problem of
determining the stress in the tibia during exercise and to a classical problem
in transport theory. The common thread that connects these problems is the need
for accurate, fast computation and the ability to visualize the results with
detailed graphics.
