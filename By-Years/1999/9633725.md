9633725 Karson Most of the ocean crust forms by the eruption of lavas on the sea
floor and the injection of lava into existing crust. We can not observe this
process, but we can study the rocks affected by this process in ophiolites, in
drill holes into the ocean crust, and in faulted sections of ocean crust. The
Hess Deep, in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean, is the best example of the
last type of locality for fast spreading ocean ridges. Two separate teams of
scientists have examined this section of ocean crust, but they interpreted the
observations quite differently. The proponenets wish to examine a broad section
of the Hess Deep crust to determine if it forms by episodes of crustal growth
followed by periods of faulting.
