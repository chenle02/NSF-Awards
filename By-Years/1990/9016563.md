Using a unique data set of ten spring-summer seasons, a series of hypotheses
will be tested to define more precisely the seasonal and interannual variability
of snow melt, surface albedo and late-summer ice extent, its climatic
significance, and relationships with surface pressure fields and heights,
temperature anomalies and other atmospheric indices. This will constitute an
expansion of previous work under NSF support for 1) an initial study of snow
melt/climate interactions based on four seasons (1977, 1979, 1984, 1985) of data
and 2) the basic data set preparation only (no analysis) of six additional
seasons (1975, 1978, 1980, 1986-1988). The analysis will be performed using
digitized ten-season data sets of snow melt stages and parameterized surface
albedo constructed from Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) imagery
for May through mid-August and coincident sea ice and atmospheric data from
other sources. The timing and extent of snow melt atop the Arctic pack ice is an
important climatic forcing factor of northern high latitudes, with implications
for the long-term mass balance and stability of the ice and potential climatic
impacts in other parts of the Northern Hemisphere. It may also serve as an
indicator of climatic change forced by increasing greenhouse gas concentrations.
