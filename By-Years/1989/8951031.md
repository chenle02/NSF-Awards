The aim of the project is to significantly improve the teaching of courses in
construction materials and structural engineering analysis and design by
utilizing modern testing and data processing equipment. Specifically, a MTS 600
kip stationary universal testing machine and two DEC Vax Station 200
workstations will be acquired. The equipment will permit the testing of modern
high strength construction materials and can accommodate large- scale
experiments on beams, columns and slabs to demonstrate physical concepts
discussed in the classroom. The workstations will be used in conjunction with
the testing machine to allow the students to compare effects of modelling
assumptions in their theoretical analyses with results observed from experiments
conducted simultaneously in the laboratory. Students planning to work in
structural design or construction must obtain an understanding of the strength
and behavior of the materials and structures which they will deal with in their
professional lives so that they can gauge the importance of their analytical
modelling decisions.
