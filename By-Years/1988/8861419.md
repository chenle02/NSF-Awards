The evolution of Very Large Scale Integrated Circuit technology demands
innovative and fast submicron lithography which could replicate more densely
packed integrated circuits at a high throughput. The proposed Hypocycloidal
Pinch (HCP) light source is considered to be an intense x-ray source suitable
for submicron and high throughput lithography. This device has a novel geometry
which utilizes the plasma dynamics hyocycloidally pinched into the radial
direction and eventually resulting a very stable, high energy, and highly dense
plasma in its axial center. The emission spectra from this highly compressed and
stable plasma composes mainly of a waveband of intense soft x-ray. The size of
pinched plasma is so small in diameter that the penumbra effect can be also
minimized in the photolithography. This stable and highly compressed plasma
guarantees the reproducibility of the soft x-ray emission and its intense
emission ensures the fast throughput. The proposed HCP soft x-ray light source
is an inexpensive system, so that it is ideal for the small business entities
and university laboratories.
