A video sequence is a rich multimodal information source, including speech,
text, audio (non-speech portion), color patterns and shapes of imaged objects
(reflected in individual frames), and motion of these objects (revealed by
changes between frames). Although the human being can quickly interpret the
embedded semantic content from the information carried by different modalities,
computer understanding of a video sequence is still in a primitive stage. The
aim of this project is to develop new theory and techniques for scene
segmentation and classification in a video sequence, which is key to video
understanding. Research in this arena has in the past several years focused on
the use of text, speech and image information. The proposed research explores
the use of motion and audio characteristics, which will provide important
complimentary information. New results are anticipated both in the general
theory of feature analysis and classification, and in practical techniques for
video understanding and scene classification. These new developments will have
direct applications in information indexing and retrieval in multimedia
databases, spotting and tracking of special events in surveillance video, video
editing and movie stratification, etc.
