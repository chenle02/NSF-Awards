This research project, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
Program and the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities, addresses the
question of surface segregation of polymer segments at polymer surfaces.
Professor Gardella and his research group at SUNY-Buffalo use methods of surface
analysis including secondary ion massspectrometry and X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy to probe the composition of various polymer surfaces. This
collaborative multidisciplinary project combines the efforts of synthetic
polymer scientists who will make selected siloxane polymers with this group's
expertise in the application of a variety of surface characterization methods to
the study of these materials. The kinetics of diffusion of the components of
siloxane polymer monolayer films through overlayer polymers will be determined
using this array of methods. Segment length and molecular weight distribution
for a range of siloxane copolymers will be examined as a function of polymer
architecture and preparation conditions. The determination of structure and
reactivity at polymer surfaces and interfaces is the overall goal of this work.
The connection between the bulk microstructure of copolymer systems and the
surface composition is a little explored area of polymer surface chemistry. This
collaborative multidisciplinary research project uses state of the art surface
analytical methods of this group to probe the segregation of polymer segments at
copolymer interfaces that will be prepared by collaborators with synthetic
polymer expertise, and addresses the effects of these compositional changes on
the surface properties of these materials. This information is vital to the
design of new polymer systems with useful surface properties.
