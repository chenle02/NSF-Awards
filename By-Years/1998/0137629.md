This project proposes to evaluate the utility of retroviruses for the
transgenesis of invertebrates. Transgenesis is a powerful technique that allows
the manipulation of an organism's genome and experimental access to its genetic
function. Despite the fact that among multi?cellular organisms, invertebrates
dominate both in terms of biomass and species diversity, most transgenesis
studies have been performed in vertebrates due to their possible relevance to
human health. The primary challenge in transgenesis is the introduction of
genetic material into the cells of an organism. To this end, vectors have been
constructed from retroviruses, parasitic microorganisms that permanently
(heritably) insert their genetic material into the chromosomes of host cells.
This study will determine whether retroviral vectors will function in a diverse
group of invertebrate organisms ranging from sponges to insects via a systemic
analysis beginning with virus entry and culminating in gene expression in host
cells.

Even though invertebrates overwhelmingly contribute to the Earth's biomass and
function as important model organisms for development, evolution, parasite?host
relationships, and environmental changes, their genetics as a whole has been
grossly understudied. This study will examine the utility of retroviral vectors
in invertebrate systems leading to a better understanding of these vectors and
the development of generic transgenesis vectors. The routine transgenesis of
invertebrates will permit critical functional genetic studies of invertebrate
organisms of vast biological, economic, and environmental importance.
