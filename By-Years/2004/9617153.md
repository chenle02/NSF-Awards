29617153 Cheng The goals of the proposed research are to develop technologies in
the fields of epitaxial growth of strained quantum wire (QWR) structures by
molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), multi-axial strain engineering, and computer
modeling of low dimensional strained structures based on efficient band-
structure models to make possible the fabrication of wavelength stable
semiconductor lasers for optical fiber communication and information
applications. Specifically, we plan to fabricate wavelength stable 1.55
(mGaxInl-xAs/InP and 0.98 (m GaxInl-xAsyP1-y/GaAs lasers which employ strained
QWR active regions formed in situ by the strain induced lateral-layer ordering
(SILO) process during MBE growth. The stable wavelength results from a unique
multi-axial strain generated in the QWR region by the SILO process. It is
expected that by using this multi-axial strain technique within a QWR structure,
new quantum and optical effects will be observed which will in turn lead to
novel devices with new functions and/or improved performance. It is our vision
that the completion of this research should lead to 1) new insight into
innovative growth methods, 2) knowledge and control of multi-axial strain
engineering, 3) an understanding of new physical effects in strained quantum
wire structures and devices, 4) the development of new efficient modeling
techniques, and 5) the physical realization of novel strained quantum wire
lasers and devices with improved performance characteristics. ***
