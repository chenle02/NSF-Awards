Professor Hawkins is continuing his study of the origins of the theory of the
structure and representation of semisimple Lie algebras. This theory is an
important component of contemporary mathematics, with many applications to other
areas of mathematics and physics. A study of its historical development is of
additional historical interest, however, because the historical roots of the
theory are entwined with many strands of 19th and early 20th century
mathematics, involving the leading mathematical schools of the period. By
considering together and in some detail the complex web of mathematicians and
mathematical ideas that combined to produce the theory, a more realistic
portrait of the development of mathematics should emerge. That is, one that does
justice to the fact that mathematics grows in large part through the cross
fertilization of diverse mathematical ideas, theories and perspectives
originating from many sources and that the significance of a mathematical
problem or theory often changes with time and circumstances. It also provides a
broad-based case study of the growth of mathematical knowledge that should
benefit philosophers of mathematics who utilize history in their philosophical
studies of the nature of mathematics.
