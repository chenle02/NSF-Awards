The PIs propose to perform large-eddy simulations of the scalar and vector
meteorological fields for an atmospheric surface layer extending down to the
surface through the canopy layer of tall vegetation such as a forest. The PI has
completed and reported a pilot study of such a simulation. The existing code,
which has run on a Cray Y-MP, will be the starting point for this project. The
model equations solve a time-dependent, 3-dimensional flow field with account
taken for the drag of foliage elements and for heat exchange between the air and
vegetation. The code will be further developed for optimal simulation of the
meteorology of the forest, and output will be tested against published field
observations, both in terms of statistical properties and the appearance of
organized structures such as ejection/sweep motions and resultant scalar ramps
and other spatial patterns. Computed flow fields will be examined in an attempt
to link large-scale vorticular structures to signatures observed in time traces
at fixed points. Simulations will be performed to determine the influence of
forest heterogeneity, such as edge or forest clearing/gap effects on the
calculated flow and scalar fields.
