Abstract &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a five-year renewal award to the
Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center (BDSC) at Indiana University. Dr. Kathleen
Matthews in the Department of Biology is the PI and CoPIs include Drs. Kevin
Cook and Thomas Kaufman. The BDSC is an internationally-recognized stock center
that collects, maintains and distributes genetic stocks of the fly Drosophila
melanogaster. It supports a large and active research community investigating
fundamental biological processes through the use of the sophisticated genetic
tools developed in this popular model organism. Its current user base includes
more than 2,400 research groups and 35 teaching units in 56 countries. 61% of
Center use comes from U.S. scientists and 98% of use comes from academic
researchers. BDSC provides a comprehensive selection of strains supporting the
full spectrum of Drosophila research. The collection consists of over 20,000
different genetic strains containing over 95,000 defined genetic elements
including mutations, chromosomal aberrations and transposon insertions as well
as tools for gene misexpression, site-specific recombination and transgenesis.
BDSC will continue to maintain a website which will provide information
concerning stocks, their experimental uses, ordering and account information,
and regulatory issues. Information about genetic components of Bloomington
stocks is fully integrated into FlyBase, the primary genetic and genomics
database for Drosophila workers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drosophila strains from
Bloomington have been key components in experiments in gene regulation, cell
biology, developmental biology, neurobiology, behavioral biology, population
biology, ecology and evolution and will continue to have a broad impact in many
fields of biological endeavor. The Center will assure that the stocks are used
effectively by making BDSC information available through databases and websites
