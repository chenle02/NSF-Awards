The Scholarships in Mathematics and Computer Science (SIMACS) program is
awarding scholarships to qualified students majoring in the relevant
disciplines. The scholarships are increasing the number of women enrolled in
computing science and mathematics degree programs. Selection of the scholars is
based &lt;br/&gt;leadership and school and/or community involvement in addition
to academic ability. Bi-weekly&lt;br/&gt;group meetings of scholars and faculty
mentors, as well as individual meetings scheduled in the
alternate&lt;br/&gt;weeks serve to ease the transition from high school to
college and from junior college to the four year institution.
