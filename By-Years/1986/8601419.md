This research project will evaluate the effectiveness of a new in situ
geotechnical testing procedure for determining cyclic and dynamic soil
properties to the accuracy and level of detail required for effective use of the
costly, potentially powerful analysis method used for advanced stages of
earthquake resistant design. With the procedure, cyclic loads are to be applied
in situ, disturbances minimized, and required information inferred by
descriptive soil-probe interaction analysis.
