Dr. Joseph Felsenstein, at the University of Washington, is developing
statistical theory and computer programs for analyzing data important to
understanding the evolution of genes and species. The statistical and
computational methods allow phylogenies (evolutionary trees) to be estimated for
specific DNA sequences that comprise genes. The phylogenies can be used to
estimate parameters such as population size that are important in understanding
the process of evolution and the evolutionary histories of species themselves.
Dr. Felsenstein will update and distribute a package of computer programs called
PHYLIP to scientists concerned with the process and history of evolution.
