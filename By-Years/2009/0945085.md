This Small Businesses Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to
synthesize ultra-long carbon nanotubes (CNT) and spin them into the yarns to
achieve breakthrough properties of CNT yarns. The approach is to develop a base
flow chemical vapor deposition (CVD) reactor, new porous substrates patterned
using laser drilling and nano-imprint lithography, and separate gas flows to
keep the catalyst alive. This technology will allow control of nanotube
morphology which is not achievable using current semi-conductor processing
technologies.

The broader/commercial impacts of this project will be the potential to break
the length record of long and aligned single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNT). Long
CNT reduces the number of end junctions and the twist angle in yarns. This will
make it possible to develop ultra-strong, lightweight and electrically
conductive yarns which may have commercial applications in aerospace, apparel,
composite and various segments of the medical industry.
