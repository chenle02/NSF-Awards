The goal of this research is to design and develop new techniques of signal
analysis and morphological analysis applied to intracardiac leads. Over the past
two years, six new computationally efficient detection schemes have been
designed in the laboratory and feasibility has been established by preliminary
studies in short passages. Further work is necessary to test the robustness of
the detection schemes in the presence of normal (physiologic) acceleration of
heart rate. In addition, morphological operators (a non-linear method of
analysis of waveforms) will be applied to address the problem of subtle waveform
changes caused by the introduction or removal of pharmaceutic agents. Another
new approach, time-frequency analysis, will also be examined to assess its
performance versus standard time-domain methods. In all cases, the goal is to
increase specificity of detection without loss of sensitivity.
