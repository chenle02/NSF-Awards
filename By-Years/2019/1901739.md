This award provides funding for US participation in the conference "Nonlinear
Partial Differential Equations and Applications" that will be held at the
University of Michigan - Ann Arbor on July 9-12, 2019.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The
conference focuses on recent developments in Analysis, especially in the topics
of hyperbolic conservation laws, mathematical general relativity, compressible
and incompressible fluids, boundary dispersive phenomena, fluid dynamics and
kinetic theory. A number of distinguished mathematicians have agreed to attend
and speak at this conference. This award gives early career researchers, members
of underrepresented groups, researchers not funded by NSF an opportunity to
attend and participate in this conference. The organizing committee will strive
to make this funding opportunity known to target groups through a number of
different activities. More information will be made available at:

has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
