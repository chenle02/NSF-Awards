&lt;br/&gt;The proposal requests partial support for young researchers and
students to participate in&lt;br/&gt;2008 MobiSys Conference in Breckenridge,
Colorado. The NSF support will provide&lt;br/&gt;opportunities for up to twenty
young participants to interact with established researchers.&lt;br/&gt;The focus
of the conference is on the design, implementation, usage, and evaluation
of&lt;br/&gt;mobile computing and wireless systems, applications, and
services.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the proposal is fostering
an environment of technical discussions&lt;br/&gt;and debates among the
communities of mobile computing and wireless systems. In&lt;br/&gt;addition the
conference is set out to encourage participation by young scientists
and&lt;br/&gt;researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
