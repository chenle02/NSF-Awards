Professor Michael A. Walters and other members of the Chemistry Department at
Dartmouth College are being supported to continue a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry. For the period 1991-93, eight
undergraduate students will spend eleven weeks each summer actively engaged in a
variety of research projects. Some of the projects involve mechanisms of organic
reactions, determination of lead concentration in the environment, and model
complexes for nickel enzymes. Students will write a journal-style report and
give an oral presentation on their results.
