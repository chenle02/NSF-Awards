9406667 Grodzicker Abstract The seventh annual "Mouse Molecular Genetics"
meeting is scheduled to be held at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, August 31st
- September 4th. The emphasis of this meeting has been and will continue to be,
the study of the mouse as an organism rather than simple in vitro tissue culture
approaches. Topics to be discussed include genetic approaches, the mechanisms of
embryonic patterning, the role of cell signaling in development, the regulation
of embryonic, neural and organ development, and cell lineage. %%% The meeting
will include students, postdoctoral fellows, and established investigators in a
setting conducive to interactions between the various levels of expertise. The
timely exchange of results, strategies and technological developments in this
rapidly moving field is central to its progress. ***
