9619579 Pollack This is the first-year of a three continuing award. Research on
planning within AI has led to the development of computational techniques for
generating a plan to achieve a specified goal from a specified initial state,
given definitions of the available actions. Until recently, however, much of
this research has been governed by a number of simplifying assumptions, notably
that there is no indeterminacy either in the planning agent's knowledge, in the
effects of its actions, or in the notion of goal satisfaction, and that there
are no changes either in the goals presented to the agent or in its environment.
This award supports research aimed at relaxing the latter assumption.
Specifically, the research investigates the issues involved in extending
planning technology to a dynamic setting, in which the agent's goals and
environment are both subject to change. A study is being made of both the
theoretical and practical issues presented by situations that call for
integrated generation, maintenance, and execution of plans for multiple,
changing goals. The project addresses these issues from two complementary points
of view. The first is designing and implementing a dynamic planning system that
is flexible enough to allow for the experimental investigation of the
consequences of adopting different reasoning strategies in different dynamic
planning environments. Secondly, but in parallel, a formal analysis is being
carried out of the dynamic planning problem, with a special emphasis on
providing a clean semantic analysis of the implemented system. The aim of the
project is more flexible and realistic planning models and systems.
