This is a SBIR Phase I project in the topic area of biological instrumentation.
Ansoft Corporation will test the feasibility of applying a sweeping electric
field to electrophoretic separation of large DNA molecules. This technology
tries to circumvent a major weakness in the existing electrophoretic separation
methods for large DNA molecules. If successful, such technology will help
advances in genome research.
