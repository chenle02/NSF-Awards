This program addresses the need for development of thin ceramic membranes for
achieving reliable oxygen separation at elevated temperatures. Technical effort
will be directed towards development of ambient temperature electrolytic
technique for the preparation of thin film ceramic mixed ionic and electronic
conductors (MIEC) for use as oxygen separation membranes. These membranes will
be based on perovskites of compositions RE1-xAxCo 1-yByO3-a (where the rare
earth metal (RE) will be selected from La, Nd, Sm, Gd, Dy, Er, Yb; A from Ba,
Sr, and Ca and B from Fe, Ni, Ag and Cu. This will be performed by initially
preparing a tape cast conductive cermet of carbon and yttria stabilized zirconia
(YSZ) by mixing graphite and YSZ powder followed by sintering the mixture under
an inert atmosphere such as argon or nitrogen. This structure will serve two
purposes: first it will provide a conductive substrate onto which
electrodeposition of pervskite films can be performed, and secondly by taking
the cermet and electrodeposited film up to 700-900 degrees celsius under air the
graphite will burn out leaving a highly porous YSZ structure onto which the
pervskite film is supported. The performance characteristics of MIEC membranes
supported on porous YSZ for separation of atmospheric oxygen at elevated
temperatures will be determined.//
