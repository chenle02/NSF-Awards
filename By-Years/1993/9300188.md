This is a study of the heterogeneous oxidation of alkenes on metal surfaces,
specifically on surfaces of silver, platinum, and palladium. A variety of
ultrahigh-vacuum methods are used, including temperature-programmed reaction
techniques, vibrational spectroscopy, and photoelectron spectroscopy;
synchrotron radiation techniques are used in selected cases to determine
adsorbate geometries. Reaction intermediates are identified and isolated if
possible, and rate constants for the elementary reaction steps are determined.
Both selective oxidation and combustion processes are studied. Although this is
a fundamental study not directed at any specific applications, the systems under
investigation are used in a number of important industrial processes as well as
in pollution control systems, including automotive catalytic converters. The new
information generated here could influence the design of such systems.
