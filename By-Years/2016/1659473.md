The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory will continue its long-running summer
REU (Research Experiences for Undergraduates) program. In addition to a 10-week
summer research internship working with scientists at the Harvard/Smithsonian
Center for Astrophysics (CfA), students will engage in numerous professional
development activities, including computer tutorials, research-training
seminars, and directed meetings with astrophysicists at all career stages.
Students will also attend group discussions on the ethical conduct of research,
graduate school life, admissions, available fellowships, and career
opportunities after graduation. Since 1994, over half of the interns have been
female, and a small but increasing number from underrepresented groups. During
this renewed program greater emphasis will be placed on recruiting students from
underrepresented groups as well as from colleges with limited resources for
astrophysical research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each summer, ten students will
spend ten weeks conducting leading-edge research with their mentors at CfA.
Scientists at the CfA are involved in virtually every area of astrophysics and
have access to a large number of modern scientific instruments, so students have
a broad range of projects to choose from. The student research experience will
be completed by a trip to the winter AAS meeting, where each intern will present
a poster.
