This SBIR Phase I project will develop a method to detect Cryptosporidium
oocysts at a level of 100 oocysts/L or lower, and to differentiate between
viable and non-viable cysts. The team will use a prototype of a capillary-based
immunosensor (AEGIS 1000 instrument) coupled with heat and lysis treatment to
detect Cryptosporidium in water.

The broader/commercial impact of the project will be the commercialization of
the prototype of capillary-based immunosensor, which has the potential to extend
its application in the water industry for live waterborne pathogen detection.
This will allow water utilities to promptly respond to and correct a microbial
contamination event.
