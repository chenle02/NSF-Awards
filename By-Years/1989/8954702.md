This conference for urban science educators will bring together science leaders
in cities across the country to discuss problems and issues related to their
elementary science programs and to share solutions and strategies for successful
programs. A working team consisting of a science supervisor, a representative
elementary teacher, and a principal from each of 20 selected cities will attend.
The intent is to begin an on-going dialogue that will continue between these
sites and continue to influence new cities. The focus of the conference will be
on concepts, pedagogy, and assessment--what concepts should be taught; what
pedagogy works with urban children; what are good assessment strategies and how
can they trigger changes in teacher behavior; and what training and professional
development efforts work and should be implemented.
