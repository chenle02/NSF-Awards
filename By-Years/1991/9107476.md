In this project the principal investigators will work separately and jointly on
a number of interesting problems in Fourier Analysis. Among the specific topics
to be considered are the following: rearrangements of orthogonal systems of
functions, the metrical properties of Besicovitch sets in higher dimensions and
their relationship to the Bochner-Riesz summability of Fourier series, and the
distributional properties of Dirichlet sums. Each of these topics has a long and
venerable history in classical analysis, and the principal investigators are in
the forefront of mathematicians working on improving our understanding of
Fourier series. Fourier series arise in a host of pure and applied contexts, and
it is not an exaggeration to say that their study has provided much of the
motivation for twentieth-century analysis. The principal investigators in this
project are two of the greatest analysts in the world today, and they propose to
study some challenging questions regarding the properties of Fourier series and
the functions defined by them.
