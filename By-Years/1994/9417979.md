9417979 Nabelek This award will support a comprehensive geochemical and
petrologic study of the generation of peraluminous leucogranites with focus on
the Precambrian terrane in the Black Hills, South Dakota. Because petrological
and geochemical relationships in the area are similar to other peraluminous
leucogranite suires worldwide, the results from the study will result in a
better understanding of perlauminous granite generation in general. The
analytical work will include SEM and X-ray image analysis of the distribution of
accessory phases, analysis of whole rocks and mineral separates for major and
trace elements, analysis of minerals by electron microprobe, oxygen isotope
analyses of whole rocks and minerals and possibly ICP-MS analysis of fluid
inclusions. The data will be interpreted in view of published experimental
studies of granite generation and theory of trace elements and isotopic behavior
during crustal melting.
