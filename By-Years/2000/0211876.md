Todd Martinez is supported by the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry
Program to continue development and application of ab initio molecular dynamics,
specifically the multiple spawning method. Methodological improvements include
addition of tunneling effects, extension to larger molecules, and expansion to
coupled cluster electronic structure theory. Specific application areas include
the photodynamics and isomerization of butadiene, hexatriene, and stilbene, for
direct comparison to ultrafast experiments.

The most fundamental and ubiquitous process in organic photochemistry is
photoinduced isomerization of molecules. This research can provide the detailed
understanding of the electronic mechanism of this process that will be necessary
in designing molecular optoelectronic devices.
