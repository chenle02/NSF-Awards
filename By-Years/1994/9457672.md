This NSF Young Investigator Award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and
Organometallic Program will support research on transition metal compounds with
heteroatoms by Dr. John F. Hartwig of the Chemistry Department, Yale University.
The goal of the research is to bring the catalytic effectiveness and stability
of organometallic compounds to new areas of chemistry. Organometallic compounds
contain metal-carbon bonds; here new species which also contain metal-boron
bonds will be synthesized and studied for their potential as catalysts and as
starting materials for new materials. Tungsten, niobium, iron, ruthenium,
iridium and gallium compounds will be prepred and emphasis will be placed on
catalysis of reactions of alkenes. In addition, catalytic metal-mediated
coupling of carbon and nitrogen and of carbon and oxygen will be studied. Work
on metal-nitrogen systems will also involve use of organometallic compounds with
peptides and DNA in which photolytic cleavage of the metal-nitrogen bond will
aid in the identification of intramolecular protein folding processes and other
protein-protein or protein-DNA associations.
