Straus Under the direction of Dr. Lawrence Straus, Mr. Thomas Berger will
collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will study a large series of
materials excavated from archaeological sites in Israel, Jordan and Syria. All
date to the Natufian period which immediately precedes the emergence of settled
agricultural societies in the Near East. In addition to architecture, site
ecology and chronological placement, he will focus on the stone tools and
chipping waste which was recovered in abundance at all localities. He will
attempt to locate the sources of the stone raw material and to reconstruct the
processes used to manufacture finished tools. He will also examine how these
changed through time. On this basis he will gain insight into the social and
economic organization of the Natufians and determine how the moved over and
utilized their landscape. The Neolithic Revolution, marked by the domestication
of plants and animals, constitutes one of the major turning points in human
prehistory. It set the base for complex societies and the emergence of social
hierarchies. Archaeologists have come to realize that one must intensively
examine the period which immediate precedes the Neolithic Revolution to gain
insight into its cause and this is the goal of Mr. Berger's research. The
project will produce data of interest to many archaeologists and assist in the
training of a promising young scientist.
