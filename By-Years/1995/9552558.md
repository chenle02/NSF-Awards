9552558 Blank ABSTRACT: Scholastic Productions is producing thirteen additional
episodes for the third season of the fully animated, half-hour television
series, "The Magic School Bus." The series, which is targeted at 6-9 year olds,
is designed to motivate children's interest in science, to introduce science
concepts and ideas, and to inspire positive attitudes towards science and
education in students and teachers. The series is unique to science educational
television because it breaks the science gender barrier, showcases both
education and science, and, through the use of animation which enables the
series to transport children to places they literally could not go, presents
content in a unique way. Season III topics include: spiders, the Arctic, light,
color, the moon, structures, and sound. Outreach activities will include and
expand upon those offered for Seasons I and II. During Season III, special
emphasis will be placed on reaching families. The project also will use America
On-line to promote the series and to communicate the value in and the methods
for encouraging children's interest in science. The same basic administrative,
content, and production staff will continue with the project. Management and
editorial control will be the responsibility of Jane Startz, Executive Vice
President of Scholastic Productions. Cheryl Gotthelf, Executive Director of
Special Projects for Scholastic Productions will oversee series distribution and
utilization, print, research, public relations, promotion, and community and
museum outreach. Science content will continue to be supervised by Michael
Templeton with the assistance of an Associate Science Content Director, Fran
Nankin. Kristin Martin will remain in charge of series production.
