The Antarctic Peninsula and West Antarctica are focus areas for climate change.
With up to several meters of sea level rise potentially resulting from melting
of this region in the coming decades to centuries, the climate trajectory of
this region is clearly of global relevance. If surface, or ocean basal melting
becomes a significant component of the surface mass balance, it could contribute
to the weakening of fringing ice shelves with a resulting marked acceleration of
currently grounded ice stream discharging into the Southern Ocean. Thus, better
understanding of the climate warming in West Antarctica has strong scientific
and societal justification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will combine
existing temperature records from manned and automatic weather stations,
satellite data, ERA interim reanalysis, and the perspective provided by recent
(~200) yr ice core (borehole) data reconstructed into the WRF model to yield
high resolution (10km) surface temperature history throughout the West Antarctic
Ice sheet (WAIS). This will help resolve recent disagreement on the extent of
warming in the WAIS region. Additional comparisons of the climate
reconstructions with and without the influences of satellite records on the
reconstructions will also be investigated.
