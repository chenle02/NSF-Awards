Abstract ATM-9226833 Bradley, Raymond S. University of Massachusetts Title:
Patterns of Organized Climatic Variability To gain insight into the possible
causes and mechanisms of climate variability, this project will identify the
timescales, temporal evolution, and spatial patterns of significant oscillatory
and episodic large-scale climatic variability recorded in proxy records of
climate spanning the last 500-1000 years. The project will specifically address
questions related to long-term changes in the tropical and extra-tropical
patterns of interannual variability that may be related to the El Nino/Southern
Oscillation (ENSO) and focus on the patterns of organized interdecadal
variability and its possible connections with lower-frequency ENSO variability,
and postulated century-scale climate oscillations (particularly in the North
Atlantic and surrounding continental regions) that may be connected with the
North Atlantic thermohaline circulation. Advanced statistical tools will be
applied to proxy data networks, combining dendroclimatic, coral, historical, ice
core and other climate proxy reconstructions. Attempts will be made to separate
out distinct indicators where possible (e.g. surface temperature and
precipitation) and to ensure proper calibration of the climatic variability
evident in proxy indicators. Similar statistical analyses will be made of the
climatic field output of several long general circulation model integrations.
