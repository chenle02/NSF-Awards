This award provides funding for the fourth edition of the Conference on Modeling
High Frequency Data to be held Steven Institute of Technology, NJ on August
16-19,2012. The conference is a joint effort between Stevens Institute of
Technology (Ionut Florescu), University of Texas at El Paso (Maria C. Mariani),
Boston University (H. Eugene Stanley), and Purdue University (Frederi Viens).
The purpose of the conference is to improve the models used to analyze data
sampled with high frequency. Tools available from a variety of areas such as
statistics, stochastic processes, statistical mechanics, clustering, and systems
will be exposed. Academics, industry professionals, and government regulators
will meet to collaborate, with the goal of advancing the quality of research
currently under development in the field. The previous editions were
instrumental for the development of the field by bringing attention to important
problems in high frequency data modeling and proposing cutting-edge solutions to
some of these problems. The scientific motivation for the conference arises from
the fact that organizing a conference in the trade capital of the world has the
potential of bringing together the best mathematicians, practitioners as well as
regulators to help develop and improve the modeling aspect of the financial
markets. The main training objective of this meeting is to continue exposing
today's economic and modeling problems to current graduate students in the hope
that this will improve the quality and impact of their research.
