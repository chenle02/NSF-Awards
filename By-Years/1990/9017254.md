This research program plans to study the linear and nonlinear dynamics and
elastic properties of low dimensional conductors supporting charge density wave
(CDW) and spin density wave (SDW) condensates. The CDW systems include, among
others nyobium selenides and sulfides, tantalum sulfide, and several alkali
molybdates, while the SDW systems include chromium, uranium- ruthenium silicide
and a one-dimensional organic chain. A variety of electrical conductivity and
noise measurements will be performed over a wide range of frequency, magnetic
field, pressure, and sample spatial extent to determine the internal mode
dynamics, metastable state structure, and the role of electron-electron
correlations. The properties of the dynamic SPW condensates will be explored.
Elastic measurements of CDW or SDW materials in the presence of ac + dc electric
fields and other perturbations will help establish internal mode deformations
and lattice couplings. Nonlinear dynamics (chaos) studies will help reveal the
number of active degrees of freedom in CDW transport and the role of amplitude
dynamics.
