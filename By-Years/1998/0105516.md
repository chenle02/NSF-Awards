Synchronization insures correctness of parallel execution by enforcing true data
dependencies and timing constraints. In a parallel programming environment based
on the shared-memory programming model, synchronization is provided either
through explicit user-level coarse-grain synchronization primitives (such as
locks and barriers) or implicitly synchronized data structures such as lock-able
L-structures and write-once I-structures.

In this project we propose a new efficient way to support fine grained
synchronization mechanisms on multiprocessors. We propose to design a full/empty
tagged memory hierarchy with aggressive hardware support for fine grained
synchronization that is embedded in the cache coherency mechanism of an SMP or a
NUMA multiprocessor, or a single-chip multiprocessor. We propose to handle
synchronization faults in a similar way as cache misses in a lockup-free cache.
We believe that handling synchronization and coherence together can provide a
more efficient execution, reducing the occupancy in the memory controllers and
the network bandwidth consumed by protocol messages. The performance benefits
are primarily the result of allowing a dataflow style of computation in
programming models, and maximizing the exposed parallelism by minimizing the
possibility of false dependencies caused by coarse grained synchronization.
