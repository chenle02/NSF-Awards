DMS-0204158 Thang Le

Thang Le plans to continue his study of quantum and finite type invariants of
links and 3-manifolds. In particular, he would like to study problems arising
around the volume conjecture which connects quantum invariants to classical
objects like fundamental groups, torsions, and volumes. Other problems involve
integrality properties (in broad sense) of quantum invariants and the topology
behind them, and their applications. The field has interactions with geometry,
combinatorics, number theory, and physics.

The theory of knots and 3-manifolds is an old branch of mathematics which has
gained renewed interest among mathematicians and physicists after the discovery
of the Jones polynomial and its relation to theoretical physics (quantum field
theory, high energy physics). In fact, it is now one of the most active domains
in mathematics. Many results of knot theory may also find applications in
molecular biology. To classify knots and 3-manifolds, mathematicians use
"invariants". This research project studies new classes of invariants of knots
and 3-manifolds and their relationships with the classical ones. The new
invariants are very powerful in distinguishing knots and 3-manifolds.
