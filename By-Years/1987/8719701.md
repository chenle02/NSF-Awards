Research in coral reef communities has been directed towards learning why
single-celled algae, the zoothanthellae, live in animal cells such as those of
corals and anenomes. A popular assumption has been that the host cell provides a
high nutrient environment in otherwise nutrient poor waters. Drs. Cook and
Muller-Parker have shown that zooxanthellae, the algal symbionts of corals and
other reef invertebrates, can be limited by inorganic nutrients. This research
project addresses the question of nutrient limitation with an emphasis on the
effect of nutrient status on productivity of the zoothanthellae and on the
relative contribution of dissolved versus host-derived sources to the nutrient
budgets of these algae. Biochemical and physiological techniques will be applied
to both laboratory cultures and in situ coral reef populations. Results will
help answer questions relating to the regulation and control of symbiotic
systems, mechanisms of nutrient transport and the roles of zooxanthellae in
coral reef carbon and nutrient recycling processes.
