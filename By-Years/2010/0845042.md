CAREER: Malware Immunization and Forensics Based on Another Sense of Self

Xinyuan Wang, George Mason University

Despite recent advances in malware defense, computer malwares (e.g., virus,
worm, botnets, rootkit, spyware) continue to pose serious threats to all
computers and networks. Besides being more damaging, modern malwares (e.g., blue
pill, agobot) are becoming increasingly stealthy and evasive. This has made it
increasingly difficult to protect our computer systems and networks from
malwares and ensure the trustworthiness of our mission critical systems.

Our natural immune systems are very effective in protecting our body from
intrusions by (almost endless) variations of pathogens. Our immunities depend on
the ability to distinguish our own cells (i.e., "self") from all others (i.e.,
"non-self"). Inspired by the self-nonself discrimination in the natural immune
systems, this research explores a new direction in building artificial malware
immunization and malware forensics capabilities based on "another sense of
self", which is essentially a unique mark to be assigned to the programs to be
protected. Based on such an actively assigned "another sense of self", the
"immunized" program is able to detect application level malwares effectively and
efficiently. In addition, the actively assigned "another sense of self" enables
new malware forensics capabilities that were not possible before. Since the
artificial malware immunization technique does not require any specific
knowledge of the malwares, it has the potential to be effective against new and
previously unknown malwares. The new artificial malware immunization techniques
and tools to be developed could automatically make many applications (e.g., Web
server) immune to many malwares and thus greatly improve the trustworthiness of
computer systems.
