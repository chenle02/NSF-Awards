Most economic theories specify equilibrium relationships among economic
variables, and, at least implicitly, the equilibrium information flows among
economic decision-makers. However, the adjustment process which moves the system
to an equilibrium position is usually not specified. This research proposes a
method for analyzing a general class of such adjustment processes. The principal
goal of this analysis is to determine the minimal communication and coordination
among economic decision-makers needed to achieve equilibrium. This can be
compared with the information flow generated by the economic institutions under
study. If the latter is less than the former, equilibrium cannot generally be
achieved, and the equilibrium relationships cannot reliably approximate actual
economic behavior. This information analysis is proposed as a new source of
discipline in the evaluation of economic models. When the convergence to
equilibrium requires information which cannot easily be communicated in an
ongoing fashion, two directions of research are suggested. First, the additional
information might be inferred from the historical behavior of observable
variables, and this information might then be used in the design of the
adjustment process. Second, the equilibrium concept might be changed to embody
more modest optimality criteria. The latter approach is proposed specifically
for the theory of the firm when communication is limited to accounting
information.
