Steven D. Harris &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IOS-0920504 Evolution of morphogenetic
regulatory systems in fungi&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law
111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fungi represent a large group of eukaryotic
organisms that exhibit a diverse array of cell shapes ranging from highly
elongated molds to ovoid yeasts. Results from multiple fungal genome sequencing
projects strongly suggest that this diversity is attributable to regulatory
mechanisms that specify where and when growth occurs. Although these mechanisms
are reasonably well understood in yeasts, it is not known whether or how they
might function in molds. Accordingly, the objective of this project is to
characterize one of these mechanisms in a divergent set of molds that have a
pronounced impact on human welfare. The project will utilize a comparative
genetic and molecular approach that relies upon recently developed experimental
tools that facilitate the understanding of gene function in molds. Expected
results include the demonstration that genetic pathways involved in the
regulation of cell shape in yeasts have a broader ancestral role in determining
patterns of growth and spore formation in molds. Two key scientific impacts are
expected to emerge from this project. First, biologists will acquire an improved
understanding of how cell shape is generated in fungi and whether the underlying
principles share any features in common with animals and plants. Second, because
the formation of specific cell shapes largely determines the capacity of fungi
to produce valuable compounds (such as pharmaceuticals and food additives) and
to cause disease (such as infections of important crops), it will become
possible to better manipulate fungi to our own benefit. Broader impacts of this
project include the rigorous training of graduate, undergraduate, and high
school students in the disciplines of microbiology and genomics.
