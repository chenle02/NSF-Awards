DMS-0401670&lt;br/&gt;Serguei Arkhipov&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will
investigate how semi-infinite cohomology and semi-regular modules integrate into
various algebro-geometric constructions on three levels: for finite dimensional
objects (including flag varieties, nilpotent cones and Springer varieties of
semi-simple algebraic groups), for objects arising in the geometry of loop
groups (affine Grassmannians and affine flag varieties) in the course of
Geometric Langlands Program due to Beilinson and Drinfeld and, finally, for
objects connected with 2-dimensional local fields, e.g. Lie algebras of iterated
formal Laurent series with values in finite dimensional Lie algebras. Thus we
propose a hierarchy of problems whose unifying ideas are semi-infinite
cohomology and semi-regular modules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project
is divided naturally in four parts. In the first part we work out a certain new
approach to semi-regular bimodules and semi-infinite cohomology of (nongraded)
associative algebras. The second part deals with finite dimensional objects. We
describe geometrically the modified semi-regular module over a semi-simple Lie
algebra. Then we provide a geometric description for semi-infinite cohomology of
the tensor square of the small quantum group at a root of 1. The third part
connects semi-infinite cohomology of small quantum groups with perverse sheaves
on the affine flag variety, equivariant coherent sheaves on the Springer variety
for the Langlands dual group and, finally, with the classical semi-infinite
cohomology of the affine Lie algebra at the critical level. The fourth part is
an attempt to construct a categorical semi-regular module for the algebra of
iterated Laurent series with values in a semi-simple Lie
algebra.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
