9405978 Gold The lignin degradative system (LDS) of the white rot
basidiomycetous fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium is capable of degrading the
plant cell wall polymer, lignin, and a range of aromatic pollutants. The major
components of this nonspecific oxidative system are two extracellular heme-
containing peroxidases, manganese peroxidase (MnP) and lignin peroxidase (LiP).
The LDS is expressed during secondary metabolic growth, the onset of which is
triggered by limiting nutrient nitrogen. MnP expression also is regulated at the
level of gene transcription by Mn ion and by heat shock and chemical stress. The
primary goal of the project is to elucidate on the molecular level these
specific mechanisms of mnp gene transcription. Mn, heat shock and H2O2
regulation of individual mnp genes will be analyzed under conditions of nitrogen
and carbon limitation. Site-directed mutagenesis, deletion analysis and
synthetic promoter elements are being used to identify the cis-acting sequences
required for Mn and heat shock regulation. DNaseI footprinting and gel mobility
shift assays will be used to assay putative DNA-binding transcription factors.
Mn and heat shock-induced mnp mRNAs will be compared and the possibility of a
post-transcriptionial Mn requirement will be examined. %%% The lignin
degradative system (LDS) of the fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium is capable of
degrading the plant cell wall polymer, lignin, and a range of aromatic
pollutants. The primary goal of this project is to determine what causes the
genes for the enzymes involved in this degradation to be turned on and off. This
work may ultimately help in the removal of pollutants from the environment.
