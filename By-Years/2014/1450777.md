Aggressive behaviors in children can be harmful and disruptive and frequently
indicate risk for psychological disorders. The contributors to and consequences
of aggression depend on both the form (i.e., physical versus relational) and
function (i.e., initiating versus reacting) of such conduct. This project is
among the first to examine early behavioral precursors to these different types
of aggression among preschoolers. This study's unique contribution is to follow
children's development over time to capture how different pathways lead to
different types of aggression.

A multi-method study using psychophysiological and behavioral observation
measures will identify the physiological and early personality features that
precede and predict different types of aggression. 230 preschoolers will be
assessed at three time points over a 15 month time period. The first objective
is to test distinct longitudinal pathways to forms and functions of aggression,
including: 1) a developmental pathway resulting from emotion dysregulation; and
2) a developmental pathway resulting from temperamental fearlessness. The second
objective is to model the mediating processes through which each personality
profile leads to subtypes of aggression. This project will benefit Dr. Ostrov's
ethnically and racially diverse graduate and undergraduate research assistants
who will be trained on valuable research skills in the psychological and
developmental sciences. These formative experiences have the potential to shape
the next generation of scientists. Moreover, the proposed project has the
potential to impact a significant portion of children, families, and schools
within society at large.
