The area of specialization for this PYI award is in separation methods used for
production of recombinant proteins. Particular focus will be on protein
adsorption and molecular recognition. The research approach combines engineering
with the tools of high-resolution separation methods. The research approach
combines engineering with the tools of molecular genetics and structural protein
chemistry, with the aim of understanding the thermodynamic driving forces and
structural basis of association equilibria. While the work is of a fundamental
nature, the understanding gained will aid the development of improved separation
media and processes. Some specific interests involve a fundamental study of the
structural and thermodynamic basis for antibody affinity and ion exchange
adsorption of proteins. By using the tools of directed mutagenesis and
thermodynamic analysis to probe fundamental driving forces and structural
determinants, one will eventually be able to understand separation processes
from the most basic level. This understanding will then be used to develop
improved separations media and processes.
