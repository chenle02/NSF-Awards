This project, sponsored by the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse, will provide
a four-year masters program specifically tailored for high school Chemistry
teachers in the state of Wisconsin. The program consists of a prerequisite year
offering calculus and Physics, followed by the major topics in chemistry
(Analytical Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Biochemistry and
Physical Chemistry) integrated with STS topics and safety issues. Pedagogy
issues, and laboratory and demonstration techniques are also totally integrated
into the program. In addition to the content and pedagogy the project has a
strong leadership component which involves key administrators from the schools
where the teachers are employed. The matching funds from the University, the
school districts and business and industry constitute a match of about 22% of
the NSF grant.
