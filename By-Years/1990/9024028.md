A large body of work in biophysics and physical chemistry suggests that the
equilibrium, kinetics, and transport of proteins at surfaces may deviate
substantially from these processes in bulk solution, i.e., that unique phenomena
may occur and be important in the physical aspects of biological chemistry at
interfaces. Dr. Thompson plans to address these questions by using substrate-
supported planar model membranes and recently developed techniques in time-
resolved, laser-based fluorescence microscopy. This proposal fulfills the FAW
objectives which are 1) to recognize outstanding and promising women scientists
and engineers in academic careers of research and teaching and 2) to facilitate
the further development of their careers.
