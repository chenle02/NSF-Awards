proposal requests support for 6 U.S. participants to a 3-day workshop to be held
in Seoul, Korea. This U.S.-Korea Joint Workshop is about the coastal ocean
prediction/forcasting for the Korea Strait and the East/Japan Sea (KSES). The
workshop will review the current knowledge of the oceanography of the KSES,
formulate recommendations for developing coastal model(s) with real-time
capacity, and explore opportunities for new collaboration between the US and
Korea scientists.&lt;br/&gt;
