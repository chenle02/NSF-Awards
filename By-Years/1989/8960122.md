This is an SBIR Phase I award for the development of novel inorganic
scintillating fibers for the use in ionizing radiation imaging detectors. In
Phase I the plan is to use metal-organic chemical vapor deposition technology to
coat discrete lengths of robust quartz optical fibers with thin films of
inorganic barium fluoride or calcium fluoride scintillators. The proposed
research will lend to the development of imaging radiation detectors useful in
medical imaging and diagnostic tools, in industrial x-ray or UV sensors in
reactor and nuclear industry monitoring and in high energy nuclear physics
research.
