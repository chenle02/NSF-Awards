9505345 Perrin The International Junior Investigator and Postdoctoral Fellows
Program enables U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four
months of research abroad. The program's awards provide opportunities for joint
research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and
experimental conditions abroad. This award will support a twelve-month
postdoctoral research visit by Dr. David M. Perrin to work with Professor Claude
Helene of the Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle in France. Antisense
technology encompasses virtually all research directed toward the rational
generation of molecules which can associate with DNA and/or RNA to block protein
production, suppress cell growth and division, or even kill the cell. The goal
of this project is to characterize antisense interaction by exploring 1) the
synthetic coupling of medicinally important DNA-damaging functionalities to the
oligonucleotide, 2) the synthesis and properties of more resilient nucleotides,
3) the synthetic coupling of intercalators to increase the stability of the
interaction and to characterize the antisense association by spectrophotometric
techniques and 4)the generation of other sequences whose inhibitory properties
will be examined in- vivo in bacterial and mammalian cell systems. ***
