High speed, high capacity optical communication systems will possess integrated
optical or optoelectronic circuits and devices connected to single mode optical
fibers. Tapered transitions in integrated optics are important for improving
interconnect losses between integrated optical devices of different dimensions
as well as integrated optical devices and single mode fibers. Existing
perturbation techniques will be extended to analyze radiation losses at step
discontinuities in asymmetrical waveguides. This analytical work will be general
enough to accommodate not only waveguide tapers but also axial inhomogeneities
such as index and width variations as well as bends in the wave guides.
