The problem addressed by this research is that of load modeling. The one year
period of the award will be used to refine the hypothesis feedback modeling
methodology in a manner congruent with interence methods based upon discrete
decision theory. Specifically, the work will concentrate on defining a class of
static-process hypothesis and a method for developing hypothesis feedback models
which are in agreement with a strategy for representation of the hypothesis and
models in a knowledge-based environment for this class. The results of this
project are expected to aid in a classification of applications and their
relationship to the process hypothesis and knowledge-base used for analysis.
