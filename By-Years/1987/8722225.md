The research consists of the development of an integrated expert system for
earthquake-resistant design of building structures, that is capable of providing
consultation and decision support for the different phases of the earthquake-
resistant design process for buildings. The design of structures for earthquake
loads requires specialized knowledge in several inter-related disciplines, which
is usually not available at a design office on a routine basis. This expert
system will be able to mimic the reasoning process and the decision-making
actions of these experts. In the Phase I study, a conceptual architecture and
the basic framework for such an expert system was developed. The feasibility of
the architecture and the framework was demonstrated by building two prototype
modules of the expert system. In this research, based on the architecture so
developed, the knowledge, procedures, and judgments/heuristics for different
steps in the earthquake-resistant design process are integrated into functioning
Knowledge-Based Expert Systems (KBES's). In addition, design and development of
the supporting modules and facilities, e.g., interactive user interfaces, design
and implementation of local data bases, and a flexible "blackboard" support
facility are included. This research represents Phase II of the Small Business
Innovation Research Program.
