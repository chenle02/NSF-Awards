9313413 Eaton This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work of
Professor Eaton at the University of Chicago for continued studies on the
synthesis, reactivities, and properties of polycyclic hydrocarbons based on the
cubyl frame. Characterization and utilization is sought of the dehydrocubanes:
cubene, 1,3-dehydrocubane, 1,4-cubane diyl, and the higher diyls. Synthesis from
1,4-cubane diyl of rigid-rod materials of defined geometry and lengths is
sought. Oligo- and polycubanes will also be pursued with focus on the synthesis
of polycyclooctatetraenes and polyacetylenes and is aimed toward generating
materials with conducting properties and with high carbon/hydrogen ratios. %%%
In this project Professor Eaton continues to explore the chemistry of the
special class of polycyclic hydrocarbons formed from cubanes. The emphasis of
this research is on the characterization and utilization of the various
unsaturated dehydrocubane systems. The research will venture out to soluble
rigid-rod materials of defined properties and conducting hydrocarbons as
applications from poly- and oligocubanes. ***
