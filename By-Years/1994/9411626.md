This is a project to examine how individuals and households adapt to traumatic
economic hardship and change. The research will be based primarily on a survey
to be conducted in 600 households in both urban and rural areas of Lublin,
Poland. The survey will collect systematic data on the nature of the economic
hardships and changes being experienced and a variety of conditions and past
experiences that influence how households adapt to economic stress. The economic
changes that are sweeping the countries of the former Soviet bloc are having a
dramatic impact on the lives of ordinary citizens in those countries. The future
stability of these societies depends to a considerable extent on whether
individuals and families can adapt to these changes and achieve family goals
better than they could under the old socialist system. Poland, as a leader in
implementing market reforms in the post-Soviet era, represents a particularly
important case we need to understand. This project, by collecting systematic
data on adaptation to economic change in one area of Poland, will increase our
understanding of the momentous changes underway in that society and their
implications for the future.
