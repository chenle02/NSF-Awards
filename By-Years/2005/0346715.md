This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
supports research by Professor Philip Power of the University of California at
Davis to synthesize and characterize new main group compounds that are protected
and stabilized by modified terphenyl ligands. This research investigates the
fundamental characteristics of element-element bonding in compounds such as
borylenes (univalent, monomeric organoboron(I) compounds), diborenes and
dialuminenes with putative double bonds, and disilynes with silicon-silicon
triple bonds. The structures, bonding and chemistry of the new compounds will be
examined by multinuclear and dynamic NMR UV-Vis, IR, EPR and X-ray
crystallography in order to correlate bonding and electronic changes that are
difficult to describe in traditional terms of valency, orbital overlap,
hybridization and bond order.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will advance
the fundamental understanding of the bonding of the main group elements
including silicon, boron, aluminum and gallium. Graduate students, undergraduate
students and postdoctoral associates will receive excellent training and
research experiences in a forefront synthetic inorganic chemistry program.
