The northern part of the North American Cordillera comprises a mosaic of
tectonic fragments, some of which formed in intra- oceanic environments far from
North America. Other fragments appear to have accumulated in a continental
margin environment. Present information about terranes in northern British
Columbia and adjacent Yukon indicates that the Nisling terrane was originally
formed in proximity to a continent, and is now surrounded by fragments of
oceanic affinity. Prior work has out- lined relations that permit several
different tectonic scenarios. This renewal will attempt, by mapping, structure
and strati- graphic studies and isotopic analysis, to resolve between these
possible scenarios. Results are expected to place significantly tighter
constraints on the rate and processes of continental assembly in the northern
cordillera.
