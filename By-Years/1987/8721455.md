An investigation is planned to study the phenomena associated with the
intermediate valence, superconductivity, and magnetism in metals with narrow
electronic bands. The joint research project between the University of
California, San Diego (UCSD) and the University of Michigan (UM) will include
sample preparation, characterization, and bulk properties measurements at UCSD
and electron spectroscopy, both laboratory and with synchrotron radiation at UM.
An effort will be made to discover and characterize new materials that display
novel narrow band phenomena, especially high temperature oxide superconductors
and heavy Fermion superconductors. Spectroscopic measurements will be made to
determine the electronic structure and the relation to the novel properties of
these materials. This information will be used to test relevant theories of
narrow band behavior, with emphasis on systematics in transition metal compounds
and the relation between the impurity and lattice regimes of the Anderson
Hamiltonian.
