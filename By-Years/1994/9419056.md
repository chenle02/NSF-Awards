This award is for support for a two year project to expand the geographic and
stratigraphic data base for the Sirius Group by studying deposits in the
Shackleton Glacier-Queen Maud Mountains region of Antarctica. Field activities
will center on further development of the marine and terrestrial stratigraphy,
mapping, and collection of paleobotanical and paleozoological material. An
attempt will be made to duplicate the Pliocene marine and terrestrial climate,
glacial and biotic record documented 100-150 km away in the Beardmore Valley.
Micropaleontological investigations of foraminifera, diatoms, palynomorphs,
macroplants and insects will be used to data strata and provide
paleoenvironmental information. These new data will address questions related to
interior ice sheet history, among others.
