The objective of this project is to expand and enrich the pre-conference
Research Development Workshop (RDW), which is held prior to the annual Atlanta
Competitive Advantage Conference (ACAC). Emory University, Georgia State
University, and The Georgia Institute of Technology jointly sponsor ACAC. ACAC
will be holding its 9th Annual Conference on May 14th -17th of 2012. ACAC's
mission is to provide a unique forum for the presentation, discussion and
encouragement of research and theory development in the fields of industrial
organization economics, organization theory, entrepreneurship, and strategic
management. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This proposal to expand the
RDW greatly increases the emphasis at ACAC on Ph.D. student research. The
proposed expansion of ACAC's RDW in 2012 will triple the number of Ph.D.
students that participate in the RDW compared to 2011. It will also increase by
50% the number of senior scholars in the fields of industrial organization
economics, organization theory, entrepreneurship and strategic management who
will mentor the Ph.D. students and double the number of hours of the RDW,
enabling these enlarged groups of students and scholars to work a significant
amount of time on a 1:1 basis. The supported Ph.D. students will be able to
attend and participate in the main conference as well.
