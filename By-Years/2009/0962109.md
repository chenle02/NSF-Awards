The degree to which chemical heterogeneity in the mantle affects the chemistry
of lavas erupted on the spreading centers of the globe-encircling mid-ocean
ridge is a topic of hot debate in the marine geology and geophysics community.
Up until now, most work has focused on characterizing and trying to understand
geochemical trends in axial lavas. This project focuses on off-axis and
transform lavas from the East Pacific Rise which, due to their low magma
recharge rates, should provide better indicators of undiluted mantle chemical
differences. Project goals are to examine the extent to which these lavas
exhibit compositions inherited directly from the mantle or from mixing during
melt aggregation. Magmatic volatiles such as H2O, CO2, S, F, and Cl will be
analyzed in about 200 geochemically well-characterized lavas from two different
areas near the Rise. These data will be combined with geophysical data to
determine the evolution of the magmas and whether it can be determined how much
of the mantle composition of origin they represent. Broader impacts of the work
include support of an institution in an EPSCoR state, international (Japan and
France) and inter-institutional collaboration, and undergraduate training.
