9624762 Sokol Neutron scattering studies of quantum systems will be carried out
in this research project. The behavior of the condensed phases of quantum
liquids and solids, such as helium and hydrogen, are dominated by quantum and
statistical effects which are responsible for many unique properties such as
superfluidity. More recently, confinement of these systems in restricted
geometries has shown that the properties can be substantially different from the
bulk. Elastic and inelastic neutron scattering will be used to probe the
microscopic structure and dynamics of these phases. This work will focus on the
helium isotopes (3He and 4He), isotopic mixtures (3He-4He), and hydrogen (H2)
where the properties of the condensed phase are dominated by quantum effects.
Elastic and total neutron scattering measurements will provide information on
the spatial correlation's. Inelastic neutron scattering measurements will be
used to study diffusive motion, collective excitations, and the one-body density
matrix. (momentum distribution). Measurements will be carried out in both bulk
systems and for liquids and solids in confined geometries such as porous Vycor
glass, aerogels and solgels, and zeolites. %%% Neutron scattering studies of
quantum systems will be carried out in this research project. Quantum solids and
liquids, such as helium and hydrogen to be studied, provide a useful model
system for studying many of the quantum effects that are found in metals,
superconductors, and magnetic materials. However, they do not suffer the same
materials preparation problems so that the central physical principles are more
easily extracted. Elastic and inelastic neutron scattering will be used to probe
the microscopic structure and dynamics of these solid and liquid phases. These
measurements will provide information on the static and dy namic interaction of
helium atoms and hydrogen molecules in the condensed phases. This work will
focus on the helium isotopes (3He and 4He), isotopic mixtures (3He- 4He), and
hydrogen (H2) in both the bulk phases and in confined geometries. ***
