A major problem for sensory processing is the separation of "signal" from
"noise." Self-generated activity stimulates sensory receptors, yet must be
distinguished from externally produced sensory stimulation. An excellent model
system for testing possible mechanisms is electrosensory processing by certain
fish. Several fish species have well-developed electro- receptor systems that
are exquisitely sensitive to the tiny electrical potentials produced by other
animals. Among elasmo- branchs (sharks, skates, and rays), electroreception is
used for prey detection. The medulla of the brainstem is a major site for neural
processing of this information. This project will examine how physiological
mechanisms eliminate sensory responses to the intense self-stimulation caused by
ventilation movements of the gill chambers. Preliminary data suggest this
mechanism relies on the primciple of "common-mode rejection," as central
circuits compare inputs from different parts of the body and by subtraction
eliminate the signals that all receive simultaneously. Similar processing by the
same circuits may enhance sensitivity to differential signals of natural
electric fields. These experiments will determine the cellular mechanisms
involved, examining the anatomy and physiology of the circuits involving the
brainstem and parts of the cerebellum. This approach is a novel one with an
excellent model system, and results will be important for understanding the
fundamental sensory problem of signal and noise separation, and for
understanding the evolution of electrosense and sensory processing in this
vertebrate class with such an ancient history.
