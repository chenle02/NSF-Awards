Robot hands fall short of the dexterity of human hands for several reasons. One
reason is the lack of affordable high-performance contact and force sensors to
provide sensation at the fingertips. This project is to develop a new
inexpensive fingertip for robot hands, with the goal of enhancing their
dexterity.? Specifically, the new fingertip will incorporate a consumer-grade
miniature camera and a flexure mount to deliver three characteristics that are
promising for enhancing dexterous manipulation: (1) a well-characterized
relationship between the force applied to the fingertip and its deflection
(i.e., stiffness); (2) high-resolution contact location sensing; and (3) high-
resolution measurement of the forces and torques applied by the fingertip.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To achieve these characteristics, the project is broken
into four tasks: (1) the design and testing of a compact six-degree-of-freedom
(6-dof) flexure exhibiting low hysteresis and stress relaxation, providing a
consistent mapping between wrenches (forces and torques) applied to the flexure
and its 6-dof displacement; ?(2) visual estimation of the 6-dof flexure
displacement by the embedded camera, with a target resolution of better than 100
microns in linear displacement; (3) bench tests of flexure displacement sensing,
wrench sensing, and contact location sensing, using our custom 5-dof stress-
strain test robot, which provides ground-truth force sensing resolution of
better than 0.01 N and motion resolution of better than 1 micron (linear) and
0.001 degrees (angular); and (4) initial validation of the utility of the sensor
for dexterous manipulation in single-finger tasks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
