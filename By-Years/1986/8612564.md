Improved performance of a mechanical system means achieving less cost, while
maintaining or improving the quality of the end product. Increased efficiency,
longevity and reliability are also needed. Vibration level of the system and
consequent noise radiation are two limiting factors on hiqher speeds and higher
load to weight ratios. This project is a multi-disciplinary effort to examine
the elastodynamic and acoustic response of high speed mechanical systems. It
models the gross dynamic behavior and vibration response of the elastic
components of the mechanism using Kane's method. The acoustic radiation
formulation is based on the Helmholtz Integral. The model which evolves from
this study will be a valuable design and research tool for use in the design,
synthesis, optimization, and diagnostic studies of mechanical systems.
