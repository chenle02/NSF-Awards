The PI will continue efforts to model the elastic and thermodynamic properties
ofsolid and liquid silicate and oxide minerals at extreme pressure and
temperature conditions. He is developing an electron gas theory of bonding that
yields quantitatively accurate thermodynamic properties, and accurately predicts
phase transformations in cubic minerals. He will apply this model to more
complex mantyle minerals, and develop a parameterized version of potentials for
geologically important iron paris.
