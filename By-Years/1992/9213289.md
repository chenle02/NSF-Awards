This study proposes to collect direct sequence information from the coding
portion of the gene for vertebrate serum albumin. Initially DNA (genes) from
three frogs will be purified and cloned. Once serum albumin DNA sequences are
obtained for these three species, the sequences will be aligned so that regions
of complete similarity can be identified. If such identical regions can be
found, primers will be developed to allow the amplification of homologous
albumin genes from other frogs. The development of such primers will permit the
rapid amplification and sequencing of this major nuclear gene from a large
number of frog species. This information can be invaluable in assessing the
relationships of major groups of organisms which are used extensively in studies
of genetics and development.
