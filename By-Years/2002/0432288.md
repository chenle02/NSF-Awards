This proposal seeks to construct and execute a workshop in the summer of 2004
focused on performance in grid computing environments. The workshop will
approach this area from a new perspective - that of the user. The workshop will
evaluate current approaches to understanding and improving grid performance for
applications. Gaps will be identified and areas for future concentration will be
summarized in a report. Measurement (what and how), analysis (how to apply
measurements), and simulation (applying measurement and analysis) will provide
the focus areas. The workshop is targeted for 45 invited experts over 2 days,
with funding sources from several agencies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
