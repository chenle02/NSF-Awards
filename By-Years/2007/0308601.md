0308601 Lu This is a U.S. -Asian Workshop proposal submitted by Dr. Kening Lu,
Brigham Young University, in cooperation with Professor Zhujun Jing, CAS, on
nonlinear dynamics and stochastic PDEs. This proposal requests funds to include
6 invited U.S. mathematicians and 6 U.S. graduate students and junior scientists
in a seven-day conference on June 21-27, 2003 in Beijing, China. The topic is
timely and has significant applications to many physical sciences. The workshop
will be jointly support by the Chinese Academy of Science and NSF.
