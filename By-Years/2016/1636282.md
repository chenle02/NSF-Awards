CBET- 1636282&lt;br/&gt;University of California-Los Angeles&lt;br/&gt;P.I.:
Cohen, Yoram&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Travel funds are requested to partially
support approximately 30 undergraduate and graduate students to attend the 2016
Annual Meeting of the North American Membrane Society (NAMS 2016) Conference in
Bellevue, Washington from May 21-25, 2016. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NAMS annual
meeting is one of the preeminent global membrane meetings. The latest
developments in the membrane field from leading academic, governmental, and
industrial research labs are presented for the first time for evaluation by the
membrane community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting will have 18 separate
technical sessions covering all aspects of membrane science and technology. An
extensive student program has been developed for the meeting, including the
three poster sessions, Young Membrane Scientist Forum, and lunch programming.
Four technical workshops will also be offered. These workshops are excellent
venues for students to learn about fundamentals and advanced research topics in
key areas such as Polymer Ion-Exchange Membranes for Electrochemical
Applications; Measurements; Membranes for Water Treatment; and Polymeric and
Inorganic Membranes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The organizers anticipate a total of
approximately 500 membrane researchers from all over the world representing
industry, government, and academia. In addition to the development of human
resources, the support provided by this proposal will allow presentation of the
latest research results from the most innovative academic laboratories around
the country. This showcase of new materials and technologies attracts
significant industrial participation as it provides a unique environment to
evaluate the commercialization potential of the research. The economic growth
associated with such commercialization benefits the entire country.&lt;br/&gt;
