The giant algal Cell, Boergesenia forbesii, will be used to investigate the
molecular and cellular basis of oriented cellulose microfibril deposition.
Advantages of this model system are: (a) large scale cultivation of axenic
cultures; (b) the cell responds to wounding to synchronously form numerous
protoplasts; (c) protein synthesis is initiated, allowing segregation of
developmental stages for biochemical analysis; (d) highly crystalline cellulose
microfibril assembly is initiated by linear aggregation of ordered plasma
membrane particles known as terminal complexes (TCs); and (e) TC size is
sufficiently large for microscopic detection. Plasma membranes of young
protoplasts and thin walled aplanospores will be purified by advanced
biochemical techniques (including free flow electrophoresis). Differences in
protein patterns will be correlated with onset of cellulose biosynthesis.
Monoclonal antibodies will be produced against purified plasma membrane
proteins. Due to large TC size, binding antibodies can be screened using
fluorescence microscopy. Protein will be identified by western blotting and
purified by immunoaffinity columns. Antibodies will be used to study TC function
in vitro and in vivo. The antibody approach leading to identification of
proteins in the TC will allow comparative analysis of TC proteins from other
plants, prokaryotes, and possibly some animals which synthesize cellulose. The
question of how cellulosic wall is laid down is one of the most fundamental, and
least well understood, problems in plant biology. The question of wall growth is
key to problems of plant cell growth and division, as well as whole-plant
development. The work to be carried out under this award may also result in
advances in our understanding of cellulose synthesis which may be of commercial
significance.
