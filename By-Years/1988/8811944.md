This study examines a persistent anomaly in the research literature on the
household division of labor: employed married women do the bulk of the housework
but few describe this arrangement as unfair. Clearly inequality in household
labor is not necessarily a reflection of inequity. Equity theory proposes that
perceptions of fairness are based on definitions of situation, rather than just
a comparison of behavior between the individuals involved. Families, like other
institutions, legitimate and perpetuate some -- but not all -- inequalities.
Using a probability sample of 600 employed married women and 400 husbands, this
telephone survey explores the circumstances in which the division of household
labor is perceived as unjust, and examines the psychological consequences of
perceived inequity. The broad significance of this study lies in its use of
equity theory to draw a connection between the balance of power in the household
and in the wider society -- testing critical propositions about distributive
justice.
