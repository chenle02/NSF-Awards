The objectives of this research are to improve the design and analysis methods
currently used for advanced composite rotary- wing structures. The outcome of
the research involves the development of: (1) a refined structural theory for
nonhomogeneous anisotropic beams, and (2) an optimum design methodology for
loaded- shape-critical applications. The refined beam theory is developed by
extending existing one-dimensional anisotropic beam theories to include the
effects of nonhomogeneity and transverse shear. This theory, which is an
extension of Timoshenko's beam theory, uses an extended set of shear correction
factors that are determined by Saint-Venant's elasticity solutions optimization
techniques to determine the initial shape of a flexible blade weight is
minimized, the stresses and stability boundaries are checked, and the design
variables include the blade geometry and material definition. These design
methods will impact the future design of rotary-wing structures. Composite
materials will be used more intelligently and blade shapes may changes as a
result. Major improvements in blade propulsive efficiency are possible, which
would result in substantial fuel savings for the next generation of aircraft.
