This award is being made under the Research Planning Grant option of the
Research Opportunities for Women program. Dr. Lando is developing a research
program in theoretical computer science with emphasis on Petri Nets and Trace
Languages. Petri nets provide simple models of distributed systems, and the
theory of traces provides a representation of concurrent processes, analogous to
the way that strings of symbols model sequential processes. For certain types of
Petri nets, the application of the theory of traces is providing worthwhile
results. Dr. Lando will investigate trace theory as applied to Petri nets and as
a new area of language theory.
