9500998 Alvarez This is an award to provide the support this investigator
requested in response to NSF 94-101, the National Science Foundation Faculty
Early Career Development (CAREER) Program. The intent of this program is to
encourage the early development of academic faculty as educators and
researchers. The research this investigator plans to conduct is directed toward
improving bioremediation in management of hazardous wastes. He plans on an
experimental approach to determine whether the controlled addition of
environmentally benign organic substances can enhance the biodegradability of
less benign pollutants such as benzene, toluene, xylenes and trichlorethylene.
The research this investigator plans on conducting is expected to be used in
design of biologically-based processes for treatment of water that contains
hazardous organic substances. The goal of the educational component of this
project is to incorporate recent advances in knowledge gained from research into
traditional introductory courses for undergraduate engineering students. His
plan involves revision of traditional courses, developing new courses based on
use of novel chemical and biological processes and constructing a unit
operations laboratory that can be used for both undergraduate and graduate
courses. ***
