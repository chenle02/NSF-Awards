9401151 Davis This award provides support for the acquisition of a distributed
memory parallel computer together with support hardware for scientific
visualization and storage of large image databases. The proposed system will be
an experimental facility designed as a testbed for operating system and
algorithm development, and will consequently run a wide range of experimental
operating systems. The research topics to be explored span a broad range of
applied research in high performance computing in three general categories:
programming tools for HPC systems, parallel algorithms for scientific computing,
and symbolic coding. A key component of the research program is the development
of scalable parallel data structure and algorithms for the representation and
analysis of global data sets arising from environmental science problems.
