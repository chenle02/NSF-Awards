Materials Chemistry will be brought into introductory chemistry courses through
the preparation of "A Materials Chemistry Companion to General Chemistry."
Consisting of text, problem sets, model kits, software, and demonstration and
laboratory experiments, the "Companion" will show how virtually every topic
typically discussed in general chemistry courses can be illustrated with
examples and concepts from materials chemistry. The introduction of materials
chemistry promises to revitalize general chemistry. The new material will
broaden and enhance the scientific and technological literacy of students as
they learn the vital roles played by chemistry and chemists in our materials-
intensive world. Inclusion of materials chemistry in introductory courses will
increase the number and diversity of high-quality students who pursue careers in
chemistry and in its many related scientific and engineering disciplines.
