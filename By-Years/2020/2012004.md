This award supports US-based participants, particularly graduate students and
recent doctoral recipients, to attend the international conference "Model Theory
and Applications 2020" held on June 1-5, 2020 in Cetraro (Italy). Model theory
is the study of classes of mathematical structures in the context of
mathematical logic. The goal of the conference is to present a general overview
of recent developments in model theory and its applications.

Topics of the conference include pure model theory (neostability, o-minimality),
as well as applications to dynamics, combinatorics, geometry, and other
neighboring areas. This award provides an opportunity for US-based early-career
researchers and PhD students to learn from leading experts and to actively
engage in research on these recent developments. More details are available at
the conference website https://www.matfis.unicampania.it/home-model-theory

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
