This program is dedicated to the study of dynamic, electronic, and optical
properties of simple systems at extreme pressures and low temperatures. The
techniques used in the experiments are principally inelastic scattering of
light. In the recent past, most of the light scattering has been spontaneous
Raman scattering. More recently the laboratory added facilities to do coherent
anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (CARS) and other four wave mixing experiments.
Among these, two-photon resonances are being exploited to probe electronic
structure of samples within anvil cells. A particular advantage of the
multiphoton technique is the ability to examine electronic states having
energies higher than the maximum photon energy at which high pressure windows,
e.g. diamond, are transparent. They propose to exploit this advantage in a
program of study of electronic excited states in hydrogen and deuterium and in
exygen, nitrogen, and benzene at extreme pressures.
