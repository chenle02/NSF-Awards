Main memory has long been the weak link in high-performance Internet-connected
computer systems, sandwiched between continuing rapid increases in both network
bandwidths and CPU performance. As&lt;br/&gt;networks reach 10 Gb/s and CPU
clock rates shoot past 2 GHz, the memory system is under more pressure than ever
to keep up. Meanwhile, increased transistor counts are enabling integration of
multi-megabyte&lt;br/&gt;caches and DRAM controllers directly on the processor
device, with switched interconnects built from high-speed point-to-point
channels carrying I/O and memory coherence traffic between
chips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This inflection point in the configuration, level of
integration, and capacity of the memory hierarchy represents an opportunity to
optimize the memory system for high-bandwidth Internet networking
support.&lt;br/&gt;This research will (1) establish a baseline analysis to
characterize the key bottlenecks of future memory hierarchies on Internet server
workloads, and (2) evaluate specific system enhancements to
address&lt;br/&gt;these bottlenecks, leading to more efficient, higher
performance Internet server systems.&lt;br/&gt;
