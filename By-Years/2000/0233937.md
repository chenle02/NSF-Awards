The project will determine whether it will be possible to obtain information
from small businesses engaged in design and manufacture of high-end apparel in
developed countries. The PI seeks to explore novel and effective supply chain
arrangements that some small companies have found to be viable. In today's
economy, off-shore manufacture is the primary means of viable apparel
manufacturing, and requires far more capital than is generally available to
small businesses. If the needed information can be obtained through interviews
with company presidents, a more comprehensive study will be undertaken. This
project may open up new ways for small domestic apparel designers/manufacturers
to survive in today's global economy.
