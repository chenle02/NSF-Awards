The project requests fund to participation of 30 minority faculty to attend the
ACM Computer Science Conference and the ACM SIGCSE Technical Symposium on
Computer Science Education which run consecutively at the same site. This is an
extremely worthwhile endeavor as reported by the past years participants. It is
essential that minority faculty become exposed to the research culture which is
effectively presented at conferences such as these. Among the planned activities
are (1) special sessions addressing unique programs for minorities, (2) panels
addressing funding opportunities for minority research programs, (3) an
employment register, (4) student activities featuring minorities, and (5) a
special session in the chair's program dealing with administering a computer
science program at a minority institution. The funding will support attendance
by approximately 25 minority faculty at the ACM CSC 92, the SIGCSE 92 in Kansas
City, March 3 - 7, and one workshop to enhance their skills. It is important
that minority faculty attend national conferences in order to become better
integrated into the research and education communities. This project represents
a strong effort in that directions.//
