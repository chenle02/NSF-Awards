The first aim of this proposal is to develop theoretical and computational
methods for common problems in tensors: small rank approximations, best rank
approximations, uniqueness of best rank approximations, approximations of
tensors preserving symmetries, rank of tensors, norm computations, finding the
number of singular values tuples, computing singular value tuples, computing
nonlinear eigenvalues. The second aim of this proposal is the use of theoretical
and computational methods in tensors for central problems in Quantum Information
Sciences: separability, the capacity of quantum channels and the computational
complexity of these quantities.

High dimensional problems arise in many areas of applications such as
mathematical biology, chemistry, physics, image processing, finance or
engineering. The typical mathematical model uses tensors, i.e., multidimensional
arrays, to represent the physical model and the computational methods for
simulation and optimization can usually be based on operations with these
tensors. For higher order tensors the theory and the development of numerical
methods is much more complicated than for matrices, i.e. two dimensional arrays.
The aim of this proposal to study, find and apply new techniques in tensors to
advance the current machinery for applications in biology, engineering and
science.
