The long-term goals of this project are to elucidate host-symbiont
relationships and to formulate a comprehensive theory for the integration of
newly acquired symbionts into host cells leading to the acquisition of new cell
components and changes in cellular phenotypic characters. In the recently
established amoeba-bacteria symbiosis, symbiotic bacteria were originally
harmful to the hosts but changed to required cell components within a few years,
bringing about many changes in cell characters. The specific aims are to test
the following 4 hypothesis: 1) That the symbiont-produced 29-kD protein is a
factor required by host amoebae for their survival, 2) that the symbiosome
membrane has a "fusion-preventing" component which is responsible for the
prevention of lysosomal fusion with symbiosomes, 3) that the plasmid DNAs of
symbiotic X-bacteria code for cell-surface components of X- bacteria that confer
them resistance to digestion and their infectivity and 4) that the X-bacteria
came from one of the bacterial strains normally living in the amoeba culture.
These studies will use immunocytochemical methods with monoclonal antibodies,
gene cloning, nucleotide sequencing, gel electrophoresis, micrurgy, and other
biochemical and molecular-biological techniques. Expected results will not only
enhance our understanding of the mechanisms for the establishment and
maintenance of stable endosymbiosis, but also will provide insight into the
origin of new cell components in eukaryotic cells and cellular character
changes. In addition, some of the results might be applicable in therapeutic
research on diseases caused by infective agents, in which such agents avoid
digestion by the host cells probably by similar mechanisms. //
