Professor Gordon and his group will continue their research into the optical
coherent control of chemical reactivity by studying three types of processes:
bond-selective photodissociation, fine-structure selective photodissociation,
and competition between photodissociation and autoionization. The experiments
are designed to compare carefully theoretical predictions of Shapiro and Brumer
to the experimental results.
