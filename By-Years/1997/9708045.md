The proposed project is a component of the international North Water Polynya
Study, which involves research cruises to the north of Baffin Bay on the
Canadian ice-breaker C.C.G.S. Louis S. St. Laurent, in 1997 (summer) and 1998
(spring-summer). This project is to measure the surface heat budget of the
polynya. Specific aims are to determine: a) surface heat budget of NOW polynya,
and assess its "latent" versus "sensible" character; b) cloud radiative forcing
as a function of cloud-cover, cloud type, ice-cover, ice-type and solar zenith
angle; c) clear sky radiative forcing as a function of water vapor, aerosols and
solar zenith angle; d) turbulent exchange coefficients for heat and moisture
exchanges in open water and vicinity of ice cover; dependences of these
coefficients on conditions in the marine boundary layer; e) skin temperature of
ocean and ice, and; f) influence of near-surface, sea-temperature gradients on
air-sea fluxes of heat, moisture and gases. These goals will be achieved by
using high quality instrumentation, including a self-calibrating infrared
interferometric spectroradiometer to measure spectra of radiation emitted by the
sky, clouds, the ocean surface and ice cover. By making measurements in the
widest range of ice cover (from total ice cover to ice-free conditions), this
project is complimentary to the much larger SHEBA and ARM programs.
