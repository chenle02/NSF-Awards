Cowley, Anne&lt;br/&gt;AST-9731491&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Cowley will carry
out an observational study of supersoft X-ray binary systems to measure more
accurately their stellar masses and other fundamental physical parameters. Both
spectroscopic and photometric observations will be made which will provide
information on stellar properties such as temperature, luminosity, and mass, as
well as the mass ratio, orbital inclination, and mass transfer rate and
structure of the accretion disk. Observations will be compared to existing
models to elucidate the nature of the compact objects in these systems and
distinguish between competing models of white dwarf, neutron star, or black hole
accretors. &lt;br/&gt;
