EAR-0229103 Keith D. Koper

This project will use high frequency seismic waves recorded at seismograph
stations of the International Monitoring System (IMS) to map and model the fine
structure of Earth's inner core. The same properties and techniques that make
IMS array stations useful for detecting and locating nuclear weapons tests make
them ideal for observing the often faint seismic phases that interact with the
inner core. Although the inner core is quite small physically it plays a large
role with respect to the geodynamo, and more generally with respect to heat
transfer within the Earth. In the same sense that ice cores can be used to
deduce past climate fluctuations it may be possible to use seismic models of the
fine radial structure of the inner core to constrain the history of Earth's
magnetic field.

The data gathered from IMS stations will be processed with standard array
techniques such as beamforming, fk analysis, and phase-weighted stacking to
observe core reflections (ScP, PcP, PKiKP, SKiKP) and refractions (PKPbc,
PKPdf). Relative properties among phases recorded on the same seismogram will be
used to mitigate the effect of shallow structure. Specific research targets
include using PcP/PKiKP amplitude ratios to constrain the shear velocity at the
top of the inner core and the density jump across the inner core-outer core
boundary (ICB), modeling precritical PKiKP phases to constrain the thickness of
the ICB, evaluating the hypothesis of an anisotropic discontinuity beneath the
ICB using quasi-polar PKPbc and PKPdf phases, and evaluating the inner-core
scattering hypothesis by analyzing the coda of precritical PKiKP phases in the
transparent zone. --
