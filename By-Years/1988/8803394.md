This award is in support of a workshop dealing with meteorite stranding surfaces
in Antarctica. The workshop will assess our current understanding of stranding
surface dynamics and their relationship to stratigraphic chronology for ice
sheet ablation surfaces and terrestrial ages of Antarctic meteorites. The
workshop will take place in July, 1988 at the University of Pittsburgh. This
meeting is an important aspect of the Antarctic geoscience and glaciology
research programs and will help to define new directions for future research.
The conveners, Dr. William Cassidy and Dr. Ian Whillans, are actively involved
in all phases of meteoritic and glaciological research in the Antarctic region
and are well qualified to organize this effort.
