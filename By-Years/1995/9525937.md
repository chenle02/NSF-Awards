Altabet 9525937 This proposal will address a fundamental problem in biological
oceanography from the viewpoint that vertically migrating algal mats in the open
ocean are instrumental in redistributing nitrogen within the surface waters of
the North Pacific Ocean. Using previously funded shiptime, the project will
document Rhizosolenia mat vertical distribution throughout the upper 100-300 m,
the quantitative N inputs, and potential for NO3- release in the surface layers
by mats in the central North Pacific gyre. The research will characterize depth
of origin, migration times and absolute transport rates by these macroscopic
associations and determine if NO3- released by mat decay is taken up by other
ambient phytoplankton. In addition, the study will survey other phytoplankton
that may be vertical migrators such as Ethmodiscus, Pyrocystis, Halosphaera and
solitary Rhizosolenia to determine if they are also important components of this
process. At the conclusion of the study, the project will have examined waters
of the central North Pacific gyre both east and west of Hawaii. This should lead
to a broad spatial understanding of the importance of phytoplankton vertical
migration in the oceanic waters of the North Pacific gyre.
