An innovative, but relatively simple, model will be applied to solar Coronal
Mass Ejection (CME) observations made with the LASCO instrument on board the
SOHO spacecraft. Starting with data obtained in 1996, some 150 Earth-directed,
or so-called "halo", CMEs will be analyzed using a conical model originally
developed by Zhao, Plunkett and Liu. From this model one may, in principal, be
able to deduce sizes and transit times of geoeffective CMEs. This information
would be extremely useful to Space Weather Forecasters. If the method proves to
be effective, a second component of this effort would involve working with Space
Weather Forecasters at NOAA's Space Environment Center to develop efficient
operational techniques to estimate CME travel times based on sequences of LASCO
images.
