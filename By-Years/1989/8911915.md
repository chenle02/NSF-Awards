This project will allow a cultural anthropologist to study the political and
economic significance of Andean ethnic cloth. In much of the developing world
local communities define their identity with respect to other communities and
the national state by, in part, the production and wearing of locally-specific
traditionally-designed clothing. The project will involve participant
observation, field surveys, archival research and time allocation studies of the
production, consumption and marketing of this cloth in several communities in
highland Bolivia. The project will test the hypothesis that the Indian peasants'
investment of labor in cloth production allowed them to maintain a relatively
independent economic identity in the face of international and national market
penetration of their communities. This research is important because the
phenomenon of indigenous cloth which marks local ethnic identity is widespread,
and understanding of the function of cloth production and consumption will help
us understand how such poor communities can develop yet maintain their ethnic
identity.
