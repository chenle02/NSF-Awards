This project is concerned with the theory and design of structured vector
quantizers for the compression and storage of analog sources such as speech,
images, video, and music. Vector quantization is a class of techniques that
holds significant promise for significant gains over recent compression
techniques. The difficulty with vector quantizers is the high degree of
complexity involved in implementations. The focus of this project is the
development of a theory of reduced complexity vector quantizers. Asymptotic
quantization theory is to be further developed and used to analyze the
performance of moderate to high rate structured quantizers. New methods for
analyzing the performance of low rate quantizers are being studied. The
fundamental limits of performance versus structure are being explored.
