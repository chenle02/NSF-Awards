This award provides partial travel support for young United States scientists
to attend the XXIII International Ethological Conference (IEC), to be held in
Torremolinos, Spain, 1-9 September 1993. The IEC is open to all who are
interested in ethology (the biological study of behavior) and its related
disciplines. The IEC is the only international gathering in the field of
ethology that brings together scientists studying all aspects of animal
behavior, including mechanisms, development, evolution, and function (behavioral
ecology). The biennial conference attracts scientists from over 40 nations and
covers a multitude of disciplines including ethology, comparative psychology,
ecology, evolution, neurobiology, sociology, anthropology, psychobiology, animal
science, conservation, primatology, and human ethology. The opportunity to meet
colleagues in all of these disciplines, from all over the world, fosters new
collaborations, new methods and approaches, and a broader perspective on the
field. These are lasting benefits to the young scientists who attend and to the
scientific community of the United States.
