9616868 Schafrik The National Academy of Sciences-National Research Council,
through its National Materials Advisory Board (NMAB) of the Commission on
Engineering and Technical Systems (CETS), is conducting a study to determine
methods for improving the exchange of information between the materials science
and engineering community and the producers, users, and disposers of materials.
The goal is to accelerate the application of new materials and processing
innovations. The NMAB developed this project as result of a strategic planning
session at the September 1995 board meeting, and it was approved by the NRC
Governing Board Executive Committee at its meeting on April 9, 1996. The board
considers this effort to be an important step towards unifying the field of
materials science and engineering (MSE) by improving its ties to the user
communities so that MSE can provide realistic choices that solve problems with
the applications of the materials. The study is conducted as a joint program
between the NMAB and the Board on Manufacturing and Engineering Design (BMAED).
The staffs of these two boards are a representative cross-section of the
materials and manufacturing communities in industry and academe. %%% It is
expected that successful completion of this study will lead to improved
selection of materials in future engineeering systems through enhanced
communication between the materials specialists and user communities. ***
