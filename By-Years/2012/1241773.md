Digital forensics is a rapidly growing branch of forensics that focuses on the
recovery and investigation of data found in digital devices. It is now a major
part of many criminal and civil investigations and its tools are used by local,
state, and Federal law enforcement agencies with increasing frequency. Digital
forensics education programs are needed to increase the size of the technical
workforce to meet the needs of the nation. The project focuses on the
development of undergraduate programs modeled on the standardized curricula
proposed by NSA, DHS, Security Centers for Academic Excellence, ACM, and IEEE.
It contributes to the creation of resources and educational materials for use in
academic programs, distance learning, multi-disciplinary, and multi-
institutional programs that meet the evolving
standards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The field of digital forensics depends on many
disciplines and skills including evidence collection, preservation, and
presentation as well as forensic preparation. The Information Trust Institute
education team involves cross-field collaboration and includes the Computer
Science, Computer Engineering, Business and Accounting, Criminal Justice, Law,
and Educational Assessment experts that are needed for this type of curriculum
development. In addition, the Institute has research findings in many digital
forensics application areas (supercomputing, clouds, cyber infrastructures for
transportation, power, health, and mobile computing) that are being integrated
into this comprehensive multi-disciplinary educational program.
