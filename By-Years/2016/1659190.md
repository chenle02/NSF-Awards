This three year renewal Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site
Program, SUNFEST: Summer Undergraduate Research in Sensor Technologies, at the
University of Pennsylvania, will offer a diverse cohort of students from
underrepresented groups who have limited opportunities for STEM-oriented
research the opportunity to work on research projects involving sensor
technologies with the goal to develop new materials and devices. Topics include
sensor phenomena, modeling, materials, nano- and micro-technology, sensors for
biomedical applications, sensory data processing and sensor systems for
robotics. Sensor technology, which acts as a common intellectual focus and which
addresses "real-life" applications, can have a huge scientific impact that can
benefit society and the environment. The program will also serve as an
intellectual hub for others' involvement, such as high school students from city
high schools and their teachers. The SUNFEST program will act as a catalyst for
broader involvement and a supportive environment for meaningful participation in
scientific communities.

Over 11 summer weeks, the University of Pennsylvania will host 10 undergraduate
students who will be involved in high quality, cutting-edge research projects
related to sensor technology. By working on a meaningful research project of
their own in a dynamic and supportive environment, students will contribute to
academically-based discovery that may lead to better devices and systems for
medical, robotics, communications, environmental, energy and surveillance
applications. To foster students' development as future researchers, they will
participate in weekly group meetings and seminars in their labs. In addition,
the REU offers enhancement activities, include workshops on writing proposals
and technical reports, responsible conduct of research, applying to graduate
school, and effective oral presentations.
