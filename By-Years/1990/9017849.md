Heavy snowfalls are among the most disruptive of weather phenomena. A joint
program between the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Science
Foundation entitled the Winter Icing and Storms Project (WISP) will be held in
the winter of 1991. The objectives of this program include the study of
snowstorms. The Principal Investigator will participate in this program and will
use both observational and numerical modelling studies to determine the
dynamical and microphysical factors that are important in determining the timing
and location of heavy snowfalls. If successful, this research may lead to better
forecast of these disruptive events.
