This research consists of four major objectives: (1) The development of
powerful, rapid, hybrid acquisition schemes designed to operate in channels
containing multiple-access interference, fading, and multipath. These schemes
will be designed to acquire signals rapidly and reliably even under severe
channel conditions. (2) The creation of a new class of sequential
multihypothesis tests based on pipelining, a paradigm akin to a parallel server
queueing system. (3) The development of acquisition schemes that exploit the
presence of multipath. (4) A determination of the acquisition-based capacity of
direct sequence CDMA communications and the acquisition-limited throughput of
packet-data CDMA in third generation cellular communications systems.
Significant advances in sequential decision theory are sought in the study, and
the results will be applicable to systems ranging from multiple-resolution radar
systems to PCS systems.
