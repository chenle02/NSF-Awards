Efforts are underway to investigate and develop methodologies for the
transformation of butyric-acid clostridia (Clostridium acetobutylicum and
related strains) and to investigate the fundamental and applied aspects of their
molecular biology and genetics for biocatialysis applications. Little is known
about the genetics or regulation of enzymatic activities involved in the
formation of primary metabolism products (organic acids and solvents) of strict
anaerober such as the butyric-acid clostridia. Mutants deficient in enzymes of
solvent forming pathways will be isolated and characterized. These mutant
strains will allow the cloning and characterization of genes which complement
the deficiencies. This approach will not only allow isolation of the structural
genes of the enzymes directly involved, but also enable regulatory elements
which may be necessary for expression of these genes to be identified and
analyzed.
