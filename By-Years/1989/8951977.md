This project establishes an upper division undergraduate course in the water
quality area of civil engineering. Three major instrumentation systems, a gas
chromatography system, an organic carbon analyzer and a toxicity analyzer
provide the tools necessary to fully support relevant pilot-scale investigations
and allow students to learn a number of skills valuable in either graduate study
or professional practice. This award is being matched by an equal amount from
the principal investigator's institution.
