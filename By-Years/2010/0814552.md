CBET-0814552&lt;br/&gt;Raguin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Partial support is provided
for US participation in the Sixth International Conference on Inverse Problems
in Engineering (6th ICIPE), which will be held in Dourdan, France, on June 15 -
19, 2008. The purpose of this meeting is to enable US researchers to become more
engaged in this field, which is being led by researchers from outside the
US.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With respect to the intellectual merit of the
conference, inverse problems impact a wide variety of interdisciplinary
engineering fields, including (but not limited) to thermal transport.
Significant advances have been made primarily outside the US, indicating that US
researchers are lagging their international counterparts. It is thus very
important for US researchers to be involved with this meeting, particularly
junior investigators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the conference
include support for a number of junior, female, and under-represented minority
researchers to attend this meeting. A key goal of the conference is to enhance
international collaboration opportunities. Results from the meeting will be
disseminated by publication in the Journal of Physics: Conference Series, an
open-access web-based journal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is funded by
the Thermal Transport Processes (TTP) Program of the Chemical, Bioengineering,
Environmental, and Transport Systems (CBET) Division.
