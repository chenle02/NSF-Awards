This grant will continue to support the construction, and eventually the
operation and analysis of data, of a powerful multi- channel lidar (light radar)
at South Pole Station. The main observational capabilities are: 1. Complete
characterization of polar stratospheric clouds (PSC's) throughout the Antarctic
winter and spring. This is of great importance in understanding the
stratospheric ozone hole. 2. Measure the temperature profile from 2 to 70 km
using Raman and Rayleigh techniques. 3. Observation of polar mesospheric clouds
during the Antarctic summer. 4. Measurement of the structure and dynamics of the
sodium layer near the mesopause region. (about 90 km altitude) The system will
be a flexible, general purpose lidar system which will be able to address a
number of important and pressing scientific issues related to global change.
