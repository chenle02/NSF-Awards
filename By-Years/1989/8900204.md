With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Roger Siervogel will lead a
project to copy seriously deteriorating radiographs from the Fels and Denver
collections. The Denver series will be inventoried and a computer catalog
constructed. Both collections will be made more accessible to anthropologists
and human biologists. The Fels Longitudinal Growth Study began in 1929 and is
the longest, continuously on-going series study of human growth and health-
related outcomes of its kind in the world. The study deals with normal growth
processes in normal (non-diseased) individuals. As part of the longitudinal
study, serial radiographs of more than 968 participants whose current age range
is from 4-weeks to over 59 years have been taken since birth. The Fels
collection now numbers more than 102,000. In addition, Fels is the repository
for approximately 60,000 serial radiographs that were collected in the Denver
Longitudinal Growth Study. These two collections are of major scientific
significance but, unfortunately, most of the films taken prior to 1965 are badly
deteriorating. This project is important because it will save these
scientifically valuable materials from destruction. Given increased knowledge
about radiation dangers, many of these films could not be taken today and, thus,
are irreplaceable. Studies based on these radiographs have greatly increased our
understanding of growth and development and have the potential to contribute
more information in the future.
