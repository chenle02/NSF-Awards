The PIs propose to culture mixtures of three types of liver cells in a
bioreactor in such a way that these cells can be used to produce
immunomodulators (interleukins 1 and 6) and major histocompatibilty complex
(MHC) glycoproteins (cell surface antigens responsible for histocompatibility
reactions). Specific objectives of the study are to: - Purify three cell types
by mechanical disaggregation and rapid fractionation. - Reassemble the three
differentiated cell types and attach to appropriate support surfaces. - Maintain
the cells in a productive mode for extended periods in small experimental
rotating batch reactors. - Induce specific proteins and secrete these into the
cells' serum free nutrient bath. The proposed work is highly innovative, and
successful achievement of the objectives of this proposal will provide a
significant advance to the culturing of mixtures of mammalian cells. It will
also provide the basis for a more extensive research proposal. An
interdisciplinary team of four experienced researchers will be involved in
carrying out the project. This team includes a chemical engineer, a civil
engineer, an immunochemist and a microbiologist.
