A Distributed Systems Laserwriter will be provided for researchers at the
University of Maryland for research in the Department of Computer Science. This
equipment is provided under the Instrumentation Grants for Research in Computer
and Information Science and Engineering program. The research for which the
equipment is to be used will be in the areas of protocol development and
evaluation, real-time operating systems, and unified time-critical distributed
systems.
