HBCU-UPâ€™s Research Initiation Awards provide support for STEM faculty to pursue
research activities to further their research capabilities and effectiveness and
help enhance research and teaching at HBCUs. This award to Tougaloo College
seeks to uncover crucial insights into gene expression and cellular
differentiation. It will advance the field of genomics by utilizing innovative
technology and computational tools. Through the use of long-read sequencing, the
project aims to make contributions in understanding the control of gene
expression in general, with specific application understanding diseases.
Additionally, it promotes education and diversity by providing undergraduate
students, particularly those from historically marginalized communities, through
valuable research experiences. By integrating this research into the curriculum,
Tougaloo College aims to transform STEM pedagogies and enrich the learning of
students in various disciplines. The potential benefits of this project are
wide-reaching. It will not only enhance the research capabilities of faculty
members, but also foster the development of future STEM professionals. By
engaging students in authentic research, it will prepare them for successful
careers and contributes to their retention in STEM fields.

The overarching goal of this project is to utilize high-throughput genomic and
transcriptome data sets, primarily based on Nanopore long-read sequencing, to
investigate the influence of DNA methylation on RNA velocity trajectories in
diverse biological systems and diseases. The project will develop innovative
computational tools to accurately estimate RNA velocity and detect DNA
methylation patterns, including rare or novel modifications. Leveraging the
unique advantages of Nanopore long-read sequencing, such as rich signal-level
information, the project will advance the field by providing a comprehensive
understanding of the interplay between DNA methylation and RNA velocity. This
research's technical approach involves the development of a computational
toolbox for RNA velocity estimation and a transformer-based machine learning
tool for direct DNA methylation detection. Through the integration of RNA
velocity and DNA methylation data, the project will shed light on the regulatory
mechanisms underlying gene expression and cellular differentiation. The
anticipated outcomes have the potential to impact various sectors, including
healthcare, by enabling more accurate diagnostics, personalized therapies, and
transformative advancements in genomic medicine.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
