Theoretical studies of electron scattering processes involving the formation
and decay of negative ions are proposed. The problems investigated include,
photodetachment of negative ions in external fields, thermal energy electron
scattering by heavy alkalis, perturbation of Rydberg atoms by alkalis and
inelastic processes in low energy electron scattering by hydrogen halide
molecules. The theoretical methods employed are an integral equations approach
and the R- matrix theory. All of the problems are quite relevant to current
experimental investigations.
