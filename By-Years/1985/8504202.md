Raman scattering will be used to observe and characterize gradual structural
changes in solids during repeated illumination by picosecond pulses. By
detecting the shift, broadening, and lineshape changes of the Stokes line with
an accuracy of + 0.1 cm-1, the accumulation of plastic strains and the formation
of microcrystallites will be readily detected. Other candidates to explain the
precursors will also affect the Stokes line. These experiments will first be
performed in disordered and crystalline semiconductors (bulk or thin film), then
extended to other materials, such as those used in optical coatings. The results
will be compared to existing models, and the nature of the precursors will be
established.
