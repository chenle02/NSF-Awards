Although this work will be done on a very simple unicellular organism, the
protozoan Paramecium, it will examine a very basic problem which is common to
all animal cells, including human ones. The problem stems from the fact that
membranes are made up largely by lipids and, therefore, lipid composition
determines the properties of other membrane constituents, such as membrane
channels. Changes in the properties of the channels results, in turn, in the
imbalance of the ion metabolism of cells, an event which ultimately leads to
cell pathology and death. Dr. Hennessey has shown that in Paramecium there are a
number of spontaneous mutations which affect the composition of membrane lipids.
Some of these mutations result in abnormalities of calcium metabolism. These
abnormalities can be "cured" by injecting in the mutated protozoa droplets of
cytoplasm of wild ones. The objective of this research is to find out which
particular constituent of the injected cytoplasm is effective in curing the
defect caused by the mutation.
