Harvey Mudd College will convene expert computer science (CS) educators to
collaboratively document refine, and publish pedagogical content knowledge
resources related to ninety topics in computer science. The central goal of the
project is to document, validate, and promote CS pedagogical content knowledge,
the combined knowledge of both the CS learner and CS content that enables an
expert teacher to teach well. Resources developed will enable novice teachers to
perform the actions of a more advanced CS teacher, such as incorporating new
teaching practices, anticipating students? difficulties, and building upon
students' strengths. In addition to this practical contribution, this research
will identify open research questions in CS education.
