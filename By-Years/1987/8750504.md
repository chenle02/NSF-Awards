A modern microcomputer laboratory consisting of nine stations will be set up to
complement courses in microcomputers and microprocessor interfacing. Each
workstation will consist of an IBM PC/AT and a Motorola 68000 emulator system.
Students will be taught the whole concept of microcomputers and how they
interact with real world devices, not just programming in either a high level or
assembly language. The system as envisioned will also allow relatively
inexpensive updating as more modern chips become available.
