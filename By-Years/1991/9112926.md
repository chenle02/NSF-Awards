Professor Horia Metiu is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to perform theoretical simulations of silicon
growth on surfaces and time dependent quantum theoretical treatments of the
effects of ultrashort laser pulses on molecular solutes. In the first area of
research, Metiu will use correlation function theory to calculate the rates of
all the elementary kinetic steps involved in the epitaxial growth process: the
sticking of atoms to the surface, their jumps from one surface site to another,
the dependence of the jumping rate on local configuration of adsorbed atoms, and
the final sites involved in the jump. These rates will be used in a kinetic
Monte Carlo program to simulate the kinetics of epitaxial growth of silicon. In
the second area of research, Metiu will develop methods capable of analyzing the
results of novel experiments with ultrashort pulses which are used to probe the
dynamics of solute molecules. He will also explore the theoretical consequences
of coherence and interference in generating laser signals that are very
sensitive to the quantum dynamics. %%% This research will provide an important
molecular level understanding of epitaxial growth on semiconductor surfaces and
of techniques for laser control of chemical processes in solution.
