Historical records have shown that damage to properties and loss of lives due to
extreme winds have occurred almost every year, and that at current levels, the
total economic loss in the US has been estimated in the order of $40 billion per
year. Most wind damages occur in low-rise buildings, yet systematic fundamental
studies of wind flow over them are very few.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the
proposed study, interactions between extreme winds and low-rise building are
investigated experimentally on building models in a water-channel facility. Flow
visualization techniques are used to gain fundamental insights into complicated
wind-structure interactions, in particular, the characteristics of roof flow and
base flow around typical low-rise building. The effects of wind directionality
and of nearby interfering structures are also investigated. Carefully controlled
water flows are produced to resemble the natural wind flow in
action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stress pattern on a building envelope is
investigated using the techniques of photoelasticity. Photoelastic coating is
applied on a building model, which is then tested in the water channel to reveal
the distribution of stresses and their magnitudes during wind-building
interaction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ability to observe simultaneously the
nearby flow field and the stress distribution on the building, resulting from
fluid loading, represents a significant advance towards understanding the
detailed nature of wind-structure interaction. The results of the present
investigation are of fundamental importance to developing a sound engineering-
science base for the design of low-rise buildings against extreme
wind.&lt;br/&gt;
