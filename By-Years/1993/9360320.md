9360320 Spooner This project is funded under the National Science Foundation's
(NSF) Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, which is designed to
provide an opportunity for small business, particularly the small high
technology firm, to participate in NSF research. Phase I of the SBIR program
serves as a filter to select promising proposals and determine if the firm can
do high quality research. Phase II is the principal research project. Phase III
is the conversion of the NSF-funded research into commercial applications and
technological innovation supported by follow-on private venture capital or other
non-federal financing. This Phase I project analyzes the development of a blind
channel identifier/equalizer (BCIE) suitable for use on digital communication
signals such as BPSK, QPSK, M-PSK, and M-ary QAM, which are corrupted by unknown
channel distortion and noise. The BCIE is needed to reliably extract the
transmitted message from the received data. Areas being investigated are the
tradeoffs in using BCIE vs more conventional equalizers; the range of operating
environments; the performance and applicability of the candidate BCIE
algorithms; and the commercially available DSP hardware appropriate for
prototype imlementation of the candidate BCIE algorithm.
