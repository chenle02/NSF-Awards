9321139 Scott Theoretical studies of low pressure diamond film growth by
chemical vapor deposition and combustion methods will be undertaken. The project
has two parts. In the first part investigations of individual chemical reactions
involving gas phase hydrogen, acetylene and associated radical with the diamond
surface will be done. These studies will be done using molecular dynamics and
trajectory methods. The reaction rate constants and probabilities will feed into
the second part of the project - kinetic Monte Carlo simulation of the film
deposition process. These results will be compared to ongoing experimental work.
%%% This multidisciplinary project between chemistry and physics aims at
developing a better understanding of the growth of diamond films. These films
are of great current interest since diamond is the hardest known material and
has other unique properties. Interest in these materials has evolved rapidly
since an inexpensive method was discovered to produce these materials. The
present project will determine the most likely chemical reactions for the gas-
phase precursors for diamond deposition and then use these to simulate film
growth. Results will be compared to experiments. ***
