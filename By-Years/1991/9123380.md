The primary goal of this project is to research and develop the use of the
qualitative reasoning paradigm for providing intelligent support to the
preliminary aspects of simulation model design. Specifically, the research will
be targeted at the application of qualitative reasoning to the description
validation and the conceptual model design activities. In order to achieve this
goal, the specific Phase II objectives are to develop ontologies for a specific
manufacturing system domain and the simulation modeling domain; to extract and
formalize Common Sense Principles of System Operation; to refine the IDEF3
model- theoretic semantics; to research and prototype a qualitative reasoning
engine comprising ontological and common sense reasoning components; and to
demonstrate the application of this qualitative reasoning engine to the tasks of
description validation and conceptual model design. The main benefits of the
proposed research will be to provide intelligent support for the initial
analysis and model design tasks of the simulation modeling proces; to enhance
the productivity of both the domain expert nd the simulation analyst; and to
enhance the acceptance of simulation modeling techniques by decision makers in
industry and business. The results of this research have the potential to make a
significant impact on the state-of-the-art in simulation modeling technology.
