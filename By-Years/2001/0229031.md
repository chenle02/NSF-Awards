Biological science is one of the top ten social trends, with the twenty-first
century defined as the "Age of Biology". One of the central themes of this age
is biodiversity. Biodiversity is the richness of life, including the variety of
genes within one species through the complex interconnection of all life within
an environment. It is necessary to document and understand the world's natural
heritage. The management of the many kinds of information associated with this
endeavor is biodiversity informatics. There are many efforts developing
worldwide to collect and distribute this information in digital collections.
Some of these efforts are complementary; some are in conflict, some are just
independent. To enhance the utility of this information, it needs to be
integrated. There are a number of different kinds of users of the information,
including the public and government agencies. The panelists convened for this
public forum will discuss different perspective on the construction of global
biodiversity digital libraries from the perspective of different goals and uses.
