supervision of Professor W.E. Billups. Dr. Haley intends to continue research at
the University of California at Berkeley under the sponsorship of Professor
K.P.C. Vollhardt. Dr. Haley's area of postdoctoral research and training will be
total synthesis and organometallic catalysis. Longer term, he plans to apply his
synthetic skills to the generation of new forms of carbon. %%% The Postdoctoral
Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as an important infrastructural
program designed to broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and
attract them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and
teaching.
