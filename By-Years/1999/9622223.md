962223 Rodriguez The objective of the combined research program (in
collaborative constructability and value engineering) is to reduce life-cycle
costs while improving design/construction process performance. The research
program has been coined CREW, or Constructability Review and Evaluation for
Workgroups, because it will develop a collaborative (group) technique for:
analyzing design alternatives (value analysis); evaluating their viability
(simulation); and electronically-communicating solutions. The effect of this
research on the infrastructure of science and engineering would be the actual
development of the CREW technique as well as the construction communication
infrastructure and logistics to improve collaborative construction research
performance.
