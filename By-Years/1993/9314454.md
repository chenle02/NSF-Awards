9314454 Lowell A key issue in understanding the chemistry of hydrothermal fluids
is the large observed variations in Chlorine. THe PI are guess that phase
separtion must play an important role. In this project, the PI will attempt
quantification of the processes responsible for large varions in CI. He will
modify a computational code (GEOTHER) to model 2-phase flow in hydrothermal
system at 9N (EPR).
