The broader impact / commercial potential of this Small Business Technology
Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to develop a new therapeutic for the SARS-
CoV-2 virus causing COVID-19. The proposed technology is a novel therapeutic
engineered to specifically target the coronavirus and assemble on its surface,
disabling the virusâ€™ infectivity. This therapeutic will potentially protect
COVID-19 patients with mild to moderate symptoms from worsening and possibly
transmitting the virus. The therapy may later benefit asymptomatic or non-
infected high-risk groups as well. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business
Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will study the nature of
supramolecular assembly of self-assembled peptides (SAPs) on the surface of
pathogens such as the COVID-19 virus (SARS-CoV-2) and its impact on the
impairment and immune recognition of the pathogen. Self-assembled peptides have
greater stability than unfunctionalized peptides, yet they are twenty times
smaller than antibodies. Therefore, they may combine key benefits of antibodies
and small molecules, enabling a new modality designed for rapid and affordable
widespread development of urgently needed therapies. Current repurposing efforts
are limited by a lack of specificity, while SARS-CoV-2-specific efforts are
dominated by antibodies or proteins that are challenging to rapidly manufacture
at scale. We will: (1) engineer functionalized anti-COVID-19 SAPs and studying
their binding kinetics to the SARS-CoV-2 viral spike protein receptor binding
domain (RBD); (2) investigate the in vitro efficacy of anti-COVID-19 SAPs in
inhibiting viral infection; and (3) establish the in vitro cytocompatibility and
in vivo dose range tolerability of the SAPs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
