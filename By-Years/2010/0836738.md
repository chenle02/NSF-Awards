Engineering Mechanical -(56)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent national
reports have suggested the need for reforming engineering education courses and
curriculum to include more integrated components. Thus, this project addressees
multiple objectives: (1) systematically increasing project-based learning
experiences throughout typical engineering curricula; and (2) increasing the
prospects for industry adoption and commercialization of industry-sponsored and
student-generated capstone design projects. This project will enhance the
outcomes of senior capstone design projects by having needed refinements to
these designs serve as the basis for project-based learning activities in
courses scheduled earlier in the curriculum. Students, in courses taught during
the sophomore, junior, and senior year prior to the senior capstone course, will
gain insight into, and experience with, many aspects of real-world engineering
projects. Simultaneously, capstone design projects will be advanced further
towards industry implementation and commercialization through efforts in this
project. This concept will be tested in the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering
Department of the University of Missouri. A rigorous assessment and evaluation
plan to measure outcomes for the project will be developed and implemented by an
independent consultant.
