Cleveland Advance Manufacturing Program (CAMP) in cooperation with Cleveland
State University, Case Western Reserve University, Cuyahoga Community College,
NASA Lewis Research Center local school systems, professional organizations,
businesses and industry proposes to establish a Comprehensive Regional Center
For Minorities that will provide academic enrichment, career awareness, and the
use of cooperative, hands-on and research-methodology teaching and learning
strategies, coupled with a supportive learning environment and parental
involvement to enhance the overall educational pathway for precollege science
and mathematics students. This program, using a HBCU related model, will build
on an existing "Greater Cleveland Science, engineering an Mathematics Center's
program". The project is expected to impact approximately 1700 minority (mostly
African Americans) students per year. All of these students will be in a
database that will enable them to be continually tracked.
