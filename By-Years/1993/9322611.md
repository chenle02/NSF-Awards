9322611 WOLCOTT Progress in geomorphology rests squarely on the ability to
obtain good field data. However, designing and carrying out field sampling
strategies can be a complicated process involving interactions between a host of
variables. No standard textbooks are able to provide the insight necessary to
conduct complex data gathering in geomorphology. This project provides modest
support to enable 12 doctoral students to participate in a workshop devoted to
better understanding the process of high quality data collection. The students
will be joined by a number of experts in field sampling who will present papers,
lead discussions, and consult in small groups. This project will have a major
impact on the development of young scientists in geomorphology by providing them
with advanced training in the use of field sampling techniques. The workshop
will provide direct assistance to the conduct of their dissertation research and
will have a long-lasting impact on the quality of their future research ***
