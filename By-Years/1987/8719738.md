Professor Kimball will investigate the lattice dynamics of superconducting
systems containing small concentrations of iron using Mossbauer spectroscopy.
The influence of the 3d transition elements on superconducting and magnetic
properties will be determined. Vibrational states in the high temperature oxide
superconductors will be probed with substitutions of rare earth ions for yttrium
and of tin or ion for copper. At a critical iron concentration the lattice
transforms from orthorhombic to tetragonal. Mossbauer and neutron diffraction
will be used to delineate the oxygen anion order-disorder transformation between
phases of these compounds and to observe the magnetic behavior in the disordered
phase. Neutron diffraction measurements in the BaPb1-xBicO3 superconductors will
continue as will a search for other high temperature superconducting materials
of the oxides and sulphides.
