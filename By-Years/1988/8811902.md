The Luquillo Experimental Forest (LEF) in Puerto Rico is a high quality
tropical forest research site with a history of long-term research programs. The
LEF is a National Forest and a Biosphere Reserve, which contains several
research natural areas within its 11,231 ha. The objective of this project is to
tie studies of disturbance regime and forest structure and dynamics to an
ecological landscape perspective. The two primary research questions address (1)
the relative importance of different disturbance types within the four tropical
rain forest life zones of the LEF, and (2) the importance of specific elements
of the biota in restoring ecosystem productivity after disturbance. A
combination of long-term (10-40 year) and short-term (3-5 year) experiments will
provide research components addressing: pattern, frequency, and intensity of
disturbance; environmental properties expected to vary with disturbance size,
age, and origin; biological properties expected to vary with environmental
properties; and system properties emergent from the effects of disturbance
pattern, severity, and frequency on the mutual interaction of environment and
biota. Existing and newly generated data sets will incorporated into a
comprehensive data management system to insure prompt data reduction, timely
dissemination of information to collaborators and other research projects, and
secure long-term data storage. The research site is an excellent one operated
under the stewardship of the USDA/Forest Service. The Forest Service will also
participate in the research through the activities of its resident scientists.
The University of Puerto Rico will provide excellent facilities for the work.
The multi-institutional research team is very strong, well organized and firmly
committed to the requisite collaborative research mode of operation. Results of
this undertaking will be important to the progress of basic ecological science
as well as to the management of the living resources of tropical forest
ecosystems. The Ecosystem Studies Program regards the LEF site and research team
as a valuable addition to the national network of Long-Term Ecological Research
projects. Accordingly, a six-year continuing award is recommended in support of
this project.
