This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the continuing work of
Professor Kenneth B. Wiberg at Yale University to study effects of structural
changes and of substituent effects on the properties of small ring compounds.
The focal point of the combined experimental and theoretical approach is the
advancement of the understanding of the nature of the carbon-carbon bond. Ionic,
free radical, and thermal reactivities of strained hydrocarbons will be studied
by means of synthetic methodologies, spectroscopic analyses, and quantum
mechanical approaches. %%% In this project Dr. Kenneth Wiberg will conduct
synthetic, spectroscopic, and computational studies to examine how both
substituents and structural strain effect the properties of small ring
hydrocarbons. This multifaced approach aims to advance the knowledge of carbon-
carbon bonding, thereby providing fundamental thermodynamic, kinetic, as well as
electronic information for this important class of compounds.
