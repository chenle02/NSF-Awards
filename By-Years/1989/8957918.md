The first two years of funding from NSF for this award will be used to acquire a
specially designed system to do metal organic chemical vapor deposition of
ternaries and quaternaries from the Ga-Al-In-As-Ph system. While 1:1 matching
monies and funding for safety related equipment such as gas cabinets and
scrubbers have been secured from the University, it is expected that the cost of
this system will fully absorb two years of both base and industry matched
funding under the PYI program. The system will be used for three research areas:
growth techniques, which will compare rapid thermal and gas switched control of
the epitaxy, interrupted epitaxy which will explore techniques for insitu
substrate cleaning to reinitiate growth on partially processed wafers, and
studies of new optoelectronic devices. This last project will be done in
collaboration with several colleagues.
