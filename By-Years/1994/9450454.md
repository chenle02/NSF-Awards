9450454 The proposed research would study the various physical processes
determining the plasma configurations of the Neptunian and Uranian
magnetospheres. The proposed project is based on the Voyager observations and
would include (1) Guiding center motion of charged particles and plasma bulk
properties along a field line in the magnetospheres with a magnetic fields
represented by both the OTD and SH models (2) Theoretical model of the
plasmaspheres of Uranus and Neptune (3) Dynamics, especially current systems and
their effects in the Uranian and Neptunian magnetospheres (4) Sources and
transport processes of the plasmas of the Uranian and Neptunian magnetospheres.
