In industrial America, work careers were structured, organized, and defined by
traditional employment relationships and the normal age-based transitions into
and out of work. Because work in the post-industrial era involves more
flexibility in both employment relationships and life course patterns, it is
possible for new career patterns to emerge. This project examines how recent
college graduates choose among diverse possibilities for organizing and giving
meaning to their work lives. To do so, it first uses existing longitudinal
cohort data on career plans and aspirations for a sample of recent college
graduates. It supplements these data with in-depth, semi-structured life history
interviews that help categorize diverse career strategies and experiences, and
help reveal the forces behind the diverse strategies and experiences. The
results contribute to the development of a theory of how highly educated adults
construct their work careers in a contemporary context.
