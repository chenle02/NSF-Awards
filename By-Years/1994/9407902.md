9407902 Browse The acyl lipids of chloroplasts contain characteristically high
proportions of trienoic fatty acids. However, the free radical by- products of
the photosynthetic light reactions can lead to oxidation of polyunsaturated
fatty acids. Because this might be expected to mediate against a high degree of
unsaturation, it has been inferred that trienoic fatty acids must have some
crucial role in supporting photosynthesis. Other unusual lipid features typical
of chloroplasts have provoked similar speculation about membrane structure and
function. To approach this research area in a novel way, a series of Arabidopsis
mutants with specific alterations in leaf fatty acid composition have been
isolated. In the last six years, these have provided a means to study both the
synthesis of chloroplast glycerolipids and the physiological significance of
membrane lipid composition. This proposal describes experiments in which the
mutants and the desaturase genes will be used together to produce plant lines
with progressively more severe alterations in thylakoid lipid composition. These
lines will be studied under a range of environmental conditions using non-
invasive chlorophyll fluorescence techniques, assays of photosynthetic electron
transport, and measurements of membrane fluidity. These experiments will provide
data on the minimum levels of particular fatty acid types that are needed to
sustain chloroplast function. They should also reveal which photosynthetic
processes are most susceptible to membrane disruption. The improved
understanding of membrane lipid metabolism and photosynthesis that will result
from this work are important prerequisites to modifying these processes for
increased plant productivity. ***
