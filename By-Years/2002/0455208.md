ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant will enable approximately 10
-15 earthquake engineering experts, who have been invited by the Japan
Association of Earthquake Engineering (JAEE) to participate in the International
Symposium on Earthquake Engineering Commemorating the Tenth Anniversary of
the1995 Kobe Earthquake. These US representatives will take part in the
international workshop and several panel discussions and present technical
papers reporting on significant research in earthquake engineering carried out
in the US during the past decade. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant will also
enable 30 scientists and engineers to collaborate with the Institute of Social
Safety Science (ISSS) in Japan in the planning the 1st International Conference
on Urban Disaster Reduction (ICUDR1) and participation in the conference,
January 18 - 20, 2005 to commemorate the Great Hanshin Earthquake in Kobe,
Japan. The conference will be influential in establishing recommendations for
future disaster research and disaster mitigation programs and policies in the US
and Japan. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both conferences will generate joint US/Japan
resolutions, which will be introduced during a special session of the UN World
Conference on Disaster Reduction sponsored in Kobe, January 18 - 22, 2005. It is
expected that the resolutions from the ICUDR1 and the International Symposium
will influence future programs of the United Nations International Strategy for
Disaster Reduction.&lt;br/&gt;
