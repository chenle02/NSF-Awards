This proposal is for funds to partially defray expenses for graduate students
and post docs, so that they can attend the Gordon Research Conference on
Photonuclear Reactions. This conference is one in a continuous, biennial series
that has been in place for nearly 30 years. It contributes substantially to the
vigor of electromagnetic nuclear physics. This years conference deals with few-
body systems, giant resonances, electron coincidence reactions, nuclear
structure, photo-nuclear and photo-pion reactions, structure of free and bound
nucleons, experimental results from new facilities, and future facilities.
