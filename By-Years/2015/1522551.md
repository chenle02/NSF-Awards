The Deep Convective Clouds and Chemistry (DC3) field campaign was a (May-Jun)
2012 experiment to study the impact of deep, mid-latitude continental convective
systems, including their dynamical, physical, and lightning production
processes, along with the regional consequences for upper tropospheric (UT)
composition and chemistry. The campaign consisted of ground-based observations
in Colorado, Oklahoma, and Alabama, as well as in situ and remotely sensed
sampling of the outflow and inflow of the convective storms observed from the
NSF/NCAR Gulfstream V (GV) and NASA DC-8 research aircraft. This proposal seeks
further analysis and modeling of the chemistry associated with specific storms
observed in the DC3 project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Focused efforts include use
of the DC3 observations to improve model representation of lightning flash rates
along with the horizontal and vertical placement of lightning produced nitrogen
oxide (LNOx) production, as well as the estimation of the magnitude of LNOx
production. In addition, the convective transport of pollutants from the
boundary layer to the upper troposphere in these storms will be investigated in
models, as well as downward (intrusion)&lt;br/&gt;transport of stratospheric
ozone.
