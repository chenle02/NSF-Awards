Abstract ATM-9729090 Jackson, Stephen T. University of Wyoming Title: Isotopic
Composition of Aquatic-Plant Tissues as Paleoclimate Proxies The SGER award
supports a pilot study on isotopic composition of aquatic plant tissues as a
paleoclimate proxy. The project is aimed at developing, testing, and applying a
new and untried approach for inferring precipitation seasonality, moisture
source, and evaporation loss from small, freshwater lakes. The work will test a
mass balance approach to determine whether it can successfully disentangle
evaporation and precipitation signals from lakewater data. Stable isotopes will
be studied from modern lakewater, aquatic-plant seeds, lake sediments, and
precipitation from sites distributed over a wide area in the central and
southern Rocky Mountains and the Colorado Plateau. If successful, this method
should open the way for a variety of applications in paleoclimate inference and
model testing.
