This research is funded under the National Science Foundation Small Grants for
Exploratory Research Program. The primary goal of the research is to extend
current aerosol deposition processes and instrumentation to process thin films
of silicon. Thin films of silicon powder are deposited on substrates such as
silicon, tantalum, titanium, or silicon dioxide. Effects of electrical charging
of the powders, powder particle size, subsequent thermal treatment of the
deposit, are being studied. The films are being characterized using scanning
electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and electrical property measurements.
