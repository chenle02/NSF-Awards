9319366 Bentley This project is to evaluate environmental conditions and
specific mechanisms which influence the in vivo stability of recombinant
proteins in E. coli. Attempts are to be made to characterize, at the molecular
level, changes occurring within the cell due to perturbations imposed by the
overexpression of cloned-proteins. New techniques to increase product yield and
reactor productivity by minimizing product degradation are to be developed.
These include the construction of new expression vectors employing antisense
RNA, the genetic modification of host cell metabolism, the development of
advanced model-based feeding policies for bioreactor operation, and the
development of a new assay for monitoring proteolytic activity. ***
