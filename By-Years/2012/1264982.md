1264982 - Xu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to
investigate, across submicron to centimeter size scales, the principle of signal
processing from single synapse to multi-neuron circuitry, via a 2D free-standing
optoelectronic graphene platform. The approach is to grow neurons directly on a
large-area suspended graphene membrane, which is part of an ultra-sensitive
graphene transistor in a liquid environment. Through graphene photoconductance
measuring, patch-clamp recording, and optical imaging, the electrical, chemical,
and optical changes in axons, dendrites and synapses across a neuronal circuit
will be investigated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;General statement:&lt;br/&gt;Neuronal
activity is typically mapped using electrode arrays that stimulate neuronal
cells and record their electrical responses. This system has several
limitations: the number of electrodes is typically small and placement of cells
in relation to electrodes is not well defined. This proposal will deploy novel
material, grapheme, to be used as the surface for culturing neurons. Grapheme
has optoelectrical effect, meaning that electrical activity of cells may be
monitored optically using a microscope. This would circumvent limitations of
electrode arrays and would allow for monitoring activity of a much larger number
of neuronal cells.
