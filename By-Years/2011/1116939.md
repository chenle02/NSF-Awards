In this project, the PIs study secure computation outsourcing in cloud computing
with the focus on widely applicable engineering computing and optimization
problems. Their methodology is to explicitly decompose computations into public
programs and private data and leverage the structures of specific computations
for achieving desirable trade-offs among security, efficiency, and practicality.

The PIs propose to organize the mechanisms into a hierarchy where computation
can be represented at various abstraction levels, and then explore a systematic
methodology consisting of the following three methods: (1) problem
transformations that encrypt the data such that the computation can be performed
on the same abstraction level, (2) procedure transformations that leverage the
mechanisms defined at a lower abstraction level as a subroutine for secure
computation outsourcing, and (3) structural-preserving transformations that
further improve the practical efficiency of mechanisms by maintaining favorable
problem structures.

The PIs expect the outcomes of this research to be adopted by application
developers, who will build applications to support secure computation
outsourcing either privately for end-users within the same organization, or for
public end-users resembling the practices of software-as-a-service (SaaS).
