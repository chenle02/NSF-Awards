The International Federation of Automatic Control (IFAC) is an international,
technical organization that has long involvement with U.S. research. The
programs and conferences sponsored by IFAC, held in the United States or
overseas, are among the most prestigious conferences in the world. The United
States has participated in these conferences over the years and has been a
cooperating member of the IFAC organization. Professor Tarn has been and
continues to be a world recognized expert in the field of automatic control with
particular emphasis on autonomous machines and undersea vehicles. His

Systems, as a member of the international program committee and presenter of a
technical paper, will enhance the effectiveness of the program and the
organization.
