In diverse world regions such as the Americas, Europe and South
&lt;br/&gt;Asia, free-market policies have forced small-scale farmers to
transform &lt;br/&gt;their productive strategies or face economic ruin. Peasant
and &lt;br/&gt;small-farmer organizations that once were oriented almost
exclusively &lt;br/&gt;toward national-level efforts to obtain local-level
benefits are now &lt;br/&gt;increasingly seeking allies across national borders,
attempting to affect &lt;br/&gt;global forces which impact their rural
livelihoods. In some cases this has &lt;br/&gt;resulted in violent actions such
as the French peasants' destruction of a &lt;br/&gt;McDonalds restaurant in a
protest against "fast food"; and Indian farmers &lt;br/&gt;burning a field of
genetically modified cotton as a protest against &lt;br/&gt;agribusiness. This
anthropological project studies a new international &lt;br/&gt;peasant and small
farmer organization called Via Campesina, or Peasant &lt;br/&gt;Road, which was
founded in 1993 and has affiliates in about sixty &lt;br/&gt;countries. The
project will interview small farmer activists and donor NGO &lt;br/&gt;personnel
in five sites: Brussels, the headquarters of the European peasant
&lt;br/&gt;confederation; Saskatoon, Canada, where the network's Technical
Secretariat &lt;br/&gt;is based; Tegucigalpa, Honduras, headquarters of the
network's &lt;br/&gt;Organizational Secretariat; Managua, Nicaragua, the base of
a Central &lt;br/&gt;American small farmers' network that helped found the
Peasant Road; and &lt;br/&gt;Bangalore, India, home of one of the most active of
the network's &lt;br/&gt;constituent organizations. In each site the interviews
and analysis of &lt;br/&gt;documentary materials will focus on the political
formation of activist individuals, the histories of &lt;br/&gt;organizational
consolidation, and the mobilization of resources and &lt;br/&gt;alliances. The
project will examine what movements defending economically &lt;br/&gt;marginal
constituencies gain and lose by forming part of global civil &lt;br/&gt;society,
as well as how new varieties of transnational politics have shaped
&lt;br/&gt;peasant and small farmer identities, both within the agriculturist
&lt;br/&gt;organizations and in relation to their NGO backers and antagonists.
The new &lt;br/&gt;knowledge generated by this proposal will advance our
understanding of how &lt;br/&gt;comparable grass-roots and global organizations
function.&lt;br/&gt;
