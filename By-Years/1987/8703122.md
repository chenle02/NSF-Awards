This proposal requests funds to help support the travel of approximately fifty
U.S. scientists to attend the XVth International Conference on the Physics of
Electronic and Atomic Collisions to be held in Brighton, England July 22-28,
1987. This is the main international conference in a broad area of atomic
physics, and is by leading scientists from all over the world. It is important
that a representative group of US scientists attend this conference, so they can
learn the latest research and ideas. Previous support of travel to earlier such
conferences has had a real impact on US physics.
