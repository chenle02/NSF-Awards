The computer data collection systems procured through this project are being
used to introduce Middlebury College undergraduate science students to an
important area of contemporary experimental science previously underrepresented
in the school's biology, chemistry, geology and physics curricula. These systems
permit the teaching of real-time computer techniques, an area of analytical
science whose coverage in earlier courses was predominantly descriptive.
Students in senior thesis programs and instrumental analysis courses gain
experience with state-of-the-art computing equipment similar to that which they
will encounter in graduate school or industry. In both the course-related
studies and independent senior projects, this equipment enhances students'
problem solving skills, and introduces them to contemporary computer techniques.
A pilot project conducted by the college with its own funds already has
validated the approach, and has enabled the development of materials and
methods.
