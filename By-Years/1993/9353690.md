9353690 Shymansky This Project is the result of a partnership between the
University of Iowa and the Iowa City Community School District, whose teachers
and administrators recently completed a science self study and made a commitment
to restructure their science program. The plan is to enhance all K-6 teachers in
the district by immersing them in inservice activities which: require them to
analyze the scientific basis of activities in the district's current science
program; allow them to examine potential supplemental and/or replacement
materials; and challenge them to refine and revise their science program to make
science more meaningful to students. Through the summer component of the project
three lead science teachers for each of the city's elementary schools will be
identified and prepared to provide support and inservice opportunities for their
colleagues. During the summer the lead teachers will have opportunities to
expand their own science knowledge, develop insights into children's science
reasoning, and improve their ability to use inquiry based instructional
strategies. During the school year these lead teachers will be given
opportunities to mentor their colleagues as they implement the school system's
inquiry based science units. The Iowa City School District's stature as a leader
in the Midwest will enable this project to serve as a model for other sites in
the Midwest, to serve as an exemplary placement for preservice elementary
teacher education and to provide leadership teams for future dissemination
efforts. The cost sharing for the project will be 50% of the National Science
Foundation support. ***
