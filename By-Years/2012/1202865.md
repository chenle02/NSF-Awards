Quantitative assessment of the population and functional diversity in
phytoplankton and coral 'holobiont' metagenomes

Coral reef health is declining while harmful algal blooms appear to be
increasing in frequency and distribution. Both are likely reflective of global
climate change. However, the dynamics of the microbial communities associated
with these aquatic habitats is not well known. The project goals are to analyze
metatranscriptomes of phytoplankton and coral associated microbes in order to:
1) characterize the genetic diversity of discrete populations and 2) evaluate
functional diversity by focusing on nutrient acquisition and secondary
metabolite genes.

The training goals are to further develop bioinformatics tools needed to
identify significantly different and similar gene expression occurring among
coral reefs and freshwater phytoplankton blooms. This project has the potential
to impact two different fields of biology. Typically, secondary metabolite type
genes (which make many of the antibiotics in use today) are overlooked in
studies of evolution and ecology because researchers are not interested in drug
discovery while natural product researchers do not have the expertise to
properly study the evolution and ecology of these gene types. This project will
help bridge the gap and place studies of natural products in the context of
evolution and ecology rather than simply for the discovery of novel drugs for
pharmaceutical companies. However, incorporating studies of natural products
into ecologically driven research will provide important data to researchers
looking to discover new pharmaceuticals. The project will also train young
scientists through MIT's undergraduate research program and establish the first
Coral Club in Cambridge where scientists can present research in an informal
setting and volunteer at museums in the Boston area.
