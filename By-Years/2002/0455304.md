The study of Hilbert schemes and vector bundles is a fundamental problem in
&lt;br/&gt;algebraic geometry. Their connections with physics and representation
theory &lt;br/&gt;were pioneered in the work of Atiyah and Penrose. The Hilbert
schemes of &lt;br/&gt;points on smooth surfaces together with its relation to
representation theory &lt;br/&gt;of infinite dimensional Lie algebras is a
particularly beautiful subject in &lt;br/&gt;algebraic geometry, which is
related to other areas including Gromov-Witten &lt;br/&gt;theory, Donaldson-
Thomas theory, the McKay correspondence, the S-duality &lt;br/&gt;conjecture,
integrable systems, orbifold cohomology, and the n!-conjecture &lt;br/&gt;in
algebraic combinatorics. In this project, Professor Qin intends to study
&lt;br/&gt;several problems concerning Hilbert schemes and moduli of vector
bundles in the &lt;br/&gt;general context of algebraic geometry and its
interplay with representation &lt;br/&gt;theory and string theory. The main
tools are techniques of vertex algebras, &lt;br/&gt;quantum cohomology, the
virtual localization formula, derived categories of &lt;br/&gt;sheaves, and
stable bundles on surfaces as well as on Calabi-Yau 3-folds. &lt;br/&gt;This
project also involves the participation and training of graduate students
&lt;br/&gt;and postdoctoral associates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Algebraic geometry
studies geometric objects described by polynomial equations.&lt;br/&gt;It has
been at the central stage of recent confluence between mathematics
and&lt;br/&gt;physics. Many of these interactions have led to profound
improvement in the &lt;br/&gt;understanding of both mathematics and physics.
Professor Qin's research helps &lt;br/&gt;to strength these interactions, and
has many of its roots in mathematical &lt;br/&gt;physics&lt;br/&gt;
