This grant improves the Digital Laboratory of the Computer Science Department
of the University of Dayton. This includes introducing modern single-board
microcomputer systems based on the Motorola 68000 chip and equipping the
laboratory with a logic analyzer compatible with this system. New electronic
equipment: oscilloscopes, power supplies, and meters, equip each student work
station and the capability to record transient signals is provided by the
acquisition of digital storage oscilloscopes. The students are also provided the
capability to analyze data communications signals and to perform experiments on
the characteristics and degradation of such signals. The institution is
providing matching funds in an amount equal to or greater than the funds
provided by the Foundation.
