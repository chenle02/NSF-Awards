The project will investigate the differences in chemistry for different faces on
calcite with respect to the elements Mg, Mn, Sr, Cd, Zn, and others. Most work
will involve synthetically produced sector zoning in calcite single crystals,
since growth parameters can be constrained and elements to be incorporated may
be chosen. Observations will also be made on natural materials for comparison.
Differences in elemental abundances between the sectors will be determined by
EPMA, which has proven adequate. Partitioning trends will be correlated directly
with differences in surface structure that can be predicted from several models
based on a knowledge of the crystal structure. Results will provide an
understanding of which aspects of the surface structure exert a significant
influence on partitioning, and for which elements the influence is most
important.
