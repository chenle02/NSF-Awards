The purpose of this grant is to acquire a high-resolution field- emission
scanning electron microscope (FESEM) with backscattered- electron-detection
capability. We are requesting the Hitachi S- 4500-II, which produces high-
resolution images at both low and high accelerating voltages, accommodates a
range of sample sizes, and has an excellent service and reliability record.
Other equipment items essential for obtaining or processing high- resolution
images are also requested, including a critical-point dryer, a thin-film sputter
coater, and a high-resolution printer. The applicants are a group of
investigators at Johns Hopkins University Medical School who need the 10- to
20-fold improved resolution offered by FESEM over standard scanning electron
microscopes. The microscope will be housed in the Johns Hopkins Microscopy
Center, a facility that offers ready access to optical and electron microscopes
to both the Hopkins community and the wider scientific community in Baltimore.
