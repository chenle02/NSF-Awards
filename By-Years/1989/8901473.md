Professor Malkus will conduct experimental and theoretical studies of bounded
elliptical flow in order to isolate principal mechanisms in the broad-band
secondary instabilities of shearing flow. Earlier results establish that the
instability is a parametric sub-harmonic resonance, whose exponential growth is
limited by the transfer of angular momentum from the basic flow. It is observed
that a three percent ellipticity imposed upon a ten centimeter diameter fluid-
filled cylinder can catalyze a thirty percent reduction in the fluid rotation
rate. This swift inertial deceleration is countered by a slow viscous spin-up,
resulting in intermittent behavior in the just post-critical regime. Theoretical
study will be directed towards a deductive understanding of the mechanism
responsible for this highly efficient withdrawal of energy from the vortex flow.
Tidal forces also cause elliptical flow. An additional aspect of this study will
be the exploration of three-dimensional instabilities in stratified atmospheric,
oceanic, and earth-core tidal processes. Professor Malkus will also continue the
theoretical search for the deductive foundation of observed statistical
stability. The success of the efficiency function as a measure of statistical
stability in the channel flow offers hope for the discovery of a more general
integral form. //
