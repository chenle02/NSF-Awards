The main emphasis of this project is on the evaluation of wavelet transform
technique as applied to the analysis of mechanical transients. Such transients
are strong indicators of impending machine and machine component failure.
Transients are signals which are much smaller in duration than the observation
interval, and are non-periodic, non-stationary, and often non-symmetrical. The
wavelet transform method is used as a powerful diagnostic tool for transient
detection and classification. Typical examples include generator arcing, rubbing
in journal bearings, and spills in internal combustion-engines. Significant
improvements are made in the repeatability of coefficients for modulated
transients, in the separability of transients using a mixed probability density
function approach, in the detectability using the transform as a matched filter
and using artificial neural network, and in the general performance of approach
by automating the classification. In addition, tests are conducted extensively
on real data. The results of this research provide an industrial tool as
powerful for the analysis of transients as the spectrum analyzer is for the
analysis of periodic waveforms.*** //
