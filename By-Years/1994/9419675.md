9419675 Rieppel The Sauropterygia is a major clade of fossil diapsid reptiles
which successfully invaded the Mesozoic sea. The Triassic stem-group
Sauropterygia provide a prime example for the study of the early evolutionary
history of a major clade which involves the shift from one adaptive zone to
another, i.e. the invasion of the marine habitat by reptiles. The study of the
evolutionary history of this group, involving complex paleobiogeographical
relations and fundamental changes of functional morphologic complexes, must be
set against the background of a well corroborated pattern of phylogenetic
interrelationships. Complete knowledge of sauropterygians from the Germanic
Muschelkalk provides the ideal background for a revision of Triassic
sauropterygian faunas outside this region including faunas from the Middle
Triassic of Spain, Rumania, Israel, China, and the western United States. The
phylogenetic interrelationships of stem-group Sauropterygia will be analyzed on
a global scale. The resulting cladogram will be used as basis for an
investigation of the palebiogeographical, paleoecological and functional
morphological correlates of early sauropterygian evolution.
