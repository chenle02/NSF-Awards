The Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov differential equations link many areas of mathematics
and physics, including representation theory (the study of symmetries),
algebraic geometry (study of solutions of polynomial equations), and conformal
field theory (from mathematical physics). The goal of this project is to develop
Hodge theoretic techniques, which are complex analytic in nature, in the study
of these differential equations. This work will produce new structures relating
representation theory, Hodge theory, the theory of motives, and mathematical
physics, which will further develop the relations between these fields and their
computational aspects. The project will provide research training opportunities
for graduate students.

In more detail, three interrelated research projects will be undertaken. The
first, is to develop a motivic factorization formula for invariants and
conformal block local systems (which are local systems on the moduli of smooth
pointed curves associated to a simple Lie algebra and representations) in genus
zero. The second is to determine the structure of the Hodge-Galois fusion rings
and representation rings that arise as a consequence of motivic factorization.
Finally, the third is to compute examples, particularly for cases when the
conformal blocks local system is rigid where the global monodromy is finite,
using Hodge theoretic criteria.
