ABSTRACT DMS - 0204480. PI: C. Robin Graham

This project will study conformal and CR geometry. Algebraic, analytic, and
geometric aspects will be considered via the introduction of metrics in higher
dimensions which are associated to the original conformal or CR geometry.
Understanding the higher dimensional spaces gives rise to problems of
independent interest. Motivation is provided by the AdS/CFT correspondence in
physics.

Conformal geometry is the study of properties of space which are unchanged by
transformations which preserve angles but not necessarily lengths. Conformal
mapping and geometry has found numerous applications to practical problems for
many years, such as the design of airplane wings. Conformal geometry in higher
dimensions has recently been the object of much interest in so-called
holographic correspondences in physics. This project will study properties of
the underlying geometric spaces, partially motivated by the interaction with the
physical theories.
