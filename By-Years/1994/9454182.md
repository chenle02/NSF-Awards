This proposal outlines an interdisciplinary traineeship program for the study
of cognition and environmental contexts. The program brings together
psychologist, anthropologists, and other social scientists who are interested in
the scientific study of graduate students who will be knowledgeable about both
methods and theory in both anthropology and cognitive science. The innovative
structural components include psychology, participation in interdisciplinary
research seminars meeting weekly throughout their graduate careers and
participation in research at several field sites and collaborative research
installations already established in locations in many parts of the world by
University of Michigan scientists. the students trained by such a program are
expected by be uniquely qualified to develop a scientific understanding of
cultural aspects of cognitive structures and processes.
