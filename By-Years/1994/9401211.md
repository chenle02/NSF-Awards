9401211 Grace, Nabil F. This research presents a new concept dealing with the
development of a corrosion-free bridge system that requires no shoring or forms
and has superior characteristics compared to existing bridge systems. The non-
corrosive bridge system will be built of: (i) pre-cast modified double tree (DT)
panels, (ii) cast-in- place fiber reinforced decks, connected to the DT through
fiber reinforced shear connectors, and (iii) external post-tension cables made
of advanced composite strands. This bridge would be adapted to rural/short span
bridges. An analytical and experimental study will be conducted by the junior
and senior undergraduate students to examine the static, dynamic, fatigue and
ultimate load characteristics of the new bridge system. ***
