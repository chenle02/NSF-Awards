This award provides partial support in the amount of $30,000 for an eighteen-
month study and report on material flow accounting of natural resources. Support
is also being requested from the following federal agencies: Department of
Energy, Department of Defense, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and the
U.S. Geological Survey. Materials flow accounting, which can be used to track
the flow of a material from the time it is extracted to its ultimate disposal,
provides a means for making better economic and environmental decisions at all
process stages. This study will examine (1) the usefulness of creating and
maintaining materials flow accounts for developing sound public policy on the
environment, materials, and energy; (2) the technical basis for materials flow
analysis; (3) the current state of materials flow information, including what
data are collected, where it resides, quality, scale and completeness of the
data, formats, accessibility, and the tools and methods available for analyzing
the data; (4) the ways the public and private sectors are currently using this
information and how materials flow accounts can be improved through partnerships
or access to additional data; and (5) who should have institutional
responsibility for collecting, maintaining and providing access to additional
data for materials flow accounts.
