The focus of this research is concerned with developing methods for rhodium-
catalyzed allylic substitution and [4+2+2] carbocyclization reactions. In the
former, the issue of diastereoselectivity in intermolecular allylic alkylation
using both cyclic and acyclic ketone enolates will be addressed. In the latter,
diastereoselective and enantioselective metal catalyzed [4+2+2] carbocyclization
will be used for the construction of complex octanoid frameworks. The
combination of allylic alkylation with carbocyclization methodology will lead to
the development of a novel tandem process that will enable the future synthesis
of natural products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and
Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. P. Andrew
Evans of the Department of Chemistry at Indiana University. Professor Evans will
focus his research efforts on developing new catalytic methodology for allylic
substitution and carbocyclization reactions. The methodology will allow for the
preparation of intermediates related to the synthesis of natural products. In
terms of broader impacts, the project has potential for the pharmaceutical and
agricultural industries and the training of undergraduates, graduate students
and postdoctorals will be carried out. &lt;br/&gt;
