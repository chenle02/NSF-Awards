The conservation of endangered species often hinges on the avoidance of
inbreeding depression or the retention of genetic variation. Therefore, it is of
fundamental importance for conservation biology to understand and characterize
inbreeding depression. In the proposed research, inbreeding depression in
Drosophila melanogaster as a model for endangered species in which such
experimentation would not be possible. The influence of inbreeding on all
components of fitness will be examined. In addition, the effect of inbreeding in
the normal laboratory environment and two stress environments will be examined
to obtain a more realistic view of the impact of inbreeding on endangered
species. In a second component of the study a computer simulation program will
be developed to analyze pedigree populations. Both genetic linkage and natural
selection will be incorporated. As a result, the effect of different rates of
inbreeding on inbreeding depression and the conditions for purging a population
of lethal alleles will be determined. Furthermore, this technique will be
applied to known pedigrees of endangered species to determine the expected
inbreeding depression.
