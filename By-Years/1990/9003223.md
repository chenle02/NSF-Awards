This project will involve the study of singularities in the theory of singular
integrals and differentiation of integrals, on the d-bar equation on domains of
finite type in several complex variables, and on dispersive nonlinear partial
differential equations, with emphasis on applications of techniques from
harmonic analysis and singular integrals. The five major topics to be studied
are (1) the d-bar equation on domains of finite type in several complex
variables, (2) singular maximal functions and differentiation of integrals, (3)
nonlinear dispersive partial differential equations, (4) singular integrals on
sets and analytic capacity, and (5) a question in non-commutative ergodic
theory. The research in this project is aimed at the study of partial
differential equations and the tools used in their analysis. In particular, it
involves the applications of the ideas of harmonic analysis to problems in
several complex variables and nonlinear dispersive equations.
