9521835 Sperling In spite of their unobtrusive size and appearance, tortricid
moths are among the most significant pests of forest trees and fruit orchards
worldwide. More than 6,600 species have been named and there are at least as
many left to be described, particularly in tropical regions. Many of the pest
species are part of complexes that continue to challenge modern taxonomists.
Unfortulately, few people have the expertise or experience that is required to
unravel the diversity and complexity of tortricid moths. %%% The objectives of
this project are to train students in morphological, ecological and molecular
investigations of tortricid taxonomy, and to produce electronic databases and
keys for the identification of these moths. Catalogues and classifications will
be developed for several tribes of tortricids in the New World. This work will
allow insight into the origins of plant feeding specialization and tropical
biodiversity. The project will also contribute to the development of computer
infrastructure for organizing and accessing knowledge about an economically
important family of moths. ***
