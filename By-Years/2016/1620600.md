Newer faculty often find the process of writing their first grant proposals to
be quite challenging. Professors Malika Jeffries-EL of Boston University and
Jeffrey Moore of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign are organizing a
workshop that seeks to clarify that proposal writing and reviewing processes and
position newer faculty to write more competitive proposals to federal funding
agencies. Participants have the opportunity to network with successful grant
recipients and program officers. They engage in mock panels, speed coaching
sessions, and other activities designed to provide them with a better
understanding of how to put together a research plan that is ambitious yet
practical. Broader impacts are also discussed in terms are educational
activities, outreach and applications to societal problems.

The workshop, supported by the Division of Chemistry, is entitled, "Chemistry
Early Career Investigator Workshop," will be held on March 10-12, 2016 in
Arlington, Virginia. This workshop brings together 100 junior faculty from a
broad range of institutions and demographics to discuss steps in strategically
crafting research ideas, planning educational and outreach activities, and
assessing and evaluating project aims.
