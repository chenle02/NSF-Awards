This project involves the synthesis of the theonellamides, a family of complex
dodecapeptides of marine origin. Several of the requisite amino acids have
inspired the development of new methodology, including the construction of
1,4-dialkylimidazoles and beta-amino-gamma-hydroxy-acids. Assembly of the
bicyclic skeleton will test the state-of-the-art vis-a-vis protecting group
strategies and peptide coupling reactions. A number of congeners bear a novel
glycosylimidazolium ion that presents a synthetic challenge and a unique
opportunity to investigate peptide-carbohydrate interactions in a small,
homogeneous system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and
Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor Carol
Taylor of the Department of Chemistry at Louisiana State University. Professor
Taylor's research efforts are concerned with the chemical synthesis and
characterization of peptides containing unusual amino acids. In particular, this
project is focused on the construction of the theonellamides, antifungal
compounds characterized by a bridging histidinoalanine residue. This cross-
linking amino acid has also been identified in dentin, eye cataracts and
connective tissue where levels appear to correlate with age and some disease
states.
