The content and pedagogy of the General Chemistry course for science majors is
being revised to substantially reduce the importance of the lecture by utilizing
small group cooperative learning procedures. A renewed emphasis on descriptive
chemistry, a reduction in the extent of the mathematical treatment of chemical
concepts and the need for students to solve problems that requiring them to
integrate material from previous studies are hallmarks of the new course
sequence.
