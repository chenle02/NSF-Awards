The ShareNet partnership will join the University of Kansas, fifty-three school
districts from the metropolitan Kansas City area, and the Silicon Prairie
Technology Association. The partnership will use technology to provide staff
development for teachers, with the ultimate goal of enhancing the science

be created and made accessible through network technology.
