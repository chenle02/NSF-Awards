This research revolves around the acquisition of a Single Instruction, Multiple
Data (SIMD) computer and its applications to a variety of problems. The problems
include: parallel group algorithms, natural language processing, neural network
learning algorithms, and the scientist's assistant project. The SIMD computer is
uniquely suited as both an exploratory platform upon which to test new
algorithms and as a compute server to actually solve problems that would
otherwise require substantial super computer resources to solve. The next
generation of super computers are likely to be highly parallel computers
following the Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD) architecture and/or the
Multiple Instruction, Multiple Data (MIMD) architecture. In either case,
algorithms need to be developed and tested for the architectures to see what
problems run best on what architectures. This can be done in two ways. The first
is to pick arbitrary problems and develop algorithms for both architectures and
then compare the results. The second method is to look for problem classes that
are best solved by a particular architecture. The group at Northeastern have
chosen the second alternative and are looking for SIMD algorithms for problems
that seem to be particularly well suited for that architecture. Two problems in
particular are promising areas of research. The parallel group algorithms are
intended to solve computationally intensive problems that could not easily be
solved on a single processor architecture. The scientist's assistant project is
a sophisticated very large pattern matching application that is particularly
well suited to the SIMD architecture.
