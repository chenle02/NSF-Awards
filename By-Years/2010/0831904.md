NEDG: Efficient Protocol Design for RFID Systems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Internet
revolutionized the world by connecting numerous computers together. Now people
are witnessing another revolution when billions of physical items, such as
clothes, folders, books, and other items are connected to the computers. This
vision is becoming a reality, thanks to the supporting Radio Frequency
Identification (RFID) technology, which allows a reader to read remotely
information from an inexpensive tag attached to an item. To enable this
technology for reading massive tags for realistic applications, it is crucial to
design efficient protocols for RFID communication. The analysis to the current
RFID research shows that a dichotomy exists between the high layer data consumer
and the low layer wireless communication engineer -- most of the information
visible to the low layer is hidden from the high layer. This restricted,
throttled interface results in efficiency and security related problems.
&lt;br/&gt;To solve the problem, this project aims to apply cross-layer design
methodology so that high layer data users may harness more information exposed
from below to solve the existing problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual
Merit: The project will design protocols and algorithms that deliver better
performance for very relevant inventory control applications, help researchers
in RFID industry to understand the power of "cross-layer design", and guide the
design of RFID communication protocols to make relevant information available to
the high layer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: This work will potentially
have an impact in the industrial standard for RFID communication protocols. The
project will also integrate research and education by introducing algorithm and
system design in RFID to students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
