Desert dust accounts for about two thirds of the total mass of particulate
matter in our atmosphere. One of the reasons that dust is so abundant is that it
has increased substantially, perhaps even doubled, since the Industrial
Revolution. This large increase is probably because of human actions like
clearing land for agriculture. Surprisingly, the impact of the increasing desert
dust on the climate system has remained mysterious. In fact, it is still an open
question whether this historical increase in dust has contributed to or
counteracted greenhouse gas warming of the climate system. This project will
answer this question by (i) determining the change in Earth’s energy budget
produced by the scattering and absorbing of solar and terrestrial radiation by
dust, (ii) determining the amount by which dust has increased since the
Industrial Revolution, and (iii) determining the resultant change in Earth’s
energy budget from the increase in dust. These goals will be achieved by
combining satellite observations, aircraft measurements, numerous records of how
deposition of desert dust has changed across the world, and numerical
simulations of how dust affects Earth’s radiation budget. The research will be
performed by a team of scientists that include undergraduate and graduate
students and a postdoctoral scholar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Determining the
climate impact of the historical increase in desert dust is important because
calculations of how sensitive the climate system is to greenhouse warming depend
on the extent to which greenhouse warming has been counteracted by cooling
produced by particulate matter like dust. This project will thus result in more
accurate predictions of the climate changes produced by future increases in
greenhouse gases, which is critical to an effective societal response to those
changes. The project will also continue a successful outreach project to under-
served high schools in the Los Angeles area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
