Members of the genus Araceae include morphologically and ecologically diverse
tropical plants. In some genera, shoot development is altered allowing the plant
to climb toward the forest canopy. Dr. Thomas Ray proposes to use state-of-the-
art approaches to studying shoot and leaf development in various genera of
aroids, in order to learn how different patterns of plant development have
evolved. A microcomputer-based image analysis system will be used to measure
shape and size of leaves and shoot organs, and these new data will be studied
against the framework of ancestor-descendant relationships. The proposed
research will reveal the evolutionary pathways that different developmental
types have traversed. The proposed research has implications beyond the study of
Araceae taxonomy and evolution. Biologists are keenly interested in how
development is altered during evolution, and how development constrains the path
that evolution may take. Dr. Ray's work will also broaden the application of
computer-aided research in botany, and will provide new computer software to the
community of evolutionary systematists.
