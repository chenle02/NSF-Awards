This research concerns the role of genetic variation at metabolic enzyme genes
in the adaptation to heterogeneous environments. Recent work has shown that
acorn barnacles (Semibalanus balanoides) carrying alternative forms of the
enzyme encoded by the MPI gene experience different survivorship at opposite
ends of the environmental gradient between high- and low-tide zones. Other
genetic markers in the acorn barnacle genome do not show this pattern, thus
implicating natural selection at or near the MPI gene. The investigators propose
to clone the MPI gene, determine its DNA sequence, and identify the specific
changes in MPI that confer the habitat-specific survivorship of the two enzyme
forms. This will be achieved by DNA sequence analyses of the two forms of the
MPI gene, by analyses of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the gene that vary
between tide zones, and through growth and survivorship experiments in a flowing
sea water lab where thermal stress and dietary sugars important in MPI function
are manipulated.

The goal of this research is to understand the functional significance of
genetic variation in heterogeneous environments. All organisms face
environmental unpredictability; how they respond to this uncertainty through
genetic adaptations is a fundamental problem in the biological sciences. In
barnacles, two crucial environmental variables are thermal and desiccation
stress. Because these stresses will increase in the future, this barnacle model
may help us understand the genetic impacts of climate change.
