The Southwestern Center for Arithmetical Algebraic Geometry was founded in 1997
with support from a Group Infrastructure Grant from the National Science
Foundation. The organizing premise was that by&lt;br/&gt;creatively deploying
the current concentration of research strength in Arithmetical Algebraic
Geometry in the Southwest, we could recreate, outside of the traditional
centers, some of the best aspects of the best programs for the benefit of our
own research and that of students and post-docs, both locally and nationally.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our premise that it is possible to recreate in
concentrated form the virtues of the traditional centers has been amply
demonstrated to be correct. The current project will build on this base and will
contribute to research and education in a wider area of mathematics and across
the country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal goals of the project are: to
spread our model of a concentrated, interactive, and highly collaborative center
to other areas of mathematics and other areas of the country; to develop and
distribute high-quality reusable components from the Arizona Winter School and
our distinguished lecture series (such as lecture notes, project descriptions,
and video footage of lectures); and to continue to serve our constituency of
advanced graduate students and post-docs in arithmetical algebraic geometry.
