This is a planning grant in the research application program. Motivated by the
need of modeling complex robotic environments, this project will explore new
methods on object modeling/representation. Current modeling systems are limited
to representing only the geometrical information of isolated objects, which is
far less than sufficient. To be more effective and informative, a modeling
system should also describe the changeable aspect of an object, i.e., the object
states, the functionalities of an object, and the interrelations among objects.
It seems, thus, reasonable to propose that modeling should be dynamic and
sensor-related. The preliminary research and planning activities will focus on
surveying the ground for, and identifying problems of dynamic modeling, which
aims to make manipulating and reasoning about sensory information an integrated
part of modeling, taking into account uncertainties. The objective is to gain
sufficient insight about the subject in order to conduct more substantial
research.
