9618325 Zumberge This award will support a gravity study of sulphide deposits in
the Middle Valley region off the northwest cost of the United States. These
deposits occur where hydrothermal circulation systems discharge at the seafloor
and provide a unique guide to the formation of similar deposits that are mined
on land. Cores of these deposits have been recovered by the Ocean Drilling
Program. The distribution of sulphides in the sediments in these area is
reasonably well known at the core locations. The objective of the present
project is to use this existing data to verify the capability of a new towed
gravimeter system developed by the principal investigator, and to provide new
information on the overall distribution of sulphides in the sediments
surrounding the drillholes. ***
