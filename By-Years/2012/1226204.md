This project builds on a successful previous program that developed a virtual
simulator for teaching construction engineering. The advancements that this
project is making include adding varying levels of complexity so that students
of all knowledge levels will find the materials engaging and not overwhelming.

This serious educational simulation is used to bring a sense of authenticity to
students who cannot work in a real construction project due to the inherent
danger in the physical environment. Through the simulation, students can safely
learn from mistakes.

In addition to expanding the simulator's capabilities the project is evaluating
the efficacy of serious simulations in Undergraduate Engineering Education.
Knowledge generated from this project will have wide application in many other
engineering education settings.
