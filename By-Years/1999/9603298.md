The proposed research seeks to derive new results in the theory and application
of mathematical logic as applied to problems in computer science. Because many
of the classical results of logic are not applicable in the modern context, it
is necessary to develop a new theoretical framework. One development would
extend the approach and methods of finite model theory beyond finite models.
Another development would investigate theoretical foundations for dealing with
evolving algebras used to describe structures in computer science that change
during the computation process. A third goal of the research is to study
decidability and complexity questions relevant to computer science problems.
