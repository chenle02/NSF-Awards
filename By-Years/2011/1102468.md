This workshop facilitates the interaction of researchers working with patent
data for the purpose of scholarship on innovation policy. The focus is on
advancing and sharing knowledge on a series of technical issues including name
disambiguation and matching patent data to other economically-relevant data
sources. Intellectual Merit: The workshop provides a unique forum for the
exchange of patent data measurement related topics with the focus of informing
innovation policy in a multi-disciplinary environment. It reduces unnecessary
duplicative effort on data, measurement, and methodology, and hence increases
the capacity to build both theory and for innovation policy. The workshop also
advances an important SciSIP goal of creating a bridge between the academic and
practitioner communities by directly engaging the United States Patent and
Trademark Office (USPTO) and the academic community through the workshop
participation of the USPTO's Chief Economist.

Broader Impact: The workshop advances the establishment of a robust data
infrastructure for cumulative, transparent, and high-quality research and the
ability to translate that research. It is an important step in continuing the
empirical research tradition that has been built around the economic
consequences of innovation. It provides an environment for high-quality high-
impact research, with an emphasis on measurement. It fosters the development of
a research community and research norms, and facilitates cumulative research
across this community.
