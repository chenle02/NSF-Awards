Evidence for delamination of the lower lithosphere under regions of tectonic
thickening includes rapid uplift coincident with the onset of voluminous
crustally-derived magmatism, sometimes accompanied by mantle-derived basalt. Two
localities in the central Andes appear to be good candidates to study magmatic
rocks associated with delamination: 1) the Argentine Puna Plateau in the late
tertiary, and 2) the Gondwana margin in the late Paleozoic-Triassic in the
Chilean Frontal Cordillera. This project is to use isotopic mass tracers and
trace element pressure-temperature indicators, along with geologic and
geophysical constraints, to test and modify the delamination hypothesis in these
two regions, as well as to characterize the delaminated Andean lithospheric
material, and to examine its relation to southern Hemisphere mantle
heterogeneity.
