With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program that is
co-funded by Chemistry, Professor Stefan Paula from Northern Kentucky University
and colleague Heather Bullen will acquire an isothermal titration calorimeter
(ITC). The proposal is aimed at enhancing research training and education at all
levels, especially in areas such as (a) characterization of protein/ligand
interactions, (b) impact of siderophores/metal oxide interactions on biofilm
formation, and (c) studies of custom nanoparticle interactions with blood brain
barrier lipid models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Isothermal titration calorimetry
(ITC) is a very sensitive thermodynamic technique that is used to characterize
binding interactions between species such as those between a small molecule and
an enzyme. ITC measures directly the heat absorbed or released during a binding
process. This provides insight on the strength of chemical and biochemical
binding interactions. This calorimeter will also be incorporated into laboratory
classes at NKU and will serve collaborators at nearby University of Cincinnati.
This instrument will be used not only in research but also in educational and
outreach activities with high and middle schools.
