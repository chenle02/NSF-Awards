The NSF-supported Program of Medium Energy Nuclear Physics will allow the
nuclear physics group at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign to
continue to lead and contribute to high-impact experiments in international
nuclear physics research. The research program fea-tures two major themes,
namely 1) The Structure and Formation of Hadrons, and 2) Fundamental Symmetries
and the Standard Model. The physics pursued by experiments in this program will
help answer questions such as, "How is the proton built?" and "Is the current
particle physics standard model correct?" Specific activities include the
following major, established international experiments: G0, HERMES, MuLan,
MuCap, PHENIX, E906-Drell-Yan, MuSun, Daya Bay, nEDM, g-2, and Mu2e. The first
four of these have completed data taking and all activities of the group are
related to data analysis and publication preparation. The other experiments are
running or are in design or construction phases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In
addition to direct physics research outcomes, the group has reached beyond the
laboratory to make significant contributions to education and outreach and will
continue to do so. Research projects contribute substantially to the education
of a large number of postdocs, graduate, and undergraduate students. Outreach
efforts, such as a major contribution to the literature and public appreciation
of the Physics of Baseball, continue to receive broad appreciation.
