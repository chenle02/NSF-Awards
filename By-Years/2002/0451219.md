This project is a research experiences for undergraduates (REU) site in
Sociology at the University of Delaware's Disaster Research Center. The site
offers 10 undergraduate students nine weeks of hands-on training in the social
science aspects of disasters. Intellectual Merit- Students work with faculty
experts to generate hypotheses and test them using existing data sets. Research
projects will focus on issues such as: disaster mitigation, preparedness,
response and recovery; warnings and technology; and disaster vulnerability and
resilience. Broader Impact- Professional development workshops held concurrently
with the research activities provide students with training in computer skills,
GRE preparation, applying to graduate school, and grant writing. Students are
also exposed to significant coursework in research methodology, social science
approaches to disasters, and the ethical implications of the research process.
Provisions for students to continue their research with mentors from their home
institutions are a major component of site activities. This site is co-funded by
the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.
