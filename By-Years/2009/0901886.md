"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5)." &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective:&lt;br/&gt;The objective of
the proposed research is to develop solid-state devices&lt;br/&gt;for achieving
controlled and efficient coupling between single photons and&lt;br/&gt;single
electrons confined in microstructures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual
Merit:&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit is the ability to efficiently transfer
information&lt;br/&gt;between the quantum state of an electron spin and the
polarization state&lt;br/&gt;of a photon. This allows for unprecedented studies
of electron spin&lt;br/&gt;dynamics using quantum optical measurements. The
research team has the&lt;br/&gt;required material-growth, device-fabrication,
and quantum-optics skills&lt;br/&gt;and resources to perform this challenging
project. To complement the&lt;br/&gt;research, the team will collaborate with
the Allosphere, which is a&lt;br/&gt;virtual reality research center at UCSB,
and with local high schools (with&lt;br/&gt;a predominantly Hispanic student
population) to provide high-school&lt;br/&gt;students with an unforgettable
science experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;The broader
impacts of this effort are the direct relevance to the
micro&lt;br/&gt;optoelectronics industry (the research is based on cutting-
edge&lt;br/&gt;technologies and materials from that industry), the importance
for&lt;br/&gt;fundamental studies in confined electron and hole properties
in&lt;br/&gt;semiconductor, and the outstanding training of PhD students in
Engineering&lt;br/&gt;and Physics. Furthermore the ability to establish a one-
to-one relation&lt;br/&gt;between an electron, the ultimate representation of a
locally stored bit&lt;br/&gt;of information, and a photon, the ultimate
representation of a flying&lt;br/&gt;bit of information, would potentially have
a tremendous impact on&lt;br/&gt;ultra-low-energy consuming classical and
quantum communication and&lt;br/&gt;computation systems. Finally, high-school
students will be inspired to&lt;br/&gt;follow a career in science.
