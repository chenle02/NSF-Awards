At the heart of this proposal is the very difficult X-ray crystallography
reconstruction problem - given the magnitude of the Fourier transform of the
electron density of a crystal, reconstruct the electron density, and, hence,
determine the locations of the atoms of the molecule to be imaged. The major
theme is a new statistical approach based on Markov random fields which promises
to permit easier and more effective incorporation of prior information such as
the possible locations of the atoms, and on the valence structure of the bonds,
and a more consistent use of statistical information. Methods which will be
developed during the course of this investigation will be useful in other
contexts such as pattern recognition and nonconvex optimization.
