Agonists invoke a variety of intracellular messengers to transduce their
signals. To discern the relevant molecules in the mediation of a specific
cellular function, complimentary biochemical and functional assays are required.
This proposal outlines experiments to combine these approaches to elucidate the
mechanism of transmitter modulation of neuronal excitability via second
messengers. To this end, the present application involves two simple systems
where the electrophysiological aspects of modulation are well described. Sensory
neurons were chosen as a model for modulation of Ca++ conductance by amines,
such as norepinephrine. Sympathetic neurons were chosen to examine the mechanism
of cholinergic and peptidergic modulation of K+ conductance. The goal of these
studies is to determine which second messenger systems are employed in the
modulation of these different voltage gated conductances. The studies share a
common approach: we will examine several key substrates, products and enzyme
activities along the metabolic pathways and then compare the findings with
biophysical studies involving selective activation or inhibition at critical
junctures in the phosphoinositide and arachidonate cascades. The proposed
studies also share a common goal: to elucidate the mechanism(s) underlying
modulation of voltage-gated conductances critical to the control of neuronal
excitability and transmitter secretion.
