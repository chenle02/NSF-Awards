9320196 Gibson A "polyrotaxane" consists of cyclic molecules physically threaded
onto a linear macromolecule with no covalent bonds between the cyclics and the
linear backbone; bulky end groups may be fitted to the chain ends to prevent
loss of the macrocycles via dethreading. Polyrotaxanes show unique behavior in
terms of solubility, solid state structure and phase transitions. In this
research, fundamental understanding of the threading of cyclic molecules by
linear species is sought with respect to factors such as the nature of the two
components (size, rigidity, structural similarity), the solvent (conformational
aspects of the two components) and temperature. Entirely new polyrotaxanes of
several types will be synthesized. Rotaxanes derived from polymeric macrocycles,
both backbone and pendant, will be utilized in blend compatibilization and
viscosity enhancement. Dendrimers with rotaxane surfaces will allow tailoring of
the shape and surface functionality of these versatile entities. Self-assembly
will be utilized in two ways: 1) to generate copolymers of block and graft types
through complexation and rotaxane formation and 2 use of the physical
functionality associated with the cyclic and linear components in the
preparation of novel "slip link" macromolecules, which are expected to be
uniquely compliant in both tension and compression. Results from this research
will span the range from basic understanding, practical application to
manipulate properties of known backbones, and preparation of entirely new types
of structures. ***
