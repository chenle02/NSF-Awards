9413880 Soyster Pennsylvania State University, University of Washington,
University of Puerto Rico, and the Department of Energy/Sandia National
Laboratories have teamed up to create an alternative core curriculum in
undergraduate engineering focused on manufacturing. This new curriculum, which
may start as early as the student's freshman year, will feature practice-based
courses, building prototypes in a "Learning Factory", and student teams that
compete for internal funding to build a new "product" on time and within budget-
just as they would in a firm. The schools anticipate this new curriculum will
eventually attract one third of their undergraduate engineering students. These
three universities alone graduate 4% of the nation's engineers each year,
including 4.2% of the women and 11.7% of the minority engineers.
