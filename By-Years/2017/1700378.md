This award will provide support for US participants, especially women, graduate
students, postdocs, and junior faculty, to attend the twenty-ninth and thirtieth
international conferences in Formal Power Series and Algebraic Combinatorics
(FPSAC). The 2017 edition will be held in London, United Kingdom, on July 9-13,
2017 (more info on the website https://sites.google.com/site/fpsac2017/). The
2018 edition will be held in Vancouver, Canada, on July 16-20, 2018 (more info
on the website http://fpsac.org). The most important annual conference series in
algebraic combinatorics in the world, FPSAC offers young American researchers a
unique opportunity to interact closely with top mathematicians from many
countries. Each conference, which includes nine one-hour plenary lectures,
thirty half-hour contributed talks, and forty posters, will attract over 200
participants from all over the world.

A distinguishing characteristic of FPSAC conferences is the concerted effort to
recognize and encourage outstanding young scientists. At least one plenary
speaker is an "emerging star," and talented young researchers are well
represented among the speakers selected for contributed talks. Another special
feature of the FPSAC conferences is a continued tradition of inclusiveness. The
conference seeks to draw substantial participation from underrepresented groups.
Furthermore, English and French have been designated as official languages for
FPSAC 2017 and 2018 to promote a diverse pool of participants. Attendance at
this conference will be exceptionally valuable for graduate students and junior
researchers. Somewhat interdisciplinary, the conferences link research in
combinatorics to other topics in pure mathematics such as algebraic geometry,
commutative algebra, representation theory, K-theory and symplectic geometry,
and to topics in other sciences such as computer science, physics, and biology.
