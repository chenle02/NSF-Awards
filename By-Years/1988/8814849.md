This Research in Undergraduate Institution (RUI) project is in the general area
of analytical and surface chemistry and in the subfield of separations science.
The focus of this research is on the development of new chemically bonded
stationary phases for chromatography. In general, the research involves new
synthetic approaches to bonding organic moieties to silica as well as
modification of alumina surfaces. Four major synthetic steps are proposed
involving 1) chlorination/Grignard chemistry, 2) silica hydride intermediates,
3) bonded olefin modification and 4) bonded liquid crystal stationary phases.
The ultimate goal of the proposed research is to provide a better understanding
of bonded phase interactions and to better understand the role of the support
surface in chromatographic separations. This research is designed to better
understand how molecules are separated using chromatography. New types of
schemes are proposed for preparing novel columns for separating chemicals. The
ultimate goal of this research is to provide a better theory for these
separations which will in turn allow prediction of better separation schemes.
