Partial differential equations, probability, and analytical methods are
fundamental tools in the modeling and description of financial markets. The
purpose of this meeting is to showcase new methods, directions and the most
recent research in partial differential equations, probability, stochastic
control, numerical analysis, and their application to mathematical finance.
Invited presentations by leading academic and industry researchers highlight the
latest research in the application of partial differential equations to option
pricing, portfolio optimization, risk management, and high-frequency trading.
Their presentations focus on degenerate-elliptic and degenerate-parabolic
variational equations and inequalities for stochastic volatility models in
finance; free-boundary value problems; stochastic control and the Hamilton-
Jacobi-Bellman equation; non-linear partial differential equations in finance;
stochastic optimal control, high-frequency finance and algorithmic trading; and
numerical solution of partial-integro differential equations and inequalities.
The invited talks are complemented by presentations on these themes contributed
by promising young researchers.

The conference will help foster academic and industry research collaborations;
introduce industry problems to academic researchers; introduce academic research
and methods to industry practitioners; facilitate scientific networking
opportunities for junior practitioners and graduate students; and foster
mathematical finance and partial differential equations as a research discipline
for Ph.D. students in pure and applied mathematics. We especially welcome
participation by women, minorities, and other underrepresented groups, as well
as students and junior researchers.
