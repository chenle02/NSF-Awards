This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project proposes the computational
modeling of hazards related to explosives by combined means of modeling,
algorithmic and computer science developments. Key concepts to be explored
include the use of AMR and TaskGraphs for load balance. The interdisciplinary
research proposed will provide compelling new science across fields and may
potentially transfer into a greater social gain in the safety of transporting
explosive materials.
