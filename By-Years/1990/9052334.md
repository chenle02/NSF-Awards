This project updates and improves the engineering technology thermofluids
laboratory through the addition of a computerized data acquisition system. This
equipment provides fifth-year mechanical engineering technology and fourth-year
energy engineering technology students with "hands-on" experience in testing and
analyzing fluid flow, thermodynamic cycles, and heat transfer through new and
existing laboratory experiments. The laboratory experience reinforces course
work in two fundamental courses, thermodynamics and fluid mechanics. With this
data acquisition equipment, the student has more time evaluating and analyzing
results such as is done in industry. The award is being matched by an equal
amount from the principal investigator's institution. //
