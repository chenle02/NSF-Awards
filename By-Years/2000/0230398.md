Conventional methods of manufacturing automation do not lend themselves to
construction of large structures with internal features. This explains why the
evolution of construction automation has been slow. A promising new automation
approach is layered fabrication, generally known as solid free form fabrication
or rapid prototyping, which uses an additive method and is capable of creating
complex internal features. However, most of the current layered fabrication
methods are limited by their ability to deliver a wide variety of materials
applicable to construction. Additionally, they are severely constrained by the
low rates of material deposition which makes them attractive only for the
fabrication of small industrial parts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
addresses a novel construction automation approach using a layered fabrication
process called Contour Crafting (CC) which has been developed at the University
of Southern California. The process aims at automated construction of whole
houses as well as sub-components. Using this process, a single house or a colony
of houses, each with possibly a different design, may be automatically
constructed in a single run. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific focus of the
PIs' research plan is to extend their current research activities, which have so
far concentrated on small scale parts, to build and test full-scale sections of
houses using proper construction materials, and to investigate other pertinent
scalability issues. Towards realizing these objectives, the PIs aim at
conducting activities pertaining to: (a) development of crucial machine elements
for construction of segments of full-scale houses, (b) software and control
issues, and (c) experimentation, testing and analysis of constructed structures.
It is anticipated that the research results will be also extendable to
construction on other planets, and to the field of ceramic
arts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
