The funds from this award will be used to support the Eleventh Annual
Southeastern-Atlantic Regional Conference on Differential Equations to be held
in October of 1991 at Mississippi State University. The topics for discussion at
the conference cover a number of important areas of differential equations:
ordinary and partial differential equations, integral and functional
differential equations, and applications of these classes of equations to
problems in physics and biology. The purpose of this conference is to promote
research and education in the theory and application of differential equations.
The conference will provide a forum for researchers in the southeast and
atlantic regions to exchange ideas with each other and with colleagues from
around the country and the world. In addition, the conference will give graduate
students and recent Ph.D.'s the opportunity to present their work, meet other
researchers, and learn about the latest results in their field.
