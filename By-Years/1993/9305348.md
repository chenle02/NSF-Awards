9305348 Williams This support will enable the California Academy of Sciences to
curate and computerize a recently discovered collection of molluscs that
includes specimens from the 1905-1906 Galapagos Expedition and other early 1900s
expeditions to the Indo-Pacific. This collection has historical importance in
studies of the changes in mollusc diversity and the causes of those changes.
Computerizing the collection will make the data more readily available to
researchers and students and will greatly increase its use in biodiversity
research and education. %%% A historic collection of molluscs was recently
discovered at the California Academy of Sciences, one of the premier
institutions that house and maintain research collections of organisms and make
them available for research and education to professionals and students. These
molluscs were collection in the early 1900s during expeditions to the Galapagos
Islands and the Indo-Pacific. Studies of these molluscs can reveal historical
trends in changes in biodiversity of these groups and the possible causes for
those changes. Computerization of this collection will make the collection and
its data much more accessible to researchers and students nationwide. *** 2 ~ \
