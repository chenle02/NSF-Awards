The project will determine activity-composition relations and cation site
distributions in MgAl2O4-FeCr2O4-Fe3O4 spinels using a combination of solid
electrolyte, phase equilibrium and electrical measurements. The enthalpy of
almandine garnet obtained calorimetrically conflicts with values derived from
precise phase equilibrium measurements. There are also discrepancies between the
measured stability fields of almandine and hercynite spinel. The free energies
of almandine and hercynite will be determined as a function of temperature using
the ZrO2 electrolyte technique. Integration of thermodynamic data into an
internally-consistent data base provides the means to calculate phase diagrams
at very high pressures and to make petrologic input into problems of earth
structure. This method will be used to investigate the reasons for observed
reflections and conversions of seismic waves at the interfaces between
subducting slabs and overlying mantle.
