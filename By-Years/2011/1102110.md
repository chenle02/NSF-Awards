Objective

The objective is to investigate novel electro-optics and nonlinear optics
approaches for generation of optical frequency combs and explore new
applications of such novel light sources.

Intellectual Merit

Combining optical frequency combs, a technology that has revolutionized
frequency metrology, with pulse shaping techniques provides new capability for
precision synthesis of user-specified coherent ultrashort pulsed fields, termed
optical arbitrary waveform generation (OAWG). However, OAWG technologies and
applications are best suited to optical frequency combs operating at repetition
rates significantly higher than those conveniently provided by current sources.
Therefore, a new research program is proposed focusing first on novel photonics
approaches for high repetition rate frequency comb generation and second on
potentially transformative new applications thereby enabled. Generation
approaches include novel combinationss of electro-optic phase modulation and
nonlinear fiber optics with application to combs at tens of GHz rates; and
nonlinear wave mixing in waveguide microresonators, with an emphasis on precise
waveform generation at even higher repetition rates (hundreds of GHz).
Investigation of high resolution, standoff optical imaging based on approaches
inspired by synthetic aperture radar, enabled by comb-based techniques for
measurement of broadband optical phase over optical fibers, is also proposed.
Broader Impact This project should provide rich opportunities for broad student
training in areas of cutting-edge technology within the atmosphere of a leading
research group. Two Ph.D. students are included in the proposal budget. Graduate
student training will be enriched through the opportunity to collaborate with
researchers at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Undergraduate
students will also participate in this research. During the course of this
project, Prof. Weiner also intends to leverage his recent textbook publication
by placing his graduate level course on Ultrafast Optics on-line via
Nanohub.org.
