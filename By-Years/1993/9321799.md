9321799 Dey This project seeks to develop efficient algorithms for triangulating
spaces (polytopes, point sets), to design efficient topological algorithms for
triangulated spaces, and to understand the combinatorial aspects of triangulated
spaces. Triangulated spaces appear in many applications, and have immediate
theoretical interest as well. The focus will first be on algorithms for polytope
triangulations and point set triangulations in higher dimensions. Finite element
methods apply triangulations to decompose the domains, while computer graphics
and solid modeling use them to represent objects with simpler components and to
manipulate them efficiently. Next, the investigation will concentrate on
topological algorithms with triangulated spaces for two problems: (i)
determining the homology groups of simplicial complexes in arbitrary dimensions,
(ii) detecting if two given cycles on a simplicial complex can be continuously
deformed to one another. Computational topology, an emerging field, examines the
computational aspects of topological problems. The constructive approaches would
inject algorithmic theories into topology, making it more useful in practical
applications. To understand triangulated spaces, one needs to know more about
their combinatorial behavior. The focus in the latter half of the project will
be on such combinatorial questions as counting the number of crossings in a set
of simplices and counting the number of combinatorially different triangulations
for a point set.
