This proposal addresses coupling between the ionosphere and lower thermosphere
which leads to large scale structure in the lower thermosphere at high
latitudes. The PI has successfully investigated the morphology of cell
structures using the TIGCM, and confirmed their existence using two independent
satellite data sets. This proposal is very relevant to understanding the lower
thermosphere. As the coupling between the upper and lower atmosphere comes into
focus over the next few years, it will be increasingly important to understand
what causes the observed behavior of the lower thermosphere, and to be able to
separate the effects of high latitude forcing from those due to upward
propagating tides and gravity waves, for example. The work, therefore, will
represent a vital contribution to the study of the lower thermosphere - the
least understood region of the atmosphere.
