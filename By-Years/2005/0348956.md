Haobin Wang of New Mexico State University is supported by a CAREER award from
the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program to carry out research on
quantum chemical reaction dynamics for ultrafast photo-induced electron
processes in the condensed phase. This research is producing novel applications
to the study of charge and energy transfer processes in both chemical and
biological systems and is providing insights into the dynamical aspects of
femtosecond nonlinear spectroscopy. In addition to these research activities,
Prof. Wang is developing web-based educational experiences to broaden the impact
of his research activities and provide students with effective learning tools
for theoretical and computational chemistry.
