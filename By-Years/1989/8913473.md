This award will support cooperative research between Dr. Norman S. Wolf of the
University of Washington and Dr. Ivan Bertoncello of the Peter MacCallum Cancer
Institute, Melbourne, Australia. This research is to investigate how changes in
the cellular environment of hematopoietic or blood cells affect their growth.
The project will advance understanding of the mechanisms through which
hematopoietic cells respond to stress and the hematopoietic cell pathologies
which accompany aging. The project represents excellent collaboration between
the Australian group, known internationally for their ability to isolate high
proliferating colony-forming cells and for their success with long-term cultures
of hematopoietic cells and the University of Washington's expertise in long-term
cell cycle measurement. This is important fundamental work on the regulation of
hematopoietic cells, as well as having potential for major advances in marrow
transplant, blood disfunctions, and aging.
