Two of the most esoteric kinds of astrophysical objects in the Universe are the
neutron star and the black hole. The Principal Investigator (PI) proposes to
continue his studies for another three years of the fundamental physics of these
objects and their influence on matter just outside them. During this grant
period attention will be focussed on quantum field effects on the equations of
state of fluids in these objects, black holes and gravitational collapse, and
the structure of red supergiants having neutron stars in their cores. An
important aspect of this proposal is the PI's training of graduate students and
postdoctoral fellows in this area. The PI is widely known for his instructional
abilities which have provided a pool of scientists conversant in theoretical
astrophysics, particle physics, and General Relativity for over twenty years.
