When infants look at someone's face or at an object, they are learning about the
world. But neither parents nor scientists know how long an infant will look at a
given face or object. This study tests the hypothesis that the durations of an
infant's previous looks at a target predict the duration of the next look at the
target. This is called the temporal dependency hypothesis. It suggests that
infants regulate their own behavior to learn from their environment early in
life. The temporal dependency hypothesis will be evaluated in a multi-ethnic
group of infants from the Southeastern United States. During several visits in
the first year of life, individual infant looks will be measured as infants
interact with their mothers, and watch videos of people and objects. During each
of these activities, individual infants may have a preferred level of temporal
dependency that indicates how strongly their past looks predict their next
looks. Greater temporal dependency is believed to reflect greater self-
regulation. The project will assess whether greater temporal dependency predicts
higher levels of communication and self-regulation at a year and a half of
age.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project unites research on social and cognitive
development to understand the behavioral bases of visual exploration. It tests a
hypothesis that may characterize other behaviors relevant to children's learning
such as reaction times. Results will inform understanding of developmental
disorders such as autism, and the development of new technologies such as robots
with realistic and effective looking behaviors. To maximize this impact, project
resources such as digital recordings of infant behavior will be shared with
other researchers.
