Scientific practice has been radically transformed by
computation.&lt;br/&gt;Many observers now place computational simulation on an
equal footing&lt;br/&gt;with the two traditional approaches to scientific
discovery,&lt;br/&gt;experimentation and theory. But while there are long-
established and&lt;br/&gt;rigorous criteria for validating experiments and
mathematical&lt;br/&gt;reasoning, the same is not true for simulation. Published
reports of&lt;br/&gt;simulation-based research typically say little or nothing
about the&lt;br/&gt;software, its qualities, or what was done to ascertain
its&lt;br/&gt;correctness. The software is rarely examined by reviewers or
other&lt;br/&gt;researchers, and in some cases is not even made available to
them.&lt;br/&gt;This situation is particularly troublesome in light of the
substantial&lt;br/&gt;evidence that scientific software is, in general, as
unreliable as any&lt;br/&gt;other type of software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
research focuses on developing a set of integrated techniques for&lt;br/&gt;the
specification and verification of scientific software. Drawing
on&lt;br/&gt;ideas from model checking, symbolic execution, and other
formal&lt;br/&gt;methods, these will include: (1) new techniques to efficiently
check&lt;br/&gt;for the presence of deadlocks, race conditions, improper use
of&lt;br/&gt;parallel programming libraries, and other generic defects
in&lt;br/&gt;scientific programs, (2) techniques to specify and verify the order
of&lt;br/&gt;accuracy of numerical programs, such as those used to solve systems
of&lt;br/&gt;differential equations, and (3) new techniques to verify
the&lt;br/&gt;functional equivalence of two scientific programs, including
programs&lt;br/&gt;with unbounded loops, and programs with (shared-variable
and/or&lt;br/&gt;message-passing) parallelism. These techniques will be realized
in a&lt;br/&gt;new tool suite, the Toolkit for Accurate Scientific Software
(TASS),&lt;br/&gt;which will be made publicly available under an open source
license.
