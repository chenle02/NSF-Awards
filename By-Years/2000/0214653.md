The Department of Statistics at the University of Connecticut &lt;br/&gt;will
purchase a Compaq Professional XP1000 EV6 667MHz UNIX&lt;br/&gt;systems, ten
DELL 1.70GHz dual processors power workstations,&lt;br/&gt;and an HP Color
LaserJet printer, which will be dedicated to&lt;br/&gt;the support of research
in mathematical statistics, statistical&lt;br/&gt;methodology, statistical
computing, complex statistical modeling,&lt;br/&gt;and statistical software
development. The equipment will be&lt;br/&gt;used for several research projects,
including, Bayesian analysis&lt;br/&gt;of multivariate categorical data and
missing covariate data,&lt;br/&gt;methodology for analyzing spatial data,
statistical inferences&lt;br/&gt;for contingency tables, cDNA microarrays, the
American travel&lt;br/&gt;survey, statistical analyses for infinite variance
stable&lt;br/&gt;processes, multivariate survival data and highway
accidents&lt;br/&gt;data, and wavelet modeling of high-frequency
data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, the machines will greatly enhance
departmental&lt;br/&gt;research and education infrastructure at all levels. They
will&lt;br/&gt;be made available to all departmental faculty, graduate
students&lt;br/&gt;
