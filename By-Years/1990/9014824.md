This application for support for an annual series of conferences on
"Controversies in Neuroscience" proposes to set up debatable issues for each
conference and to publish the results in a journal which will publish both the
main speakers' summary of the issues and the discussants' comments. If this
formula is succesful it will be a good format for settling issues and arriving
at new directions for neuroscience.
