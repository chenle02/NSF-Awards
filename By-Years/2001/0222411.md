The PI's propose to investigate three specific problems for which there is
reason to suspect that the ionosphere strongly influences phenomena previously
thought to be driven solely by the magnetosphere. In each of these cases, UV
insolation alters the ionosphere (through increasing conductivity, or through
increasing polar wind outflows), which in turn may alter the phenomena. Each
problem is expected to be solved in about one year with part time effort, yet
yield worthwhile results.

The first of the three problems is whether intense aurora are affected not only
by local ionospheric conductivity, as previously determined, but also by
conductivity in the opposite hemisphere. If it is true that southern hemisphere
conductivity affects the formation of intense aurora in the northern hemisphere
and vice versa, then the influence of ionospheric conductivity has a far more
global influence on space weather than previously believed.

A second problem is the possible coupling between the outflows associated with
polar wind and the inflows from the distant magnetosphere (and ultimately solar
wind) of the polar rain. In each case, the greater mobility of electrons leads
to the creation of electric fields opposing electron flows, but in the opposite
sense. Because the polar wind fluxes, driven by UV insolation, far exceed polar
rain fluxes, it is likely the major direction of interaction is that when the
polar wind is larger, the polar rain will be driven to higher fluxes. This can
be relatively easily checked by determining whether polar rain is more intense
when UV insolation is higher.

The third problem is whether ionospheric conductivity affects the diffuse aurora
(and/or total auroral particle precipitation intensity). It is widely assumed
that the diffuse aurora represents a direct dumping of the plasma sheet, and
there is no obvious reason why it should be much affected by ionospheric
conductivity from insolation. However it surprised much of the space physics
community to learn that discrete aurora are suppressed by sunlight. There are
some anomalies in recent reports in the literature which suggest that it would
be well worthwhile investigating whether the "direct dumping" of the plasma
sheet really is indeed independent of the insolation of the ionosphere.
