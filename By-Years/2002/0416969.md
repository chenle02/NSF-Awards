This project creates a computer-security focused center for the state of
Colorado, with the Denver metropolitan area serving as the commerce hub for the
surrounding rocky mountain region. It takes the first step in establishing an
information assurance program at the University of Denver (DU), with a two-to-
three year goal of having DU designated as a Center of Academic Excellence in
Information Assurance Education (CAE/IAE). The project develops new information
security focused curricula, increases the number of graduates with emphasis on
computer security, and creates degree programs with emphasis on security that
are accessible to underrepresented groups, especially women.
