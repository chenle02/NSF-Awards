The long term goal of this proposal is to understand how positional information
is established in the Drosophila egg during oogenesis. Dr. Cohen is focussing on
the expression and function of the K10 and C factor genes. His interest in K10
stems from its known requirement in the establishment of dorso-ventral polarity
in the egg; females deficient for K10 gene activity produce abnormally shaped
eggs that, if fertilized, die as embryos. Dr. Cohen's recent data indicate that
K10 is transcribed exclusively in nurse cells, but that its transcripts are
selectively and rapidly transported into the oocyte where they are translated.
Genetic and molecular approaches will be used to identify the proteins involved
in the transport of K10 RNA from nurse cells to oocytes. Dr. Cohen's interest in
C factor stems from its potential role as both an activator of transcription in
nurse cells and a repressor of transcription in oocytes. The exclusive synthesis
of RNAs in nurse cells appears to be a prerequisite for the subsequent
localization of some RNAs to specific regions of the oocyte. To elucidate C
factor function he will; 1) determine the distribution of C factor protein in
nurse cells and oocytes, and 2) identify/generate C factor mutants.
