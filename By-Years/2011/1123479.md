This award provides travel and subsistence to graduates students (and some
undergraduates) who will attend the Oregon Programming Languages Summer School
(OPLSS) on "Types, Semantics and Verification." The program is available at
http://www.cs.uoregon.edu/Activities/summerschool/summer11/. The summer school
is a two-week event that brings together top international researchers and
students to engage in lectures and discussions on leading-edge foundational
topics in programming languages and software verification, much of which is not
yet in textbooks. The NSF support ensures participation of US students while
paying attention to underrepresented groups. The summer school will help build
the next generation of researchers and a global workforce with expertise in
these important areas of research and education. 100 students have registered
for the 2011 summer school. The organizers will make video of lectures and other
educational materials available to the public immediately after the event.
