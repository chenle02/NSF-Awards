The Albert Nerken School of Engineering at The Cooper Union is planning a new
undergraduate engineering curriculum that addresses the needs of a changed
world. The planning vision focuses on: interdisciplinary studies and programs
that reflect the nature of discovery today; integrating genuine research with
undergraduate education; maintaining academic rigor; and accommodating students'
academic interests. Accordingly, project goals include: 1) establishing a new
administrative structure that eliminates departmental divisions, establishes two
engineering degrees for students on different professional tracks, creates
interdisciplinary academic research hubs that facilitate project-based learning,
and integrates the "soft" skills crucial to professional development; 2)
outlining new curricula for the two-degree program that meets the needs of the
engineering community, the nation, and the students; and, 3) evaluating the
planning process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will entail gathering and
analyzing information from external sources such as other colleges and industry
representatives; working with internal constituents to create a flexible class
schedule and promote efficient use of space; fostering collaboration among
faculty and institutions; and monitoring and measuring the effectiveness of the
planning process. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact. This planning project
will outline ways to encourage more undergraduate research activity; attract
more students from underrepresented groups to engineering, including women; and
provide opportunities to use and experiment with recent advances in teaching and
learning. Ultimately, when implemented, the new Cooper Union model and curricula
will demonstrate to other undergraduate schools and engineering departments ways
to provide curricular flexibility and interdisciplinary while maintaining
rigorous standards, meeting ABET criteria, and encouraging undergraduate
research.&lt;br/&gt;
