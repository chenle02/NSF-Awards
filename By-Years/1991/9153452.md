Believe and Achieve is a comprehensive and integrated curriculum of
mathematics, science, and critical thinking especially designed for minority and
female junior high school students. The program uses videotapes and written
lessons developed by faculty at the University of St. Thomas. The major
components of Believe and Achieve are: (1) instructional materials especially
designed for minority and other underrepresented groups, which contain
strategies for increasing these students' confidence and achievement; (2)
interdisciplinary instruction among the mathematics, science, and English
classes with material from each of the classes used to emphasize points in the
other classes, and critical thinking and problem solving skills emphasized
throughout; (3) an intensive five-week summer program, held on the University of
St. Thomas campus, with a particular emphasis on computer programming, a hands
on science project, and concepts of physics; and (4) a network of resources
focused on the importance and usefulness of mathematics, science, and critical
thinking, and on helping to motivate student to higher achievement. In many
cases, students in the program are learning mathematics and science two years
earlier than they normally would. In addition, the students are given
opportunities to achieve success solving problems with mathematics which
increases their confidence and interest in pursuing advanced courses. Teachers
and students have been very responsive to this success. Currently over 1200
students and 40 teachers are taking part in the program. Within the year, it is
estimated that 2000 students and 60 teachers will be involved. The support of
the NSF will allow the number of students in the program to increase rapidly.
