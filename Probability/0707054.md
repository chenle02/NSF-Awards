It is proposed to study several problems in Probability. One class of problems
concerns central limit theorems for complex objects like nearest neighbor
statistics and linear statistics of eigenvalues of large dimensional random
matrices. The PI has invented a new method that works by exploiting a hitherto
unknown connection between normal approximation and concentration of measure,
two different branches of probability theory. A second class of problems
involves fair allocations of Lebesgue measure to discrete point processes in
Euclidean spaces and manifolds. Finally, a third line of investigation pursues a
method of connecting the analysis of interacting Brownian particles with the
geometry of convex polytopes.

The key focus of the project is on Central Limit Theorems. CLT's, as they are
popularly known, are one of the founding pillars of Probability Theory and
arguably its most widely used tool in the applied sciences, finding everyday
applications in fields ranging from Statistics to Bio-informatics, Computer
Science to Economics. Although much is known, there are still many unsolved
questions. In fact, the PI's investigation into the theory of Central Limit
Theorems was initiated by an open question raised by Peter Bickel, an eminent
Berkeley scientist working in the area of high dimensional data analysis. The PI
now has a new technique for proving CLT's that has not only solved the open
question, but has yielded and promises to yield much more.
