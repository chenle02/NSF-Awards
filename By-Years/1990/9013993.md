The chambered nautilus (Nautilus spp.) is the sole surviving genus of the once
dominant externally-chambered cephalopods. Nautilus achieves its near-neutral
buoyance in seawater via the gas-filled chambers of its heavy protective shell.
The siphuncle, the organ that passes through the animal's chambers, removes the
cameral liquid which initially fills the chambers, and allows gas (mostly N2) to
enter. Thus, the siphuncle is the organ responsible for nautilus' buoyancy. To
understand how the siphuncle empties and partially fills chambers, studies of
this transport and electrophysiology and required. Prior to writing a formal
proposal involving microelectrode and flux experiments, preliminary studies are
required to show that the appropriate measurements can be made on siphuncular
cells in vitro. This SGER proposal will attempt to demonstrate the feasibility
of those methods. This SGER proposal is exploratory and high risk because in
vitro studies of the siphuncle have never been done and there is no quarantee
that the siphuncle is a useful system for microelectrode and tracer
experiments.***
