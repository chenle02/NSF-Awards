This project is mathematical research in operator theory, a subject that had
its origins in quantum mechanics (where operators on Hilbert space are used in
place of scalars to represent physical quantities), but that has long since
acquired a vigorous life of its own. The world of operators, being infinite-
dimensional and noncommutative, is full of remarkable phenomena that are not
present in the more familiar world of scalars. More specifically, Professor
Herrero will work on problems related to compact perturbations and approximation
of Hilbert space operators, including approximation by similarity - invariant
classess of operators and closures of joint similarity orbits. He will also
study the spectral structures of multicyclic operators.
