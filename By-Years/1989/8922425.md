This is is a three-day symposium on interactive 3-D graphics. Its focus is on
the current frontiers in real-time interactive 3-D graphics. Some of the
questions of interest are what special-purpose architectures are on the drawing
board, what are the most user-friendly paradigms for interactions with such
systems, and what applications have not been sufficiently addressed.
