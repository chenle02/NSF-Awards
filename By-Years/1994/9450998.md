9450998 Pervine Murray State University is establishing a computer laboratory
for students enrolled in multivariable calculus, numerical analysis,
mathematical modeling and applied statistics. The laboratory consists of a
network of UNIX-based workstations serving as a platform for Mathematica, SAS,
FORTRAN, and C. Students presently enter these courses having taken computer-
enhanced calculus, linear algebra, and differential equations courses. These
students have begun to develop their problem-solving skills and started to
develop some mathematical insight. Students participating in this project are
continuing their mathematical development. They are building and analyzing
mathematical models, carrying out analysis of data, and learning how to apply
modern numerical methods to realistic and open-ended problems. This process,
which includes experimentation, searching for patterns, and making conjectures
is helping students refine their problem-solving skills and gain a deeper
understanding of mathematical principles.
