Eastern New England is now recognized to consist of a number of exotic terranes
joined to ancestral North America along large faults. However, the timing of the
accretion of these terranes is in a state of flux. This project will gather
thermometric and barometric data from both sides of these terrane bounding
faults and together with existing age determinations will assess the possibility
of major Alleghenian motion, not previously recognized. Results have the
potential to provide a major re-interpretation of the timing of terrane
accretion in New England.
