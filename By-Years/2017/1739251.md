One of the core values of the National Science Foundation is ensuring
inclusiveness among all segments of the broader scientific community. This Life
STEM project will provide a mechanism for strengthening minority serving
institutions' capacity to help the nation meet the growing demand for a more
diverse future STEM workforce. The workshop will provide opportunities for these
institutions to increase their capacity to inspire, prepare, and retain
underrepresented K-12 and undergraduate students in life science and bioscience
fields through innovative models of interventions. To enhance the capacity of
these institutions to participate in this endeavor, the workshop will focus on
cutting edge research designs and review models of intervention shown to be
effective in helping retain underrepresented students in the STEM
pipeline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Working in concert with the Quality Education for
Minority Network and MER Associates, Spelman College will host a workshop for
100-125 key university administrators, education and STEM researchers, and
sponsored research office representatives. The workshop attendees will
participate in teams of 4-5 members to learn more about the Foundation's mission
and goals for STEM education and for broadening participation in STEM. Teams
will be provided support to attend the workshop where representatives can also
share best practices about individual successes in helping underrepresented
students complete courses of study in STEM fields.
