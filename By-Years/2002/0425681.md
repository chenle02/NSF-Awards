The PIs propose to develop fluorescence-based fiber optic biosensors designed to
measure oceanic trace levels of free Zn2+ and Cu2+ continuously in situ, in real
time. These biosensors use a biomolecule, carbonic anhydrase, to transduce the
level of free metal ion as a change in fluorescence intensity or lifetime that
can be measured through a length of optical fiber. The use of the biomolecule as
transducer confers unmatched selectivity and sensitivity on these optical
sensors. Proposed improvements in the transducer molecule, fluorescent labels,
and optics will permit measurement deep in the water column and in anoxic
waters, where current analytical technology is incapable of acquiring the needed
data. This capability will permit questions of central importance in surface
zinc bioavailability, Cu availability for methanotrophs and denitrifiers, and Cu
availability in reducing conditions to finally be addressed. A key goal of this
project is the training of students and the introduction of students outside the
discipline to marine biogeochemistry and the special character of research in a
shipboard environment.
