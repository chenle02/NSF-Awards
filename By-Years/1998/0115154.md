This project the publication of a book tentatively titled "Beyond inertia: the
transformation of mechanics in the seventeenth century." In that century the
boundaries of mechanics were greatly expanded to include the study of motion and
other areas. The study covers all areas of mechanics as it was understood at
different times in the century, not just the motion of projectiles and celestial
bodies. Therefore, the project investigates the science of waters and the
resistance of materials. The project's methods pay close attention to the role
of experiments, especially quantitative experiments, and to the mathematics
employed. The best way to capture the wealth of domains progressively
incorporated is to focus on the objects studied by scholars, including: the
lever; the inclined plane; the pendulum; beams; canals; falling, projected, and
colliding bodies; slings; springs; vibrating cords; pierced cisterns; hanging
chains; bodies moving in resisting media; planets, satellites, and comets. These
objects were studied empirically, including their material characteristics, and
in abstract form. The study of the tensions between material and abstract
objects is one of the defining methodological features of the project.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study covers a major transition period in the history
of the mathematical disciplines. The topic is one of the classical elements of
the history of science and has been widely examined in history of science
courses. Indeed, it is so important as to be often the object of specialized
courses, besides being included in all history of science surveys. However,
there is no recent or reliable monograph on this central topic. The project
advances both knowledge and science education because the book is aimed at both
scholars in the field and graduate students. The incorporation of technical
material in appendices makes the main portion of the book accessible to a wide
audience.&lt;br/&gt;
