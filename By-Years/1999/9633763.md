Although citation flows among papers constitute one of the critical stratifying
mechanisms in science, insufficient attention has been paid to the determinants
of such flows. Previous research has studied citation flows in terms of
characteristics of cited articles, but has ignored the role played by
characteristics of the citing articles. This project extends previous research
by viewing the citation process as a dyadic relationship that simultaneously
encompasses characteristics of both citing and cited articles. Using data on two
research areas, one in astrophysics and one in economics, this research will
develop a network analytic approach to analyze all of the possible citation
links between the papers in the area. This project will extend our understanding
of stratification in science by illuminating the allocation of credit at the
micro level of the citation. In addition, by adopting a comparative framework,
it may produce further information about similarities or differences between the
physical and social sciences.
