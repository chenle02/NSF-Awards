The work planned in this mathematical sciences group research project seeks to
combine two approaches to the problem of representing signals as expansions of
discrete sets of functions. One is through the Gabor transform, the other uses
the wavelet expansion. One of the primary goals of this research is to combine
the two approaches using a new technique called the multiplicative Zak
transform. Applications of this work will concentrate on characterizations of
non-stationary signal. Algorithms will be developed to compute the coefficients
of the resulting double series expansion and signal properties will be derived
from the expansions. Since the multiplicative Zak transformation can be
interpreted as the Weil map. It appears in another context within the
representation theory of the Heisenberg group. This theory provides insight into
special function theory including theta functions and Krautchouk and Poisson-
Charlier polynomials. Applications to number theory are also planned.
