This award provides additional resources for the American Geological
Institute's Minority Participation Program. This program, begun in 1971, has an
established history of success in aiding underrepresented minority students in
the geosciences. Traditionally, funding for the program has come primarily from
industry, with additional support from geoscience associations and individuals.
The downturn in the petroleum and mineral extraction industries in recent years
has seriously impacted the program, yet the need for human resources in the
sciences remains high. The broad goal for this project is to increase the number
of underrepresented minority students entering the geoscience pipeline and being
retained through college graduation. This additional funding for the program is
specifically targetted for undergraduate geoscience majors, and is intended to
provide sustained support for the selected individuals through completion of
their baccalaureate degrees.
