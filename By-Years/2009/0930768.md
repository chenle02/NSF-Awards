This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project proposes a
functionalized magnetic nanoparticle to be used in a new water desalination
process. The proposed technology uses magnetic nanoparticles functionalized with
selective synthetic salt ion-receptors to extract the dissolved salt ions from
saline water.

If successful, the result will be a revolutionary desalination technique that
greatly reduces the energy required for desalination for agricultural and other
needs. The surface engineered nanomaterial based water desalination technique
proposed will overcome the major shortcomings of current desalination methods
that rely on thermal and membrane processes involving huge operating costs due
to high electricity demands, periodic membrane replacements, and disposal of
brines.
