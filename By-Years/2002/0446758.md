This work supports an integrated research and education effort that aims to 1)
better understand how communities of organisms are organized from both an
ecological and evolutionary perspective, and 2) train undergraduate and graduate
students in quantitative methods used to examine morphological variation in
communities and methods for assessing community organization. The major research
goals of this project are to understand the organization of ecological
communities, the importance of species interactions in those communities, and to
examine the evolutionary consequences of species interactions on morphological
traits in Plethodon salamanders. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The education component
focuses on better integration of research in education, through several
mechanisms: 1) ongoing research projects provide data examples for educational
exercises in the classroom to help to establish ties between research and
education, 2) undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students will be
directly involved in laboratory research, 3) further development and
participation in an educational exchange will strengthen the connections between
a major R-1 institution and an undergraduate college, 4) continued training of
visiting faculty and students in my laboratory during mini-sabbaticals, 5)
educational outreach through teaching at International Geometric Morphometrics
Workshops. Finally, hosting a Geometric Morphometrics Workshop at Iowa State
University will provide US researchers in-depth training in these
approaches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
