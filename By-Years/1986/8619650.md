This is a renewal proposal by Professor Katja Lindenberg for studying the nature
of excitations in molecular aggregates as well as the dynamical mechanisms in
the evolution of the motion of the excitation. These are important problems of
great current interest in condensed matter theory. Professor Lindenberg is a
first rate scientist at the forefront of her research field and is eminently
qualified to do the work.
