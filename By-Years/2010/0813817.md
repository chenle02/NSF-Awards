Students in the United States continue to show a significant gender gap in their
academic achievement in mathematics. One reason for this is that females still
fall victim to the stereotype of lower math ability; that is, they are
vulnerable to "stereotype threat." This project applies lessons from research on
student motivation to understand the academic contexts that can heighten or
lessen this vulnerability. The research is designed to show that math classes
conveying the idea that math ability is a fixed trait -- you have it or you
don't -- will lead females to fall prey to stereotype threat. In contrast, math
classes that portray math skills as acquirable should defuse the impact of
stereotypes. Even someone performing poorly now can still gain ability over
time. This view of math skills, in addition to fostering greater achievement, is
expected to increase females' enjoyment of math and their sense of belonging to
the math community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research addresses two key moments
in students' educational lives: the transition to junior high school and to
college. Educational experiences at these points lay the foundation for future
interest in science, technology, engineering and math domains, and thus
influence the career paths women take. The findings will have important
implications for members of any group who face messages of limited ability in
any area of achievement.&lt;br/&gt;
