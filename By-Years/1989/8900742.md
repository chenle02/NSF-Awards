This REU award is for a number of geological research projects which are both
tractable to undergraduate juniors and seniors, and are of significance in
refining understanding of the Taconic Fold/Thrust Belt, the Cambro-Ordovician
Platform and the Adirondack Massif of eastern New York and western Vermont. Four
faculty will supervise ten students in a 5-week summer field program with a
full-semester follow up, possibly at other institutions. This structure follows
the model of Colgate's regular field camp, but will be considerably more
intensive and will allow the students to go much further.
