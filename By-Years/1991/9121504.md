ABSTRACT The aim of the project is the publication of the Grammar of Mupun.
Mupun is a West Chadic language, spoken in the Plataeu State of Nigeria. The
Grammar and an accompanying Dictionary are the first full descriptions of this
language and also the most complete body of information on any language from the
Angas group, to which Mupun belongs. The two books were written with the support
of an NSF grant. The dictionary received a Kayden Prize in the Humanities, an
award that provides support for the publication of the book. The Grammar
presents a number of analyses and facts of interest for general linguistics. In
addition, observation in the field indicates that the language is in extremely
vulnerable situation because the educated youth are more and more replacing
Mupun in their daily speech by eith Hausa or English. The Grammar and the
Dictionary will be thus the record of a language in jeopardy of extinction
within a few generations.
