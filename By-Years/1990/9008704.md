The focus of this project is on the contractile apparatus responsible for
cytokinesis in animal cells. The goals are to understand how actin and myosin
are assembled into the contractile units that form the cleavage furrow, and to
determine how these units are attached to the cell membrane. Fluorescent
analogues of actin, myosin, talin, and vinculin will be injected into living
cells and their incorporation into cleavage furrows analyzed. The kinetics of
assembly and disassembly of actin and myosin in the furrow will be measured and
specific inhibitors introduced to test the hypothesis that the two proteins are
recruited co-temporaneously but independently of one another. Short term
incorporation of fluorescent actin and myosin analogues during mitosis will be
measured to determine if actin and myosin are incorporated preferentially into
the equatorial cortex. Inhibitors of talin and vinculin will be introduced into
mitotic cells to test the idea that these proteins play a role in attaching
actin filaments to the cleavage furrow membrane. Photoactivation and
photobleaching of actin and myosin analogues will be used to determine if there
is a cortical flow of actin and myosin from the poles to the equatorial cortex
to form the cleavage furrow. The significance of the proposed experiments lies
in their potential for describing how actin and myosin are assembled into the
contractile apparatus that is essential for one of the most basic of biological
processes: cell division.
