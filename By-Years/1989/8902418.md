The principal investigators will continue their work in various areas of
probability theory. One investigator will continue his study of limit theorems
for empirical measures. This has both direct and indirect applications to
statistics, and in particular to the bootstrap technique of estimation. A second
investigator will study the relationship between Gaussian and Markov processes.
Each of these processes acts as a model of many natural phenomena, but each
makes different assumptions. A third investigator will continue his study of
diffusion processes which involve discontinuity or singularity of the
coefficients of the process, the state space, or the boundary. This study has
indirect applications to stochastic control. ***
