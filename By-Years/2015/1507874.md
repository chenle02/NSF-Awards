Non-technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;The spin of an electron is a simple quantum
mechanical property when the electron is isolated, but when electron spins
interact inside a solid a large variety of wonderful phenomena can be observed.
Magnetism and superconductivity are two major examples where spins play a
seminal role. The PI and his team have developed microscopes based on the idea
of scanning a nanoscale sensor over the sample in order to probe the charge and
spin properties down to the atomic scale. They use these techniques to study new
manganese oxides that have unusual magnetic and electrical properties, and
superconducting copper oxides that can produce regular patterns in their charge
and spin distributions. These studies are important in order to understand the
role of spin in complex magnetic and superconducting oxides, which will serve to
improve current materials and will help in the design of new materials for
future applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;In this
proposal, experiments to be performed on interesting oxides with a new low
temperature spin polarized scanning tunneling microscope (SP-STM) are
highlighted. While there has been much progress in the understanding of the
phase diagram for high temperature superconductors, there are still fundamental
questions about the nature of the superconducting phase, the presence and
properties of other phases, and whether all these order parameters compete or
coexist at the microscopic level. All these issues are particularly important in
the pseudogap region of the phase diagram, an area that extends to lower doping
and higher temperatures than superconductivity, and the topic of intense debate.
Charge and spin density waves (CDW, SDW) have been reported to exist in this
region, but so far most measurements are done with bulk probes that provide
average properties. The SP-STM is particularly well suited to provide
microscopic information down to the atomic scale. Other scanning probes are also
used to improve our understanding of these materials and phenomena. This
proposal focuses on two newer oxides with the 327 crystal structure: one is a
superconducting cuprate [(LaSrCa)3Cu2O6+d] and the other a magnetic manganite
[La2-2xSr1+2xMn2O7]. These materials were chosen because their structure
promotes excellent cleaving characteristics that are essential to produce a
clean, ordered surface for STM studies, and because they allow the study of
fundamental questions on the role of antiferromagnetic interactions and CDW/SDW
in the cuprates, and charge, spin, and orbital ordering in the manganites.
