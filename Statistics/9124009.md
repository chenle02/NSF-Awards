The project's goal is to investigate the asymptotic estimation problem when the
number of nuisance parameters increases with the number of observations. The
application of the obtained results to multidimensional sensor array processing
is expected. The aim here is to determine the best possible asymptotic
performance and to give a method for constructing an estimator exhibiting this
behavior. Similar questions will be studied in a version of the change-point
estimation problem and admissibility conditions under Pitman closeness for
generalized Bayes estimators will be derived. The relationship between prior
distribution and the shape of the frequentist risk of the corresponding Bayes
estimator will be also investigated. This proposal is directed towards finding
new methods of obtaining optimal statistical procedures with the application to
signal processing.
