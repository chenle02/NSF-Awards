The objective of this research program is to obtain state- specific information
on the dynamics of elementary gas-phase chemical reactions. State-to-state
information enables chemists to understand how and under what conditions
reactions occur. Dr. Zare's detailed observations will also enable numerical
calculations of such reactions to be evaluated. The research described in this
plan will obtain state-specific information on the reactions Ca + HF and O + RH
by combining molecular beam and laser spectorscopic methods. Special emphasis is
placed on experiments which use a tunable infrared source for preparing reagents
(HF, RH where R is any hydrocarbon) in known vibrational-rotational internal
states or use a tunable UV source for the quantum-state-specific detection of
molecular hydrogen. The information gathered in this manner will enable the
forces experienced between reagents and products to be described.
