This award provides funds to the Roswell Park Cancer Institute to sponsor 12
undergraduate students in the Institute's Research Participation Program in
Science for Undergraduate College Students. The program offers college
undergraduates opportunities to experience laboratory research in preparation
for their career development, particularly in molecular biology and cell
biology. Participants in the program are given intense laboratory experiences
with a senior investigator on a one to one basis for ten weeks from June to
August. This laboratory experience nurtures the participant's research interests
and develops their skills in cell and molecular biology. The experience should
also exert an influence on their career development leading many to do graduate
work in this area. Since 1953, the program has had approximately 3,000
participants. Follow-up data show that 40% of undergraduates went on to pursue
doctoral degrees and many have gone on to distinguished careers as research
scientists. The Institute staff is not required to participate in the
Undergraduate Research Program, but they look forward to selecting talented
students, particularly minority students, who are seriously inclined to develop
careers in science. While scientists acquaint students with the theory and
methodologies involved with their research, they also assist students in their
development of independence and self motivation. At weekly seminars, conducted
by senior staff and graduate students, participants are required to describe
their progress on their laboratory work among their peers. This encourages
discussion and broadens their horizons in other areas of science. At the end of
the program, each student has to write a short description of their project and
give a presentation before senior staff, guests and peers at a scientific mini-
conference.
