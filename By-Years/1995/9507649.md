9507649 Bagger In recent years there has been a significant cross fertilization
between the areas of particle physics and cosmology, leading to major advances
in both fields. At the same time string theory has been proposed as a unifying
theory. String theory also describes a quantum theory of gravity, leading to a
synthesis in our understanding of all forces. PASCOS is a conference on
Particles, Strings and Cosmology. The proposed conference is the fifth in the
series of annually held PASCOS meetings and is likely to be as successful as the
other four have been. It is being hosted this year by Johns Hopkins University.
