The rock deformation laboratory at Rice University studies the physical
processes that control faulting and earthquake hazards. The lab, which is headed
by an early career PI, uses high pressure and temperature experiments to measure
the mechanical and physical properties of rocks from areas prone to earthquakes.
This proposal will support the creation of a laboratory technician position that
will enhance research, education, and training opportunities in the Rice rock
deformation laboratory. The technician will increase the group's capacity to
host visitors from other universities and to support undergraduate research
projects.

The rock deformation laboratory hosts two triaxial deformation apparatus to
study the rheology and deformation processes of rocks. Recent and ongoing
research is focused on the physical properties of rocks from subduction zone
settings and the role of rock rheology in controlling the speed and mode of
fault slip. Recent growth in technical capabilities, number of students, and
community service requires additional technical support to maintain and grow the
size and scope of the Rice research program. The new research technician will
(1) assist undergraduates and visiting scientists who are conducting
experiments, (2) educate students on equipment design, use, and maintenance, (3)
maintain a physically safe laboratory including maintaining equipment and
developing and documenting protocols, (4) oversee data storage and management,
(5) assist with education and outreach activities, and (6) participate in the
design and scope of our research program.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
