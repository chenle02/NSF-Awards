Center for Experimental Research in Computer Systems Proposal #1127904

This proposal seeks funding for the Center for Experimental Research in Computer
Systems at Georgia Institute of Technology. Funding Requests for Fundamental
Research are authorized by an NSF approved solicitation, NSF 10-601. The
solicitation invites I/UCRCs to submit proposals for support of industry-defined
fundamental research. While cloud computing is rising in importance for numerous
applications, there remains a fundamental lack of understanding of performance
achievable for different configurations, especially for N-tier applications
common in such areas as e-commerce and social networking. The proposed research
will seek to systematically design large scale experiments from which
performance data will be derived and performance metrics established for N-tier
applications. The resulting large data sets can enable researchers to explore
means to achieve optimal allocation of hardware and software resources for
specific applications. The proposed comparative experimental study will enable
development of comparative models through which N-tier application performance
can be predicted and as such holds the opportunity for significant breakthroughs
in understanding of cloud performance for this class of problems.

The proposed research has the potential to source the development of tools from
which industry providers of cloud resources can better manage their resources
and offer services in a cost effective way. Additionally, this optimization can
be applied to achievement of Green IT goals. The work is well supported by
center individual industry members and has the potential to extend the portfolio
of the center by virtue of the many studies and modeling efforts achievable
using the dataset generated by this study. Beyond the center, the dataset, if
properly designed, has the potential for broad impact in the research community
as a resource for studies in this area. The proposal furthermore provides a
solid plan for student and UREP involvement.
