A Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Sites award has been made to the
University of Connecticut to provide research training for 10 weeks for 10
students during the summers of 2013-1015. The Department of Physiology and
Neurobiology (PNB) will offer research opportunities to undergraduate sophomores
and juniors from non-Ph.D. granting institutions. The students will participate
in graduate level research projects on physiological and neural systems in
animals. The goal is to expose students to a career in scientific research, and
to increase student applications to graduate programs in basic science. Students
are selected on the basis of their academic record, personal and professional
goals described in a required essay, and letters of recommendation. Interested
students, especially underrepresented minorities, veterans, first-generation
college students, and students with disabilities from institutions with limited
research opportunities are encouraged to apply. REU students will be part of a
campus multidisciplinary REU community consisting of several programs in the
physical sciences and engineering as well as physiology and neurobiology.
Students are housed together, and work with faculty mentors on their own
research project. Professional development and cohort-building activities are
planned. Seminars introduce students to topics such as safe practices in the
laboratories, ethical issues in science, how to apply to graduate school, and
how to present research results effectively. An end-of-session symposium
features student platform and poster presentations. Information about the
program will be assessed by various means, including the common assessment tool
available to BIO-funded REU PIs. More information is available by visiting

Xinnian Chen at xinnian.chen@uconn.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. Larry Renfro at
