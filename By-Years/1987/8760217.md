This project is funded under the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Small
Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, which is designed to provide an
opportunity for small business, particularly the small high technology firm, to
participate in NSF research. Phase I of the SBIR program serves as a filter to
select promising proposals and determine if the firm can do high quality
research. Phase II is the principal research project. Phase III is the
conversion of the NSF-funded research into commercial applications and
technological innovation supported by follow-on private venture capital or other
non-federal financing. This is a Phase I project concerning applying expert
systems to network management, an extremely important area of research. Networks
are growing very rapidly and are becoming too complex for non-automated
solutions. Enormous potential costs are attached to badly behaving systems,
including delayed usage by commercial and government concerns. In Phase I, the
principal investigator will select a suitable area of the problem for Phase II
development. The approach is to analyze this "vertical slice", expecting to
obtain insights into how to tackle the general problem while solving a
particularly promising one.
