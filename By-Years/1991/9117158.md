Professor Larry A. Viehland is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to study the way diatomic ions move through
dilute gases under the influence of electric fields. The appropriate Boltzmann-
like kinetic equation will be solved in order to systemmatically approximate the
ion mobility and diffusion coefficients for comparison with experiments. The
calculations will be extended to the determination of the ion velocity
distribution functions. This will allow calculation of the reaction rate
coefficients measured in swarm experiments and provide an assessment of the
accuracy of our knowledge of diatomic ion/molecule reaction cross sections. %%%
A thorough understanding of interaction between ions and neutral molecules is
important in such fields as atomic and molecular physics, aeronomy and
atmospheric chemistry, gaseous electronics, and laser physics. Viehland studies
the mobility and diffusion of ions moving through trace amounts of dilute gases
under the influence of an electric field. These conditions are frequently
encountered in laboratories where ion molecule reactions are studied.
