Although the insect nervous system is relatively simple, it has not prevented
these animals from engaging in quite complex behaviors. One such insect behavior
that has led to much human suffering is the one that allows a mosquito to find a
host for a meal of blood. Using various chemical and visual signals that we
humans give off, mosquitos are able to locate us and ingest our blood, and in
the process transmit often deadly disease agents. Dr. Klowden is an
internationally renown expert on mosquito behavior in the complex environment.
He has identified times when the insect itself controls its behavior and does
not seek a host. Using these periods of inaction, Dr. Klowden identified a novel
FMRFamide-related neuropeptide, Aedes Head Peptide 1, that specifically inhibits
host seeking behavior in the yellow fever mosquito, and prevents them from
feeding on blood. Using extremely difficult technical/surgical techniques, he
can begin to unravel the mechanisms by which Aedes Head Peptide 1 prevents
mosquito host-seeking behavior from occurring, and how this hormone interacts
with other factors. The results from these fundamental studies are likely to
lead to new discoveries that will substantially impact progress in the
neuroendocrinology of insects and insect behavior. In addition, basic findings
derived from this research should provide essential information needed for the
development of better strategies for the control of populations of mosquitoes
and the diseases that they transmit via their blood-feeding activities.
