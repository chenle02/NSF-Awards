Fuchs This grant supports two additions to the Pixel-planes project. The first
is for construction of a high-resolution head mounted display. This display
extends the use of Pixel-planes to three-dimensional visualization in large
volumes of space, with the user able to walk around and interact with the image.
The capability for such visualization allows the meaningful presentation of
complex data. The second allows completion of the work originally planned.
