Theoretical research will be carried out on the properties of objects with
strong gravitational fields, such as neutron stars, black holes, and the
Universe as a whole, with a particular focus on understanding the gravitational
waves that such objects produce, and on developing and extending analytic
approximation methods in general relativity to study these objects. The
particular objects to be studied include (i) newly born neutron stars in
supernovae explosions, (ii) neutron stars and/or black holes spiralling into
supermassive black holes in distant galaxies, and (iii) the dynamics of the very
early Universe in models motivated by string theory with extra spatial
dimensions and membranes. These studies will be useful in teaching us about the
physics of relativistic gravitational fields, particularly when combined with
future observational data from gravitational wave detectors and other sources.
