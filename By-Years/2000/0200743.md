Proposal Number: DMS-0200743&lt;br/&gt;PI: Evgeny
Poletsky&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
proposes the further study of the geometric &lt;br/&gt;complex analysis, mostly,
through pluri-potential theory.&lt;br/&gt;Research will be conducted in the
following topics:&lt;br/&gt;the existence of a "general" potential theory
containing&lt;br/&gt;all the necessary background; the complex geometry of
&lt;br/&gt;infinite-dimensional spaces related to classical
problems&lt;br/&gt;for plurisubharmonic functions; the complex geometry
of&lt;br/&gt;compact sets via the pluri-potential theory on such&lt;br/&gt;sets;
the geometry of domains and multipole Green &lt;br/&gt;functions (the classical
analog is the Martin-Caratheodory&lt;br/&gt;compactification) and Bernstein-
Walsh and Markov &lt;br/&gt;inequalities for generalized polynomials. Other
geometric&lt;br/&gt;questions will also be considered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In
this project research will be conducted on geometric&lt;br/&gt;complex analysis.
Geometry, as a part of mathematics,&lt;br/&gt;aims to describe qualitative links
between different &lt;br/&gt;objects. For example, parallel lines do not meet
and the&lt;br/&gt;heights in a triangle meet at the same point. When
&lt;br/&gt;Euclidean objects: points, lines and planes are replaced&lt;br/&gt;by
more complicated structures: functions, surfaces and&lt;br/&gt;sets, the
research is of a more delicate flavor.&lt;br/&gt;It happens because the
mechanism providing links between&lt;br/&gt;objects is not transparent. In our
proposal we will look&lt;br/&gt;for such a mechanism in the form of potentials
similar to&lt;br/&gt;the energy levels of electrical charges. &lt;br/&gt;
