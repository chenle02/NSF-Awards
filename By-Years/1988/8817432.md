A great deal of change has occurred with regard to electrical machines and drive
systems. These changes have been brought about by the introduction of advanced
solid-state control technology, new materials that are being or can be applied
to advanced machine designs, more powerful computational techniques for
analyzing electrical machines and drives, and the user need to have drive
systems that are more efficient and that precisely match the requirements of the
process. A workshop is being held to present and review needed research in the
field of advanced electrical machines and drive systems. The results of this
workshop will be an identified research program, the goals of which will be to
advance the state of energy conversion. It is expected that new and novel drive
system ideas and research objectives that extend beyond the traditional
technologies will result from this workshop.
