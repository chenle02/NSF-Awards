The Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers requests travel support for
participants in the Broader Engagement (BE) Program at the Supercomputing (SC)
2009 Conference. That program aims to increase opportunities for U.S.
undergraduate, graduate, faculty, industry professionals, and researchers to
learn about high performance computing (HPC). It emphasizes the participation of
members of the groups that are underrepresented within the HPC community:
African Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, Alaska Natives, Native
Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders, persons with disabilities, and women. Participants
will have the opportunity attend specialized, targeted sessions, a student job
fair, and to connect with mentors. This award will make it possible for
additional participants to attend. New this year are (1) a pilot program
combining the Broader Engagement Program, Education Program, Student Volunteers
and Ambassadors Program into SC Communities to better leverage available
opportunities for conference participants and (2) hosting travel to engage BPC
Alliance members with the SC Community in order to build lasting relationships.
