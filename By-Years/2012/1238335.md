The proposed planning activity seeks to establish a new Industry/University
Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) site at Iowa State University of the
existing Center for e-Design. The center currently involves six universities
-Virginia Tech as lead, the University of Massachusetts Amherst, the University
of Central Florida, Carnegie Mellon University, University of Buffalo, and
Brigham Young University. The specific needs within the Center to be met by Iowa
State University are focused in the following areas: 1) information technology
strategies and optimization of products and systems, 2) design education and
training, 3) early stage design theories and methodologies, 4) robotics and
sensor integration, 5) materials, manufacturing and design, and 6) design for
sustainability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed new site, in combination with
the existing center plans to build innovation capacity by developing methods and
tools that support the realization of new virtual simulation and design
paradigms for development of new engineered products and systems. The outcomes
from the center have the potential to broadly impact the public and private
sectors through impact on manufacturing. The site plans to have a significant
impact on students via a broad range of mechanism from curriculum to design
experiences. The PI and other Iowa State faculty have a documented history of
recruiting women and minority graduate and undergraduate students. Research and
educational findings will be disseminated nationally and have significant
broader impact through industrial collaboration and technology transfer.
