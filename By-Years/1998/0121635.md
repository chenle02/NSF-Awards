This collaborative project (with personnel at the University of California
Berkeley) is investigating the creation of a learner-centered metathesaurus
based on the analysis of transactions between learners and two learning
resources - the Math Forum and www.smete.org. Three modes of interaction are
being considered. The first involves data in which many students respond to the
same problem (the "Problem of the Week" at the Math Forum). The second
interactional mode involves data from transactions between learners and experts
(the Math Forum's "Ask Dr. Math" feature). The final interactional mode under
study uses collections at a third resource, www.smete.org, where learner usage
is more in the traditional library mode of search-retrieve. Additional feedback
information in the form of the viewed and selected resources enables the
construction of a map between the learners' language and resource metadata,
which has potential to permit the extension of the metathesaurus across domain
boundaries.
