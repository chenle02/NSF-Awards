As high performance computing (HPC) continues to grow in scale, energy and
resilience become first-class concerns, in addition to the pursuit of
performance. These concerns demand significant changes in many aspects of the
system stack including resource management and job scheduling. In order to
harness the great potential of extreme scale systems, this project aims to
incorporate intelligence into resource management and job scheduling. More
specifically, it will develop a framework named SPEaR (Scheduling for
Performance, Energy, and Resilience efficiency) for dynamically optimizing the
three-dimensional performance, energy, and resilience scheduling. The research
focuses on two thrusts: one is active learning to automatically extract valuable
performance, energy, and resilience patterns and tradeoffs out of application
and system data, and the other is intelligent scheduling to improve and control
performance, resilience, and energy efficiency in resource management and
scheduling. An event-driven scheduling simulator is being developed for
comprehensively evaluating scheduling policies and their aggregate effects. The
simulator, along with system logs, will be made available to the broad community
under an open source license. &lt;br/&gt;This project creates critical
technologies to promote system productivity and makes important advances
essential toward smart HPC. Additionally, the learning techniques developed in
this project are useful to other big data problems of national interests. The
education plan enhances the undergraduate and graduate curricula and broadens
the participation from underrepresented groups.
