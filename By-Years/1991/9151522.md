In many small colleges, one physics instructor is called upon to teach several
different levels of introductory physics. There generally are not enough
students to justify offering parallel lecture style classes at a given time to
students with varying calculus proficiency.Workshop Physics is a teaching system
in which students build their own understanding of physics by direct interaction
with phenomena. Traditional lectures are replaced by guided hands-on activities
for students working in small groups. Microcomputers interfaced with laboratory
equipment allow for real-time measurements and immediate interpretation of
results by the students.This project is resulting in an instructional design in
which both calculus-based and non-calculus students learn physics in the same
classroom/laboratory at the same time with one teacher using The Workshop
Physics approach. Improved learning and better use of instructional resources
are the outcomes.NSF grant funds are being matched with funds from non-federal
sources.
