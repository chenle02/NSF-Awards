Paleoanthropologists have long considered scavenging to have played an
important role in hominid development. This research will test the possibility
that tree-stored leopard kills of small bovids may have provided arboreally
adapted Plio-Pleistocene hominids with a regular source of scavengeable meat.
This project will systematically document the duration and pattern of carcass
consumption and temporary abandonment of tree-stored leopard kills in the
Serengeti National Park, Tanzania. The results will permit an assessment of the
feasibility and value of arboreal scavenging by hominids, and the extent to
which scavengeable bones can be identified at early East African archaeological
sites. This project will extend knowledge about early hominid foraging
strategies and also enable archaeologists to better understand the remains left
by early hominids.
