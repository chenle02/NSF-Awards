AST-0215793&lt;br/&gt;Oppenheimer, Ben R.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will
produce a new coronagraph system to extend the well-understood and tested
techniques of the classical coronagraph at the 3.67 meter Advanced Electro-
Optical System (AEOS) telescope of the United States Air Force observatory at
Haleakela, Maui, Hawaii. AEOS is equipped with a very high order (960 elements)
adaptive optics unit to correct for atmospheric turbulence. The AEOS adaptive
optics unit dramatically surpreses the seeing halo between radii of 0.2 and 1.5
arcseconds at a wavelength of 1.6 micrometers. It is within this region of the
spatial information domain that enables compelling scientific analysis for the
nearby vicinities of brown dwarfs, super-Jupiter planets, extra-solar system
zodiacal dust disks. This instrumentation development establishes a new
instrumentation program to provide graduate students in New York City to peruse
instrumentation-based research programs. Undergraduates from an all-women
college in New York will participate. &lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
