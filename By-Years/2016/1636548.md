The Subduction Zone Observatories (SZO) concept is a multidisciplinary facility
and associated science program to study a significant portion of one or more of
the circum-Pacific/Caribbean subduction zones as an integrated system.
Subduction zones contain a rich diversity of tectonic processes operating at a
wide range of temporal and spatial scales, from plate-scale over millions of
years to grain-scale over microseconds. Subduction zones span continental to
oceanic environments, and interact with biological processes and climate.
Subduction zones are responsible for many of Earth's most extreme natural events
including earthquakes, volcanic eruptions,&lt;br/&gt;and tsunamis. These hazards
coupled with increasing population density in these regions leads to an urgent
need to understand how subduction zones work to better inform hazard assessment,
mitigation, forecasting, and early warning. Emerging technologies, strong
international partnerships, open access data, and the success of long-term
community experiments supported by EarthScope and MARGINS/GeoPRISMS establish a
strong foundation to investigate the entire subduction zone system from an
integrated, multidisciplinary perspective and at multiple
scales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Subduction Zone Observatory workshop will provide
a critical forum to build community consensus across a range of disciplines and
constituencies, and an opportunity for early career scientists and senior
graduate students to help shape a new transformative initiative. A systems
approach to the study of subduction zone processes promotes integration across
multiple disciplines, interagency and international collaboration and
partnerships, technological innovation, early career development, education and
training for graduate students including students from underrepresented groups,
and improved hazard assessment.
