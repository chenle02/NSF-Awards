With the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor
Barry M. Trost, of the Department of Chemistry at Stanford University, is
developing new and efficient approaches for the synthesis of complex organic
molecules. Chiral ligands spontaneously promoting the formation of dinuclear
metal complexes are being developed for asymmetric catalysis of addition
reactions. Guided by mechanistic principles, a novel synthetic method effecting
trans hydrometalation is being explored. A variety of metal-mediated
methodologies, exploiting the chemistry of ruthenium, rhodium, molybdenum, and
vanadium, will be developed, facilitating the construction of complex organic
molecules from a range of substrates. Finally, recognizing that not all
catalytic events require transition metals, cyclization strategies based on
nucleophilic catalysis are opening new doors for unprecedented approaches for
organocatalytic polypeptide synthesis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As our knowledge of
the structure and reactivity of molecules increases, the practice of organic
synthesis is undergoing a change in focus, with the question now more often
asked being not if a complex target can be synthesized, but rather how.
Practical syntheses derive from the existence of a basic set of synthetic
reactions, and the limitations of that base set define the extent to which
organic syntheses may be made economical, efficient, and environmentally
conscious. With the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program,
Professor Barry M. Trost, of the Department of Chemistry at Stanford University,
is developing new and selective reactions that add to our arsenal of techniques
for the synthesis of the complex organic molecules increasingly forming the
basis of a myriad of applications, ranging from biology to materials science.
