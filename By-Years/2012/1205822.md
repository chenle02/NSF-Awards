Topological structures are central to many different branches of physics, at a
variety of different energy and length scales. Quantized vortices, for example,
express the rotational properties of a superfluid system; and, cosmologically,
Dirac monopoles have long been sought in the magnetic field since evidence for
their existence has implications for the quantization of charge. Here, several
experimental aspects of topological structures in the pristine and highly
controllable context of dilute-gas Bose-Einstein condensates are explored. The
dynamics of small clusters of interacting quantized vortices and their response
to changing environmental conditions, including temperature and the strength of
the interatomic interactions, are explored using real-time imaging techniques
under development as a central part of the project. More exotic topological
structures in spinor condensates are also sought for study, including merons
(two-component vortex "molecules") and Dirac monopoles.

Research on topological structures engages fundamental problems in basic physics
and the nature of the world. Progress toward answering these questions
contributes to the understanding of increasingly complex phenomena and
ultimately to its application to problems of significance. Here, one might
envision a study of superfluid rotation as leading to the creation of more
sensitive rotation detectors. Of more direct and immediate benefit is the
emphasis on education and training of undergraduates of diverse backgrounds in
the performance of cutting-edge research in physics. This training takes place
much earlier than is typical of research universities. The participating
students then become active members of the next generation of scientists and
citizens.
