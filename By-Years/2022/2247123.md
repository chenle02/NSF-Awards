Approximation is a fundamental concept in mathematics, and a powerful tool in
science and engineering, in which a core notion is that one may study an object
of interest by modeling it with simpler objects and using a limiting process.
The various approximation properties in mathematical analysis refer to the
capacity of an object, such as an infinite-dimensional vector space, to be
approximated in useful ways, for instance, by finite-dimensional subspaces. Such
properties are central to a number of important fields, such as quantum
probability theory, noncommutative geometry, and quantized calculus. This
project will focus on Lp-approximation properties of von Neumann algebras and
their applications in operator algebras, noncommutative analysis, and beyond.
The project incorporates research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate
students, as well as training for postdoctoral researchers.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this study, the principal investigator will explore Lp-
approximation properties of group von Neumann algebras and their connections to
the von Neumann rigidity property and Connes's quantized calculus. The major
challenges of the proposed research include the absence of geometric/metric
structure and a commutative product in the abstract setting. The proposed
research necessitates a reinvention of classical theory on Fourier multipliers
in a context with much less structure. Success in this proposed project will
strengthen the existing connection between functional analysis and harmonic
analysis and will enhance our understanding of the rigidity of discrete groups,
the theory of noncommutative geometry, and its applications to quantum
information theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
