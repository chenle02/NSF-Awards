ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PROPOSAL NO.: CTS-0306266&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL
INVESTIGATORS: MOHAMMAD SAMIMY&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION: OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;REVISITING COMPRESSIBILITY EFFECTS IN FREE SHEAR LAYERS
USING ADVANCED OPTICAL DIAGNOSTICS&lt;br/&gt;Compressible jets are utilized in a
myriad of engineering applications, vary in size from one millimeter in
passenger size automobile fuel injectors to one meter in commercial airplane jet
engines, and are almost always high Reynolds number and turbulent. In a recent
work conducted by this team, a novel MHz rate planar imaging system was used to
generate real-time movies of large-scale structures within supersonic
axisymmetric jets. A key result was that for relatively high compressibility
level (convective Mach number of 0.87), the convective velocity exhibited a
bimodal distribution where structures were either approximately 33% faster or
slower than theory predicted. Such deviation from theory has been found
previously in planar shear layers, but has never been observed to deviate with
both a fast and a slow mode in the same flow. A comprehensive study will
systematically explore the effects of a matrix of variables such as flow
geometry, flow visualization method, and compressibility level, on the dynamics
of turbulence structures and their measured convective velocity. The work will
advance "discovery and understanding" by involvement of graduate and
undergraduate students, incorporation of the measurement techniques developed
into the graduate curriculum, and rapidly disseminating the principal findings
by maintaining an active web site and by participation of students and PIs in
national and international meetings.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
