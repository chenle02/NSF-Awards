The project will develop a general framework for defining risk measures for
systems consisting of&lt;br/&gt;a set of interacting agents with uncertain joint
outcomes. This framework will define convex&lt;br/&gt;programming-based axioms
that characterize a very general class of systemic measures. This
class&lt;br/&gt;of risk measures includes all the ad hoc risk measures that have
been recently proposed in the&lt;br/&gt;literature. The optimization-based
approach leads to a primal-dual representation for the systemic&lt;br/&gt;risk
that allows attribution of the overall risk to individual agents in a fair
manner, as well as&lt;br/&gt;the development of decentralized algorithms for
systemic risk sensitive social welfare&lt;br/&gt;maximization. The project will
seek to extend this representation to include a larger class of&lt;br/&gt;risk
functions. New structural models will aid the study of the role of contagion in
complex&lt;br/&gt;systems. A statistical methodology will be developed for
identifying systemically important&lt;br/&gt;factors and the exposure of the
system to these factors. These systemic factors would lead to&lt;br/&gt;methods
for robust and efficient estimation of systemic risk. Systemic risk measure
based&lt;br/&gt;algorithms for the design and control of the network structure
underlying complex systems will&lt;br/&gt;also be
explored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent events across many disparate settings
(e.g., the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in&lt;br/&gt;2010, the financial crisis
in 2008, the Northeastern blackout in 2003) have all highlighted
the&lt;br/&gt;critical importance of risk management in general, and systemic
risk management in&lt;br/&gt;particular. Progress on tools for systemic risk
management will help prevent, or at least better&lt;br/&gt;manage, future
systemic failures in financial, public health, environmental, national
security,&lt;br/&gt;and governmental domains. The proposed research is
synergistic with ongoing relationships and&lt;br/&gt;collaborations the PIs
maintain with industry and policy-making groups concerned with
systemic&lt;br/&gt;risk in electricity grids and in capital markets. In
addition, the project will provide funding&lt;br/&gt;for research and
educational opportunities for students.
