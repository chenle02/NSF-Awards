This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
new approach for the fabrication of periodic nanoelectronic device arrays.
Processing of structures on the sub-100nm scale poses significant challenges due
to limited resolution of available lithographic methods. The proposed technique
will address the deficiencies of the existing nanofabrication approaches by
directly growing nanostructures inside a molecularly self-assembled NanoWell
shadow mask, which offers an unprecedented atomic-scale control over the
nanostructure size. During the proposed research, a silica shadow mask with
cylindrical pores ~3-30 nm, or NanoWells, will be self-assembled employing
organic surfactant molecules. Silicon nanorods will be grown inside NanoWells by
both CVD and sputtering, followed by chemical removal of a shadow mask. An array
of Si nanorod LEDs will be fabricated to demonstrate the feasibility of the
proposed approach as well as the quantum size effect for the Si nanorods.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this cost effective, high-throughput, and
ultra-high precision technique will figure into a wide range of electronic
device array applications such as sensors, processors, memories and displays,
and provide enhanced miniaturization, speed, and power reduction. The proposed
technique will offer the dramatically improved nanoprocessing capabilities for
the fabrication of flat panel displays, sensor arrays, quantum dots,
nanomagnetics, image and signal processors. It will have a broad range of
potential applications in commercial microelectronics and image processing
industries. &lt;br/&gt;
