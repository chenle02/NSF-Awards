This research is the continuation of a very productive program under Professor
H. L. Tuller at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Under the prior
support by the National Science Foundation, Professor Tuller and his colleagues
published more than eighteen significant papers in scientific journals on topics
such as mixed electrical conduction in nonstoichiometric oxides, electronic
structure of grain boundaries and interfaces in polycrystalline zinc oxide,
defects and charge transport in stabilized tantalum oxide, electrical and
optical properties of magnesia and alumina, thermodynamics and transport
properties in mixed cerium and uranium oxides, and metal oxide sensors. The
current research will emphasize defect formation, interaction, and transport in
nonstoichiometric metal oxides in both single and polycrystalline forms. The
program will include both experimental and theoretical efforts. Electrically-
active ceramic interfaces (which form the basis of a variety of advanced
electronic devices) will be studied with the goal of modifying and controlling
the chemistry of these interfaces, characterization of their electronic
transport properties, and interpreting the correlation between the two. Oxygen
defect concentration as a function of depth from the surface will be determined
with complex impedance techniques and through a unique new method based upon
photoelectrochemical etching. Solid state diffusional techniques will be used to
establish the oxygen ion configuration as a function of composition. Electronic
ceramics are technologically important to the semiconductor industry, the sensor
industry, and for fuel cells, catalysts, and high temperature batteries.
Understanding of the defect structure and electrical charge transport is crucial
to the performance of these materials. Training of students to do research in
this critical area is a key part of this research program.
