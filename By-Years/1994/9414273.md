9414273 Bailey The objective of this award is to learn and demonstrate the
functionality needed for a concurrent engineering project management system to
support an existing design process. A second objective is to learn how to build
realistic, pre-definable, and reasonably complete product development protocol
models and to build a library of objects representing activities, tasks, etc.,
from which many such models can be generated. The final objective is to learn
and demonstrate how to build product development protocol models from a library
of design process objects and then translate the models into data files for
concurrent engineering project management. Design integration and management
through processes such as concurrent engineering is aimed at improving the
engineering design process, leading to products that are better design, easier
to manufacture, and more appropriate for use by consumers.
