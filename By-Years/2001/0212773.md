Every person that has ever walked the earth developed from an embryo. However,
many animals such as sea anemones can develop by three alternate developmental
pathways: from an embryo (embryogenesis), from a piece of an adult that has been
fragmented by injury (regeneration), or from an autonomously produced offshoot
of an adult (asexual reproduction). How are three alternate developmental
pathways encoded in the genomes of animals such as sea anemones? Why is this
kind of developmental flexibility lacking in animals such as humans? Answers to
these fundamental questions will come from understanding the similarities and
differences between embryogenesis, regeneration, and asexual reproduction at the
molecular level.

Towards this end, the Finnerty lab will compare the roles of specific axial
patterning genes in sea anemones during embryogenesis, regeneration, and asexual
reproduction. Axial patterning is the process whereby an animal's body is
divided into distinct regions along its primary axis. For example, the
relatively simple body of a sea anemone has three main regions: a head, a
central body column, and a foot. Importantly, axial patterning is a process that
must be performed during embryogenesis, regeneration, and asexual reproduction.
This study seeks to reveal whether conserved molecular mechanisms are used to
accomplish axial patterning in these alternate pathways. The following specific
questions will be addressed. (1) Are the same genes used to accomplish axial
patterning in each developmental pathway? (2) Are the temporal and spatial
patterns of gene expression consistent between pathways? (3) What are the
consequences for embryogenesis of "turning off" a given gene by experimental
means? To address questions one and two, the expression of several homeobox
transcription factors will be assayed using the techniques of in situ
hybridization and quantitative RT-PCR. To address question three, gene
expression will be "silenced" using the technique of RNA interference.
