This award will support collaborative research in physics between Dr. Robert
Brandenberger, Brown University and Dr. Anne Christine Davis, University of
Cambridge, England. The proposed research deals with the role which topological
defects that arise in many particle physics models play in cosmology, and
conversely, with the constraints that can be put on particle physics models by
investigating their cosmological consequences. Topological defects are playing
an increasing role in cosmology. They are invoked in many theories to explain
the origin of galaxies, clusters and the large-scale structure of the universe.
Specifically, it is proposed to study the microphysics of topological defects.
Cosmological consequences of some non-standard particle physics models will also
be explored. These studies may provide new information about the state of matter
at energies which will never be accessible in accelerators. This project will
benefit from the complementary expertise of the US investigator in cosmological
applications and the experience in field theory of the British collaborator.
