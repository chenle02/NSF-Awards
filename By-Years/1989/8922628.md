This award from the Office of Special Projects of the Division of Chemistry
enables the participation of twelve younger U.S. chemists in the Bilateral NSF-
SERC Conference on Molecular Recognition which is being held in Leicester,
England, on October 20-24, 1989. This conference, which is being convened at the
recommendation of the NSF Chemistry Advisory Committee, brings together some
twenty-five young American and British scientists who are likely to be the
future leaders in this field. Molecular recognition involves the study of weak
intermolecular forces and the role that they play in the formation of complexes
or assemblies between two or more chemical entities. The complexity and
specificity of biochemical processes depends critically on the controlled and
effective use of non-covalent interactions in the binding and recognition
processes between biomolecules. This leads to the remarkable properties of
biological systems such as enzymes, DNA, antibodies, and membranes. The primary
aim of this Bilateral NSF-SERC Conference on Molecular Recognition is to expose
young scientists to the wider community of international scholarship and to
build the foundation for long term international collaborations.
