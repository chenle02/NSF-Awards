The proposed project will correlate deposits and individual strata with recorded
hydrovolcanic eruptive events at the Ukinrek Maars, Alaska, in order to
understand the processes involved in eruption and emplacement of phreatomagmatic
deposits. Our results will provide a means for inferring diverse phreatomagmatic
eruption styles from the characteristics of deposits in places where the
eruptions were not observed. The underlying reason for this research is to aid
understanding of hydrovolcanic processes for hazards assessments. Hydrovolcanic
eruptions commonly include "blast" events that are among the most devastating
and hazardous of all eruptions. It is of fundamental importance for hazards
evaluations to recognize these deposits, as they are commonly mistaken for re-
worked volcanic deposits.
