This award will support the particpation of undergraduate students in
conducting hands-on, basic research in mammalian genetics under the mentorship
of staff scientists at Jackson Laboratories. During the program, which is 11
weeks long each summer, students are exposed to all aspects of the research
process as well as participating in group sessions on careers, ethics, critical
scientific thinking, and a formal student symposium. This Research Experience
for Undergraduates Site has been very successful with 95% of former student
participants now in graduate or medical school or employed in science. This
award will foster the continued education and training of individuals who will
be part of our next generation of basic researchers in the Biological Sciences.
