This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Technology Transfer
Phase I project is to develop quantum dot-based materials to enable the
development of low cost, ultrafast lasers. By utilizing new quantum dot
semiconductor materials, ultrafast lasers that are monolithic, robust, and
inexpensive are planned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Successful completion of this STTR
project will result in the development of compact, robust and inexpensive
ultrafast laser systems. These systems will address a wide variety of markets
including bioinstrumentation, biomedical applications such as corrective laser
surgery and screening pharmaceuticals, and for instrumentation for homeland
security and several military applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
