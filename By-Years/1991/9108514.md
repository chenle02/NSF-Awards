The archaebacterium Halobacterium halobium contains intracellular gas-filled
vesicles that confer buoyancy to the cell. Research will be carried out on the
development of a cloning vector for this organism, using the plasmid which
contains the genes for the gas vesicles. Studies of the loci involved with
plasmid stability are being undertaken in order to determine the mechanism
responsible for a class of vesicle mutants which are partially vac and extremely
unstable.
