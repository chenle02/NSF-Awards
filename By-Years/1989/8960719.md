The recent discovery of new high temperature superconductor systems has created
a need to develop compatible measurement techniques to characterize the
electrical, structural, acoustic and optical properties of these materials.
Although many standard methods of measuring conventional superconducting
materials can be adapted to new high Tc superconductor systems, effective
measurement of critical properties is difficult. Conventional acoustic
techniques to measure the physical properties of superconducting materials
normally require contact between the sensor and the superconducting material
under test. This research uses noncontacting laser-based ultrasonics as a means
of accurate, non-intrusive measurement of the electronic, vibrational and
optical properties of new high Tc superconducting materials. Successful
completion of this work would result in a research technique for improved
material characterization in superconducting perovskite structures in
environments at lower than room temperature. The significance of this program is
the possible development of noncontact and versatile ultrasonic monitoring
system for fabrication processes and of acoustic vibrational mode measurements
for superconducting device performance.
