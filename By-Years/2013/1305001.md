This Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Particpation Bridges to the
Baccalaureate Alliance is named "CIMA" ("Summit" in Spanish). CIMA consists of
five Hispanic Serving Institutions in Texas led by the only college in the
nation with both a Hispanic Serving Institution and Historically Black Colleges
and Universities designation. The CIMA project will broaden participation of
minorities in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields by
involving at least 900 underrepresented minorities (URM) STEM majors in CIMA
activities, increasing minority STEM student enrollment by as least 10 percent
and increasing the successful transfer of community college into STEM majors at
4-year institutions by 20 percent from baseline. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CIMA
Alliance will provide: undergraduate research; peer mentorship; faculty
mentorship; tutoring; Supplemental Instruction (SI) especially in math; STEM
student academic development; STEM student clubs; faculty professional
development for advising for STEM pathways and teaching best practices; training
for college recruiters, advisors and developmental math teachers to improve
recruitment of underrepresented minorities into STEM; and development of
additional STEM articulation agreements.
