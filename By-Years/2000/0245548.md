Abstract:

The principal investigator proposes to study the structure and representation
theory of vertex operator algebras, connections between vertex operator algebras
and geometry, number theory in mathematics and conformal field theory in
physics. He plans to investigate the following: (1) Connections among the
monster simple group, the monstrous moonshine, permutation orbifolds and
elliptic genera. The goal is to understand a new mysterious appearance of the
permutation orbifolds in the monstrous moonshine and to understand the moonshine
geometrically. (2) Coset construction. The coset construction is an important
way to construct new conformal field theory from a given one. The goal is to
prove a duality theory of Schur-Weyl type and determine the module category of a
coset vertex operator algebra. (3) Subalgebras of vertex operator algebras. The
goal is to understand the rationality of vertex operator algebras. This research
has fundamental applications to orbifold theory. (4) Characterizations of
certain finitely generated vertex operator algebras. This research leads to the
classification of rational vertex operator algebras with small central charges.

The theory of vertex operator algebra is a new and very rapidly developing area
of mathematics. The vertex operator algebra is essentially the chiral algebra in
conformal field theory and string theory (which is the leading candidate for the
"theory of everything" in mathematical physics) in physics. The proposed
research lays some algebraic foundations of conformal field theory. The proposed
research also has a lot of applications in many areas of mathematics, such as
group theory, topology and geometr
