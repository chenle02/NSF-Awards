Coordinated Introductory Courses for Computer Science and Mathematics Majors
This project restructures and coordinates a common core of introductory courses
for computer science and mathematics majors. The courses are Mathematical
Foundations I and II and Algorithmic Computation I and II. The mathematics
courses introduce abstract mathematical concepts from discrete mathematics,
logic, and graph theory, and the computer science courses apply these concepts
to the development of algorithms that can be implemented on a computer. The
computer science courses rely on the functional and logical programming
paradigms as a basis for direct application of mathematical concepts in
algorithmic form. By stressing visualization, concrete examples, and practical
applications in the laboratory, these courses make abstract concepts accessible
to under-prepared students; New Mexico State University is recognized by the
Department of Education as a Minority Institution. All four courses are required
by computer science majors, and the mathematics majors are required to take all
but the last computer science course, which is optional in their program.***//
