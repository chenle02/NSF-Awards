Under the direction of Dr. Dan Healan, MS Christine Hernandez will collect data
for her doctoral dissertation. For several years with National Science
Foundation support Dr. Healan has conducted archaeological excavation in the
Zinapecuaro region of Central Mexico. What makes this area important are its
abundant deposits of high quality obsidian (volcanic glass). Because this
material may be worked to produce sharp edges it was highly prized raw material
for tools in pre-metal times. Evidence to date indicates that Zinapecuaro
obsidian was traded over a wide region and that patterns of exchange varied over
time. Dr. Healan and his colleagues have excavated in a number of mining and
production areas and collected large amounts of material. The problem they now
face is dating each occurrence. Luckily numerous ceramic remains have been
recovered and because ceramic styles change over time analysis of them provides
a fruitful approach. MS Hernandez will travel to Mexico and study these ceramic
materials. Applying a standard type variety approach in conjunction with
stratigraphic information, she will seriate these materials to establish a
sequence. Through the identification of exotic or foreign potsherds she will tie
the local sequence into a broader inter-regional context. Finally she will study
how inter-regional relationships developed and changed over time. This research
is important for several reasons. It will provide a chronological sequence which
many archaeologists can use for a variety of goals. It will shed light on the
economic and political relationships between societies at a relatively simple
level of development and elucidate the ways in which they interact. It will also
assist in the training of a promising young scientist.
