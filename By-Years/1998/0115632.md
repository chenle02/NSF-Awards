This planning grant will develop a comprehensive plan to refine, broaden and
implement an interdisciplinary curriculum model that has proven effective in
accelerating learning for diverse student populations in science and reading at
the upper elementary grades. Collaborators are the school districts of Broward
and Palm Beach Counties. The project will also contribute to the knowledge base
about specific design features associated with quality teacher professional
development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
