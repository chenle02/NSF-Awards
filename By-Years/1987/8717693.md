This award is made according to the provisions in AD/ENG Bulletin No. 85-25,
"Expedited Awards for Novel Research". Many tieback walls (the walls are tied or
anchored by rods or cables to the adjacent soil) have been constructed in
seismically active areas of the world. However there is no generally accepted
method of seismic analysis and design for this type of retaining structure. This
research project considers the case where the walls are tied with pressure-
grouted anchors. It is generally recognized that anchors installed with grout
pressure have significantly higher anchoring capacity than those installed
without grout pressure. While the reason for the higher capacity is not well
defined, there are several possible explanations for the increase. Depending
upon the actual cause, the effect of earthquake ground shaking can lead to a
loss in strength of the anchor. The decrease in anchor capacity may vary from
insignificant to a critical loss of capacity leading to failure of the wall.
This research project will investigate the cause of the increased capacity of
pressure grouted anchors, as well as the effect of seismic ground shaking upon
this increased capacity.
