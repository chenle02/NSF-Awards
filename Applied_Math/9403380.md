9403380 Manoranjan This project will support the Workshop on Mathematical
Biology to be held March 18-20, 1994 at Washington State University. The
workshop will bring together theoretical and experimental scientists working in
areas of biology, mathematics, and physics, thus creating an atmosphere for open
communication and in-depth interactions. The major speakers will address topics
in population models in ecology, bursting in neurons, chemical oscillations, and
thermoregulation and flight. The workshop will be interdisciplinary and is
expected to be a focal point for the meeting of theoretical and experimental
scientists, especially from the Pacific Northwest region. There will be an
emphasis on attracting recent doctoral recipients and graduate students to
attend the workshop and in providing them opportunities for open communication
with senior scientists on topics at the cutting edge of theoretical and
mathematical biology. ***
