Tribological processes at materials interfaces are of major technological
importance since they are the source of wear and degradation as well as
frictional energy dissipation. Fundamental understanding of the physics and
chemistry of tribological phenomena is of particular importance for the
development of advanced materials required to function under extreme ambient
conditions and for long periods of time. Although there is an immense body of
empirical data, there is no detailed microscopic theory of tribological
phenomena. This project is concerned with the microscopic mechanisms of
friction, lubrication and wear at material interfaces. It focuses on two topics.
They are studies of lubricants, lubrication, and plastic flow,and studies of
tribological processes at interfaces between amorphous and crystalline
materials. These studies will be performed through molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations. The MD method allows one to follow the time evolution of the
dynamical state of a system of interacting particles by integration of the
classical equations of motion. In this method, the particle interactions are
prescribed by pair potentials. The number of particles normally included in this
type of analysis is between one and ten thousand. The method is applicable to
systems in various stages of aggregation (solid, liquid, crystalline, or
amorphous), under various conditions and in the presence of complex interactions
and external fields. Furthermore, the method allows the study of structural
changes that materials undergo at elevated pressure and temperature and there is
evidence that careful simulations are in agreement with experimental structural
data. The intent of the project is to provide a systematic method of predicting
the complex phenomena of friction, lubrication and wear processes.
