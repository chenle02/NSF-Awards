An integrated sensor system employing high-precision ultrasound range finding
instruments combined with a charged-couple device (CCD) video processor can be
used to determine the precise position and motion of container ships being
loaded at a pier. Processing will be carried out by a twelve state Kalman filter
which relies on feedback from the loading crane's automatic control processor
for good a priori state vector estimates and for high-order corrections. The
system will be self-monitoring, providing a reliable estimate of the errors in
its own predictions, and detecting unpredicted motions quickly, for operator
alert and correction. The primary anticipated benefit of this research is to
demonstrate the feasibility of fully automating the loading of container cargo
onto ships at pierside.
