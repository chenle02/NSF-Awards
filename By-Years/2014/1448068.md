The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to produce low-cost and customizable aromas
that are inspired by plant extracts. The fragrance industry uses fragrant
extracts from flowers and other plant materials as basic building blocks for
haute-couture finished fragrances. These extracts are expensive due to the
limited availability of suitable plant materials, and due to the fact that the
extracts are too complicated to replicate by mixing pure chemicals. This project
will generate novel fragrance blends via fermentation ("cultured aromas"). These
cultured aromas will be customized for the exacting requirements of professional
perfumers, offering a degree of creativity that does not exist with plant
extracts. This technology will present a disruptive entry into the multi-billion
dollar market for finished fragrances. Beyond fragrances, this technology will
allow the development of new customizable extracts with the beneficial
properties of plant extracts, including flavors, dyes, and antioxidant
activity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase I project proposes to apply
advanced synthetic biology tools to produce sustainable alternatives to complex
plant extracts. Conventional metabolic engineering projects focus on the
optimized production of a single target compound; this project instead will
engineer microbial strains that produce a range of components found in high-
value plant extracts used in the fragrance industry. The goal is to rapidly
screen and characterize novel plant enzymes for use in conjunction with existing
strains that produce key fragrance molecules. These novel enzymes are expected
to produce multiple fragrance molecules and the profile of the resulting blends
will be compared to those derived from plants via high throughput metabolomics.
The cultured aroma blends can then be customized to a perfumers' specification
by tuning the biosynthetic pathways.
