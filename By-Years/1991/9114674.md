The objective of this research is to develop and integrate the perception,
planning, and manipulation technologies necessary for autonomously detecting,
uncovering, and retrieving fragile buried objects. Such technology has
application in the retrieval of waste containers from landfills, recovery of
munitions from shallow burial, exposure of cables beneath the ocean floor, and
acquisition of extraterrestrial soil/rock samples. The proposed work will
advance current knowledge in the fields of software architectures and reasoning
systems for autonomous robots working with geomaterials, perception for building
three- dimensional representations of buried objects, and manipulation for
extricating objects from geo or diffuse material.
