The goal of the project is to provide image processing equipment for use in
introductory classes in both the two-year and four-year degree programs, as well
as in advanced classes, and for undergraduate research projects. The use of such
equipment will teach students to integrate knowledge gained from superficially
disparate courses, and to encourage them to synthesize this information to
generate unique solutions to unique problems. This project constitutes a
significant improvement in undergraduate instruction, not just in terms of the
increased scope it affords, but also because of the cohesiveness it provides. In
this age of ever-increasing specialization it is imperative that students
comprehend the unifying relationships within the biological sciences.
