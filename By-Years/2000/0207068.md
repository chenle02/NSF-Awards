ABSTRACT

Proposal Number: CTS-0207068 Principal Investigator: L.-S. Fan Affiliation: Ohio
State U Title: High Pressure/High Temperature Gas-Liquid-Solid Fluidization

This GOALI proposal is a continuation of the PI s work on electrical capacitance
tomography (ECT) to characterize complex three phase flow in fluidization
processes. The novel aspect of this proposal is the image reconstruction
technique based on the unsupervised analog neural network multi-criteria
optimization technique.
