9732145&lt;br/&gt;van Dyck&lt;br/&gt;This work is a continuation of a series of
ultra-precise measurements of masses of atomic ions. One new goal of the
research is to develop an ion source that would allow determination of masses of
ions such as germanium and selenium that are not easily generated in a vapor
phase. A second goal is to improve the accuracy of the spectrometer to levels
that would allow such measurements as the "weight" of a chemical bond as well as
refine existing measurements of masses of elements such as tritium and helium-3.
