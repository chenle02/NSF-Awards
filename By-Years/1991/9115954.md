This award will support a U.S.-France Workshop in high performance polymers
organized jointly by Matthew Tirrell of the University of Minnesota, Alain
Michel of the Laboratory of Organic Materials, and Alain Fradel of Pierre and
Marie Curie University, Paris, France. New developments in high performance
polymer materials are of technological importance in microelectronics, ceramics,
medicine and separation processes. The workshop will focus on the development of
high performance properties beyond the current norm. They will address
developing multicomponent materials of increased strength, chemical or thermal
resistance, enhanced electrical conductivity, improved nonlinear optical
properties, and effectiveness as interfacial agents. Multicomponent refers to
existing composites, copolymers, blends, grafts and semicrystalline materials.
The workshop participants will exchange information and review the state of the
art in this area. This workshop will bring together strong French expertise and
tradition in macromolecular chemistry and American experience spanning the range
of chemical synthesis to processing. It is expected that future research areas,
including joint activities, will be defined.
