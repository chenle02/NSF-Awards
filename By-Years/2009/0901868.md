Objective: Optical injection locking has been actively researched for its
potential to improve ultrahigh frequency performance of semiconductor lasers for
both digital and analog applications. The proposed research explores a new
injection-locking scheme, based on unidirectional semiconductor ring lasers
(USRLs) monolithically integrated with distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) laser
masters, which is expected to result in low-cost ultrafast (over 100 GHz)
functional chips that will be easy to use in practice. Both single-USRL as well
as cascaded systems will be investigated. Experimental tests will be performed
on ultrahigh frequency modulation of injection-locked microring USRLs. Both
digital and analog modulation will be explored.

Intellectual Merit: Semiconductor ring lasers have not yet been used for
modulation bandwidth enhancement by injection-locking technique. The proposed
research has the potential of revolutionizing the field of optical
telecommunication by providing scientific basis for development of a novel class
of ultra-high-speed integrated light sources based on micro-ring USRLs. The use
of USRLs holds promise for development of ultra-high-speed chips suitable for
use in optical transmission networks. The results will be important for both
fundamental and applied physics of semiconductor lasers.

Broader Impacts: First demonstration of modulation bandwidth enhancement in
monolithically integrated injection-locked USRLs will open up new opportunities
for creation of high performance, small size, low cost, ultra-high-speed
integrated light sources for all levels of telecommunication networks.
Development of inexpensive ultrafast chips operating at speeds exceeding 100 GHz
will have a huge societal impact by increasing the transmission capacity of
fiber-based networks.
