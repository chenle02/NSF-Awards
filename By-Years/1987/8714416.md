This is a study of the structural requirements and selectivity of reactions on
oxide surfaces with the objective of determining those factors important for the
design of new catalytic oxide materials. Adsorption and reaction on single
crystals of zinc oxide and titania are studied to determine the structure
sensitivity of archetypal reactions. Processes studied include proton transfer
and nucleophilic oxidation on the zinc polar face of zinc oxide, electrophilic
substitution on the oxygen polar face, and activation of difunctional species on
the prism faces. Relative surface-adsorbate bond strengths on polycrystalline
oxide powders are determined quantitatively in order to elucidate the nature of
the surface-adsorbate bond and its dependence on both moieties; this may explain
the surprising selectivities observed for hydrocarbon and oxygenate reactions on
zinc oxide. Ultimately, this work should lead to principles for design and
synthesis of novel oxide materials for use as catalysts and sensors.
