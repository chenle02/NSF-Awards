The active, contractile, and remodeling nature of the cytoskeleton is central to
many cellular activities. No model yet exists, however, for quantifying these
phenomena. The objective of this research is to translate discrete nano-scale
molecular events like actin-myosin interaction into a macro-scale at which the
cellular contractility and remodeling operate. A quantitative model of cell
contractility will be developed reflecting the heterogenous, interconnected and
remodeling nature of the cytoskeleton. Such a model is crucial to interpreting
the micro-scale and macro-scale mechanical behavior of the cell that is
complicated by the long-range interconnections and reorganizations
characteristics of the cytoskeleton.

The proposed model is crucial to interpreting the micro-scale and macro-scale
cytoskeletal functions that are complicated by the long-range interconnections
and reorganizations characteristics of the cytoskeleton. The experimental
observations on micro- and macro-scale cytoskeletal mechanics will be
interpreted in the context of the heterogeneous, interconnected and remodeling
character of the cytoskeleton. While a model of more complex cell processes such
as mechanotransduction and migration are beyond the immediate scope of this
research, the tools developed here will subsequently aide the research community
in addressing other fundamentally important issues in a manner that cannot be
explored systematically and quantitatively by experiments alone. The proposed
model will offer a necessary tool for advancing our understanding of a key step
in cellular mechanosensing and mechanotransduction, and has therefore a strong
transformative potential for discovering new strategies to mitigate many
diseases where the interplay of mechanics and biochemistry are critical (e.g.
atherosclerosis, calcific aortic stenosis, cancer, ...)

On an outreach level, the PI plans to disseminate the research through a
website dedicated to cellular and molecular mechanisms. In addition, the PIs
plan to develop new courses and to broaden the participation of students from
underrepresented groups.
