CTS-9309530 State University of New York-Binghamton Timothy J. Singler ABSTRACT
Fabrication techniques in microelectronics has outpaced developments in
soldering. The process of soldering is to be examined with emphasis on greater
understanding of the underlying transport phenomena. Integrated experimental and
theoretical approaches will focus on joint shape prediction, solder defect
analysis and reactive wetting to improve soldering technology. Soldering is
important throughout the electronics industry. Advances in soldering could
reduce failure rates to increase productivity or maintain performance while
better addressing environmental considerations.
