&lt;br/&gt;Lay Summary&lt;br/&gt;Cocroft, Hunt and
Wood&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mating signals can diverge early in the process of
speciation, but it is unclear whether signal divergence plays a direct role in
speciation or is a byproduct of other processes such as ecological
specialization. Our goal is to determine the role of mating signals in the
diversification of a group of plant-feeding insects. The Enchenopa binotata
species complex of treehoppers consists of nine species that are specialists on
various trees and shrubs in North America. Considerable evidence suggests that
speciation in this group occurred as a result of a series of shifts to novel
host plants. A host shift alters life history timing, which, in combination with
high host fidelity, allows divergence in traits that enhance performance on a
novel host. Our research will test the hypothesis that divergence in mating
signals is important in speciation by reducing gene flow between populations on
ancestral and novel host plants. Our project will integrate (1) a comparative
study of vibrational mating signals in the nine extant Enchenopa binotata
species; (2) comparison of patterns of signal variation within and among species
with patterns of DNA sequence divergence; and (3) determination of whether
divergence in signals and life history traits has occurred in experimentally
host-shifted populations. This research will provide a complementary picture of
the relationship between mating signals and divergence not only in fully
differentiated species, but also in lineages in the early stages of host plant
race formation. Results of this research will enhance our basic understanding of
speciation, and may provide practical benefits such as an improved understanding
of how agricultural pests become established on novel host
species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
