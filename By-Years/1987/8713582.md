The modified chemical vapor deposition (MCVD) process is in wide use for the
fabrication of optical fibers. One of the steps of the process is to deposit
high purity chemicals on the inner surface of a fused silica tube to form doped
silica glass layers. This is accomplished by passing a high purity gas mixture
through the bore of a rotating silica tube. The tube is mounted in a glass-
working lathe and is heated externally by a moving torch. The reagents are
heated by the torch, causing a gas-phase reaction which results in the formation
of submicron glassy particles. These particles travel along the tube and are
deposited on the wall, downstream of the torch. Although the MCVD process is
operational, the theoretical underpinnings are woefully weak. The objective of
the proposed research is to provide a strengthened underpinning which should
lead to more efficient operation. Features to be investigated include the
effects of torch heating, torch speed, gas flow, tube rotation, and thermal
radiation.
