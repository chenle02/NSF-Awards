Under the direction of Dr. Vincas Steponaitis, Mr. I. Randolph Daniel will
analyze a body of archaeological material from the Hardaway site, located in
Stanly County, North Carolina. The results will be incorporated into Mr.
Daniel's dissertation thesis. The Hardaway site was excavated in the early
1960's but the materials recovered have not been fully studied. These date from
the Archaic period, between 10,500 and 8,000 years ago, and document the
adaptation of Native American peoples to the relatively modern biotic community
which emerged following the last glacial advance. Mr. Daniel will examine the
lithic materials recovered. Through analysis of these artifacts and comparison
with geological outcrops in the region, he hopes to match raw materials to their
sources. This will provide information on the geographical range exploited by
the Hardaway people. He will also examine collections from other sites in the
region to set the Hardaway site into a broader cultural context. On this basis,
he will reconstruct the Archaic settlement system in the region and learn how
aboriginal groups utilized the seasonally changing environment. This research is
important for several reasons. It will shed light on the origins and development
of Native American culture. It will also reveal how human groups at a
technologically simple level adapted to a variable environment and the
strategies they employed. Finally, it will aid in the training of an extremely
promising young scientist.
