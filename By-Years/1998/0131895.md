For nearly 30 years, the National Science Foundation has provided support for
EERI's Learning from Earthquakes (LFE) Program. These funds have enabled dozens
of &lt;br/&gt;multidisciplinary teams of researchers to carry out field
investigations of significant &lt;br/&gt;earthquakes throughout the world, to
observe and document effects on the natural and&lt;br/&gt;built environment and
resulting social, economic and policy impacts. Over the years
the&lt;br/&gt;program has generated much new knowledge, leading to changes in
practice and stimulating new research in each of the related
fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the US leader in post-earthquake investigations,
EERI proposes significant&lt;br/&gt;revisions to the LFE program to improve the
overall coordination of NSF funded post-earthquake research efforts and to
incorporate new technologies to improve the collection and management of
perishable data. During the duration of this award, EERI will coordinate post-
earthquake investigations and improve the collection of perishable data in the
first weeks after the earthquake. Equipment will be acquired to enhance data
collection and dissemination, training will be provided to team members, and a
new program of small grants for follow up research in each of the disciplines
that contribute to fundamental understanding of earthquake impacts will be
initiated. The LFE program will be integrated into the new Network for
Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES). The LFE program will work with other
agencies, organizations and NSF funded centers to reach diverse population of
young people and students to stimulate their interest and involvement in science
and engineering. These and other activities during the five year duration of
this award will contribute to a fundamental understanding of the science and
practice of earthquake engineering and the reduction of future earthquake
losses.&lt;br/&gt;
