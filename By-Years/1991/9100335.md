Under this grant, the University of Rhode Island will carry out its first, in a
series, major initiatives in educational outreach related to the science and
social science aspects of global environmental change through the mechanism of
an Honor's Colloquium for the spring semester 1991. The Honor's Colloquium is a
combination of public outreach, in the form of Wednesday evening public lectures
and a complementary undergraduate course for freshman and sophomore Honor's
students. The University of Rhode Island will bring world-renown educators and
scientists to the campus during the spring 1991 for the Wednesday evening
lectures. They will videotape the evening lectures for long-term educational
prospects in the form of additional-to-offered- courses and the development of a
new course for the distance- learning market. The invited speaker presentations
will be published and available along with curriculum materials and readings to
other interested educational institutions and public groups through a number of
networks and mechanisms. A Colloquium volume will be produced through the Marine
Technology Society through a special issue of the Marine Technology Society
Journal. This activity is important because it seeks to increase the pool of
qualified students entering the environmental sciences.
