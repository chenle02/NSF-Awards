9322321 Guckenheimer The National Science Foundation's initiative in high
performance computing has had a tremendous impact on scientific opportunities
for the national research community. The Theory Center's Supercomputing Program
for Undergraduate Research (SPUR) complements this initiative by extending the
opportunities of computational research to undergraduate students. By providing
students with an early research experience, this program is an effective mean of
motivating students to pursue careers and graduate education in mathematics,
science, and engineering. Through this program, undergraduate students will
investigate problems in an area of computational science research under the
joint guidance of a Cornell University faculty member and a member of the
Cornell Theory Center's scientific and technical staff. While working on their
research projects, the students will not only participate in scientific research
but will also learn about computational methods and receive training in high
performance computing techniques. The research projects will take advantage of
the advanced computational tools of the Theory Center, including the use of
scalable parallel processing and visualization tools. The research experience
will be enhanced by the interaction among students from diverse institutions
with multidisciplinary backgrounds and research projects. Building on
longstanding relationships, the Center will aggressively recruit from
historically black colleges and women's colleges and also target
thoseinstitutions which lack a strong research orientation. Students at colleges
and universities with otherwise limited computational research resources will
thus have the opportunity to undertake significant research projects as part of
their undergraduate education.
