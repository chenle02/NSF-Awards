The research is concerned with the development and application of a new method
to solve time-dependent problems in quantum mechanics. The approach is based on
the existence of a closed Lie algebra for certain Hamiltonian systems. Under
such conditions, the time development of the system can be reduced to solving a
relatively simple set of differential equations. The benefit of this method is
that for the systems to which it can be applied, it offers a simple approach to
the dynamics which is also applicable to open systems.
