B.A. Degree in Computer Science

This project, which has the potential of having long-term and wide spread impact
on national curricula in computing, develops a B.A. degree in computer science
that incorporates research results from Digital Production Arts and Computer
Graphics into all required computing courses in the curriculum. Instruction in
these (new) courses is oriented toward large-scale problem solving. The starting
point for the project is the articulation of key concepts that underlie the
proposed curriculum including: a machine model (imperative programming, machine
capabilities, machine limits); a connection model (networks for communication
and distributed processing); software design (the object-oriented paradigm,
large-scale development, testing); windowing and operating systems (resource
management, protection levels, security); data structures and performance
(performance measurement, bottleneck identification, work-flow management); and,
cross-platform computing (PDAs, embedded systems, cross-compilation, external
device control). The second phase of the curriculum design involves the
identification of research results from the graphics and special effects domains
that are amenable to mapping, at the undergraduate level, directly into the
identified key concepts. Particularly unique in this B.A. in C. S. is the
magnitude and origin of the problems to be integrated and the broad impact of
the approach across an entire curriculum. The benefits to the students are not
only from the problem-solving orientation of the instruction but also the
students' exposure to the vitality of real research problems. It is the
proposers' supposition that a more balanced educational experience, like the one
involved in the B.A.C.S. degree program, may be of substantial benefit to the
students and to society.
