This project will improve student instruction in electro- chemical methods
through the purchase of a potentiostat/galvanostat with a mercury drop
electrode. Using this equipment, students in analytical, inorganic, and physical
chemistry courses will be able to explore the application of electrochemical
methods to a wide range of problems. The instrument will be computer interfaced
for ease of student instruction and to facilitate data collection and analysis.
Experiments will range from the determination of trace amounts of inorganic and
organic substances to the elucidation of reaction mechanisms. In addition, a
student/faculty research project in bioinorganic chemistry will be significantly
enhanced.
