0401753&lt;br/&gt;Wang&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a U.S.-China
cooperative research project between Dr. Zhi-Qiang Wang, Utah State University
and Professor Jia-Quan Liu, Peking University to study quasilinear elliptic
partial differential equations using variational methods. The research problem
is of great interest and importance to mathematics communities and can provide
useful tools to physical scientists, especially those involved in the
micromaterials research. Both the U.S. and the Chinese scientists are experts in
this area, and the results are mutually beneficial. This research project will
be jointly supported by the NSF and the National Natural Science Foundation of
China.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
