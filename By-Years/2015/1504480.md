Typically, learning is thought to occur during studying, whereas retrieval of
information during testing serves to assess what was learned. Importantly and
perhaps surprisingly, modern research is demonstrating that retrieval practice
often produces large gains in long-term retention of knowledge relative to
repeated studying. Thus retrieval practice promotes the acquisition of knowledge
that can be flexibly retrieved and transferred to different contexts. This has
important implications for both the study of memory and its application to
educational practice. In light of the clear need for educational approaches that
can enhance students' success in STEM courses, it is important to apply this new
research to STEM educational practice to examine the robustness of the research
in science and mathematics courses.

The goal of this project is to examine the systematic application of retrieval
practice to enhance achievement in STEM courses. Students will complete a series
of in-class exercises involving retrieval of course information and reflection
on their confidence, familiarity, and out-of-class preparation with the
material. Students' responses on these exercises throughout the semester will
determine whether regular doses of retrieval practice are associated with
increased accuracy, confidence, and out-of-class preparation. Performance on
course assessments will reveal whether particular response patterns on the
exercises predict achievement. The project will provide important new data on
how best to use retrieval practice in STEM courses to maximize students'
achievement and awareness of their own learning (metacognition), and permit the
discovery of heretofore unknown factors (e.g., individual student differences in
preparation) that may moderate these effects. The knowledge gained will provide
educators with the tools they need to maximize student achievement, and to help
equip students with the skills they need to thrive in STEM fields.
