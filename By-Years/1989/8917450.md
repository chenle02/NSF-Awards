The PI has studied viscous behavior at elevated temperature in 1-2 micron
glass-ceramic magnetite. The goal of these experiments has been to identify the
physical mechanism that causes VRM unblocking temperatures to be substantially
higher than what traditional theories predict. She will now extend the previous
studies of high-temperature viscosity, with the following goals: (1) to
determine whether there is a causal link between diffusion after-effect and
anomalously high unblocking temperatures, by combining viscosity studies with
measurements of susceptibility as a function of time at elevated temperatures,
and (2) to characterize viscous behavior and domain structure as functions of
temperature and initial thermal/magnetic state.
