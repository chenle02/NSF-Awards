Through this project, an energy dispersive x-ray (EDX) microanalytical system is
added to the Biology Department's existing scanning electron microscope (SEM)
system. This enables students performing undergraduate research at all levels of
the curriculum in Chemistry and Physics to become much more involved in the
growth and characterization of materials using techniques often developed for
the rapidly emerging field of Material Science. Because of the relative ease of
use of new SEM and SEM/EDX systems, our students can perform spatially resolved
elemental analysis on films and bulk materials they prepare as part of our
extensive laboratory research programs. Students correlate these measurements
with the wide variety of other types of electronic and optical measurement
already being made. High- resolution SEM and SEM/EDX maps are made available to
students photographically as well as remotely over the campus ethernet. This
project promotes interdisciplinary scientific research by undergraduates and
helps augment an expensive instrument (SEM) so that its acquisition and
maintenance costs can be amortized responsibly over a broader base of users.
