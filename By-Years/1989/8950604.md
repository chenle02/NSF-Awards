This project establishes a software engineering laboratory consisting of a
network of Sun workstations along with a selection of computer-assisted software
engineering tools. This laboratory supports a sequence of courses in software
engineering covering such topics as object oriented design, the cleanroom
approach as well as traditional analysis and design methodologies. It is
anticipated that the students will gain a better understanding of the software
milieu, as well as gain experience with the tools that will help them
professionally. This award is being matched by an equal amount from the
principal investigator's institution.
