Understanding force-induced learning and memory&lt;br/&gt;(NSF CMMI
0800870)&lt;br/&gt;PI: Taher Saif, University of Illinois at Urbana-
Champaign&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent in vivo experiments using
Drosophila (fruit fly) embryos in the PI's lab reveal that mechanical force
applied at an individual neuromuscular junction (synapse) produces neuronal
memory. Under normal conditions, axons of neuron cells actively maintain a
resting tension of about 1 nN. Increased tension, applied artificially, causes
increased accumulation of neurotransmitters at the neuro muscular junction.
Reduction of tension causes a decrease in neurotransmitters. This force-mediated
control of neurotransmitter accumulation appears to be essential for memory
formation. It is envisioned that a specific set of molecules serves as a "force
sensor" that senses mechanical force at the synapse to induce the accumulation.
Furthermore, this mechano-sensing ability of neurons is likely rooted in
evolutionarily conserved properties of cells. This project will investigate the
underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms of force sensing and force-induced
neuronal memory in vivo in Drosophila embryos using advanced nano-mechanical
force/stretch sensors, and new molecular FRET (fluorescence resonance energy
transfer) based biosensors. The quest for the force sensor will be based on the
hypothesis: localization of neurotransmitters is mediated by an appropriate
level of intracellular calcium. The latter is induced by force/stretch.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study will shed light, for the first time, on whether
(and if so, how) nature employs mechanical tension to store and process
information in an analogue fashion. It will thus reveal a new mechanism of
memory formation, in contrast to the conventional view that neurotransmission is
entirely a result of electro-chemical signaling process. The study will offer
significant fundamental knowledge in the field neuroscience, and has the
potential of laying the foundation of the new field of neuro-mechanics. The
study will also offer clues for new engineering treatment protocols for various
neuronal disorders such as Alzheimer?s, and Parkinson?s diseases, possibly
involving mechanical stimuli.
