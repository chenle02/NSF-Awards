It is proposed to perform detailed comparisons between theory and experiment for
electron scattering from alkali atoms. The first phase of the research involves
construction of a careful and complete description of the sodium atom, which
will then be used to study electron-sodium scattering as a function of energy,
angle, electron spin, atom alignment and orientation. The second phase will
involve an extension to heavier atoms, particularly cesium, which is of concern
for parity violation experiments. The theoretical approach will utilize the
R-matrix package of scattering programs, adding a semi-empirical polarization
potential to simulate the effect of core electrons on valence and scattered
electrons, not summing magnetic quantum numbers, including relativistic effects.
