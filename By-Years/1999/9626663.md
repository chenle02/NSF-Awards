With support from the Organic Dynamics Program of the Chemistry Division of NSF,
Professor Kenneth R. Fountain of Northeast Missouri State University will study
the alpha effect, i.e. the rate enhancement in nucleophilic substitution
reactions deriving from the presence of a second lone pair of electrons adjacent
to the attacking pair on the nucleophile. The project lies within the NSF
Program for Research in Undergraduate Institutions. The issue to be examined is
the extent to which single electron transfer (SET) models the reactivity in such
reactions. Rates of transfer of alkyl groups from alkyldiarylsulfonium salts to
alpha or non-alpha nucleophiles will be measured. Since the sulfonium salts are
amenable to electrochemical analysis, structure-reactivity studies affording
plots of log(rate) vs. redox potential can be constructed and the effect of SET
capability deduced therefrom. Computations at the 3-21G** level, kinetic isotope
effect studies, and certain studies of symmetric substitutions expected to lead
to radical trapping, will also contribute to the project. Study of nucleophilic
substitutions, reactions well known to undergraduate students of organic
chemistry, will provide understanding of an effect of a certain structural
change of the nucleophile on reactivity. The experimental work will be supported
by computational modeling. The project design encourages students to view their
individual work in the context of a larger and overarching scientific goal.
