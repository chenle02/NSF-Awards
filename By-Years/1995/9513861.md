on Techniques and Concepts of High Energy Physics, the latest in a series of
successful biennial institutes that date back to 1980. The purpose of the
institute is to provide instruction on advanced technology in particle- physics
experiments and related theoretical concepts to a select group of young
physicists at the level of recent PhD's or advanced PhD students. The award
covers their travel and incidental expenses in part. ***
