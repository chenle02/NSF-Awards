This Chemistry Division award provides continued support for a Research
Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in the Chemistry Department,
California State University, Fullerton, directed by Dr. A. M. (Scott) Hewitt.
Ten students will participate in a 10-week summer program over the next three
years. This program deliberately seeks out `late bloomers` and representatives
from groups that are traditionally under-represented in chemistry research. The
students will be exposed to a variety of research topics, trained in the use of
scientific instruments, guided in designing, completing, and interpreting
experiments, and encouraged to develop verbal and written communications skills.
Each participant is assigned to a research focus group where the students
present their own work and hear about other department research activities.
Other features of the program include a tour of local chemical research
facilities. A five-part Science, Ethics, and the Environment seminar series will
expose the students to ethical issues having to do with their research and that
of others. Research results will be reported in a final talk, research poster
session, and a journal-style report.
