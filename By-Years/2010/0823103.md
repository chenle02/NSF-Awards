This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to develop
a flexible, double-sided, dry adhesive "tape" that is applicable to science,
space, industry and home use. The thermally and electrically conductive tape
will be detachable and reusable, and, will not have the disadvantages associated
with other adhesion methods. Surfaces will not require being smoothed, clean,
non-porous, nor ferro-magnetic for adhesion, nor will it require special
fixtures for attachment. This project will permit tape to be directly applied as
the intermediary between any two surfaces that require 1) high thermal heat
transfer from one surface to the other, and/or 2) strong adhesion. The project
will explore manufacturing aspects, as well as preparation for production of
prototype double-sided adhesive tape with superior thermal and adhesive
properties. The coexistent mechanical, thermal and electrical properties, makes
this innovative adhesive tape advantageous to many applications including
semiconductor chip mounting, heat sinking and systems that require a rapid
mount.

The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will mean significant
improvements in thermal performance of many electronic devices and time-savings
in manufacturing by removing the need to bolt down (sub-) assemblies. The true
commercial value of using this innovation, in terms of superior performance,
streamlined designs, ease of manufacture, trouble-free operations and simplified
assembly, could very well run in the millions of dollars in cost savings.
