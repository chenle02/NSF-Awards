This project is improving the retention of undergraduate majors in science,
engineering, and computer science, through a focused approach on developing
student metacognitive ability. The target population includes a large proportion
of deaf and hard-of-hearing (DHH) students and first-generation (FG) college
students, both of whom attend the proposing institution in disproportionate
numbers and underperform relative to the general student population. For
example, DHH and FG students are more likely to fail a course in their first
year (81% vs. 58%) and have lower 4-year retention rates (47% vs. 63%). The
intellectual merit of the project lies in its grounding in the literature of the
learning sciences, which supports the project's plan to focus on developing
students' ability in and practice of metacognition so as to transform their
approach to learning. In so doing this approach complements existing content-
oriented tutoring programs and other interventions, and addresses fundamental
issues that lead students to struggle. The project is exercising broader impact
by serving as a model for other institutions that seek to use such a focus on
improving metacognition to improve student learning. That this particular
project also holds promise to have an impact on a significant number of DHH and
first-generation college students only adds value to the project's impact.
