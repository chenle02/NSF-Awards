A laboratory for the development of computer interfaces is being established to
educate undergraduate computer science majors in the design and experimental
evaluation of human- computer interfaces. The lab supports a new course in
human- computer interface (HCI), covering topics that include HCI modelling,
experimental evaluation of various forms of interfaces, tools for interface
development and management, and rapid prototyping. A variety of computer models
are used in the laboratory, including NeXT, SUN, DEC, APPLE, and IBM. Students
design, develop, and implement prototype interfaces, and then experimentally
evaluate their effectiveness.
