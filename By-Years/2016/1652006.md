This proposal will support travel by robotics researchers to two workshops to
update the National Robotics Roadmap. The Roadmap was first developed in
2008-2009 and helped contribute to the establishment of the National Robotics
Initiative. The Roadmap was subsequently updated in 2012-2013. Much has happened
in the field of robotics in the past four years, and it is prudent to update the
Roadmap, once again. The two-day workshops, to be held at Oregon State
University and Georgia Institute of Technology, will bring together a diverse
group of US robotics researchers to discuss issues related to the societal
drivers and technical challenges ahead for robotics. The outcome will be a
publically available report on the future of robotics, which may serve to help
formulate a national strategy for robotics.
