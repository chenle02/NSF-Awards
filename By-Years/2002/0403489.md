The objective of this research is to develop a basic understanding of aspects of
charge transport in semiconducting single walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs),
methods for purifying and manipulating these tubes, and means for using them in
a new type of mechanically flexible transistor that incorporates massively
parallel arrays of SWNTs (SWNT-arrays) as high mobility semiconductor layers.
This interdisciplinary scientific effort involves the chemistry and materials
science of the tubes and means to functionalize them, chemical engineering of
their separation/patterning, physics of charge transport through them and
electrical engineering aspects of the SWNT-array transistors. The approach
includes the combined use of high resolution spectroscopic methods, scanning
probe microscopies, unusual methods for device fabrication, chemical techniques
for tube functionalization, and computational tools to simulate device response.
&lt;br/&gt; The science that will emerge from this research has the potential to
yield technologies for flexible 'plastic' circuits that offer performance
comparable to or better than advanced single crystal silicon devices. These new
approaches will enable important classes of systems -- wearable computers, high
resolution flexible emissive displays, etc. -- that would be difficult or
impossible to achieve with conventional inorganic electronics. The team includes
DuPont as a research collaborator, and as a potential path to commercializing
these systems. The interdisciplinary science and technology components of the
program, especially when combined with the close collaborations with industry,
provide excellent educational, human resource and outreach opportunities. High
school teachers, undergraduates and graduate students from diverse backgrounds
will all participate in the research, both at the academic and industrial
locations.&lt;br/&gt;
