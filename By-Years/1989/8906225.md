Funds are provided for an instrumentation system for the purpose of
experimentally investigating a variety of soil-structure interaction phenomena,
such as; gravity effects on Rayleigh waves in soil-foundation structures, blast-
induced soil-structure interaction, stress-strain relationship of granular
materials under impact loadings, and dynamic waves in composite materials. The
instrumentation system, applicable to both small-scale laboratory and
centrifugal models studies, consists of a full line of high precision, digital
storage oscilloscopes with a built-in floppy disk which allows permanent record
storage of the responses received from transducers (e.g., accelerometer,
velocity gage, displacement gage (LVDT), strain gage, and pressure meter) and
provides for their recall and display.
