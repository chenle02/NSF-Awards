The dynamics of very large DNA molecules undergoing gel electrophoresis will be
studied using a fluorescence microscope developed under a previous NSF grant.
The objectives of this study are: (l) to characterize DNA motion in steady and
pulsed fields; (2) to determine the molecular processes involved in the trapping
of these large molecules in the gel; (3) to test for the existence of "lakes"
and "super-lakes" in agarose gels; and (4) to improve the computer model of DNA
electrophoresis. Understanding the dynamics of megabase DNA electrophoresis may
lead to improvements in this technique which is vital to gene mapping studies.
The elastic and torsional properties of single DNA molecules will also be
studied by attaching them at one end to paramagnetic beads and at the other end
to a microscope slide. The bead will be subjected to a magnetic field. A
characterization of these basic properties of DNA is necessary for an
understanding of the behaviour of these molecules in their natural milieu.
