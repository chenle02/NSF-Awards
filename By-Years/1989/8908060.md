The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will acquire two liquid scintillation
counters and a modern autoanalyzer. This new instrumentation will replace
existing and outmoded equipment that is no longer serviceable and will be
operated as shared use facilities. These instruments provide rapid and accurate
measurements of radioisotopes and nutrients in seawater samples. Such
measurements are becoming increasing- ly important in modern oceanographic and
marine biological investigations. The equipment will be maintained for use by
all investigators and it will especially benefit NSF- sponsored research
projects by increasing the capabilities of the institution to support research
and educational activities.
