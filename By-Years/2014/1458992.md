Game theory, which models decision-making by strategically interacting agents,
is a basic modeling tool in economics and other social sciences. Predictions
typically take the form of equilibria, which are collections of mutually optimal
choices. A question that has garnered much recent attention is how agents in a
repeated interaction might learn to play in accordance with equilibrium
predictions. This project is a first foray into a complementary question: how
play of an equilibrium may break down, to be followed by the emergence of a
different equilibrium. For instance, in macroeconomic contexts, the overall
state of the economy moves between booms and busts; the techniques developed in
this project offer tools for understanding such transitions.

Specifically, this project studies equilibrium breakdown and equilibrium
selection in games played by populations of myopic agents. In our stochastic
evolutionary model, agents update their strategies over time by applying noisy
best response rules, under which the probability of a suboptimal choice depends
on its payoff consequences. The population's aggregate behavior is described by
a Markov chain on a discrete grid in the simplex. Developing methods from the
theory of large deviations, we study the behavior of this process as two
parameters approach their limiting values: as the noise level in agents' choice
rules goes to zero, and as the size of the population goes to infinity. By
taking either one of these limits, it is possible to obtain characterizations of
equilibrium breakdown and selection, but these characterizations do not allow
one to solve specific examples beyond the simplest cases. But we argue that
taking both limits, in either order, leads to characterizations that are
tractable. We conjecture that the predictions from the two orders of limits are
identical, implying that the nature of equilibrium breakdown and selection does
not depend on whether rarity of mistakes or the averaging effects of large
numbers drives long run play.
