This project aims to understand the cognitive models, assumptions, and inference
methods the comprise the layperson's system of "intuitive toxicology" and to
compare this system with the cognitive models, assumptions, and inference
methods of toxicologists and risk assessors. Such comparisons would expose the
similarities and differences within the expert and lay communities as well as
the differences between lay perceptions and expert views. Several empirical
studies will be designed, conducted, and reported during the course of this
project. These studies should produce clearer, better articulated representation
of the conceptual frameworks that exist for experts and laypeople with regard to
chemical hazards and the scientific methods used to assess chemical risks. Such
representations are crucial for improved methods of risk assessment and for the
development of a risk-management process that replaces polarized social conflict
with effective multi-way communication about chemical risks and benefits.
