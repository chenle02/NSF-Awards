Obfuscation schemes are highly desirable tools for transforming programs into
unintelligible ones while preserving functionality. However, so far, there lack
obfuscation schemes with well-founded security guarantees. The main objective of
this project is addressing this gap, by developing new approaches for designing
obfuscation schemes based on standard, well-studied, assumptions. Another
objective is using obfuscation as a versatile tool to enable a wide range of
cryptographic and security applications. This research will advance the state of
design and application of obfuscation schemes, and more generally cryptographic
feasibility, which contribute to building a more secure and private cyberspace.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research focuses on a form of obfuscation, called
Indistinguishability Obfuscation (IO). Specific research problems include
finding simpler cryptographic objects, algebraic structures, generalization of
standard objects, and assumptions that imply IO. The project also investigates
what can be built from standard assumptions, and develops new techniques that
overcome existing technical barriers in applying IO, as well as general
techniques for removing the use of IO to obtain simpler and more efficient
solutions for specific applications. This project actively engages in
disseminating knowledge of obfuscation, teaching cryptography to undergraduate
and graduate students, and supporting women in STEM. These activities will
contribute to building a skilled and diverse workforce and enriching the
scientific community.
