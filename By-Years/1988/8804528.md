This is a proposal to establish an NSF-REU Site in Computer Science at Caltech
during 1988. This program would focus upon advanced topics in computation. This
program would involve four (4) undergraduates from other universities and four
(4) Caltech students. The program would be administered like that which took
place in 1987 at Caltech.
