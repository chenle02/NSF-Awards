Shocks accelerate particles to relativistic speeds throughout the universe â€“ in
astrophysical processes and more locally in the region of space near the Earth.
It is a mystery how shocks can accelerate particles to energies higher than
their own shock potential energy reserve. This project will investigate
irregularities in plasma flows ahead of shocks moving into the magnetosphere,
studying plasma bubbles and hot flow anomalies. The results of this project have
direct applications in space weather models; it thus addresses one of the goals
set out in the National Space Weather Action Plan. The project will also help
understand shock acceleration throughout the universe. Three early career
researchers and a graduate student will receive
support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key objectives are (i) to determine the role
of upstream electron energization on space weather phenomena that result from
inward penetration of energetic particles; and (ii) to provide new insights in
the classic pre-acceleration need for Fermi type shock acceleration processes.
For the first time high quality and resolution THEMIS and MMS data from the
foreshock region are available. THEMIS provides data on large scale magnetic
structures along with high-frequency magnetic fluctuations and superthermal
particles ( &gt;25 keV), while MMS is capable of resolving small scale (10-100
km) high time resolution (30 -150 ms) providing microscale and electron dynamics
quantities. The observations will be supplemented by Cluster and DMSP which
monitor the energetic particle flux in the cusp and from all sky imagers and
NSF-funded SuperDARN data providing signatures of accelerating particles.
Combining these observations is a challenging task. The proposal utilizes a
well-tested 3D global hybrid simulation code to organize the data and achieve
the desired results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
