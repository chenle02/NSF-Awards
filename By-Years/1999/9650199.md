This proposed project seeks to integrate Computer-Integrated Manufacturing (CIM)
technology into curriculum that is introductory in nature for the Manufacturing
Technology student. Objectives are: 1. Upgrade the existing Production
Laboratory to reflect the current state of automation processes in
manufacturing. 2. Integrate manufacturing automation processes into the
Technology Education (pre-service teachers), General Industry &amp; Technology
and Manufacturing Technology concentrations where CIM is part of the elective
curricula rather than a requirement. 3. Improve the quality of undergraduate
student research in manufacturing automation, materials testing, CAD/CAM,
technology education and industrial technology through full-size machine tool
technology. By purchasing an electronic engine lathe, retrofitting an existing
vertical mill and purchasing a new CNC controller for an existing NC lathe, the
Production Lab will have the capability to introduce fundamental CIM technology
to students in Manufacturing Technology concentrations, Technology Education,
and General Industry &amp; Technology in entry level courses. The proposed
project will upgrade existing laboratory facilities to include CIM technology
with full-sized machine tools. Currently, students have access to CIM technology
through table-top machines in elective courses. The project will facilitate the
introduction of CIM concepts earlier in the curriculum, improve laboratory
experience for pre-service technology teachers, be available for student
research projects requiring full-size equipment and open an avenue for
independent study requiring CNC lathe and mill projects.
