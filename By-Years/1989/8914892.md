Herbarium collections are the single most important source of information about
the Earth's plant life, yet access to this information is often extremely
difficult. Computerization of individual collections, and networking among
computerized catalogs can provide enormous improvements in the quality and
quantity of research involving plants. Dr. Robert Haynes of the University of
Alabama proposes creation of a Southeastern Floral Information System (SERFIS),
a prototype network among several herbaria in the southeast U.S. New
technologies for capturing and processing data will be tested, and emerging data
standards will be implemented in several herbarium databases in the region. Dr.
Haynes will also explore various approaches to linking local databases into a
wide-area network, accessible by outside investigators wishing to search the
contents of several databases simultaneously. The proposed project will greatly
accelerate the application of new computer technologies to botanical collections
and biodiversity research. SERFIS will be a model for future development in the
area of collection management and inter- institutional cooperation.
