The Institute for Advanced Study will provide a program of visiting memberships
in theoretical astrophysics. The members will be chosen on the basis of their
ability to do creative research. The Institute provides a stimulating
intellectual environment and convenient computing facilities as well as guidance
and support from senior scientists. The visiting members will work in areas of
current interest in theoretical astrophysics. There is additional support for
the visiting members in the fields of particle physics, mathematical physics,
and statistical mechanics.
