This project provides partial support for the Fifteenth Annual
Telecommunications Policy Research Conference, held September 27-30, 1987 in
Airlie, Virginia. The Conference brings together researchers of varied
disciplines from the academy, research institutes, industry and public-interest
organizations with government policy-makers in a setting conducive to open and
fruitful exchange of information and ideas. The Conference is designed to
facilitate the rational development of coherent telecommunications policy by
presenting the results of the best available current research on a wide range of
key telecommunications policy issues, by clarifying the policy research agenda,
and by stimulating future policy-relevant research. Conference proceedings will
be edited and published. The topics addressed at the Conference reflect the
broad range of key policy issues that confront the nation in its transition to a
services-based information economy. The dissemination of significant current
research relevant to these issues is highly valuable to both the policy making
and research communities.
