The PI will address the following research during FAW tenure: reconstruction of
the paleoclimate of the Pangaean supercontinent and documentation of events and
patterns of Pangaean monsoonal system. A detailed climatic interpretation of
North Polar vegetational and thermal change and its relation to lower northern
latitudes and southern high latitude vegetation. This work will help interpret
paleoclimate from preangiosperm vegetational physiognomy and understand the
history of latitudinal climate asymmetry. A literature depended reclassification
of petroleum source rocks for ancient and modern organic - rich sedimentary
systems.
