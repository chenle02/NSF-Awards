This grant will support the refurbishment of an internally heated high-pressure
vessel (IHPV) acquired by the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) from
NASA. Experiments under deep earth conditions are the primary means of
investigating chemical evolution of magmas under controlled conditions. The
installation of this apparatus will provide much greater access for students
participating in AMNH-sponsored high school, undergraduate, graduate,
postdoctoral, and teacher training programs. The additional IHPV access will
also support AMNH and other, non-museum colleagues to enhance U.S.
competitiveness in research in magmatic processes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
IHPV will be used to investigate melt-mineral-fluid phase equilibria and
component partitioning behaviors in geologic systems under controlled
conditions. The primary research objective is to obtain critical, missing
knowledge to better address the compositional range of magmas that threaten
society with eruptions or are part of hydrothermal mineralizing processes that
produce metallic resources.
