ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;17 July 2009&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:
0910894&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Minnesota Duluth&lt;br/&gt;PI: R.
Ricketts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal requests five Shipboard Scientific
Support items for the University of Minnesota Duluth; namely an expanded fixed
fire suppression system, ship?s service generator overhaul, HVAC up-grades in
the dry lab, new RADAR?s, and new life rafts. All items will either enhance
safety or provide greatly improved science support
capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The University of Minnesota
supports federally funded scientific research on the Great Lakes and routinely
exposes graduate and undergraduate students to the marine sciences. The R/V BLUE
HERON is scheduled to complete over 50 NSF sponsored days in 2009.
