This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes to develop a
new, low-cost methods for direct fabrication of metal parts at near-net shapes
(NNS). This technology is critical for many industries and in particular, for
manufacturing parts of expensive metals and alloys such as titanium. Such
technologies have an impact on many industries because of the potential to
quickly manufacture complicated parts with minimal waste. Currently used methods
typically involve melting and solidification, which can cause high residual
stresses, undesirable phases, and other problems. To solve the problems
described a new method for spray forming is being used. This method is based on
using the cold spray process avoiding undesired material, chemistry, and phase
properties associated with thermal spray-forming methods. Studies conducted
during Phase I demonstrated the feasibility of the cold spray process for rapid
prototyping and direct fabrication of spray form shapes of Titanium alloys. The
anticipated result of this activity is to deliver a technology yielding superior
material properties of sprayed material and reduce cost of manufacturing.

The broader impacts of cold spraying near net-shapes technology could be very
important technology for aerospace, including aircraft, military aircraft and
spacecraft. This technology is promising for many other industries including
automotive, medical, power, chemical, sport goods, and others. The proposed
research activity will enhance scientific and technological understanding of the
spray processes based on using high-speed particle flow.
