This action funds a Phase II research project under the National Science
Foundation's Small Business Initiation Research Program. In Phase I, Dr. Ebert
and his associates examined instrument assisted methods which increase the
efficiency of recording the locations and characteristics of archaeological
artifacts and features. This work employed the use of electronic distance
measurement equipment and portable in-field computers. Associated software was
also refined. The team concluded that such an approach held considerable
promise. In Phase II this work will be continued and in addition be directed
toward devising a total distributional archaeological system consisting of
hardware, software and methods for their use in the field and laboratory. These
methods will facilitate the acccurate, efficient and theoretically-supported
collection of distributional data and its management, representation, mapping,
analysis and interpretation. Potentially, it will be widely used by
archaeologists in a great variety of field situations.
