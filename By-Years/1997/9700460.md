Fuel efficiency and vehicle crashworthiness are two important issues for modern
automotive manufacturing. Current industry standards require aluminum structural
components to absorb sufficient crash energy while limiting material
microcracking to subcritical fractures. Thus, a successful design for crash-
resistant aluminum components must consider microstructural material properties,
detailed material failure mechanisms as well as the product and process
parameters that determine them. This research projects is a joint research
effort between the University and an industrial partner to develop improved
manufacturing processes for the production of extruded aluminum components with
superior properties for automotive crashworthiness. This collaborative research
project has a balance between theory and experiment, and will provide valuable
findings for the automotive manufacturing and aluminum manufacturing industries.
