Based on the assumption that electric vehicles can decrease fossil fuel
dependency and ameliorate urban air quality issues, elected officials at the
federal, state, and municipal levels have enacted a variety of policies designed
to increase the adoption of this potentially radical technology. This project
examines the degree to which these policies, individually or in tandem, affect
consumers' willingness to purchase electric vehicles, and the degree to which
these policies are driving technological adoption. Alternatively, public
policies may be a response to existing demand for electric vehicles and are,
therefore, a lagging rather than leading adoption of this technology.
&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This research increases understanding of the ways public
policy can influence, either assist or restrain, the spread of new technologies.
The research provides a conceptual and empirical basis for future study of the
adoption of radical sustainable technologies. The project surveys the electric
vehicle policy landscape in large municipalities across the United States and
the ways government officials, representatives of industry, and citizens are
communicating about and implementing electric vehicle policies. The project also
surveys individual consumers in large U.S. cities in order to assess the effect
that government and industry activities have on consumer interest and purchases
of electric vehicles.
