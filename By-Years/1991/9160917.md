The research proposed is a program to administer and manage a program in modern
biotechnology with the commercial result of demonstration modules for use in
high school classes. The effort includes summer workshops for high school
teachers, university faculty and industry experts. In later sessions, students
will utilize demonstration modules tested and refined in classroom settings.
