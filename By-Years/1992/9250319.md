The project focuses on the use of microcomputers and related equipment in the
expansion of a three-phase curricular program in sociology, that addresses the
special needs of non- traditional undergraduate students many of whom are women.
Phase I is designed for the large introductory course, and employs
Microcase/Showcase Presentational software to demonstrate actual research in a
lecture format thus enabling us to link the introductory lectures to future
hands-on laboratory experience. In Phase II, we will address problems of math
and computer phobia with group projects using simplified software for
quantitative analysis. By Phase III, students will have had repeated experiences
in posing sociological questions and bringing data to bear on them. In this
phase, students will integrate the diverse elements of their course work into a
coherent and mature conception of sociology through their senior projects.
