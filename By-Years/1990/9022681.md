A new Materials research Group is established to investigate fundamental
aspects of physical adsorption and phase transitions in physisorbed films. The
goals of the research are to study both the structure and kinetics of
physisorbed films, and the nature of these phases and the transitions between
them. The research is organized into five topics: (1) melting of monolayer argon
films on graphite, (2) phase transitions of films of binary adsorbates, (3)
properties of simple gases in a well- characterized zeolite porous medium, (4)
unusual properties of monolayer and multilayer helium films on weak-binding
substrates, (5) desorption and helium atom scattering of films. Experimental
efforts include measurement of heat capacity, in-situ vapor pressure isotherm
study, inelastic helium scattering, high- resolution low-energy electron
diffraction, inelastic helium scattering, neutron scattering, time-of-flight
desorption measurements, and wetting and superfluid studies. Molecular dynamics
computer simulation is being used to provide realistic modelling of adsorbate
behavior and phase transitions of thin films and confined fluids. Interaction
potentials, atom-surface scattering, and classical and quantum transitions of
adsorbate systems are being studied in the theoretical thrusts of the program
using potential energy models and statistical mechanics approaches. The strong
coupling of experiment, computational simulation and theory are making advances
not possible by isolated approaches.
