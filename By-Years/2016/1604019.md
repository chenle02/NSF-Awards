The co-production of valuable chemicals and materials can improve the economic
viability of bio-refinery processes that convert renewable biomass resources
into biofuels. To serve as a forum for emerging bio-refinery concepts, the
fourth scientific conference in the Frontiers in Biorefining series, titled
Chemicals and Materials from Renewable Carbon, will be held during November
2016, at St. Simons Island, Georgia. This conference will assemble scientists
and engineers from around the world to share recent progress, explore
information needs, and present ideas that advance integrated bio-refinery
concepts. A total of 90 participants from academia, government, and industry are
expected. This award will support the travel of five graduate student
researchers to present their original research at the conference, and to network
with influential scientific and industrial researchers in the field of
biorefining.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As research programs continue to build the
body of fundamental science that create new bio-refinery concepts, a scientific
conference to facilitate networking, exchange ideas, and further collaboration
between scientists and research institutions is timely. The opening plenary
session will highlight key developments in emerging bio-refinery concepts by
invited scientists. The subsequent technical program emphasizes pathways for
conversion of biomass to useful and valuable chemicals and materials in six
parallel sessions and a student poster reception. Specific sessions are:
Engineered feedstocks for the bio-refinery; Cell wall deconstruction and biomass
fractionation; Catalytic conversion of lignin; Catalytic conversion of
carbohydrates; Biochemical conversion of carbohydrates and lignin; Catalytic
thermochemical conversion of whole biomass; The interface of biomass and
petrochemicals. An open-access, peer-reviewed paper will summarize the
activities at the conference in an effort to guide future research, funding
opportunities, and policymaking in the fields of biorefining and bioenergy.
