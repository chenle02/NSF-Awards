This project establishes an office for the expressed purpose of coordinating the
scientific efforts of international and U.S. scientists, so that a comprehensive
Sun- Earth interaction program is established. The effort recognizes that multi-
national, multi-technique studies are essential for achieving a new
understanding of short-term (Space Weather) and long term (Space Climate)
variability throughout the solar-terrestrial domain. Specific themes for
organized data collection and analysis include the solar influence on climate,
Space Weather physics and operational applications, atmospheric coupling
processes, and space climatology. Specific tasks within these themes are the
planning and execution of data taking campaigns on a global scale, assimilation
of data bases on a global scale and from a wide variety of instrumentation, and
the coordination of end-to-end ("sun-surface") modeling capabilities using the
assimilated data. Beyond the broader impacts of international cooperation
manifested by idea, technology, and human capital exchange, the research focuses
information useful for tracking global climate change and ozone distribution.
