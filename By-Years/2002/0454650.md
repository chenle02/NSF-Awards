Commercial use of genetically modified conifers is now underway with
&lt;br/&gt;field trials concentrated in the southern United States. Opposition
has &lt;br/&gt;ranged from requests for a planting moratorium to threats of
&lt;br/&gt;ecoterrorism. This tension will only grow as genomics continues to
&lt;br/&gt;provide gene discovery available for genetic modification. Similarly,
&lt;br/&gt;policy has not progressed as fast as technology. By default,
&lt;br/&gt;agricultural policies cover forest management in the US yet few
decision &lt;br/&gt;makers are clear about the many ways in which genetically
modified &lt;br/&gt;forests deviate from GM food crops. Balanced, open dialogue
is needed to &lt;br/&gt;find common-interest solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
2004 Nicholas School Forum at Duke University will open dialogue
&lt;br/&gt;about genetic composition of US forests. Attendees will identify
&lt;br/&gt;emerging issues for forest genomics portfolios, ecosystem interface,
&lt;br/&gt;landowners, regulations and community perspective. The forum has
&lt;br/&gt;attracted inclusive participation by science writers, employees of
&lt;br/&gt;biotechnology firms and timber corporations, non-government
activists, &lt;br/&gt;students, university faculty, state and federal government
officials and &lt;br/&gt;foresters. Eminent international speakers will broaden
perspective on &lt;br/&gt;this regional and national issue. Forum organizer
Claire Williams and &lt;br/&gt;her colleagues will complete an edited volume
entitled 'Landscapes, &lt;br/&gt;Genomics and Transgenic Conifer Forests' to be
published by &lt;br/&gt;Kluwer-Springer by summer 2005. Our participatory forum
on genetically &lt;br/&gt;modified conifers is designed to catalyze similar
venues in the US and &lt;br/&gt;other countries.&lt;br/&gt;
