This research studies a number of algorithmic issues related to the design of
VLSI chips and wafers. The foremost interest is the problem of the efficient
design of fault-tolerant arrays of processors. Next in priority is the problem
of how to render feasible the exhaustive test approach to VLSI self-test. A
third continuing area of concern is multilayer circuit realizations, where the
attention is shifting from abstract layout-theoretic issues to CAD-algorithmic
ones. A new area of interest includes algorithmic (in contrast to systems-
oriented) aspects of the "silicon compilation" problem. All of these topics
encompass problems ranging from abstract mathematical questions to concrete
engineering issues. The intent is to tackle the problems at several points along
this abstract-to-concrete spectrum.
