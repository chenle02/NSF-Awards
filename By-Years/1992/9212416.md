This award supports the research of Professor Kadell to work in combinatorics.
Specifically, he will continue his investigations into the properties of the
Selberg-Jack symmetric functions. This research is part of more general
investigations of the theory of orthogonal polynomials. Moreover, Professor
Kadell is bringing to bear standard algebraic machinery into the study of these
combinatorial ideas, thereby placing these combinatorial results into the
general context of algebra. The research in the general area of combinatorics.
Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study how discrete
collections can be organized. The behavior of discrete systems is extremely
important to modern communications. For example, the design of large networks,
as in telephone systems, and the design of algorithms in computer science all
deal with discrete objects, and this make use of combinatorial research.
