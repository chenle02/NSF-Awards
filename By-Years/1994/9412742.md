9412742 Kamari The Rapid Response Manufacturing (RRM) program is an effort for
the development of a knowledge-intensive environment in which engineers can
design and manufacture parts faster and cheaper, with acceptable levels of
quality, and deliver the manufactured products to customers in response to their
demands. The main objective of this research is the development of a Group
Technology Knowledge- Based Coding and Classification system and its
complementary database to support the activities within the RRM environment for
a specific product, an automobile crankshaft. The technical concepts associated
with the development of this environment include feature-based products
modeling, knowledge- based environments, and database systems.
