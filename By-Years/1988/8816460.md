This project will support the Conference on Geometric Convexity, Integral, and
Stochastic Geometry to be held June 1-4, 1989 at Oregon State University. The
conference will be organized by Professor William J. Firey. The major topics of
the conference will be (1) stability questions in geometric convexity, (2) the
development of statistical methods for spatial problems which have arisen from
interactions among the areas of integral geometry, geometric probability, and
statistics, and (3) integral geometry in the sense of Radon problems.
