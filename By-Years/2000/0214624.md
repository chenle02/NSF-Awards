This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project proposes to
create state-of-the-art proximity correction software, which will ultimately be
merged with the Nanometer Pattern Generation System, which is an advanced SEM
lithography system that is already commercially successful. In recent years, SEM
lithography has become an increasingly popular tool in university and government
research labs, as well as at industrial R&D labs. The interest in SEM
lithography comes from both its low cost and versatile nature when compared to
the dedicated e-beam writing systems that are designed primarily for writing
full wafers in industrial settings. The purpose of this project is to create an
advanced proximity correction system that matches the inherent versatility of a
well-designed SEM lithography system such as NPGS. To achieve this goal, this
project will investigate the development of two advanced proximity correction
techniques that are currently not commercially available. Specifically, the
techniques are "grayscale" proximity corrections for manufacturing multi-level
(grayscale) structures and binary proximity corrections for non-rectangular
pattern elements.

Potential commercial applications, if successful, will give researchers
worldwide a much more advanced e-beam lithography capability than is presently
available.
