This request would support college students (graduate and undergraduate) to
attend an international conference on "Computer Support for Collaborative
Learning" (CSCL) of about 700 researchers and practitioners in Boulder Colorado
in January 2002. The theme for the conference is: foundations of the research
field in theory, technology, methodology, and community building.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The requested funds will support activities at conference
such as creating a "community memory" which involves digital video, the Web, and
DVD media to capture and disseminate ideas from the conference. It will also
support activities that involve teachers directly in the conference process in
order to provide the other participants with the perspective of practitioners.
Also, it will support a doctoral consortium to introduce graduate students to
the research community as they explain their dissertation work. &lt;br/&gt;
