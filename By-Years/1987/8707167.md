This is a ROW Research Planning Grant in order to plan a research project for
characterizing (1) the micro-mechanisms of fracture, (2) the material
parameters, (3) the test parameters, and how they affect fracture in the
ductile-to-brittle transition region. Activities include a literature search,
formulation of a preliminary plan, consultation with known experts, and the
revision to the final research plan.
