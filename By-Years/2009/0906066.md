This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY 2009. The
fellowship supports a research and training plan entitled "Landscape study of
the effects of climate change on Sierra Nevada mammals" for Toni Morelli. The
host institution for this research is the University of California-Berkeley, and
the sponsoring scientists are Steven Beissinger and Craig Moritz.

Understanding the effects of climate change on natural populations is quickly
becoming a hallmark of 21st century conservation efforts. This research
integrates microclimate and genetic data with ecological modeling and spatial
analysis in order to make better predictions of the effects of climate change on
Sierra Nevada mammal populations. Specifically this research is examining
patterns of genetic variation and gene flow in relation to habitat
heterogeneity, both geographical and climatic. This study utilizes and optimizes
newly developed landscape genetics tools, spatial analysis software, and the
latest climate models.

Training goals include remote sensing, spatial analysis and genomic sequencing
techniques. The research results are being disseminated to the public and to
governmental and non-governmental agencies in order to help conserve
California's wildlife in the face of climate change.
