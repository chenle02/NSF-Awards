Research supported by this grant is under the auspices of the Arctic Systems
Science (ARCSS) Global Change Research Program and is jointly sponsored by the
Division of Ocean Sciences and the Office of Polar Programs. Work to be
performed represents preliminary steps towards a major 5-year research project
named SHEBA, which is envisioned to study the heat budget of the Arctic Ocean
and its impact on global change. The primary goals of SHEBA are: (1) to develop,
test and implement models of arctic ocean-atmosphere-ice processes that
demonstrably improve simulations of the present day arctic climate, including
its variability, using General Circulation Models (GCMs), and (2) to improve the
interpretation of satellite remote sensing data in the Arctic for analysis of
the arctic climate system and provide reliable data for model input, model
validation and climate monitoring. This joint project by researchers at the
University of Colorado and University of Alaska will increase the understanding
of the feedback mechanisms in Arctic climate. The integration of meteorological
data derived from satellites with regional atmospheric models will allow better
prediction of Arctic climate variables at the proposed site for the Phase 2
field experiment in 1997. This research will necessary for planning the
experiment phase of the study.
