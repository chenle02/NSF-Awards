Ice storms pose significant risks to infrastructure, transportation, forests,
and the economy, with annual losses in the billions of dollars. The basic
weather patterns that result in ice storms are well-understood, however there
are questions about how well ice storms are represented in climate models and
how ice storm risk may change in a future climate. This award is for a small
workshop to be held at Purdue University that will bring together meteorological
experts with risk experts from a number of industries to define the high
priority research questions that the atmospheric science field should be
addressing in the upcoming years. The workshop has direct societal relevance due
to the long-term goal of improving forecasting and reducing ice storm
risks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is for a two-day Ice Storm Risk Workshop
to explore scientific questions and risk mitigation for freezing rain events.
The meeting will take place on campus at Purdue University on October 11-12,
2021. The central objective of the workshop is to generate an interdisciplinary
road map of critical research gaps in ice storm science and risk, with specific
focus to: 1) define solutions for reducing ice storm risks under climate change;
and 2) identify the underlying scientific knowledge gaps that must be filled to
realize those solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
