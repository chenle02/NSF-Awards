This engineering research equipment grant is to acquire three separate pieces
of equipment, each of which is important to the continued research progress of
the Cornell Injection Molding Program - an interdisciplinary research group in
the Engineering School at Cornell University which has received continuous NSF
funding since 1974. The acquisitions include (1) computer hardware for upgrading
a heavily used computer facility in various areas related to the injection
molding of thermoplastics as well as thermosets, ceramic-filled polymers and
semi-solid metal alloys; (2) a high-temperature/high-pressure capillary
rheometer which will be used for establishing more accurate and reliable
material-property data such as melt viscosity in support of computer-simulation
and process-control work; and (3) a tensile tester for plastic specimens which
will be used for experimental verification of research aimed at development of
predictive models for the load-deformation behavior of short- fiber-reinforced
injection-molded parts.
