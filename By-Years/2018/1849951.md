This award provides support for participation in the conference "Between
Topology and Quantum Field Theory" in Austin, TX, on January 14-18, 2019. The
conference is intended to be a gathering of 100-150 researchers, including
graduate students, postdocs, and faculty, in mathematics and theoretical
physics. It will be an opportunity for broader communities of researchers to
learn about dramatic developments from the last few years as well as about the
areas of the conference more broadly. To maximize its impact the conference will
be broadly advertised, and funds will be provided to support travel expenses of
participants who otherwise could not attend. Researchers from groups
underrepresented in mathematics and theoretical physics will be prioritized in
allocating these funds. To further increase the reach of the conference, audio
and video from the talks will be recorded and made freely available
online.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will catalyze new interactions
between researchers in fields bridging mathematics and physics. The specific
focus will be on three overlapping areas: topological phenomena in quantum field
theory, mathematical formulations of quantum field theory, and differential
geometry of supersymmetry. The conference plan builds on significant recent
momentum in these three areas, and includes a list of 18 confirmed speakers,
including both current international leaders in these areas and up-and-coming
future leaders. The conference web page is available at

statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
