9601783 Frost This grant, made through the Academic Research Infrastructure
(ARI) Program, provides $250,000 as one-half support of the costs of acquiring a
thermal ionization mass spectrometer (TIMS) with ion counting capabilities for
use in isotopic studies of igneous petrogenesis, thermochronology and
geochronology for tectonic studies, and environmental isotope geochemistry at
the University of Wyoming. The instrument will replace a somewhat antiquated VG
TIMS purchased in 1984 but more recently upgraded in 1989. However, since the
upgrade, the instrument has been plagued with technical problems that have only
more recently (1993) been rectified and data produced. The 50% match from the
University of Wyoming is part of a one-time, $18M state supported Geology
building expansion/improvement. Specific studies that will utilize the
capabilities of this new TIMS will include research on the petrogenesis of the
Laramie Anorthosite Complex and Aleutian and Caribbean arc magmas through
examination of Pb, Sr and Nd isotopic signatures, the tectonic evolution of the
Western U.S. based on thermochronologic and geochronologic techniques and Sr and
Nd isotopic studies of groundwater hydrology and weathering processes. ***
