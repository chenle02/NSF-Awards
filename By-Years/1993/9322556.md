This award supports research on free resolutions in commutative algebra. The
principal investigator will study a conjecture of Vasconcelos, the Poincare
series and asymptotic behavior of betti numbers of modules over rings with small
linking number, higher order multiplication in Tor-algebras, and the cokernel of
generic exterior multiplication. This research is concerned with a number of
questions in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. Algebraic geometry
studies solutions of families of polynomial equations. One can either study the
geometry of the solution set or approach problems algebraically by investigating
certain functions on the solution set that form what is called a commutative
ring. This dual perspective creates a close connection between commutative
algebra and algebraic geometry.
