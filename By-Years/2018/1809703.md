This award will support student and postdoctoral attendance at a workshop on
computational complexity theory, organized by the Clay Mathematics Institute,
and by the Computer Science Department at the University of Oxford. Many leading
figures in computational complexity have already made a commitment to attend the
workshop, which will be held July 23-26 at the University of Oxford. For these
student attendees, the meeting serves as a valuable educational experience, both
for the technical content of the talks and for the opportunities for networking
that it provides. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award will provide partial support
to approximately seven students, partly defraying the cost of travel and
lodging. Efforts will be made to support students from under-represented
groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
