Professor Eric Munson of the University of Kansas and co-PI John Heinrich of
Revolution NMR, LLC, are supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
Program in the Division of Chemistry (with co-funding from the GOALI program in
the Engineering Directorate) to develop new techniques for solid-state Nuclear
Magnetic Resonance (SSNMR) spectroscopy, and to apply those techniques to
substances of pharmaceutical interest. They are collaborating with researchers
from GlaxoSmithKline, who can provide insight into significant problems in the
pharmaceutical industry and can help provide interesting compounds for study.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research aims for significant increases in
sensitivity and throughput that will broaden the application of SSNMR in almost
all fields of chemistry. Industrial collaborations will add value by promoting
the rapid dissemination and application of technologies and information. They
will also promote the rapid development of safe and efficacious drugs and drug
formulations by increasing the number of drugs which can be analyzed, as well as
identifying potential problems with proposed drug formulations. Finally, the
interdisciplinary collaborative nature of the work will enhance the education of
graduate students and postdoctoral associates performing and presenting this
research.&lt;br/&gt;
