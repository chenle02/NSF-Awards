The objective valuation of the world's ecological systems and services and its
natural capital stocks is an issue of global importance. The proposed activity
applies a functional modeling approach to collected information archives. The
resulting analysis tools should prove useful to a broad sector of the science
and policy making community. The proposed activities would lead to a web-based,
publicly accessible resource for primary data storage and subsequent modeling
for use in policy development as well as scientific research.
