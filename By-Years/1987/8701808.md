This project continues work on problems centering on functions of several
complex variables. The research uses geometric measure theory in complex
analysis to characterize holomorphic chains in terms of locally rectifiable
currents. Work will also be done on Hartogs-type theorems concerned with almost-
everywhere separately meromorphic functions. Investigations will be carried out
on value distribution theory of functions of several complex variables. The
second main theorem and defect relations for non-equidimensional meromorphic
mappings into complex projective manifolds will also be treated. Work on
cohomology vanishing results for holomorphic line bundles satisfying weak
numerical positivity conditions on complex projective manifolds will be carried
out. Efforts will be made to construct semi-positive metrics on these line
bundles. This research will provide valuable tools for studies in mappings
between hypersurfaces.
