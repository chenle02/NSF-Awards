EAR-0309992&lt;br/&gt;White&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project
is to estimate the incompatible element composition of material subducted into
the deep mantle. The composition of material subducted into the deep mantle (the
"deep mantle subduction flux") differs from the composition of material
subducted at the plate boundary (the "trench subduction flux") because some
fraction of this material finds its way into subduction zone magmas ("the arc
flux"). Since the deep mantle subduction flux is equal to the trench subduction
flux less the arc flux, the deep mantle subduction flux can be determined if the
trench subduction flux and arc fluxes are known. There is now a sufficiently
advanced understanding of subduction zone processes and sufficient literature
data for this to be done. &lt;br/&gt;This study will determine the trench
subduction, arc, and deep mantle subduction fluxes for 8 arcs. New analytical
work will be carried out to estimate the incompatible and isotopic composition
of sediment being subducted adjacent the Andean southern volcanic zone; the
study will otherwise make use of previously published data available in on-line
databases. &lt;br/&gt;Estimates of the deep mantle subduction flux should allow
more quantitative tests of broad ideas about the evolution of the Earth,
including (1) the proposition that recycled oceanic crust and sediment is
present in deep mantle plumes, (2) that subduction zone magmatism is the
principal mechanism of the continental crust creation, and (3) that sediment
subduction is an important control on the composition and volume of the
continental crust. &lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts include graduate training (the
study will constitute a doctoral dissertation) and participation of a member of
an underrepresented group in research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
