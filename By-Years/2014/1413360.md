Many living organisms sense and respond to light, primarily through a large
family of proteins known as photoreceptors. This Research in Undergraduate
Institutions proposal will provide insights into fundamental, light-induced
mechanisms in biological systems by addressing the role of photoreceptors in
unique microorganisms, the myxobacteria, which are distinguished by unusual
light-controlled morphogenesis of fruiting bodies. This project will advance the
understanding of microbial light perception and the evolution of photoreceptors,
engaging undergraduate and Master's level students (including members of groups
under-represented in science) in interdisciplinary research in microbial
genetics, spectroscopy and structural biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
addresses the physiological role of red-light photoreceptors known as
bacteriophytochromes in the non-photosynthetic myxobacteria Stigmatella
aurantiaca and Cystobacter fuscus which form fruiting bodies under starvation
conditions. Fruiting bodies are markedly stimulated by red and blue light but
the exact role of the bacteriophytochromes that are encoded in the genomes of
these species in controlling morphogenesis is unknown. This project will
investigate the role of bacteriophytochromes through integrated studies of
myxobacterial genetics, high-throughput RNA sequence analysis, time-resolved
spectroscopy, and elucidation of bacteriophytochrome structures by X-ray
crystallography.
