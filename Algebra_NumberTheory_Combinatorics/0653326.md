This conference, held at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, will
bring together distinguished experts to report on recent advances in classical
analytic number theory, combinatorial number theory, computational number
theory, and Diophantine analysis. All of these areas of number theory are very
active with a number of spectacular recent breakthroughs.

Between 125 and 150 participants are expected, with approximately 25 invited
plenary 40 minute talks and many 20 minute contributed talks. Invited speakers
include both well-established senior researchers and rising young stars. Most of
our overall budget is intended to support students, postdocs and young faculty
who do not have their own support, including women and under-represented
minorities.
