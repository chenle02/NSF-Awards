0923475&lt;br/&gt;Solin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The applicants propose the
acquisition of a state-of-the-art, reactive ion etching, inductively coupled
plasma (RIE/ICP) system to develop the nanofabrication capabilities at
Washington University (WU), which will be extended to researchers in the St.
Louis metropolitan area and elsewhere. The capability for high-spatial
resolution, site-specific fabrication/modification of nanostructures using
electron-beam lithography (eBL) and RIE/ICP is essential for cutting-edge
research in integrated nanostructured materials and devices. RIE/ICP provides
dry-etch processing that is standard in nanofabrication design work, and allows
the creation of sophisticated, three-dimensional, functional devices with
nanometer-scale features.
