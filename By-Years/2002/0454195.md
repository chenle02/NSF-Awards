Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Proposal: CNS 0454195&lt;br/&gt;PI: Thomas L.
Martin&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State
University (Virginia Tech)&lt;br/&gt;Program: NSF 04-588 CISE Computing Research
Infrastructure&lt;br/&gt;Title: CRI: Electronic Textiles for Wearable and
Pervasive Computing &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI at Virginia Polytechnic
Institute and State University is a leader in emerging research in electronic
textiles. At present, the PI's team is handweaving textiles with embedded
wiring, sensors, actuators, and processing elements. The project will acquire a
computer controlled, 60-inch industrial loom, a 15-needle embroidery machine,
and a software controlled sewing machine that can handle novel fibers. These
acquisitions will enable faster and more reliable production of experimental
textiles; the equipment is similar to industrial equipment so the researchers
will both gain experience with manufacturing needs and position their research
for future impacts on practice. The research supported includes textiles for
health monitoring, monitoring physical therapy, monitoring gait, and sound
detection and localization.&lt;br/&gt;
