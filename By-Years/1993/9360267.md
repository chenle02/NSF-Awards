9360267 Gosper This project is to develop a prototype software system for
computing definite summations. Some of the methods developed, whether or not
they succeed in finding a closed form result, will offer an alternative
expression, mathematically equivalent to the sum but more rapidly convergent. A
secondary goal is to develop in parallel, the complementary process of expanding
expressions into infinite series. The resulting product will be embedded in
Macsyma, an established symbolic-numerical mathematics software system with many
users who will benefit from better technology for computing with summations and
series. ***
