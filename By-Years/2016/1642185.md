With various sources of funding, graduate students and early-career faculty in
cybersecurity are able to participate in conferences in their area of research
and have an opportunity to interact with other researchers. However, there seems
to be much less support for faculty or doctoral students to attend conferences
on cybersecurity education. Consequently, there seems to be a shortage of
representation of faculty from doctoral institutions among cybersecurity
education community. Yet, it is those institutions and faculty who produce the
next generation of professors educating the future cybersecurity
workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The funding from NSF will support US-based
early-career tenure-track cybersecurity faculty and PhD students at research
universities to attend the Colloquium for Information Systems Security
Education. Since 1996, the Colloquium brings together professionals in academia,
industry, and government to provide a forum to discuss and advance cybersecurity
education at large. The 2016 Colloquium, which marks the 20th anniversary of the
conference, will be held on June 13-15, 2016 in Philadelphia, PA and it will
consist of a three-day technical program with optional workshops right before
the conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project intends to have a diverse
representation among the travel grant recipients in terms of gender, ethnic
background, academic institutions, and geographic location. While the grant
recipients are the most immediate beneficiaries, the community in general will
benefit by connecting with a new group of students and faculty that will likely
become active contributors in the years to come. This effort is supporting the
critical need of the cybersecurity workforce development. A specific broadening
participation efforts are reflected by prioritizing applicants traditionally
underrepresented in cybersecurity including women, African-Americans, Hispanics,
Native Americans, and Native Pacific Islanders.
