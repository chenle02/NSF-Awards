A workshop general chemistry class is being developed that includes experimental
work during every meeting. Lab work is merged with classroom discussion.
Students working in groups are challenged to link their macroscopic observations
to chemical principles. The merger of thirty-minute, concept- based discovery
labs with discussion and lateral development material provides a unique
perspective of chemistry. In modernizing the general chemistry curriculum, fewer
topics are treated and the more esoteric aspects of physical chemistry that are
inappropriate for freshmen are eliminated. More time is allocated to materials
chemistry, organic and biological chemistry, and environmental science. The
course material is organized into modules or case- studies that contain material
which is developed with the specific aim of showing the relevance of the
material to problems to which the students already have been exposed. Societal
relevance is built into every module of the syllabus by incorporating
laboratories, discussion and "lateral development" problems for each topic.
