The PI plans to determine the source characteristics of aerosols originating
over the savannas of southwest Africa, including aerosol size distribution and
composition, distinguishing between products from biomass burning and erosion of
mineral soils, concentrations of water extractable nutrients in surface soils
and in aerosols, fluxes of aerosols from identified source areas, and
meteorological processes associated with aerosol emissions from source areas and
subsequent long range transport. The PI plans to take advantage of data sets
from the TRACE- A/SAFARI field programs to address both source characteristics
and long range transports. Isotope characteristics of continental (both dry and
wet) regimes will be used to fingerprint the source and trace the trajectories.
Three-dimensional isobaric trajectory analysis will be carried out not only
during the field experiment, but also for historical dry and wet conditions. The
combined trajectory, isotope tracer and general circulation analysis will
provide a framework to interpret the role of the atmosphere and the resultant
transports of the aerosols. The PI plans to use the results of this work to
infer consequences to both continental and oceanic ecosystems as a function of
the airborne supply of nutrients.
