There has never been a concurrent study of prey capture success and water flow
over reef corals. This project will investigate the effect of water movement on
several aspects of the feeding biology of corals. The first portion of the
project will measure field rates of feeding of three species of coral,
Montastrea annularis, Eusmilia fastigiata and Porites porites with prey sampling
by an automated pump/sampler array that allows concurrent measurement of water
flow (thermistor flowmeter, video), irradiance (Licor quantum irradiance meter)
and prey availability (DO pump sampler). Feeding experiments on expansion and
contraction behavior and feeding during several diel cycles. A self-contained
underwater thermistor flowmeter with a 2 mm spatial resolution has been
constructed and tested for this research based on the design of LaBarbera and
Vogel (1976). The data collected will be used to characterize the general flow
regime at the site (mainstream flow at several points along depth transects
using the Interocean S4 recording current meter), providing new information
about the flow environment on coral reefs in St. Croix at the NOAA National
Undersea Research Program's AQUARIUS habitat.
