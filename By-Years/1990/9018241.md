This award is made as the starter grant increment of Dr. John Griffin's
Postdoctoral Fellowship in Chemistry Award in support of his research at
Stanford University. The thrust of Dr. Griffin's research is the isolation,
purification and characterization of enzyme and antibody catalysyts for polyene
cyclization reactions. Enzymatic activity of purified cyclase will be quantified
and the amino acid and gene sequence will be determined. The cyclizing acive
site will be studied through affinity labelling and directed mutagenesis
experiments. This should permit the design and preparation of engineered enzymes
having novel substrate and/or product specificities. Heterobicyclic immunogens
will be synthesized which will elicit antibodies capable of initiating,
directing and terminating the cyclization of diene epoxides. Once antibody
catalysts have been identified, their mechanism of action will be studied. This
should lead to a better understanding of sterol biosynthesis and macromolecular
catalysis and may provide useful catalysts for the synthesis of sterols.
