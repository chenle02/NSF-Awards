In order to make predictions about future changes in biological communities, it
is necessary to describe the foraging relationships that occur in these
communities. Such descriptions are mathematical expressions of the rate at which
a predator or consumer consumes a given type of prey or food. The proposal
research is designed to develop mathematical expressions to describe foraging
relationships. It differs from most previous work in that the predators or
consumers are assumed to behave adaptively in balancing the costs and benefits
of a given amount of consumption, and it focuses on situations in which there is
a choice of two or more food types. Optimization theory will be used to explore
the types of eating relationships that occur when there are different costs and
benefits to, and constraints on, the process of food consumption. The ultimate
goal is to compile a catalogue of potential foraging relationships that can be
used in building quantitative models of ecological communities. Such models are
essential in predicting the effects of perturbations to ecological systems,
whether the perturbations result from the introduction or extinction of species,
or from the effects of pollutants on the death rates of specific species.
