Since the seminal studies of Darwin and predecessors, multiple hypotheses have
been proposed concerning evolutionary relationships among the barnacles of the
world. However, because of the strange and diverse morphologies associated with
this most interesting group of crustaceans, discerning evolutionary
relationships has been particularly difficult. Furthermore, most modern attempts
have been hampered by poor sampling of species diversity. This international
collaborative study will examine a broad array of barnacle species from around
the world by sequencing DNA from multiple gene regions to infer evolutionary
relationships among the major groups of barnacles. The project will use state-
of-the-art automated sequencing techniques combined with supercomputing
applications for estimating genealogical relationships among the species
sampled.&lt;br/&gt;The resulting genealogical relationships will then be used to
explore biogeographic patterns of biodiversity among the barnacles. These
biogeographic patterns allow global inferences of patterns of diversity
(conspicuously absent for marine fauna in general) thus informing global
conservation decisions. These results will be disseminated to the public through
the Tree of Life web project (tolweb.org - also supported by NSF). This research
represents a strong global collaboration, with co-Principal Investigators from
the US, Denmark, and Australia and collaborators from many other countries
including Brazil, Russia, and Spain, combining leading expertise in crustacean
molecular systematics with barnacle morphology. This project will also provide
educational/training opportunities for undergraduates, high school teachers,
graduate students, post-docs, and international faculty through research
experiences and lab exchanges of personnel.&lt;br/&gt;
