Portable and multi-target DNA/RNA diagnostics requires a rapid, field-usable,
simple to operate, regenerable and economical biosensor system. The nanomembrane
technology presented here is based upon the integration of newly discovered
electrokinetic phenomena in nanoporous membranes that promise to extend
traditional label-free electrochemical and capacitance/conductance biosensors to
the requisite robustness, sensitivity, selectivity and assay speed for on-field
nucleic acid detection. The proposed work will optimize and integrate these new
physical phenomena into an automated membrane sensing platform for hand-held
DNA/RNA devices suitable for field applications by scientifically scrutinizing
the detailed non-equilibrium electrokinetic phenomena and by exploiting the
latest nano/microfabrication technologies. The proposed work will heavily
involve development of miniature prototypes that can have a significant impact
on biological research and, more commercially, the biotechnology industry
sector. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A viable portable and label-free DNA/RNA detection
platform for bacterial detection has the potential to spur a technological
advance in the biosensor industry, as it could transform pathogen detection
methodology for medical, environmental, and agricultural applications by
eliminating the time-consuming nucleic acid amplification step and the
costly/bulky/personnel-intensive optical detectors of fluorescent sensing. The
project can hence impact both nanoscience and nano biotechnology. The
flexibility of the platform to test various pathogenic targets related to health
and environmental safety could vastly increase the target portfolio and widen
the impact of the technology.
