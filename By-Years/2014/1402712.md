Research Corp Title: CELL INTERFACIAL ENGINEERING WITH SOFT LbL SHELLS

Biological cells are complex machineries that are able to do many things that
are still beyond the capabilities of engineering and science. Those capabilities
can be used by preserving the cells in a protective shell before bringing them
into a hostile environment, where the cell's functionalities are to be used.
This proposal presents a new way to construct responsive coatings for cells,
such as yeast and bacterial cells, using layer-by-layer (LbL) techniques to make
polymeric capsules based on hydrogen bonding of the polymeric layers,
particularly silk-based polymers. This proposed approach will bypass the known
toxicity of past cationic (positively charged) LbL polymers, as well as resolve
some of the issues with silica sol-gel and hydrogel encapsulation technologies.
The encapsulation methodology described in this proposal, if successfully
developed, could lead to a high impact on new ways to protect cells from their
environments and thus enable cellular technologies in cell-based biosensing,
cell-based therapies, and tissue engineering.

The proposed approach is systematic and well laid out, involving identification
of components from which to fabricate the multilayers, studies of the transport
properties of the multilayers, and then encapsulation of yeast and bacterial
cells with the select polymers and investigation of protective effects of the
shells on the cells as they are challenged in various environments. Novel
aspects of the proposal include the use of shear and/or ionic strength changes
into induce conformational changes (beta-sheet formation) in silk-based proteins
to achieve physical cross-linking. The planned approach of using soft bio-
interfaces that are robust, semipermeable, and cyto-friendly will help the
investigators to reach their ultimate goal of gaining an understanding of
interfacial organization, transport properties, and the mechanism of
interactions between the shells and cell surfaces that are necessary to preserve
the viability and function of genetically engineered microbial cells.
