The proposed work has the objective of obtaining a detailed understanding of
selective removal (SR) of a component from an alloy. Model systems (e.g., Cu-Au)
and commercially important systems (e.g., Cu-Ni) will be studied over a range of
temperatures in both gaseous and aqueous environments. Atom probe-field ion
microscopy (AP-FIM) will be used to study the initial stage of the SR process in
metal/gas systems at elevated temperatures. Scanning tunneling microscopy will
be used to make insitu studies of SR reactions at the atomic scale.
