This research examines how young children keep track of and estimate the
position of nonvisible objects so that they can effectively move through their
environment without getting lost. These skills are fundamental to managing
everyday tasks, but little is known about how they are acquired by young
children. Two studies use a task that requires young children to search for an
object hidden in sandboxes that differ in size and shape. Children's performance
in finding the hidden objects in the different sandbox tasks will reveal the
generality and limitations of their knowledge about space during the first three
years of life. The research will generate new knowledge about children's spatial
behavior, while also seeking points of integration between two different
theories of spatial behavior. There is a gap in our existing knowledge about
spatial behavior in children between 1 to 3 years of age. This is a time in
development that includes important advances in the growth of movement skills
and thinking skills that should influence how children keep track of locations
while they move through space and how this ability develops. The project is
guided by two different theories, one that attempts to explain adult spatial
behavior and another that attempts to explain children's spatial behavior.
Specific predictions made by these two theories will be tested. The results of
the studies may support an integrated account of early spatial development that
can explain a wider range of spatial behaviors than either theory can now
explain. This POWRE award will permit the investigator, an associate professor,
to resume her research career after spending the last few years on sabbatical
leave and assisting in university administration. These activities, while
important in other respects, took a toll on her career advancement and
professional growth. She will now get back on track to a productive research
program, which will put her in an excellent position for academic advancement
and leadership in her field.
