This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will result in the
development of a novel semiconductor growth technique to produce low dislocation
density III-nitride AlInGaN substrate materials for high efficiency deep UVLEDs
and electronic devices. This novel growth technique termed Metalorganic Hydride
Vapor Phase Epitaxy (MOHVPE) is a hybrid of Metalorganic Chemical Vapor
Deposition (MOCVD), used for device growth where atomic layer accuracy is
required, and Hydride Vapor Phase Epitaxy (HVPE), used for fast bulk growth.
Their combination in a single growth reactor allows for the growth of very
thick, low dislocation density films as substrates templates. Then the growth
mode can be switched to the metalorganic sources to grow atomically controlled
device active layers, such as quantum wells, without taking the wafer out of the
growth chamber.

The MOHVPE AlGaN substrate technology will lead to higher efficiency Power
Electronics and deep UV LEDs. Deep UV LEDs offer the potential to greatly
increase our understanding of the interaction between UV light and
biological/microbiological species. This is increasingly important as we
confront the global trends of an aging population (healthcare), increased
population density leading to greater pathogen exposure and water shortages, and
greater cross-border travel. Researchers are just beginning to investigate
applications for UV radiation including cancer treatment, increased plant/food
yield, and genetic modification with an increasing interest based on the ability
to more controllably deliver UV radiation to particular points of interest that
has been enabled by UV LEDs.
