A Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrophotometer (FTIR) is being used by the
Chemistry Department of the University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh to introduce
chemistry students to the infrared techniques of data acquistion and
manipulation, spectral storage, searching, and signal enhancement. This is being
accomplished by introducing several new laboratory experiments, updating
existing ones and offering expanded opportunities in undergraduate research.
This curriculum development is having a direct impact on the physical chemistry,
instrumental, inorganic, and spectroscopy laboratories and will significantly
update the training of students in the area of Infrared Spectroscopy.
