9452749 Keynes The University of Minnesota seeks to initiate a comprehensive,
year round program, called PROJECT YES, of monthly academic year activities
followed by a four-week summer commuter enrichment institute for 90
mathematically talented students in grades 7 and 8. Project YES is primarily
targeted at female students, students of color, and economically disadvantaged
students. It presents rich and diverse informational and enrichment activities
to support further study of mathematics and enhance interest in career
oppurtunities in mathematics and sciences. A special feature of the program
would be an innovative two-week program at the NSF supported Geometry Center
featuring geometry, visualization, and hands-on graphics exploration. ***
