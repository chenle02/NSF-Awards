DMS-0204681&lt;br/&gt;Michael Hutchings&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
involves the development and application of new&lt;br/&gt;enumerative invariants
in low-dimensional, symplectic, and contact&lt;br/&gt;topology. There are two
main goals. The first is to develop and&lt;br/&gt;compute ``periodic Floer
homology'', a theory defined for an&lt;br/&gt;area-preserving surface
diffeomorphism, which counts periodic orbits&lt;br/&gt;together with embedded
pseudoholomorphic curves in R cross the mapping&lt;br/&gt;torus. This theory is
conjectured to agree with the Seiberg-Witten&lt;br/&gt;Floer homology of the
mapping torus, thus giving a link between low&lt;br/&gt;dimensional topology and
surface dynamics. Also, an analogue of&lt;br/&gt;periodic Floer homology for
three-dimensional contact manifolds should&lt;br/&gt;have applications to the
topology of overtwisted contact structures&lt;br/&gt;and smooth four-manifolds.
The second main goal is to develop and&lt;br/&gt;compute invariants of families
of equivalent objects in different&lt;br/&gt;versions of Floer theory. These
give topological invariants of&lt;br/&gt;families of symplectomorphisms, three-
manifolds, Legendrian knots, and&lt;br/&gt;any other type of object for which a
version of Floer theory can be&lt;br/&gt;defined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project fits into the broad theme of developing tools to&lt;br/&gt;understand
the possible global shapes of three and four dimensional&lt;br/&gt;spaces. For
example the universe we live in is a four dimensional&lt;br/&gt;space if one
includes time, and its global structure is not known.&lt;br/&gt;The tools used
here to understand the shape of a space involve&lt;br/&gt;counting interesting
geometric objects inside the space. An important&lt;br/&gt;class of such objects
are pseudoholomorphic curves, which are surfaces&lt;br/&gt;resembling soap
films. By counting the number of such surfaces with&lt;br/&gt;appropriate
constraints that exist in a space, one can gain&lt;br/&gt;information about the
global structure of the space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
