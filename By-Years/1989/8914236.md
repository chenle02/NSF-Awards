This research employs analytical and numerical modeling to explore the close
interaction, deformation, and coalescence of liquid drops in motion. Specific
issues to be addressed are: the lubrication force and mobility functions of
nearly spherical drops, collision rate predictions, intervening film drainage
times, and the influence of van der Waals forces. The development of a suitable
model for such phenomena, and predictions from it, will lead to improved
prediction capability in the areas of sedimentation, emulsions, and
flocculation.
