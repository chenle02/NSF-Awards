This project is an element of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment that
addresses issues associated with current meters. The PI will assess the present
current meter data inventory, will determine the quality of the information, and
will prepare a study outlining a strategy for WOCE on this topic. Additionally,
the project will test components of current mooring and pressure gauge
measurements to assess the potential for their deployment in the Southern Ocean,
or other hostile climates.
