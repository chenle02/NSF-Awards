The project Mapping Developmental Trajectories of Students' Conceptions of
Integers, led by faculty from San Diego State University, is using data from
interviews with K-12 students and adults to describe common understandings and
progressions of development for negative number concepts and operations. The
project is motivated by the widely acknowledged finding that students have
difficulty mastering key concepts and skills involved in work with integers.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two questions frame and guide the proposed
research:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* What are students' conceptions of integers and
operations on integers?&lt;br/&gt;* What are possible developmental trajectories
of students' understandings?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators are seeking
answers to those questions through structured interviews with students in
elementary grades prior to instruction about negative numbers, students in
middle grades whose curriculum includes explicit instruction about integers,
high school students who are expected to use prior knowledge about integers in
more advanced mathematics, and adults who use integers in their work.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to providing an empirically-based picture of
ways that students acquire increasingly sophisticated understandings about
negative numbers, the project is producing useful interview protocols and a
reliable and valid assessment instrument for describing the understanding and
skill of students at various stages on such a progression.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Both the characterization of common learning progressions and the
assessment instruments will be broadly useful to curriculum and test developers
and teachers in K-12 mathematics classrooms.
