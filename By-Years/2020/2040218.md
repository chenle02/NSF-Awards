An important goal of plant synthetic biology is to design artificial chromosomes
with custom genes and pathways that can improve plant performance in areas such
as drought tolerance. The overall aim of this project is to develop strategies
for the introduction and inheritance of custom designed artificial plant
chromosomes. This work will be communicated to the public through two “Plants by
Design” research symposia, research demonstrations at the Bell Museum at the
University of Minnesota, and interactive instructional events at local farmers
markets in Athens Georgia. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Years of research
have provided a comprehensive understanding of what centromeres are made of and
what proteins bind to them. This project will test the investigators' knowledge
by creating synthetic centromeres with defined components. In prior work the
investigators inserted long arrays of LexO binding sites on maize chromosome 4
and showed that a fusion protein containing a LexA DNA binding domain and CENH3
(LexA-CENH3) binds to LexO arrays and recruits other kinetochore proteins. In
this project, they will determine whether LexA-CENH3-activated synthetic
centromeres are capable of driving independent chromosome segregation. They will
use several methods to break chromosome 4 and liberate the end fragments to
become independent neochromosomes, which they will test for mitotic and meiotic
stability. They will also create new LexO arrays and determine the minimum size
necessary to activate functional centromeres. They will further extend the work
to Nicotiana benthamiana, where methods exist to transform protoplasts with
large molecules. They will build synthetic chromosome vectors based on the LexA-
CENH3 system and test their properties in culture and regenerated plants. If
successful, the results will expand knowledge of plant centromeres and provide
first-generation synthetic chromosome vectors for plant genome
engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
