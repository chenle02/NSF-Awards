9319445 Scott The goal of this research is to develop and evaluate
synchronization techniques on very large scale shared memory mutliprocessor
systems. With increases in size and availability of parallel processors, high-
performance synchronization has become a critical factor in overall application
performance and scalability. Among the techniques for synchronization include
special-purpose hardware, active messages, lock-free data structures, and
scalable software synchronization algorithms based on atomic fetch-and-o
instructions. The choice of the synchronization approach plays a significant
role on the overall performance. The PI proposes to concentrate his research on
1)comparative evaluation of software synchronization, lock- free data
structures, active messages and special-purpose hardware primitives, 2)new
synchronization algorithms that scale with the number of processors and utilize
the available atomic instructions, and 3) new mechanisms for cooperative
synchronization and scheduling which minimize the unnecessary spinning on locks,
maximize processor locality and avoid contention for both lock and nonlock data.
