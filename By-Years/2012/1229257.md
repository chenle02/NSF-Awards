1229257&lt;br/&gt;Walker&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research
Instrumentation (MRI) Program grant supports acquisition of a powder x-ray
diffractometer for the Department of Earth Science and Geography at Vassar
College, a non-Ph.D. Granting institution. A new table XRD will replace an
extant but aging Siemens D5000 XRD (vintage 1989). The XRD will support research
that requires rapid phase identification of fine grained materials and
crystallographic structure refinement. Research that will be supported includes
studies of clay mineral assemblages in low grade metamorphic rocks in order to
determine zones of metasomatic activity, studies of phyllosilicates in soils to
understand the cation exchange behavior of soils; and studies of the clay
mineralogy of lacustrine sediments in order to understand the paleoevironmental
conditions of their formation. The instrument will support undergraduate student
research training at this four year liberal arts institution with a historically
high enrollment of women and underprivileged students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***
