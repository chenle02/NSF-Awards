This research is to use tomographic imaging techniques to determine the
subsurface structure beneath Mt. St. Helens at a very high resolution (on the
order of 100 meters). By the use of 5000 previously unused earthquakes, a three
dimensional velocity model will be determined which can then be used to improve
the spatial resolution of earthquake locations. Gravity, aeromagnetic and
attenuation data will be used to constrain the structural solution. A goal of
the work will be to distinguish between conflicting models of the plumbing
system for the transport of magma to the surface. Because this work has the
potential for increasing the understanding of the interaction of magma transport
and seismicity for the major Cascade range strato-volcanos, it has application
to the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
