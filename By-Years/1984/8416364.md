This research project addresses the problem of high rejection rates in the
processing of high technology ceramic components. Rejection is often caused by
non-uniform microstructure development during sintering. Polymer adsorption from
various solvents is studied to provide steric stabilization of particles to
allow ordering of these particles into green bodies with uniform porosity.
