The objective of this research is to develop a fiber-based endoscopic device
with a metamaterial hyperlens at the end of the fiber, providing submicron
resolution imaging for in-vivo diagnostics. The approach includes 1) theoretical
design and experimental demonstration of a fiber-based hyperlens, 2)
demonstration of transmission of high resolution images through a single fiber
with an optimized design, and 3) identification of low-loss plasmonic materials
for hyperlens fabrication to address the fundamental issue of losses that
hinders the performance of optical
metamaterials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: Remote in-vivo
endoscopic optical imaging plays a key role in the area of minimally invasive
medicine. It is particularly critical for advancing the field of
gastroenterology and oncology. The proposed research is transformative in nature
as it will 1) advance fundamental knowledge of sub-wavelength imaging using
metamaterial fiber-based structures, 2) address the critical need for a high
resolution endoscopic imaging device by combining unique properties of
metamaterials and specialty fibers, and 3) identify novel low-loss plasmonic
materials for practical metamaterial devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
impacts: The ability to rapidly and noninvasively image biological substances
and tisssues with sub-wavelength resolution without biopsy, sectioning, or
staining would be an extremely useful tool that would revolutionize many fields
from clinical diagnostics to pharmaceutical manufacturing. The proposed system
could lend itself to single molecule spectroscopy and enable new approaches to
multimodal remote sensing. The proposed education and outreach program will
contribute to the preparation and training of graduate and undergraduate
students, including underrepresented minorities and women, K-12 students and
high school teachers.
