ABSTRACT EEC-9713064 JONES Factors influencing polyelectrolyte are greater and
more complex than those in organic solvents. Quantitative comparison of theory
to experiment, and therefore a comprehensive understanding of these factors, is
lacking. Only a fraction studies conducted with polyelectrolytes used samples
with sufficient monodisperse molecular weight distribution to quantitatively
isolate the relevant phenomena. This collaboration (TIE) project utilizes the
expertise of two Industry/University Cooperative Research Centers to address
this problem. Researchers at the Industry/University Cooperative Research
Centers for Coatings Research at Eastern Michigan University will synthesize
three classes of polymers to address the study. Researchers at the
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Polymer Interfaces at Lehigh
University will perform fundamental studies to build a ground-up understanding
of the absorption behavior of these polymers.
