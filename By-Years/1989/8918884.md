The proposed project would connect the eight campuses in the University of
Maine System to the NSFNET. The System's Computing and Data Processing Services
has in place the initial nodes of a TCP/IP based network currently connecting
the three largest campuses. Additionally, several private colleges in Maine will
be offered connectivity to the University's System. A high speed link is
proposed (1.5 million bits per second), which would connect the Portland Campus
with a major NSFNET node in the Boston area. The Portland Campus, in turn is
connected to the other System's major campuses via high speed links provided by
the University. Once the connection is established, researchers using computers
can exchange data with any other NSFNET site with great ease. It also
significantly facilitates data transfer between the mainframes at the University
of Maine campuses with other advanced facilities on the NSFNET and provides
remote log-in capabilities from the System's campuses to supercomputer centers
and allows for quick transfer of results to local computers for analysis.***
