OPP-9728364 PI Posson Abstract In 1988, the Interagency Arctic Research policy
Committee (IARPC) established the AEDD Working group to identify, organize,
preserve, and present information about Arctic environmental data which is
available from US Federal agencies and selected Alaska State agencies and
academic institutions. The Arctic Environmental Data Directory (AEDD) was
assembled as a subset of the Earth Science Data Directory of the U.S. Geological
Survey. AEDD contains more than 400 references to data sets, each of which has
been reviewed for completeness, consistency, and accuracy. Data sets described
cover many disciplines including geophysics, hydrology, geochemistry,
oceanography, cartography, atmospheric physics and chemistry, marine and
terrestrial biology, health and medicine, contaminants, remote sensed data, and
in situ data. AEDD resides on a computer system accessible to scientists, policy
makers, educators, and the interested public over the internet.
