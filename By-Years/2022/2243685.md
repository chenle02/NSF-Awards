The oceans play a critical role in modulating Earthâ€™s carbon cycle, climate, and
habitability. Geoscientists rely on the sedimentary record of ocean basins to
understand how the Earth and its oceans respond to geological and environmental
change over long timescales. Ultimately, a better understanding of these
feedbacks allows for predictions about how life on our planet has responded, or
will respond, to external drivers such as climate or tectonics. This project
will investigate links between physical surface processes, ocean oxygenation,
and organic carbon burial during the establishment of the South Atlantic Ocean
from 150-100 million years ago, a time period characterized by greenhouse to
hothouse climate conditions. More broadly, this project will (1) generate new
high school educational and professional development content; (2) enhance
infrastructure for international research, collaboration, and community
engagement in southern Patagonia; and (3) promote teaching, mentoring, and
research with undergraduates in STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Continental break-up
facilitates suitable conditions (e.g., restricted incipient ocean basins) for
organic carbon burial. It is less clear, however, when/how these conditions are
reversed by continued continental breakup and ocean basin ventilation and
circulation. This project aims to determine the depositional response to local
basin setting, regional tectonics, and global climate changes associated with
the opening of a major oceanic gateway in the South Atlantic during the Early
Cretaceous breakup of Gondwana. Preliminary results from southern Patagonia show
there are discernable lithologic and chemostratigraphic boundaries in the
stratigraphy of southern ocean basins recording changing environmental
conditions. Constraining the timing of deposition with high precision
geochronology and the chemical environments of deposition allows for comparisons
between this study in Patagonia with age-correlative basins elsewhere. Moreover,
through collaborations with Chilean paleontologists, the project will inform
ongoing paleobiology studies of the environmental influences on the distribution
and behavioral patterns of Cretaceous marine
vertebrates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
