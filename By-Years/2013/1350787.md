This project, carried out by the University of Notre Dame, seeks to contribute
to statistics education by developing improved methods for computerized adaptive
testing. These methods use modern versions of item response theory, going beyond
older versions that are commonly used in adaptive tests. Hence, the project has
the potential to lead to tests that more successfully measure student knowledge
and provide diagnostic feedback, as computerized testing increasing comes into
wide use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is a CAREER award, supporting not
only research but educational outreach and professional development by a Notre
Dame faculty member, Dr. Ying Cheng. The educational outreach includes providing
summer research fellowships to high school and college students, and offering a
workshop to high school statistics teachers. The test items and computerized
testing/feedback programs developed in this project will be made available to
students and teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project involves the
participation of several hundred students, taking Advanced Placement (AP)
statistics classes in high school or introductory statistics in college, as well
as about 30 AP statistics high school teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work
helps the Education and Human Resources directorate, and the Division of
Research on Learning, pursue the mission of supporting science, technology,
engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education research. In particular, this
project focuses on improving STEM learning, including assessment of learning and
use of technology in STEM learning environments such as schools.
