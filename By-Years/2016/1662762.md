This project seeks to establish a new CyberCorpsÂ®: Scholarship for Service (SFS)
program at the University of Alabama at Birmingham to prepare highly-qualified
Cybersecurity professionals for entry into the federal, state, local, and tribal
government workforce. The proposal addresses the growing need for a well-trained
cyber-security workforce via a unique partnership between Computer and
Information Sciences (CIS) and Justice Sciences (JS). This proposal supports the
U.S. Department of Justice's call to develop new tools and applications that
improve the capacity to use and process digital evidence. The key to these goals
is to educate the next generation of cybersecurity professionals skilled in the
use of these new tools and processes. The project will provide SFS students with
knowledge and practical experience on how to conduct cyber-criminal
investigations. The graduates will develop unique skills to combat cyber-crime.
The proposed combination of CIS and JS creates a unique model of cross-
disciplinary education and research to address cyber-crime. The program aims to
produce unique professionals serving in the public sector and it could serve as
an exemple for other universities. The project will employ mechanisms to enroll
students from minority populations and to retain them via innovative approaches
focused on monitoring and mentoring. The project emphasizes outreach to high
school students via security events and summer camps, the Intelligence Community
via internships, the public via security conferences and workshops, as well as
the media. It will contribute to improve national security and online safety by
graduating highly-skilled cybersecurity professionals who are dedicated to
public service.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The university is designated as the DHS/NSA
Center of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense Research, and the proposed
program is leveraging the existing Master's program in Computer Forensics and
Security Management (CFSM) offered jointly by CIS and JS. A minimum of 30
semester hours of credit are required for the MS-CFSM degree, including 21 hours
of required credits and 9 hours of elective credits fulfilled by choosing one of
two tracks in the program: Cybercrime Investigations or IT Audit/Fraud
Examination. The courses offered within the program include Computer Network
Security; Information Security Management; Ethics and Computer Forensics; Law
Evidence and Procedure; Malware Analysis; and Fraud Examination; among several
other offerings. The team has a close working relationship with federal
organizations, including formal internship agreements, and cybersecurity
research support from NSF, DARPA, IARPA, ONR, DHS, NIJ, COPS, BJA, the state of
Alabama, and federal law enforcement agencies, including the FBI and ICE.
