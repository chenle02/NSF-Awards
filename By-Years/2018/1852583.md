The Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site in Interactive Virtual
Experiences seeks to engage 10 undergraduate students each summer at the
University of Southern California's Institute for Creative Technologies, a
unique multidisciplinary research community that combines leading academic
researchers in computer science, psychology, education, cinematic arts, and
medicine. Students will be embedded in collaborative research teams working on
the institute's core theme of interactive virtual experiences, with specific
projects in natural language dialogue, virtual humans, narrative, mixed reality,
medical virtual reality, vision and graphics, and learning sciences. These
research activities will be combined with weekly interactive seminars for
training in best research practices, mentorship support, and peer
feedback.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The REU site teaches techniques and technologies
developed by the researchers and students in natural language, vision, and
graphics that will drive the creation of compelling synthetic environments and
characters. These technologies have immediate relevance to a broad range of
application domains including training, education, entertainment,
rehabilitation, and medicine. The project will emphasize selection of
participants from populations that are underrepresented in computing, will
engage undergraduate students in interdisciplinary research, and will expose the
students to opportunities in science and engineering graduate programs. This
effort has the potential to prepare undergraduates to perform independent
research, thereby broadening participation and increasing enrollment and
retention in computing doctoral programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
