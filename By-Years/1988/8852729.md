This award to Wesleyan University's Department of Earth and Environmental
Sciences is made in response to a proposal submitted to the National Science
Foundation's Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement Program. The award will
provide one- half of the funds needed to acquire a microcomputer-based image
processing system for use in the Department's undergraduate training program.
The University is committed to providing the other half required. The equipment
will be used to upgrade the institution's capability to teach digital methods of
mapping and map interpretation in a curriculum which emphasizes earth surface
processes.
