It is commonly assumed that consumers' demand functions are generated by the
maximization of some utility function. Detailed knowledge of utility functions
is necessary for the prediction of consumer demand under different environments
and for the assessment of the welfare implications of policy changes. The
purpose of this project is to develop nonparametric methods for estimating
utility functions from consumer-demand observations. The methods are
nonparametric because they do not require the specification of a specific
functional form. This is important because this approach can eliminate
misspecification errors leading to faulty predictions. The computational
complexity of estimating nonparametric demand functions requires the use of a
supercomputer, and this award will provide access to a supercomputer for
developing and testing nonparametric estimation methods.
