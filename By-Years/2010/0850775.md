Chip multiprocessors (i.e., multicores) are rapidly emerging as the dominant
platform for computing. This computing environment features parallel computing
with shared-memory and a hierarchy of caches. This research will develop
parallel and cache-efficient algorithms for many important problems that can be
used effectively on multicores. The outcome of this research will be a set of
provably correct methods for the efficient use of multicores, which is of
critical importance given the imminent reality of multicores on every desktop.
These results will have broad applicability to all fields that rely on compute-
intensive tasks.
