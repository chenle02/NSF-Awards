Computer communication networks are becoming increasingly important for
integration of administrative, engineering design, and production processes in
the large-scale manufacturing business. The efficiency and flexibility of
networks for computer-integrated manufacturing (CIM) can be significantly
improved by using optical fibers as the transmission media. Since the physical
characteristics of optical fibers are significantly different from those of
coaxial cables, the topology and medium access mechanisms in the existing CIM
networking architectures need to be revised. The objective of this research is
to conduct basic and applied research in integrated office and factory
communication networks. The research will focus on the development and analysis
of a high- speed fiber-optic-based network protocol that will integrate real-
time distributed manufacturing processes with engineering design and plant
management databases. Projects of national importance like (1) Manufacturing
Automation Protocol, (2) Technical and Office Protocols, and (3) Integrated
Services Digital Network will directly benefit from this research.
