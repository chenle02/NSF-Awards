Austin Community College District (ACC) will lead a planning grant for an
Advanced Technological Education Center for energy-related technician education.
This planning grant's results will determine the goals, objectives, activities,
and outcomes for a future regional center spanning the State of Texas. This
project will produce a statewide community college mentorship model in which
colleges are mentored to become leaders in energy workforce development and
education. This project will also investigate the possibility of cross-mapping
existing energy skill standards, determine if new skill standards are needed,
and investigate the best ways to constantly review and update standards based on
the needs of the industry and changes in policy. Both cross-mapping and the
mentoring model could be adopted and adapted by other states or a consortium of
states.
