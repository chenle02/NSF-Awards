9600348 Daughton The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables U.S.
scientists and engineers to conduct three to twentyfour months of research
abroad. The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the
use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions
abroad. This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research visit by
Dr. Alan R. Daughton to work with Dr. Henri Waelbroeck at Instituto de Ciencias
Nucleares, UNAM in Mexico City, Mexico. Dr. Daughton has been invited to visit
the Department of Gravitation and Field Theory of Universidad Nacional Autonoma
to establish a collaboration in the field of discrete quantum gravity. That
department is pursuing three different lines of research: the interpretation
problems, specifically the "problem of time"; the mathematics of quantum groups
and their implications as to the structure of spacetime; and discrete models of
quamtum gravity. The institute has a Sun system built around a Sparcsystem 1000.
In addition to Dr. Waelbroeck, Dr. Daughton will be working with Professor
Rafael Sorkin, who will be working on a causal set program. ***
