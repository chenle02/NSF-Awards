Travel funds are requested to partially support the attendance of 4 US
researchers at the Engineering with Membranes 2008 meeting to be held May 25-28,
2008 in Vale do Lobo, Algarve, Portugal. This conference aims to explore new
developments in novel and improved membrane processes through mathematical
modeling, monitoring and characterization. The PI and Co-PI are organizing a
session entitled Responsive Membranes and are responsible for soliciting,
reviewing and organizing the session. The session will have both US and foreign
participants. US participants will benefit from the opportunity to network with
members of the European Membrane Society.

The proposal is a multidisciplinary research collaboration between the
Departments of Chemical Engineering at Colorado State University and Clemson
University. The broader impacts of the project include international perspective
on engineering research which will be obtained by the faculty and graduate
student attending the conference. This award may result in international
collaboration opportunities. will being set up between Germany and the USA.
