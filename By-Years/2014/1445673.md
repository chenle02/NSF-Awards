This award provides support for young scientists to attend the 5th International
Symposium on Lepton Moments, devoted to the study of fundamental properties of
leptons. Topics covered at the symposium include the searches for permanent
electric dipole moments, electron and muon magnetic moments, and lepton flavor
violating decays of the muon. These areas are all of fundamental importance to
our understanding of matter and the formation of the universe. This conference
is unusual in that it brings together researchers in atomic, nuclear, and
particle physics. The support of graduate students and postdocs to attend such a
conference is critical to their overall training and development as scientists.
