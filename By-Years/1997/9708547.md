It is widely held that scientific method involves attempts to disconfirm
prevailing hypotheses -- and experiments conducted in fields like physics are
usually designed to do exactly this. On the other hand, a large body of
psychological literature suggests that people instead seek evidence confirming
hypotheses. In this proposal, the PI suggests that this difference may have to
do with the state of knowledge associated with a given hypothesis - when the
state of knowledge is advanced, we seek disconfirmation of a hypothesis but when
the state of knowledge is primitive, seeking confirmation may be more effective
because it is more likely to result in further evidence from which to induce
generalizations, rules and principles. This conjecture will be tested in a
series of experiments, some involving individuals and some involving small
groups to allow for testing of the additional hypothesis that groups will
perform better in induction tasks than individuals.
