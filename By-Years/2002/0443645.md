This proposal is for a conference to bring together mathematicians and educators
to discuss the organization of "mathematical circles": groups of middle- and
high-school students working through challenging problems and led by academic
research mathematicicans. Representatives form working mathematical circles,
from mathematics competitions, teachers, mathematicicians and prospective
leaders of mathematical circles will be invited. Results will be disseminated on
the web as well as through the circulations of a CD record of the conference.
