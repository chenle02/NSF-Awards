The large-scale use of hybrid seeds over the past century has contributed to a
revolution in agriculture. Hybrid crop plants produce high yields, but due to
genetic segregation, their progeny have variable and frequently low yields. This
means that hybrid seeds have to be generated afresh for every season, using
labor-intensive methods such as hand pollination, resulting in substantially
higher costs. Consequently, hybrids are underutilized for many crops, especially
by farmers in developing countries. Recently a technology called synthetic
apomixis has been developed to enable hybrid rice plants to produce seeds that
are genetic clones of the parent plant, such that the progeny can produce the
same high yields as the parent plant. The method mimics a process called
apomixis that occurs naturally in many asexual plant species, and utilizes
genome editing together with manipulation of gene expression to bypass both
genetic segregation and fertilization. In this project, the method for clonal
propagation of hybrid seeds developed for the monocot plant rice will be
modified and tested for use in tomato, which is a dicot species. If successful
in tomato, the method can be extended to other major crops that are dicots, such
as soybean and cotton, with correspondingly large impacts on world
agriculture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first successful propagation of clonal
seeds by a sexually reproducing plant has been recently achieved in rice,
through the elimination of meiosis by CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing of three
meiotic genes, followed by parthenogenesis arising from egg cell expression of
an embryogenic transcription factor of the BABY BOOM family. The resulting seeds
were clonal and maintained the genome wide heterozygosity of the parent plant. A
similar approach will be used in this project on the dicot plant tomato, to
enable the propagation of hybrid tomato plants clonally through seeds. Tomato
orthologs of the highly conserved meiosis genes REC8, PAIR1 and OSD1 will be
genome edited by CRISPR-Cas9 to eliminate meiosis and form unreduced gametes.
Parthenogenesis of the unreduced egg cell will be induced by ectopic expression
of candidate embryogenic factors identified by orthology to embryonic factors in
rice and Arabidopsis, including those of the BABY BOOM transcription factor
family. Putative clonal progeny will be identified by their chromosomal ploidy,
and validated by whole genome sequencing to confirm maintenance of parental
heterozygosity in their genomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
