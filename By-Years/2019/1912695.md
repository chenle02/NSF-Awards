The IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM 2019) is a
premier conference with a highly selective multi-track technical program
dedicated to addressing the emerging challenges in the broad area of
communication networks. This award supports students who will substantially
benefit from attending this conference but have limited access to foreign travel
funds. Priority will be given to students from under-represented groups (women,
minorities, and those with disabilities), authors without other funding, and
first-time attendees. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The IEEE International Conference on
Computer Communications (INFOCOM 2019) is a top-ranked conference in the broad
area of communication networks. The broad scope of the conference includes both
system and theoretical research. The conference includes a diverse range of
activities, including research presentation, panels, and keynote speeches. This
award supports the travel of graduate and undergraduate students from U.S.
universities to participate in the conference. The selection criteria give
preference to applicants who are women, minorities, have disabilities, or are
from other under-represented groups. The students will be exposed to state-of-
the-art developments in the field and will have the opportunity to exchange
significant and innovative contributions and ideas in the field of networking
and closely related areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
