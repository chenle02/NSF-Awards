This project continues research on producing improved and new Bayesian
econometric methods and applying them in analyzing and predicting economic data.
Topics to be pursued include: (1) work on Bayesian learning models and
procedures for generating prior densities and models for observations; (2)
Bayesian model and forecast combining techniques with applications; and (3)
macroeconomic theory and Bayesian macroeconometric forecasting equations. This
research should improve existing methods of econometric inference and
estimation. The theoretical derivations of information processing rules could
lead to a powerful new framework for analyzing statistical information. The
Bayesian diagnostic checking procedures developed in this project will prove
useful in detecting outliers and departures from specifying assumptions in
econometric studies. A predictive test of when to combine and when not to
combine forecasts developed under the previous NSF grant will be generalized and
applied to economic problems.
