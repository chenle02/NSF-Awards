This award from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Oregon acquire an X-ray
photoelectric spectrometer (LXPS). The research activity to be supported
includes: the areas of molecular self-assembly, polymer modification and/or
degradation, semiconductor photocorrosion, chemical sensing, fabrication of non-
linear optical devices, and the preparation and characterization of new solid
state nanostructures and materials. The X-ray photoelectron (XPS) spectrometer
is used for chemical analysis. It irradiates a sample with a beam of
monochromatic X-rays and the energies of the resulting photoelectrons are
measured and are related to specific elements
