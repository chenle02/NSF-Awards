Supported by a Small Grant for Exploratory Research, a numerical investigation
will be carried out to evaluated the utility of wavelet transforms in
constructing solutions of partial differential equations. As a test problem, an
available two-dimensional but steady state solution of Burgers equation will be
used as a test bed. This is a prototype equation containing many of the
characteristics exhibited by fluid motion, particularly localized regions with
strong gradients. Wavelet-based numerical solutions will be compared to those
from conventional techniques for this test case in which the results are known
exactly. Wavelets contain a potential for more efficient and accurate numerical
methods to predict complex fluid motions, applicable in diverse areas of
engineering.
