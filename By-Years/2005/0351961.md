Under this award the PIs will be responsible for the duration of the Scripps
Institution of Oceanography (SIO) ocean core geological collections. The mission
of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) Geological Collections is to
serve the scientific community by acquisition, maintenance, conservation and
duration of marine geological samples, to encourage utilization of the
collection for scientific study and educational purposes, to develop consistent
policies and procedures through active cooperation with other marine geological
repositories and to support related activities at SIO and the scientific
community at large. The collection includes more than 6000 marine sediment
cores, 2500 dredge hauls, as well as Special Collections of marine microfossils
(radiolarians, nannofossils and foraminifers) and sediment and rock from unique
marine environments, donated by researchers and which had served as the basis
for many significant scientific papers. With this award the repository will
continue the process of getting the Collections in a sensible order, both
physically and electronically, with the help of a Curatorial Assistant and
undergraduate student assistants.
