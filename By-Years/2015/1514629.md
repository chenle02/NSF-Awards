Almost every process in bacteria depends on the dynamic and specific
localization of large molecules within the cell. This research addresses the
question: how do bacteria make sure all of these molecules are organized into
their correct positions? This project will probe the molecular and biophysical
basis of cellular organization, including the role of positional constraints in
regulating both essential and non-essential processes. The study will be carried
out by undergraduate and graduate students in a highly mentored, collaborative
research environment that emphasizes learning-through-teaching experiences and
promotes critical thinking by allowing students to make decisions and learn from
mistakes. The research will also produce a broadly useful and powerful community
research tool that will facilitate the research efforts of over a hundred other
laboratories. The project will provide multi-disciplinary training for graduate
and undergraduate students.

The premise of this research is that the bacterial nucleoid encodes a largely
overlooked reservoir of topological information, and the aim is to elucidate the
mechanisms by which the nucleoid functions as a primary positional determinant
in the 3D landscape of a bacterial cell. Biochemical, structural, genetic, and
cell biological approaches will be employed to elucidate the role of the
nucleoid in the regulation cell division. In addition, a systematized approach
to gene function discovery will be undertaken to identify and characterize novel
factors that interact with the nucleoid and the cell envelope to drive
subcellular organization. The gene discovery pipeline developed for this study
will be broadly applicable to other organisms and the ordered gene expression
library will be made publicly available to accelerate gene function discovery
and characterization efforts in other laboratories.
