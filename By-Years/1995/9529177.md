Abstract 9529177 Rosenberg This Project, the Polar Experiment Network for Upper-
atmosphere Investigations (PENGUIn), supports most of the science and
instrumentation in the Automatic Geophysical Observatory (AGO) network in
Antarctica. The AGOs are totally autonomous observatories, requiring only annual
service visits, which are located at strategic spots on the East Antarctic
Plateau. There are presently five AGOs in the field and a sixth will be deployed
during the austral summer of 1996-97. The science equipment is directed toward
the study of the Earth's ionosphere and magnetosphere. The present PENGUIn
instrumentation is: DC Magnetometer; Lucent Technologies (formerly AT&amp;T Bell
Labs) AC Magnetometer; Kohoku U. and the National Institute of Polar Research in
Japan; U. Of New Hampshire and Augsburg College VLF Radio Noise Receivers;
Stanford U. Imaging Riometers; U. Of Maryland Auroral All-sky Imager; U. Of
California, Berkeley PENGUIn is expected to be a major contributor to both the
International Solar Terrestrial Space Physics and National Space Weather
Programs. ***
