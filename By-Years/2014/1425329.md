This award will support the selection and attendance of eight U. S. graduate
students and postdoctoral researchers at the 2014 Heidelberg Laureate Forum
(HLF) in Heidelberg, Germany on September 21-26, 2014. The HLF brings together
Laureates of the most prestigious awards in mathematics and computer science
(the Abel Prize, the Fields Medal, the Turing Award, and the Rolf Nevanlinna
Prize) to spend a week interacting with 200 early career researchers from all
over the world. This award allows early career researchers from the U.S. to
participate in this valuable international activity. In addition to the
scientific exchanges with the Laureates and each other, young researchers at the
Forum gain a valuable global perspective on the mathematical and computer
sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The HLF provides graduate students and
postdoctoral researchers extraordinary access to a group of scientific role
models through lectures, small group discussions, and casual conversations. Such
experiences can have a profound impact on the development of an early career
researcher. Oak Ridge Associated Universities will recruit a highly qualified
and diverse applicant pool for the Forum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Forum web site:
