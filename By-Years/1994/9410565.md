9410565 Anderson Animals such as sea anemones, jellyfish (Phylum Cnidaria) and
flatworms (Phylum Platyhelminthes) are modern-day representatives of organisms
in which the nervous system, as we know it, first evolved. As such, they present
us with a window into the evolution of the early nervous system and of the
various molecules that enable nervous systems to function as they do. An
evolutionary approach to neurobiological questions has an added benefit inasmuch
as it is possible to identify groups of relatively closely related animals that
differ subtly in some aspect of their neurobiology. A case in point concerns the
action of tetrodotoxin (TTX) a toxin that blocks sodium channels extremely
specifically and with high affinity. Tetrodotoxin blocks sodium currents in
flatworms and higher animals, but is completely ineffective in jellyfish. Thus
one might ask, what are the structural differences between the flatworm and
jellyfish sodium channels that account for this differential sensitivity. Armed
with this information, it should be relatively easy to identify the equivalent
site on mammalian sodium channels thereby enabling the development of new
classes of highly specific, and highly potent anesthetics and channel blockers
that target this hitherto unexploited site on this very important class of
proteins. The overall aim of the proposed work is to take advantage of this
difference in the TTX sensitivity of flatworm and cnidarian sodium channels to
identify the requirements for TTX binding to sodium channels. In addition to
using molecular cloning techniques to determine the primary structure of sodium
channels from a sea anemone, and a flatworm, the PI will use conventional lipid
analysis and protein biochemical techniques to determine the lipid environment
of the native sodium channels in these groups, and the types of sugar moieties
linked to these proteins. The PI will compare these data with equivalent data
previously obtained from a jell yfish.
