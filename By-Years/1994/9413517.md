9413517 Green This award provides partial funding for the acquisition of a
transmission electron microscope (TEM) to be installed and operated as a campus
facility of the University of California at Riverside. The University is
committed to providing the remaining funds needed to acquire the instrument. The
new TEM will serve twelve departments on the Riverside campus. Users of the new
facility are spread broadly across a spectrum of disciplines ranging from the
physical to the biological sciences. Individual research programs needing the
analytical and imaging capabilities of the new TEM include investigations of the
cause of deep- focus earthquakes, evolution of Nematoda, the hypothalamo-
neurohypophysial system, and cell communication mechanisms. ***
