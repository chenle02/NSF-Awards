This award will provide opportunities for undergraduate students to participate
in the National Museum of Natural History Research Training Program at the
Smithsonian Institution. This program introduces undergraduates to the diversity
of scientific disciplines, research techniques, and career choices available in
the fields of modern natural history and systematic biology. The ten-week
program focuses on a research project guided by a research advisor who is one of
the over 100 Ph.D.s on the institution's scientific staff. Each student
participant, in conjunction with the research advisor, develops and tests a
scientific hypothesis(es) using appropriate techniques and communicates the
results in written manuscripts and oral presentations. That research experience
is supplemented with lectures, discussions, demonstrations, field trips, and
tours to provide a broad and balanced view of natural history careers. This
previously funded REU Site has been very effective in encouraging women and
minority students to pursue careers in natural history and systematic biology.
This award will foster the continued education and training of our next
generation of researchers in the Biological Sciences.
