This program presents information and hands-on experience for planning,
designing, building and operating wet lands to serve two functions
simultaneously: (1) wet lands habitat and (2) waste water treatment.
Participants from engineering and the biological sciences interact with experts
in the various aspects of this technology. Lectures are presented, followed by
field trips, laboratory assignments, and interaction with the experts. Long term
continuation of the project is accomplished through a quarterly newsletter and
teleconferencing with a second follow-up workshop of one week, a year after the
first two-week workshop.
