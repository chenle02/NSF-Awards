0333131 Durand Support is provided for the Neural Systems and Engineering track
of the IEEE-Engineering in Medicine and Biology annual meeting and conference in
Cancun, Mexico, September 17-21, 2003. Neural Engineering is a relatively new
field at the interface between neuroscience and engineering. It encompasses
neural sensing, coding, neural prostheses, neural modeling, neurotechnology, and
neural networks.

A goal of the conference is to give junior professors an opportunity to
participate in the organization of a technical meeting early in their careers.
By bringing new blood in the organizational process it is expected that the
conference will benefit in the short run and the junior faculty will benefit in
the long run. A second goal is to promote excellence in the field of neural
Engineering. This will be accomplished by providing travel support for students,
junior faculty, and post-doctoral researchers, and by having an outstanding key-
note note speaker. The third goal is to promote close interaction between
engineers and scientists. Neuroscientists do not normally attend engineering
meetings and yet work on similar problems. Limited travel support is to be
provided for such scientists to attend the conference.

Neural Engineering is a new field with a great potential for new scientific
discoveries and depends for its future on the careers of bright scientists and
engineers. The conference will contribute to the development of excellence in
the research associated with this emerging field.
