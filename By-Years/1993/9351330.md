9351330 Holden A high-field Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) instrument, with
variable temperature and multi-nuclear capabilities, is being used throughout
the chemistry curriculum. Faculty are developing an innovative curriculum in
which the use of modern instrumentation is crucial for demonstrating the inter-
relationships between the various areas of chemistry. The NMR is being used by
all chemistry majors extensively throughout their careers at the College;
significantly, this exposure begins in the second semester of the freshman year.
Through a program of slowly giving the students more responsibility for NMR
operation, more independence in NMR projects, and the introduction of
increasingly more advanced NMR theory, the program is enabling chemistry
students to become skilled in the use and theory of modern NMR. All chemistry
majors are also undertaking research projects, and many of their experiments
involve the use of the NMR. ***
