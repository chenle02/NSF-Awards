The Antarctic Automatic Weather Station (AAWS) network, first commenced in 1978,
is the most extensive ground meteorological network in the Antarctic,
approaching its 30th year at several of its installations. Its prime focus as a
long term observational record is to measure the near surface weather and
climatology of the Antarctic atmosphere. AWS sites measure air-temperature,
pressure, wind speed and direction at a nominal surface height of 3m. Other
parameters such as relative humidity and snow accumulation may also be measured.
Observational data from the AWS are collected via the DCS Argos system aboard
either NOAA or MetOp polar orbiting satellites and thus made available in near
real time to operational and synoptic weather forecasters.

The surface observations from the AAWS network are important records for recent
climate change and meteorological processes. The surface observations from the
AAWS network are also used operationally, and in the planning of field work. The
surface observations from the AAWS network have been used to check on satellite
and remote sensing observations.
