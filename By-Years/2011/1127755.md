The objective of the AIR proposal "Accelerating Deployment of Novel Alleles in
Cotton" addresses the next essential steps for the translation of information
regarding cotton gene function that is currently being developed under a NSF-PFI
alliance into commercial products by identifying and utilizing genotype-specific
single nucleotide polymorphism DNA markers ('SNPs') to facilitate the rapid and
selective transfer of desirable alleles (traits) into superior cotton cultivars.
The outcomes from the proposed work will strengthen the cotton innovation
ecosystem, empowering a wide range of new ventures by both large enterprises and
smaller enterprises that lack the resources to accomplish such innovation
alone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work will impact the innovation
ecosystem for cotton improvement in both short-term and long-term ways, also
reducing barriers to entry by smaller enterprises both through technology
development and engagement of a potential matching sponsor. The network of
partners in the proposed work will be key to sustained transformation of
enabling resources into economic benefits. Proposed activities are closely tied
to strong training and outreach programs with a successful history of engaging
groups under-represented in the sciences, and which benefit from major
institutional and state commitments.
