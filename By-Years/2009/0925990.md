Under the sponsorship of NSF, DHS, and the European Commission FP7 project, two
workshops were held, in 2006 and 2007, to foster collaboration among U.S., EC,
South Korean, Australian, and Japanese researchers involved in computer security
and privacy. This award funds the third workshop in this series; it is expected
that the workshops will continue to be held. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first
workshops were concerned with security for critical infrastructures. This third
workshop has as its focus security and privacy for an evolving Internet, with
the goal of exposing, among other things, the tradeoffs between these two
topics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An outcome of the workshop series continues to be
fostering working relationships among PIs supported by the EC and U.S. funding
agencies, where related projects are augmented with travel supplements.
