Maine researchers are advancing the state of the art in areas including
landslide prediction, hydrodynamic modelling, fluid-structure interaction and
modelling the electro-chemical properties of organic molecules. Strong,
scientifically compelling investigations have previously been hampered or
stalled by the lack of adequate computational resources.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;This project advances research at the University of Maine in two ways
through the addition of approximately 1000 processing cores in high RAM nodes
along with a growth in CEPH disk storage. It enables research to move forward in
areas such as landslide prediction, coastal modelling, DNA sequencing from
single strands of DNA, and high resolution modeling of the cardiovascular
system. It facilitates an increase in collaboration with the Eastern Regional
Network, the Open Science Grid, the Open Storage Network, and with other
institutions, particularly other EPSCoR sites in the Northeast. Data and code
from this grant is disseminated to the public through tools such as github and
EarthCube. The increase in computational resources as a result of this project
allows opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to engage in state-
of-the-art numerical modeling. By having these new resources to meet the needs
of researchers, previously existing resources are utilized to offer courses for
which there was not previously the capacity. Thus the instrumentation advances
research and also enables the project team to better train the next generation
of scientists and engineers. The research projects facilitated by this cluster
all include plans to distribute, and visualize model output for relevant
stakeholders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
