In the Bay Area, there are currently over 10,000 job openings for electronics
technicians. In addition, the number of electronics technician jobs is projected
to grow at a rate of over 20% within the next ten years. This project aims to
meet local workforce needs by developing a new engineering electronics
technology program. This program will be developed in partnership with local
industry to ensure that graduates of the program have the knowledge, skills, and
competencies needed to meet this critical local workforce need. The new program
has the potential to improve the capacity and quality of the electronics
technician workforce in the Bay Area and to serve as a model for building new
engineering technology programs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will adopt,
adapt, and develop courses covering DC and AC circuits, math for electronics,
electronics test and measurement, schematic entry, custom cabling, printed
circuit board design and manufacturing, soldering and printed circuit board
rework, and battery technology. The program will align with the eleven elements
of high-quality Career Technical Education programs as outlined by the
California Department of Education. The project will include an intensive
student support program and a funded internship and job placement program with
integrated support from industry partners. This project is funded by the
Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of
technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's
economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
