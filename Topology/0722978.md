This is a proposal to fund travel (especially by young Americans) and marginal
subsistence to attend an international conference on algebraic topology at the
Stefan Banach International Mathematical Center in Bedlewo, Poland, June 18-24,
2007. This is planned as a substantial conference, with over 100 participants.
There will be ten plenary talks and three parallel sessions focusing on (A) low
dimensional topology; (B) homotopy theory---conformal algebraic topology and
elliptic cohomology; and (C) manifold topology. One of the intents of the
conference is to stimulate exchange of ideas between these areas.

This conference aims at bringing together groups which have drifted apart.
During its first great flowering---during the first half of the last century---
topology was a unified subject. Around the middle of the century techniques
became specialized and the subject broke up into low-dimensional, geometric, and
algebraic branches. M. M.Postnikov (1927-2004) was one of the great figures from
the second half of the 20th century trying to preserve the unity of the subject.
In this new century we see a resurgence of use of techniques from other
branches. This conference takes this re-convergence as its theme. It also aims
to bring topologists from eastern European and former Soviet Union countries
together with researchers from the United States and Western Europe. More
