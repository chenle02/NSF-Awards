The mechanism by which double stranded DNA viruses translocate DNA into a
preformed virus coat and organize it into a structure that has a density as high
as a DNA crystal is a fascinating, unsolved, biological problem. In
bacteriophage T4, an E. coli lytic virus, a 56 mm long DNA molecule is packaged
within an icosahedral capsid that is approximately 0.115 mm long and 0.085 mm
wide. Genetic and biochemical studies suggest that an ATP-powered DNA packaging
"machine" constituted by the prohead portal protein and two nonstructural
packaging/terminase proteins drives DNA packaging. This project addresses one of
the central questions of the DNA packaging problem, i.e., which component of the
packaging machine consumes the ATP and couples it to DNA translocation? It is
hypothesized that the large terminase subunit gp17, which possesses two
consensus ATP binding sites and exhibits an ATPase activity, is the
translocating ATPase in phage T4. This hypothesis will be tested by a novel
combinatorial mutagenesis paradigm. Mutant libraries consisting of all possible
codon combinations will be constructed at the signature residues of the
consensus ATP binding sites in gp17. The mutations will be transferred into
phage T4 genome by a site-specific marker rescue strategy. A collection of novel
mutants exhibiting null, plaque-size, and temperature sensitive phenotypes will
be generated. Selected mutants will be analyzed by molecular and biochemical
approaches to test the linkage between the putative ATPase centers and DNA
translocation. The predictions of a rotatory model for DNA translocation will
also be tested. These approaches are broadly applicable to analyze functional
sites in other terminases and ATP-triggered biochemical machines, and serve as
an exciting model for training undergraduate and graduate students.
