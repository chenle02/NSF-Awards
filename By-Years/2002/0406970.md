Completing the MEGA Survey of Microlensing in M31

ABSTRACT

AST 0406970 Crotts

Dr. Arlin Crotts, at Columbia University, will use this award to complete the
analysis of the "MEGA" gravitational microlensing survey of stars in M31. The
PI's group has constructed the major hardware for the project, nearly completed
observations totaling roughly 350 nights, developed software, and begun the
analysis of the data. To-date, a number of likely microlensing events have been
found, and the group has developed techniques to distinguish variable stars from
microlensing events.

Broader impact of this work to the astronomical research community will result
from the existence of data on variable stars that are the byproduct of the
microlensing survey. Additionally, the PI will make the image subtraction
package, used in the data analysis, available for general distribution. A
potential medical application of the analysis technique in producing more
sensitive CT-scan detections of small tumors has also been identified, giving
this work a multidisciplinary impact.
