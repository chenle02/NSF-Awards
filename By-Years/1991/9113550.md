This study involves polymers which form glasses. The techniques of absolute
volume dilatometry, Differential Scanning Calorimetry, and Langmuir monolayer
trough studies will be used to investigate glass forming polymers. Dilatometry
and Differential Scanning Calorimetry will be used to examine the bulk glasses.
This will involve isobaric temperature scans as well as volume recovery
isotherms. The same polymers will then be spread on a Langmuir trough to form a
glass-like structure at a free surface. The glass-like monolayers will be
studied using analogous experiments to the bulk studies. Measurements will
include surface area vs time isotherms at constant applied surface pressure and
surface area vs temperature studies at constant applied surface pressure. The
properties of polymer glasses confined to a surface are expected to be useful in
a molecular interpretation of the glassy state.
