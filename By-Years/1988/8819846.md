This award supports US participation in a bilateral US-Taiwan workshop on long-
term air quality changes and their climatic impact. The award will support
travel and per diem expenses of eight American scientists. This proposal was
approved at the December 1988 joint staff meeting of the NSF and the Taiwan
National Science Council. The joint workshop, scheduled for May 1989 in Taiwan,
is intended to serve as the first step in developing a climate background
research observatory, to be established by Taiwan.
