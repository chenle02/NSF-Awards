0104414&lt;br/&gt;Denda&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a three-year
collaborative research project between Professor Mitsunori Denda of Rutgers
University and Professor Julio Florez-Lopez of the University on the Andes in
Venezuela. The project will focus on the assessment of damage to reinforced
concrete structures subject to strong loading. The research team will carry out
analytical, numerical and experimental studies to compare the fracture mechanics
and lumped damage mechanics approaches of assessing cracking in reinforced
concrete structures.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The vulnerability of concrete
structures to strong loading, such as that caused by earthquakes, results in
significant loss of life and property damage. Potential new approaches to
assessing the cracking behavior of reinforced concrete could have far-reaching
implications for building safer structures and mitigating against damages from
earthquakes. This collaboration brings together the efforts of international
laboratories with complementary expertise and research facilities. The project
will directly involve U.S. undergraduate and graduate students in the
international collaboration. &lt;br/&gt;
