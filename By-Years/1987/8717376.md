The proposal is for the study of structure of surfaces using the technique of
reflection electron microscopy. The objective of the study is twofold: to
further develop the technique, which was originally developed by the PI, i.e.,
to better understand the nature of the information provided by reflection
electron microscopy (REM) in terms of atomic structures and defects, and to
apply the technique to several technically interesting materials-crystal
surfaces, III-V compounds, and interfaces. The approach thus is both to apply
the REM technique to materials with known surface structure and defects, and to
explore the potential of this relatively novel technique for providing
information on the surface structure of a variety of interesting materials. The
results should be of both scientific interest, in the development of a new tool
for surface analysis, and of practical interest, in providing information on the
structural features on the surfaces of several technically important materials.
The results should be relevant to both electronic applications, where the
surface properties dominate many device properties, and in the areas of
sintering, catalysis and crystal growth, where surface effects are also critical
in determining the nature of the final material or in its performance.
