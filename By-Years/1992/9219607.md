This research will develop a new global three-dimensional S- wave velocity
model for the upper mantle with lateral resolution of on the order of 1000 km or
less. The new aspect of this project is that it will depart fundamentally from
the approach of using little or no a priori information which underlies all
recent seismological tomographic studies. To better account for the overwhelming
influence of shallow lithospheric velocity heterogeneity, a regionalized initial
model, including topographic, crustal and lithosphere variations will be used in
some of the inversion. The inversions will include simultaneous determination of
source locations and structure using Love and Rayleigh wave spectral data. This
project will promote multi-disciplinary advances in the study of plate
tectonics, mantle dynamics and the geoid, and petrology and geochemistry of the
lithosphere.
