The University of West Georgia ADVANCE IT-Catalyst project has a unique focus on
Master?s institutions that aspire to become more research intensive, and the
impact of that transition on the retention and advancement of STEM women
faculty. Specifically, this project is characterized by an in-depth examination
of institutional policies and practices, and identification of those that may
serve as barriers to tenured women faculty. The project is also expected to
develop novel mechanisms for supporting and expanding the numbers of senior
level STEM and STEM-related women faculty. The outcomes of the University of
West Georgia ADVANCE IT-Catalyst project will be used as the foundation for a
comprehensive strategic plan that will guide the institution toward sustainable
institutional transformation aimed at eliminating the inequities inherent in the
current academic culture. A robust dissemination plan, which includes Human
Resources personnel, will allow the University of West Georgia to articulate
best practices to a wide range of institutions of higher education and
contribute to the knowledge base regarding how women faculty can be supported
and advanced in similar institutional climates.&lt;br/&gt;
