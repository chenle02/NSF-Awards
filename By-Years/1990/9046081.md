This award will provide supplementary support to enable Dr. Daniel D. Weeks to
continue collaborative research with Dr. Tadashi Kifune at the Institute of
Cosmic Ray Research, University of Tokyo, Japan. Dr. Weeks will spend a total of
20 months in Japan conducting research in the area of astrophysics. Data
collected over several years at the Akeno Observatory in Japan will be analyzed
to determine the densities, energies and arrival times of high-energy cosmic
rays. The data will be subjected to periodic time correlation analysis in an
effort to unravel the mysteries of the sources and mechanisms of the cosmic ray
emissions. Dr. Weeks has considerable experience with the Haleakala gamma-Ray
Experiment in Hawaii, and this research collaboration with Dr. Kifune at the
University of Tokyo should prove synergistic.
