The Mechanical Universe and Beyond The Mechanical Universe is a one- year
college-level physics course for national television currently under development
at Caltech and supported by a $5.8 million grant from the Annenberg/CPB Project.
This project has three objectives: (1) to produce videotape adaptations and
print materials based on Beyond The Mechanical Universe for use in high schools,
(2) to conduct regional workshops on the use of the materials, and (3) to plan
dissemination procedures for promoting the increased effective use of the
materials by all teachers. The last objective will utilize results from two
years of field testing and from related special projects. The academic and
television staff of the Caltech project will work closely with a group of
outstanding high school teachers, the Materials Development Council, to continue
the development of the materials. In addition, Council members will conduct
workshops on the use of materials for teachers residing in their local areas.
The videotapes and supportive written materials will be field tested by the
Council members and by the teachers participating in the workshops. The results
of the evaluation will be utilized to modify the materials. The project has
undergone thorough evaluations, and staff have made effective use of the results
in revising the materials. In addition to evaluation done to yield information
for revisions, data was also gathered from teacher and student participants as
to their reactions to the materials. "The strong positive nature of the
responses and the comments received encourages the evaluators and the staff to
believe that what has been begun and what will continue to be accomplished has
the potential to make a major contribution to the strengthening of physics
instruction in the nation's public schools". The project director's training and
experiences, as well as his track record amply qualify him to undertake project
direction responsibilities.
