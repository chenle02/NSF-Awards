The long range goal of this project is to build methods to infer genetic
networks from gene chip or microarray transcription profiles. The methods
developed are also envisioned to enable experimental design. The approach
proposed is a staged one consisting of initially building a low-resolution
dynamic model that fits observed data, and then to improve such a model to
identify hidden variables in order to increase its predictive power. To achieve
that objective, a series of kinetic functions for gene expression will be
developed and made available on the Internet (where they will be peer-reviewed).
These models will be used to generate artificial gene expression data. The data
analysis algorithms will thus be developed and tested using a known in silico
source to assess robustness and areas for further
improvement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
