This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is focused on
research and development of whole hand interaction with computer aided design
(CAD) models. This project incorporates advanced numerical constraint
optimization techniques, tessellated and algebraic collision detection
algorithms, and CyberGlove-based input devices to interactively manipulate the
kinematics of large commercial CAD models. Immersion will develop techniques for
enforcing graphical non-penetration of virtual avatars with CAD models. Grasping
and manipulation-state machines will permit users to naturally grasp and
manipulate CAD parts. Force feedback will be calculated and displayed to users
with CyberForce hardware devices. A client-server infrastructure for offloading
the computationally intense algorithms from desktop workstations will be
developed. All CAD related development would occur in CATIA V5 from Dassault
Systeme SA.

The technology has potential for a broad impact on virtual prototyping of
consumer products and processes. Enabling real-time interaction with a virtual
design will facilitate higher quality products with reduced development costs.
Virtual prototyping of manufacturing processes will reduce laborer stress and
injury by allowing detailed analysis of human factors before a factory work-cell
is developed. Immersion will realize commercial returns from this project
through a combination of increased hardware sales, product revenue, intellectual
property licensing, and contract opportunities.
