ABSTRACT P.I.: Ain Sonin MIT CTS-9413026 Objects, materials or components may be
built up by precise deposition and solidification of molten microdrops under
controlled thermal conditions. This provides a means of true "digital micro-
fabrication" or fabrication of 3D objects or materials in microdrop units under
complete computer control, much in the same way that 2D hard copy is obtained by
ink-jet printing. Shape can in principle be controlled accurately, properties
can be tailored via the choice of melt materials, droplet size and thermal
conditions, and there is no waste. Numerous applications are conceivable: rapid
prototyping, customized parts produced directly under computer control,
materials or parts with continuously varying or heterogeneous properties to meet
special needs, etc. Particularly interesting possibilities arise in electronics
packaging. Customized 3D microcircuits could in principle be fabricated,
complete with simple components like resistors and with protective insulation.
The purpose of the present research is to develop, via experimentation and
theoretical modeling, a fundamental knowledge base for precise dropwise
deposition and solidification at the microscale. This has until recently been a
largely unresearched field. In this one year project, experiments will be
performed which will lead to a basic understanding of the solidification angle
in microscase melt deposition on subcooled targets. Insofar as discoveries
permit, the results will be expressed in terms of universal scaling laws, and
the physical processes controlling solidification will be identified. The second
objective is to provide a theory for instabilities observed in earlier work on
sweep deposition of beads on molten material onto substrate materials.
