The fundamental open problem of inner model theory is to extend the theory to
models satisfying stronger large cardinal hypotheses, with ``There is a
supercompact cardinal" being the most well-known target. This target has
resisted 40 years of effort by set theorists, despite major advances in the late
60's, in 1974-1980, and in 1985-1994. That earlier work gave us a good
understanding of canonical inner models satisfying ``There is a Woodin
cardinal", and even slightly stronger hypotheses, but it fell well short of
superstrong cardinals. Since 1994, progress in this interval has been slow and
incremental, but Steel believes it has opened up a promising line of attack.
This line builds on concepts and methods derived from the evolving merger of
inner model theory and pure descriptive set theory. It centers on the Core Model
Induction technique, and the Mouse Set Conjecture. Steel proposes to work in
this direction.

Work on the set-theoretic foundations of mathematics has revealed a remarkable
phenomenon. It appears that all natural mathematical theories fall into a single
hierarchy, calibrated by the degree to which a commitment to the existence of
large infinite sets is implicit in the theory. Moreover, this degree of
commitment corresponds exactly to the power of the theory to decide questions
about concrete objects, like natural numbers, real numbers, or sets of real
numbers. Set theorists have developed two complementary methods for locating
theories in this hierarchy of logical strength, namely Forcing and Inner Model
Theory. While the basics of Forcing are understood in full generality, the
basics of Inner Model Theory are not, and consequently many problems concerning
the logical strengths of particular foundational theories remain open. Steel
will work to further develop the basics of Inner Model Theory.
