Oscillatory zoning has been observed in crystals of a variety of minerals grown
under a range of conditions - diagenetic, metamorphic, and igneous. Such
undulatory zoning has often been attributed to corresponding, externally imposed
variations in the growth environment. However, it has been shown via
mathematical reaction-transport modeling that oscillation may arise
spontaneously from the kinetics of grain growth coupled to transport of
components in the medium from which the grain grows. The genesis of oscillatory
zoning in pyroxene grown in magmas will be investigated using a combined ion
probe and modeling approach. The zoning profiles contain a wealth of data which
will be interpreted via equations of crystal growth and component migration in
the melt. Model parameters will be constrained via available grain growth
experimental data and the detailed zoning profiles. Developing a model capable
of explaining oscillatory zoning will, in addition, give a more reliable tool
for analyzing common crystallization phenomena. Because zoning of various types
should occur in well defined ranges of growth conditions, the results also can
be used to interpret the geologic record.
