This work falls within the area of graph theory and is closely related to
theoretical computer science and mathematical programming (operations research).
A graph is an abstract mathematical notion used to model networks, such as
telephone networks, transportation networks, or the Internet. Various problems
arise in the study of such networks, and this research project is concerned with
questions of structural nature. Why do some networks possess certain specific
desirable properties, and others do not? A satisfactory answer can have many
applications, ranging from better understanding of underlying structure, to the
design of efficient algorithms, to practical computations. For instance, one
such question answered previously by the investigator settles a question of
George Polya from 1913, solves a problem that baffled theoretical computer
scientists for quarter of a century, and has applications in economics.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central theme of this project is graph structure
theory and its applications to coloring, flows, and algorithms. More
specifically, the investigator will study the structure of graphs pertaining to
the graph minor inclusion and will use those results to attack flow and coloring
problems, as well as the problem of characterizing "Pfaffian graphs." Pfaffian
graphs are of interest because they allow efficient computation of perfect
matchings, and their rich theory is related to other areas. This research will
require the development of new tools in graph structure theory. Improved bounds
will have immediate applications to the design of efficient algorithms.
