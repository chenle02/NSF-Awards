The objective of this project is to demonstrate that standard vapor phase
epitaxial growth techniques can be extended into time/temperature regimes to
allow fabrication of sub 100 A layers with abrupt and/or quasi abrupt
interfaces, with fewer defects and at much lower cost than with MBE. The
material to be used for this study will be silicon, due to the high growth rates
of silicon VPE, the difficulty of silicon MBE, and the lack of any alternate
growth technique. Wafers will be heated rapidly while in a gas flow using DC arc
and flash lamps. Cooling will be done using direct contact with a "cool" plate.
Two growth chemistries will be explored: pyrolysis of silane which can be done
at temperatures close to 800 C for very abrupt junction formation, and reduction
of chlorosilanes for the highest quality material and potentially, completely
selective growth. Films will be characterized chemically, electrically, and
microscopically. As final proof of material quality transistors will be
fabricated and characterized with attention being paid to a ballistic bipolar
device.
