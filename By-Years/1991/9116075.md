The proposed research is concerned with meteorological aplications of
polarimetrically agile radar sensing, that is, determining properties of
collections of scatterers (e.g. hydrometeors) such as size, shape, and
orientation distributions from measured scattering or Mueller polarization
matrices. It is argued that processing of fully polarimetric data should be done
before time averages are made and correlations formed so that physical insight,
based on vector wave scattering, can be focused on identifying an optimal
combination of polarization parameters. The purpose of this work is to develop,
test, and apply new polarimetric data processing algorithms in both, coherent
and incoherent scattering regimes. The algorithms are aimed at 1) improving the
accuracy of existing estimators of precipitation; 2) providing new "signatures"
of cloud and precipitation phenomena e.g. rain vs. hail discrimination; 3)
improving conceptual understanding and ranges of applicability of the coherent
and incoherent polarimetric scattering regimes (scattering matrix vs. Mueller
matrix description).
