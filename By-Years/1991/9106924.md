The University of California - Los Angeles will coordinate a multidisciplinary
workshop to bring together, for the very first time, biologists, mathematicians,
engineers, geologists, and computer animation specialists who work with three-
dimensional pattern formation and models of aggregation. Examples of three-
dimensional aggregations include fish schools, insect swarms, and molecules
within a crystal. Aggregation is a pervasive behavioral phenomenon within most
animal taxa. Gaining knowledge about density, cohesion, and spacing and
movements of individuals within three-dimensional groups has been hampered by
the visual complexity of these aggregations and the lack of tools and techniques
to analyze interactions within them. Three- dimensional aggregations are also of
interest in several non-biological disciplines as well. The workshop will bring
together thirty investigators from various disci- plines and computer
specialists to present information on their individual research interests, and
to explore whether tools and techniques from other fields can be used to develop
new cross-disciplinary collaboration to advance the study of aggregations.
Results of the workshop will be broadly available and form the foundation for
future research.
