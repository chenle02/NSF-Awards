9504537 Liverance This award supports a 12-month Japan Society for the Promotion
of Science Postdoctoral Fellowship for Dr. Eric Liverance of the Mathematics
Department at the University of Southern California. This fellowship opportunity
will enable Dr. Liverance to begin a collaborative research effort with Dr.
Tetsuji Shioda of the Mathematics Department at Rikkyo University. The
investigators propose to study possible applications of Dr. Shioda's work on
Mordell-Weil lattices of elliptic surfaces. The main research question is he
size of the Galois representation associated to the Mordell-Weil lattice, and
possible applications to elliptic curves. As a postdoctoral fellow, Dr.
Liverance will have the opportunity to become familiar with research techniques
and methodology invented essentially single-handedly by Dr. Shioda for the
elliptic surfaces. Therefore, this proposal fulfills the objectives of the
Program in its exchange and transfer of scientific knowledge through an
international collaboration. ***
