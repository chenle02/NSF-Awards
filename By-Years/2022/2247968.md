In classical physics, order does not matter: for example, if you measure
momentum and then measure position, you get the same answer as if you do the
measurements in the opposite order. In quantum mechanics, this is wrong: if you
measure momentum before position, you can get a different answer than if you do
the measurements the other way around; this is a manifestation of the famous
Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Mathematicians call this phenomenon – that
order matters – “noncommutativity.” Noncommutative systems are much harder to
understand than classical ones. The bulk of this project, which aims to better
understand noncommutative systems, concerns the so-called “universal coefficient
theorem problem.” On a very rough level, it asks whether it is true that any
(reasonable) noncommutative system can be replaced by a classical one, such that
doing computations in the classical system gets the same results. Other parts of
the project concern direct applications of the same ideas to approximation
problems in the study of geometry and symmetry. The project will also involve
both undergraduate and graduate students in research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project intends to use approximation methods to study the so-called universal
coefficient theorem (UCT) problem, which asks if any separable nuclear operator
algebra (potentially highly noncommutative) is equivalent on the level of
K-theory to a commutative one. The recent impressive successes in the Elliott
program to classify simple nuclear C*-algebras have thrown this problem into
sharp relief: it is now the only extra ingredient needed to get the best
possible classification result. The approximation methods should be useful in
other areas: two projects building on these ideas study approximation properties
of word hyperbolic groups and finite-dimensional models for elliptic
differential operators on manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
