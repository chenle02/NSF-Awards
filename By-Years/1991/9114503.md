The investigator continues his studies of quantization of several differential
equations. particularly the Ablowitz-Ladik equation and a form of discrete
nonlinear Schrodinger equation called the discrete self-trapping equation. The
equations arise in describing the behavior of a variety of nonlinear systems,
many coming from a biological context. He uses these results to enhance
understanding of several applications: comparisons of quantum theories for the
two equations, especially focussing on the issue of soliton binding energies,
analysis of spectral data for a molecular crystal, and modelling the growth
dynamics of microtubule. A better understanding of how cells behave is a central
theme in biology. This project uses mathematical tools to consider several
related aspects of cell biology and also concerns itself with the tools
themselves. Hence the investigator studies the structure of microtubule (a kind
of "protein crystal"), undertakes a more general analysis of molecular crystals,
and develops the theory of certain kinds of differential equations that describe
nonlinear phenomena. A microtubule is an arrangement of tubulin in a tube-like
shape. Tubulin is a protein that plays a key role in the ability of cells to
hold their shape and to move. So a better understanding of the growth of
microtubule could lead to a clearer picture of cell development; this is
important in areas as diverse as the development of fetuses and the growth of
tumors.
