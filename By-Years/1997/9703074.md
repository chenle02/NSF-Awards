The steadily decreasing cost of wireless mobile communications and its growing
deployment have resulted in its increased popularity. The trend towards software
radio base-station, one such instance, opens up a new avenue of possibilities
for innovative baseband signal processing technologies in wireless
communications which in turn, introduces new challenges in academic research due
to the complex and interdisciplinary nature of practical systems. The
development of future high performance wireless systems requires the integration
of technological advances that span a broad area of communications and signal
processing subjects. This research involves the development and design of a
wireless communication laboratory, and the implementation of a high performance
antenna array CMDA wireless network. Focussing on critical issues like
complexity and robustness, the investigator seeks theoretically sound and
algorithmically feasible solutions to the multipath fading problem unique to
wireless mobile systems. Key to the new system is a self-adaptive CDMA receiver
that is capable of tracking environmental variations without the use of training
sequences. The novel methodologies developed here take advantage of both spatial
and temporal diversities in a unified fashion, thereby allowing optimum
performance to be realized without introducing undue complexity.
