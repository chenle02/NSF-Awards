The Center for Analysis and Prediction of Storms (CAPS) at the University of
Oklahoma proposes to continue the development of techniques for the numerical
prediction of small-scale weather, especially aimed at substantially increasing
the accuracy and reliability of warnings of hazardous weather associated with
thunderstorms. The program will focus on: 1) the development and testing of a
new, easily modified prediction model aimed at being highly portable among
different styles of computer architectures and sophisticated in its physical and
numerical formulations; and 2) the research and development reqired to
assimilate new storm- scale observational data into such a prediction model. To
complement these goals will be a variety of related studies designed to provide
insight into storm predictability, promote the development of data management
and visualization tools, and evaluate strategies for the use of massively
parallel computers in solving complex fluid flow problems.
