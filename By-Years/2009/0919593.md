Computer Science (31) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses a major
difficulty in teaching digital forensics, which is the lack of realistic data
sets for student use. Such data sets typically include disk images, log files
and network packet dumps. The project develops corpora of authentic forensic
data for use in undergraduate education and research involving computer
forensics. It addresses the issue of how to get realistic data into the hands of
students without breaking laws or compromising personal data. Prior sponsored
work by the PIs resulted in a large corpus of real data obtained from physical
devices purchased on the secondary market worldwide. Much of these data contain
either copyrighted material or information that could compromise the privacy of
individuals. The project seeks to develop data sets that are cleansed of
inappropriate information but contain rich and realistic content for use in the
classroom. The data sets are combined with accompanying educational materials to
help guide both students and faculty in learning forensic analysis techniques
and tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project provides a rapid dissemination of
these resources to institutions with computer forensic programs. The proposed
workshops benefit educators interested in using the corpora and educational
materials. The dissemination plan includes distribution of DVDs as well as
providing web-based materials. It has a potential to improve the overall quality
of digital forensics instruction and to build a forensics education community
through the common usage of this data.
