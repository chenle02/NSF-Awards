This Presidential Young Investigator Award is for support of Mary Beckman at
the Ohio State University. Her research is aimed at understanding and modeling
the prosodic patterns which organize speech into coherent units of sound.
Earlier work, including most exisitng speech synthesis systems and all speech
recognition systems, is based on linguistic theories from the 1960s, which
posited only a single type of organizational unit, the phonetic segment, which
constituted the informational primitives. More recently, however, linguists have
recognized that the prosodic patterns of intonation and stress organize speech
into units of various sizes. A computational model based on those theories would
take advantage of the way prosodic patterns encode a hierarchy of phonological
words and phrases. Such a model would make constructive use of the variation in
spectral patterning that accrues from a segment's position in the organizational
structure to recover the higher-level informational structure. The significance
of this work is that it should yield a computational model for timing patterns
that will be implemented in an articulatory synthesis program and ultimately
will be incorporated into an automatic speech recognition system, thus bringing
a new set of tools to bear on a difficult problem area.
