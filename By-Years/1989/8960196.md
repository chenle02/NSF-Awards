Although methanol fueled diesels are an attractive means of meeting the 1991
diesel particulate standards, they are not yet practical because the ignition
delay is too long under typical operating conditions. On board production is the
ignition enhancer dimethyl ether (DME) from methanol, followed by aspiration of
the DME into the cylinder has been shown to reduce significantly the ignition
delay. However, no information is available on the mechanism by which DME
concentration on ignition delay. Development of DME enhanced, methanol fueled
compression ignition engines is best carried out with a fundamental
understanding of the combustion process. It is proposed to develop a mechanistic
model of DME combustion, validate it against existing ignition delay data, and
merge the DME model with existing models of methanol combustion. The insights
and predictions derived from the model will be used to guide experiments aimed
first at determining the effect of DME concentration on ignition delay, and
ultimately at determining the optimal strategies for DME enhancement of methanol
combustion.
