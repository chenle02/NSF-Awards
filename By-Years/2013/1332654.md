Today's computer systems are more powerful than ever, but have become so complex
that it is now difficult for programmers to produce high-performance software.
Even slight changes in programs or differences in a user's system can cause
dramatic slowdowns. Currently, there is no way to guarantee that a program will
perform as well as it did during testing. This situation makes it extremely
difficult to track down the sources of inefficiencies or repair them. The result
is reduced power and computational efficiency on servers, and a degraded user
experience on client platforms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research aims to
deliver reliable performance on modern computer systems. By introducing
randomness into the way a computer runs programs, a reliably performant system
will significantly reduce the probability that any small change will have a
large impact on performance. For instance, consider a cache miss caused by a
conflict. With standard caches, repeated access to the same elements would
always cause misses, degrading performance. In a randomized cache or with
randomized object placement, it would be very unlikely for the same line to be
repeatedly evicted. The investigators are designing and evaluating the use of
both randomized algorithms in software and hardware, separately and in
combination, to remedy the numerous sources of pathological behavior in modern
systems. The result will enable performance-portable applications that are
immune to unfortunate interactions with microprocessor components.
