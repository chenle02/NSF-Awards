This action provides funds for a project that will examine alternative
approaches for a survey of immigrant scientists and engineers and will include
estimates of the costs and benefits of each approach. This work is needed before
finalizing the design for the survey of immigrants which will be an integral
part of STPDS for the 1990's.
