With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Kennesaw State University will
acquire a UV-VIS scanning spectrometer. Research will focus on the following
studies: a) synthesis and characterization of novel monodisperse
oligo(p-phenylene vinylene)s as models for poly(p-phenylene vinylene)s; and b)
quantification of polymeric aluminum in water treatment coagulants.

Scanning UV-VIS spectroscopy is a workhouse in a modern chemical laboratory. It
is critical for the study of chemical reactions, as it enables the detection of
ultraviolet or visible light-absorbing molecules. These studies will have an
impact in a variety of areas, especially environmental sciences and materials
chemistry.
