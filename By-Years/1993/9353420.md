Abstract ESI 93-53420 Shirley Hill University of Missouri-Kansas City Kansas
City, MO Enhancing the Teacher's Role in Assessment (EXTRA) Project Overview:
This is a 3-year project of the University of Missouri-Kansas City School of
Education in collaboration with the Coalition for Missouri Mathematics, the
Missouri Council of Teachers of Mathematics, the Missouri Department of
Education, the University of Missouri Video Network, the Mid-Continent Regional
Educational Laboratory, and 6 school districts. The aim of the project is to
make mathematics teachers (grades 7-12) knowledgeable about, and skillful in,
the uses of modern assessment practices, and to integrate such practices
successfully into their teaching. To these ends, 40 teachers from 6 ethnically
diverse school districts will be selected to participate in a 3-year
professional development program consisting of two sequential academic year
institutes and summer workshops. Communication between participants and staff
will be facilitated by a state-wide fiber optic communication network. An
outreach program will begin in Summer 2, when the original 40 participants will
begin to help project staff run institutes for some 120 teachers around the
State, again relying heavily on telecommunications. By Year 3, it is expected
that some 200 teachers around the State will be implementing modern assessment
practices in their classrooms. By way of dissemination, the project will
organize working groups of mathematics educators from around the State to
produce both a handbook and a television course on modern assessment in
mathematics. From its beginning, the project will be represented by both
participants and staff on the State's new testing committee.
