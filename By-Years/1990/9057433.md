This project is devoted to the analyses and developments of various biological
and physical phenomena using mathematical models. Topology and nonlinear
differential equations will be used in conjunction with problems as diverse as
DNA structure, oscillating cells in the heart and nervous systems, and charge-
density waves in quasi-one-dimensional metals.
