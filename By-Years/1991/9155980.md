A study-group based learning system is being introduced into the general
chemistry course at the University of Connecticut. The large lecture classes are
broken into study groups of 3-5 students. Faculty, graduate assistants, and
undergraduates act as monitors of study groups, which meet once weekly. Study
group members responsible for assigned problems present and explain their
solution. Each person also submits a quiz question similar to his or her
assigned problem. After modification by the monitor, one of these questions are
used as a future quiz question for the class. Another feature of the study
groups is the distribution of a worksheet which the study groups work on
together. The worksheet requires the students to solve problems without benefit
of text, thereby simulating examination conditions.
