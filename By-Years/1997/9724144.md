Demski 97-24144 The evolution of the brain is marked by an increase in the size
and complexity of the front-most portion of the brain, the telencephalon, as
well as the expansion and increased integration of sensory systems. This pattern
is apparent in several lines of organisms. Investigating and comparing how
different organisms accomplish this provides insight into the evolution of the
human brain as well as information about the different ways systems can process
high volumes of complex information. This project examines the evolution of
visual and auditory systems. Neuroanatomical studies describe the connections of
visual and auditory systems and how these systems converge and are integrated in
the forebrain. Physiological studies indicate how this convergence results in
complex patterns of neural activity related to ongoing behavior. Results of this
research add to the understanding of the evolution of the brain and to the
understanding of how the brain compares information from multiple sources to
arrive at an integrated representation of the external world.
