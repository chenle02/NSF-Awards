The International Symposium on Bioinformatics Research and Applications (ISBRA)
is in its 9th year. This year's meeting will be held at the University of North
Carolina at Charlotte, an emerging research university that has invested
substantially in the development of research and educational programs in
Bioinformatics since 2004. The International Symposium on Bioinformatics
Research and Applications (ISBRA) will contribute to the rapid dissemination of
latest research results and to foster the formation of collaborations between
researchers with the multidisciplinary expertise required to analyze the
enormous datasets accumulated in modern biological research. The conference
content will encompass diverse topics from comparative and functional genomics,
to systems biology, to population biology and genetics. ISBRA will provide
important formative experiences to graduate students and post-doctoral scholars,
helping them to become future leaders in the field. In 2013, when other popular
bioinformatics conferences are being held outside the US, ISBRA will provide a
valuable opportunity for resource-limited U.S.-based students and PIs to present
research and interact with colleagues.
