This is an award to provide support for purchase of Lanthanum- Hexaboride
electron source for the Department of Civil Engineering's environmental scanning
electron microscope. The source is expected to enhance the resolution and
contrast of images in the study of biocorrosion of ferrous metals, control of
the stability of immobilized contaminants, study of creep in moist rock salt
that comprises subsurface geological strata that are planned for use in storage
of wastes, and for remediation of radiocolloids. This proposal was submitted in
accord with conditions listed in the publication Research Equipment Grant
Program Announcement and Guidelines (NSF 90-146). The aquisition of this
equipment is expected to improve the efficiency of the research being conducted,
results of which are expected to be utilized in engineering design of waste
management processes and systems.
