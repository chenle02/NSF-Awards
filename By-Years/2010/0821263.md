A grant has been awarded to the University of Georgia through its Institute of
Bioinformatics to acquire a high powered multiprocessor computer and a
corresponding large disk storage capacity. This proposed acquisition will
contribute to, and substantially improve, the computing power available to UGA's
biologists, computational and experimental. It will facilitate research at the
interface of computational, physical and biological sciences which falls into
five areas: (a) analysis and modeling of non-coding RNA genes, (b) analysis and
modeling of protein and carbohydrate structures, (c) mining of eukaryotic and
prokaryotic genomes, (d) gene expression data analysis, and (e) modeling of
metabolic pathways and regulatory networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The acquisition
will enrich the research and educational experience of bioinformatics and
computational biology students on campus, including 75 graduate students and 52
postdocs in the 18 participating laboratories. The investigators will partner
with UGA?s Center for Undergraduate Research Opportunities and the NSF-funded
Peach State Louis Stokes Minority&lt;br/&gt;Program, to engage undergraduates,
particularly underrepresented minorities, in bioinformatics research, so that
they will be drawn into research that makes use of this acquisition. At the
secondary education level, the Institute will work with the Mathematics and
Science Education Department in to offer summer workshops for A.P. Biology
teachers. The idea of using web services and web tools to study bioinformatics
should be a natural way to get these students,&lt;br/&gt;who have grown up with
the Internet, interested in biology and science research.
