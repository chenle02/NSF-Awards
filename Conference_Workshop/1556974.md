This proposal is to fund a conference on isoperimetric problems on manifolds
with density to take place at Williams College in Williamstown, MA on February
6, 2016. This conference will bring together experts in the field with newer
researchers, graduate students and undergraduates interested in this area. The
conference will provide the opportunity for researchers at all levels to
interact, learn from one another and network. The slides from the talks will be
posted on the website so a broader audience can reap the benefits. Every effort
will be made to encourage and support women and underrepresented minority
participation.

The field of manifolds with density has seen a dramatic increase of interest in
recent years. Manifolds with density were fundamental in the proof of the
Geometrization Conjecture and new advances have continued to push the field
forward. This conference will allow researcher to set a roadmap for further
critical developments. The conference website is at
