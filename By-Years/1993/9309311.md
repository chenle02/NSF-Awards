Adaptive strategies for the optimal trace-and-replay debugging of parallel and
sequential programs will be developed. As parallel machines become larger and
processors become faster, the increasing tracing bottleneck is preventing the
development of sophisticated trace-based tools necessary for debugging. Our
objectives to alleviate this problem are twofold. First, we will explore the
theoretical lower bounds on what must be traced to provide execution replay. We
will investigate which messages, shared-memory references, or local variable
accesses need be traced to replay any part of the execution in a bounded amount
of time. By bounding replay time, we provide a fixed response time to debugging
queries, even for large-scale or long-running programs. Second, we will develop
optimal or near-optimal strategies that adapt to the execution being debugged.
Our algorithms make run-time tracing decisions to adapt to what the execution
will be doing next, and keep traces optimally small. ***
