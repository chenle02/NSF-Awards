It is proposed to study the quasi-liquid layer (QLL) that occurs on the surface
of ice just below the melting temperature. This very basic surface melting
phenomenon remains very imperfectly under- stood but is of considerable
importance owing to the dominance of the water/ice system in nature. The
extensive use of the freez- ing/melting process in the chemical industry adds an
element of significant technological importance.
