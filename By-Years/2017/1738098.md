This project, being led by Prof. Amar Flood, provides an opportunity for
domestic graduate students to participate in a Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) on
June 10-11, 2017 at Holderness College in New Hampshire. This project aims to
promote the involvement and collaboration of young scientists in the field of
molecular switches and motors. A better fundamental understanding on how to
control the movement on molecular length-scales could impact other fields such
as drug delivery, molecule-scale electronics, and robotics.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry
Program and the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms B Program of the NSF
Division of Chemistry support the participation of about 30 domestic students
(including women and members of underrepresented groups) in the GRS on
"Artificial Molecular Switches and Motors". This GRS aims to encourage students
to get involved in discussions in scientific meetings, to provide an environment
for students to establish informal networks with their peers, and to forge life-
long working relationships. In addition, students have the opportunity to
develop leadership and organization skills through the involvement in the
implementation and planning of the GRS.
