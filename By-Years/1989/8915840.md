This award provides one-half the funds needed for the acquisition of an
alternating field demagnetizer system to be installed and operated in the
Department of Geology and Planetary Science at the University of Pittsburgh. The
University is committed to providing the remaining funds. The demagnetizer
system is needed in the Paleomagnetic Research Laboratory at Pittsburgh where it
will be used in determining the direction and intensity of the remanent
magnetism of rock, mineral and other naturally magnetized samples. Alternating
field demagnetization is a basic technique used to isolate the meaningful
remanent magnetic signal left after the sample has been magnetically cleaned or
demagnetized. The laboratory at Pittsburgh is engaged in dating classic hominid
fossil sites in Africa with the magnetostratigraphic method and in the
application of paleomagnetism to the interpretation of global tectonics.
