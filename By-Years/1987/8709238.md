The commercial usage of linear chain polymers has greatly outdistanced the
theoretical understanding of their interactions and orientations. A program of
research will be undertaken to study the conformation and crystal packing of
helical polymers. The goal is to determine the minimum energy states resulting
from intra- and inter-chain interactions, and to study the effects of disorder
about these ground states. This grant is made under the Research Opportunities
for Women Program.
