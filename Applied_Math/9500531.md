DMS-9500531 Fonseca The general objective of this project is the study of
variational problems in connection with material instabilities. The phenomema
addressed will include phase transitions, metastable equilibrium states and the
presence of dislocations and other defects in crystals, the onset of
microstructure and the creation of concentrations, interaction between fracture
and damage, and the behavior and defects of liquid crystals. Their study escapes
the framework of classical mathematical theories, and it concentrates on very
contemporary research issues in material science. The success of this program
will require manipulation of recently developed mathematical tools, the
introduction of new ones, and it may have a considerable impact in the advance
of industry and technology, clarifying problems in material sciences and smart
materials. The areas involved in this program are Continuum Mechanics, Geometric
Measure Theory, Partial Differential Equations, Thermoelastodynamics, and the
Calculus of Variations. Among the underlying mathematical questions, one can
find constrained variational problems, evolution of phase boundaries,
interfacial energies, relaxation techniques, and generalized measure-valued
solutions.
