Hugh R. Slotten, Dissertation Student; Topic: "A History of the Coast Survey of
the United States in the Nineteenth Century" Scholars have generally
acknowledged that the Coast Survey of the US under the command of Alexander
Dallas Bache from 1843 to 1867 was one of the most powerful institutions
supporting science in the antebellum period. A comprehensive and analytic
history of the Coast Survey, however, has not yet been written. The Coast Survey
was first authorized in 1807 as a temporary agency of the federal government
that would survey the country's coastlines in the interests of commerce and
navigation. In the period preceding Bache's tenure as superintendent, the Coast
Survey attained only minor significance; but under Bache's command, the Coast
Survey grew to become the most influential scientific institution of the
antebellum period. Because geographical (primarily geophysical) research fit
best into the range of the Survey's mandate, this kind of science expanded under
Coast Survey patronage. the Coast Survey also served a unique educational
function in this period, training civilians and military officers in scientific
methods. Above all, however, Bache's Coast Survey functioned as a vital center
for the growth and professionalization of the emerging scientific community and
set a precedent for future public policy towards the financing of scientific
research.
