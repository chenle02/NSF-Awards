This project is funded as a Phase I award under the 1987 Small Business
Innovation Research Program Solicitation. The purpose of this research is to
begin initial development of new analytical tools which will be used to
determine the range of technologies coexisting in each of the four-digit U.S.
manufacturing industries and the effect on production costs as lower cost
technologies replace more costly ones. The differences in costs associated with
each of the technologies in an industry, and the sensitivity of each to changes
in input prices, along with other information developed in the study will be
useful per se and in predicting the pace at which investment will be undertaken
in each industry. The effect of such investment on U.S. and foreign markets will
also be evaluated. To accomplish these ends, the research will result in a set
of microeconomic tools applicable at the individual industry level.
