Support is sought acquire computer equipment to enable the Department of Earth
and Atmospheric Sciences at Saint Louis University (SLU) to expand the
accessibility and number of products available from UNIDATA for both teaching
and research. The proposal requests a UNIX server and several UNIX workstations.
The additional equipment would expand student access to UNIX-based workstations
with X-windows capabilities. Presently only one UNIX terminal is available and
it is five years old. Moving to a UNIX environment would allow an expanded use
of several very capable UNIX-based UNIDATA software packages. PC-based (OS/2)
software packages are used extensively at SLU for many teaching and research
applications. However, the upgrade path for PC-based UNIDATA software appears
limited and the use of PC-based application packages will be phased out in favor
of the UNIX platforms. The requested equipment upgrade will provide us the
opportunity to more fully integrate UNIDATA software into the SLU curriculum and
expand student experience with new technology and software.
