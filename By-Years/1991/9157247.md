This is a Presidential Young Investigator Award. The long-term goal of Dr.
Brodl's research is to understand the cell biology of higher plant responses to
environmental stress. The model system for investigation is the heat shock
response of the aleurone layer of barley grains. The cells of this tissue are
normally dedicated to protein secretion; however, heat shock dramatically
redirects their cellular activities. The synthesis of secretory proteins is
abruptly arrested when the tissue is subjected to heat shock, yet the synthesis
of nonsecretory proteins continues. This is accomplished by the selective
destabilization of otherwise stable secretory protein mRNAs. Heat shock also
causes the loss of endoplasmic reticulum lamellar structures upon which
secretory protein mRNAs are translated; only small fragments of ER remain. This
appears to provide the discriminatory mechanism for selectively stopping the
synthesis of secretory proteins, as nonsecretory protein mRNAs are not
translated by ER-bound ribosomes. Dr. Brodl will continue and extend his studies
of the molecular and cellular basis for these heat shock-induced events. This
research program should provide insights into the cell biology of ER, as well as
reveal mechanisms for regulating protein expression during heat shock. These
efforts will ultimately build a better understanding of how plants respond and
adapt to stress.
