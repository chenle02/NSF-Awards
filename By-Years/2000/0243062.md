This NSF project seeks to make measurements of nucleon structure&lt;br/&gt;using
polarized gamma rays and polarized nucleons. The polarized&lt;br/&gt;gamma rays
are created at LEGS by back scattering polarized laser&lt;br/&gt;light from the
high energy electrons circulating in the storage ring&lt;br/&gt;of the National
Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National&lt;br/&gt;Laboratory. In back
scattering the polarization is unchanged. By&lt;br/&gt;detecting the scattered
electron, the gamma ray energy is "tagged",&lt;br/&gt;and measurements at all
energies can be made simultaneously. The&lt;br/&gt;polarized nucleons come from
producing targets of frozen HD in a&lt;br/&gt;high magnetic field. Polarized H,
D or both can be produced in&lt;br/&gt;targets of a size suitable for nuclear
physics experiments and with&lt;br/&gt;relaxation times of two weeks in the case
of H and longer for D. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These double polarization
experiments allow measurements of&lt;br/&gt;pion-photo-production amplitudes
that have not been previously&lt;br/&gt;measured. Such are important to
completely describe the&lt;br/&gt;gamma-nucleon interaction. The difference in
the absorption cross&lt;br/&gt;sections for gamma and nucleon spins parallel and
anti-parallel are&lt;br/&gt;sensitive to the spin structure of the nucleon. We
will be able to&lt;br/&gt;test the major part of the Gerasimov-Drell-Hearn Sum
Rule and make&lt;br/&gt;direct determinations of nucleon spin polarizabilities.
Due to the&lt;br/&gt;large energy range required to test the sum rule no
single&lt;br/&gt;laboratory can accomplish the task. However, as the gamma
energies&lt;br/&gt;in the LEGS case range from photo-production threshold to
beyond the&lt;br/&gt;delta resonance, the major region of sensitivity is
covered.&lt;br/&gt;
