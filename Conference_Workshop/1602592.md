A conference on Statistical Challenges in Modern Astronomy VI will be held at
Carnegie-Mellon University, June 6-10, 2016. (See http://www.scma6.org/.)
Astronomical data are continuously being gathered from surveys that are
increasingly ambitious in scope, and astronomers face a wide range of challenges
when transforming this information into scientific conclusions. This conference
brings together statisticians and astronomers to work on problems in astronomy
involving large amounts of data. It has been held every five years since 1991.

The conference Statistical Challenges in Modern Astronomy VI will be held at
Carnegie-Mellon University, June 6-10, 2016. Over 15 years the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (SDSS) has collected 100 terabytes data from hundreds of millions of
stars and galaxies, as well as a million supermassive black holes; by contrast,
the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), planned for completion by 2022, will
gather 15 terabytes of data per night over its ten-year life. The full
scientific potential of these surveys will be realized not only with ingenuity,
but also with novel methods of data analysis. Experts in statistics and machine
learning can make crucial contributions both to these specific domains, and to
general methodological development for Big Data applications. This conference is
a major effort to increase the interaction of astronomers and data scientists
and to build the next generation of scientists to bridge the gap between these
disciplines.
