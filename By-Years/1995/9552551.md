9552551 Fraknoi The Astronomical Society of the Pacific requests $1,317,701 over
three years to implement its California pilot project to six sites around the
country. Each site will establish local, self- sustaining coalitions linking
science centers, astronomical institutions, school districts, and community
groups. These coalitions will, with training and support from the national
Project ASTRO staff, identify, link, and support the astronomer/teacher partners
in their area to use the excitement of astronomy to improve the teaching and
learning of science in elementary and middle school. A second strand of the
project will use the Project ASTRO materials and techniques to train astronomers
and teachers at national meetings outside the six sites to set up individual
ASTRO partnerships on their own. Materials to be produced include a: Project
ASTRO Coalition Manual; Training Manual; update to the Resource Notebook for the
Teaching of Astronomy. Target audiences are students in grades 4-9.
