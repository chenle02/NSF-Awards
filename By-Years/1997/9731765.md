This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program
supports an annual workshop in `InOrganometallic` Chemistry. The participants
will be from academia, industry, and governmental research organizations. The
goals of the workshop are to facilitate communication among researchers in these
three sectors and to foster exchange of new ideas earlier than is possible
through formal publication. The format of the workshop is designed to encourage
maximum participation by all attendees, and the plan for selecting attendees
will ensure broad-based participation, particularly by new investigators. The
topics discussed will be at the interfaces between inorganic chemistry and
organic chemistry, biological chemistry, and materials chemistry.
