The focus of the project is the observation of the dynamics of subaqueous
volcaniclastic sedimentation from eruption-fed density currents, and the
characteristics of the resulting deposits. Since the processes in question are
almost impossible to observe in the field, an alternative approach will be
employed here: the use of laboratory tanks to perform experiments that reproduce
the deposits. The experiments have been designed to model as accurately as
possible three settings: a) lacustrine turbidites of the Taupo volcano, New
Zealand, b) submarine hyaloclastites consisting of limu shards and c) eruption-
fed density currents of the style of Pahvant Butte. The results will be used to
extend existing numerical models of turbidity currents to the case of 2-D and
3-D currents laden with vesiculated grains of variable size and density as well
as hot water. The numerical models will provide new predictive tools for the
study of volcaniclastic stratigraphy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research
represents a collaborative effort between Gary Parker of the University of
Minnesota (turbidity currents) and James White of the University of Otago, New
Zealand (subaqueous volcaniclastic deposits).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
