The Marine Sciences Program at the University of North Carolina will acquire
several items of laboratory instrumentation to be placed in an inventory of
shared use equipment. This equipment is maintained for use by all investigators
and will especially benefit NSF-sponsored research projects by increasing the
capabilities of the institution to support research and engineering activities.
The instrumentation includes: -a research quality autoclave for sterilizing
scientific apparatus, and -a scintillation counter for measuring trace amounts
of radio-active elements used in a variety of experiments. The instrumentation
described above will increase the capability of the organization to support
several diverse NSF-sponsored research and engineering projects that are
underway and proposed.
