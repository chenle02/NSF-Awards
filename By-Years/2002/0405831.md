In this research, the investigator will extend the recent robust optimization
methodology to general optimization problems, including nonlinear programs with
uncertain equality constraints. The extension provides a solid foundation for
rigorously treating uncertain parameters in general optimization problems where
reasonable parameter estimates exist and the magnitude of uncertain variations
is moderate. The proposed research will focus on studying and developing
suitable optimization strategies, efficient numerical algorithms and convenient
software tools to provide guidelines for treating parameter uncertainties in a
general constrained optimization setting.

In the design or control of a complex system such as a spacecraft, there often
exist physical quantities (parameters) whose values cannot always be precisely
measured. In critical applications, such uncertainties must be carefully
handled, while attempting to achieve as good a performance as possible, to
prevent system failures under the worst-case scenario. This project will study
and develop rigorous mathematical formulations, computer algorithms and software
tools to provide guidelines for treating parameter uncertainties. The research
findings will be potentially applicable to a wide range of fields such as space
exploration.
