This award is for support of a program to establish a long-term monitoring
network of accumulation stakes at the South Pole. The scientific objectives are
to determine the long-term history of the "undisturbed" net accumulation regime
and to assess the "station effect" upon the spatial distribution and magnitude
of net accumulation at the South Pole. Thirteen shallow (&lt; 12m) cores will be
collected to examine accumulation rate variability since 1955. The goal is to
leave in place an optimally designed array of poles, the measurement of which
can be incorporated into the routine scientific observation program at South
Pole Station.
