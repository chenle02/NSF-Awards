Many stochastic optimization problems involve more than one player, often
having competing interests. For example, one player's reward can be the other
player's cost, known as a two-person zero-sum game. At a formal level, one can
similarly model so called robust optimization problems, where an
active/intelligent player optimizes a reward under the worst case scenario
(chosen by a passive/uninterested player, thought of as nature). The project
focuses on such zero-sum games and robust optimization problems where the
existence of equilibria with pure strategies (which means that players do not
introduce additional randomness) is not expected. The modeling and existence of
a value for zero-sum games with mixed strategies is studied. It is expected
that, despite a similar analytic representation, genuine zero-sum games and
robust optimization problems behave differently in the presence of mixed
strategies. These mathematical models arise as descriptions of problems in which
one must make decisions in the face of uncertainty; their solutions reveal how
to choose among alternatives. Applications occur in areas of engineering as well
as finance and economics. Another direction concerns a problem in Financial
Economics: optimal investment strategies with high-watermark performance fees.
Students are included in the work of the project.

The project focuses on the modeling and analysis of games without Isaacs
conditions. In a genuine zero-sum game with two active players, modeling of
mixed strategies is non-trivial. One way is to allow for actions (including
mixing) to be changed over discrete time grids and then attempt to find a value
for the game. It appears that the cases when both players are restricted or not
to the same time grid lead to different results. For a robust optimization
problem (where the uninterested player chooses open-loop controls), allowing the
only intelligent player to randomize may lead to a better value function.
Special attention is given to the dynamic programming analysis using
probabilistic modifications of Perron's method. A second topic of the project
studies a general two-dimensional reflected diffusion model of optimal
investment with performance fees. The feedback representation of the optimal
control plays a prominent role. Students are included in the work of the
project.
