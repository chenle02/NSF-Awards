The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop autonomous, ocean-going cargo
vessels powered by a combination of wind and solar power. These vessels will
enable the provision of cheaper and more frequent sea freight service to
isolated communities, such as those in coastal Alaska. The technology seeks to
the lower operating costs by removing liquid or solid fuels or onboard crew,
enabling the vessels to be more readily right-sized to particular routes and
markets. The project may also have positive impacts on the environment by
eliminating fossil fuel emissions and reducing marine noise impacts on wildlife,
such as marine mammals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project will integrate existing robotic and energy
capture technologies with newly developed wind/solar combined energy
optimization software and autonomous contingency management. A vessel using both
the wind and sun for propulsion has a difficult energy optimization problem,
both on a minute-to-minute basis but also on the scale of an entire voyage; This
project will build a model for solving this intermitancy problem given specific
vessel performance characteristics and weather predictions. Likewise, this
project will build a framework for addressing the autonomous contingency
management problem for uncrewed marine surface vehicles given a particular set
of vehicle and system characteristics. The focus will be on ship-to-shore
communications contingencies because those are the most serious for the
contemplated target system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
