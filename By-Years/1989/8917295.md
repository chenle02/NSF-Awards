The Funds will be used to drill two holes into platform carbonates on the Great
Bahama Bank. This drilling will take place from a jack-up platform situated in 5
to 10 m of water on the platform margin and interior and will penetrate between
500 and 1000 m of sediments. The rationale for drilling these holes is two fold.
First, recent discoveries about the subsurface, Neogene, seismic stratigraphy of
Great Bahama Bank have drastically changed long standing ideas concerning the
evolution of the Bahamas. Drilling will provide a test of these ideas as well as
examining relationships between pulses of progradation and relative fluctuations
of sea level. Second, drilling the holes will allow an unique opportunity to
examine the chemistry of formation fluids from deep within the platform which
will provide an indication of the diagenetic reactions taking place.
