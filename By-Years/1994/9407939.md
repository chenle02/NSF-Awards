9407939 Talamantes Several peptides originally identified in the hypothalamus
are also present in the placenta. One of these peptides is growth hormone-
releasing hormone. The factors that regulate expression of the growth hormone-
releasing hormone gene in the placenta and its function in the placenta are not
understood. This project will address two basic questions: (1) what are some of
the structural features in the mouse growth hormone-releasing hormone gene that
regulate its expression in the placenta? and (2) does placental growth hormone-
releasing hormone regulate the production of a group of hormones in the placenta
which are known to play important roles in maintaining a successful pregnancy?
The latter hormones include the placental lactogens. These questions are a
logical extension of the very limited research that has been carried out in this
field so far, and the information gained from this project will provide a good
basis for future work in an area that could prove to be very important to
understanding placental physiology. ***
