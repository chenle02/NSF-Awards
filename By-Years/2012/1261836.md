The Advanced Laboratory for Visual Anthropology (ALVA) is a new facility that
puts the tools of digital cinema production into the hands of researchers. This
project will utilize ALVA to further advances in anthropological imaging. This
project will enable researchers to undertake visual anthropological projects in
collaboration with planetarium science centers, textbook publishers and cultural
resources managers. The ALVA facility has the potential to enhance research in
visual anthropology through 4K cinema production. The project continues this
enhancement, bringing anthropological content into full-dome planetarium
environment.

If successfully completed, this project plans to translate the results of
scientific research into the medium of digital cinema enabling transmission of
these results across multiple platforms including streaming over the Internet
and projection onto full-dome planetarium screens. It has the potential to
create digital cinema resources for educators and students. The infrastructure
and technologies enhanced through this project may enable further dissemination
of the results of anthropological research through digital cinema and
technological channels.
