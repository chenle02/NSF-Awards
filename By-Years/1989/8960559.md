Because of innovations in the biotechnology industry,protein sequence data is
becoming available at an even increasing rate. Since structural information
obtained from X-ray crystallography or NMR analysis is obtained much more
slowly, there are many proteins critical to ongoing research for which amino
acid sequences are known but atomic coordinates are available. The research
proposed here is designed to develop methods to determine the molecular
structure of a protein based only on its amino acid sequence and its similarity
to other proteins for which Cartesian coordinates are known. These methods will
then be incorporated into a computer program which will be sold as a commercial
product.***//
