Dr. Dwight A. Sweigart, Department of Chemistry, Brown University, is supported
by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program of the Chemistry
Division for the study of chemical reactions effected by the coordination of the
manganese tricarbonyl moiety to aromatic ligands and for the development of
systems that contain a redox switch to activate or deactivate remote metal
centers. The ability of coordinated manganese tricarbonyl fragments to activate
aromatic ligands will be exploited to prepare a wide range of monoarenes and
heterocycles. Examples include functionalized centropolyindan hydrocarbons and
stereoselectively derivatized prochiral arenes. Arene ligand exchange will be
extended to bimetallic complexes of conjugated polyarenes containing a variety
of metals. Concentrating on hydroquinone and catechol complexes, the redox
properties of the metals will be evaluated. The studies will converge into the
design of systems in which metal-metal interactions can be electrochemically
switched on or off. Drawing on the reactivity of the manganese tricarbonyl
fragment, reductive insertion reactions into sulfur-carbon bonds will be
developed, with an emphasis on processes related to HDN and HDS. This project
will concentrate on developing several applications for manganese metal
complexes. The first of these aims at the synthesis of selected types of organic
molecules and at the use of manganese containing species to break carbon-sulfur
bonds in thiophenes. This study is significant because the removal of thiophenic
materials is important to the desulfurization of fossil fuels and manganese is
especially attractive for this application because of its low toxicity and
relative abundance. Another major activity is the development of systems in
which the transfer of an electron to or from a metal atom will control the
behavior of a second metal center. This will have relevance to several areas
including the control of conductivity and optical properties in metal containing
materials.
