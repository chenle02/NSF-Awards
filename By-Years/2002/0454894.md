This proposal addresses the need for monitoring preciptable water vapor (PWV) in
the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions of Siberia using the Global Positioning System
(GPS) and meteorological observations collected in near-real time over the
Northeast Asia GPS Deformation Array (NEDA), which currently does not include
Siberia. Smoothed observations of PWV over Siberia are important for calibration
and validation of global water vapor data sets and global numerical climate
models.
