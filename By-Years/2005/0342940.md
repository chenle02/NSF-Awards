This CAREER award focuses on research and education integrating material
characterization and systems analyses for Civil Systems Design. An innovative,
polymeric fiber cement-based material, which exhibits pseudo strain hardening in
tension, is studied for use in seismic-resistant structures. Energy dissipation
in this engineered material is examined in its combination with traditional
materials of concrete and post-tensioned steel. This combination of materials is
applied to an innovative bridge substructure system, providing energy
dissipation and reduced residual deflections for seismic loading. Material
characterization is conducted using advanced experimental techniques and
nonlinear finite element simulation. Systems analyses are performed to study the
potential of using this advanced material in new seismic-resistant structures.
&lt;br/&gt;Courses are developed to enhance knowledge and skills for material
characterization and systems analysis. This coursework facilitates and motivates
creativity in the invention and implementation of innovative materials for civil
infrastructure needs. Students are exposed to advanced experimental and computer
simulation tools. Real-world projects in civil systems courses give exposure to
complex decision processes and offer opportunities to implement creative
solutions using innovative materials. &lt;br/&gt; To promote creativity and
inspire imagination, the civil engineering community must be a diverse
population. One approach to attract diversity is to promote awareness of
engineering through activities for pre-college students. Hands-on laboratory
workshops on Civil Systems Design will be developed to demonstrate the
excitement and social relevance of modern civil systems to pre-college
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
