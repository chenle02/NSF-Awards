The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Resesarch (SBIR)
Phase II project will be in helping to close the homework gap in the United
States. The homework gap has been a long simmering problem where 12 â€“ 17 million
K-12 students do not have reliable home internet to complete digital homework.
Students that could benefit the most from learning applications that require
home access are disproportionately from lower-income, rural, and at-risk
minority populations. While new broadband funding initiatives may make
incremental improvements to the situation, millions of students in low-income
and rural areas continue to be left behind. This project aims to use new
advances in web technologies and intelligent agents to provide a software
solution that will enable any student to participate in a complete digital
homework workflow including interactive lessons, videos, and robust teacher
feedback even when they have unreliable or no access to the internet.
Unconnected adult learners will also benefit from the project as technical
skills training including computer programming will be supported. This solution
will assist in filling the key technical skill gaps in the American
workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase II project will
advance a new homework management system that will support digital learning with
a consistent experience for learners that are online, offline, or in degraded
network conditions and on any available devices. Through an innovative offline-
first distributed architecture that solves complex problems around state
divergence and conflict resolution, user identity, system integrations and
offline content management, this system attempts to bring equitable access to
learners who have historically had limited or no access to at-home digital
homework solutions. The system will utilize intelligence at the edge to
facilitate effective, research-based, pedagogical approaches to improve learning
outcomes and minimize teacher overhead. Pilot programs and user feedback
studies, along with custom-built learning model simulators will be used to
evaluate and iteratively refine the system's efficacy. The goal of this
project's research and development will be the release of a production-ready,
scalable homework management system that makes positive progress toward bridging
the homework gap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
