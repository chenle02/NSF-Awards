The principal investigator will study eigenfunctions of the Laplacian operator
on complete manifolds. When the space is compact and there is a differentiable
metric, sharp bounds on the Hausdorff measure of the nodal set will be computed.
The decay rate of these eigenfunctions will be studied when the space is not
compact. Techniques will be developed to handle the general geometry and
topology which exists for such manifolds at infinity. The eigenfunctions of the
Laplacian operator correspond to the dominant frequencies one might hear if one
could hear a surface. If an object in flight emits sound, some of the shape of
the object can be recovered by careful analysis of these sound waves. Key to the
understanding of such emissions is an analysis of the dominant wave fronts. The
principal investigator will build on earlier mathematical work on these problems
which applied only to very special cases.
