Kukavica&lt;br/&gt;1615239&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The investigator studies the
properties of solutions of equations that describe the motion of fluids. He
considers the Navier-Stokes system, which is the principal model for motion of a
viscous incompressible fluid, the Prandtl equations (a boundary-layer
approximation for Navier-Stokes), the Euler equations (roughly speaking, Navier-
Stokes with zero viscosity), and the primitive equations, which represent large-
scale motion of the ocean and atmosphere. He analyzes fluid-structure
interactions between a fluid and an elastic solid, other problems involving free
boundaries, the limiting behavior of viscous fluids in the presence of
boundaries as the viscosity goes to zero, and the regularity and long-time
behavior of solutions. Results expand our understanding of fluid flow problems
arising in geosciences, engineering, and other areas, especially in connection
with control and numerical methods. Graduate students are involved in the work
of the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The main goal of the project is the study
of the qualitative properties and regularity of solutions of equations arising
in fluid dynamics. While the primary focus is placed on the Navier-Stokes
equations, the investigator considers also related models such as the Euler
system, Prandtl equations, and the primitive equations of the ocean and the
atmosphere. A special emphasis is systems involving a fluid (compressible or
incompressible) and an elastic solid. Here the main aim is to investigate the
local and global well-posedness of solutions as well as their large-time
behavior when they exist. The investigator also studies the vanishing viscosity
problem in domains with boundaries, using the properties of the local
asymptotics. The main goal here is to better understand the solutions of the
Prandtl equation and to identify their role in the vanishing viscosity limit.
The last part of the project concerns the local properties of solutions of the
partial differential equations modeling fluids, in particular their analytic and
Gevrey regularity, unique continuation, and their long time behavior. Graduate
students are involved in the work of the project.
