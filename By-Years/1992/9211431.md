The velocity of a shear wave is directly related to the stiffness and density of
the geotechnical material through which the wave propagates. It is possible to
correlate material properties of a soil deposit to the measured shear wave
velocity; and accurate shear wave velocity profiles are recognized as providing
essential data on which to evaluate the dynamic response of soil deposits, in
particular to strong earthquake ground shaking. Existing methods for measuring
shear wave velocities through soil deposits, such as the steady-state Rayleigh
wave method (SSRW) and the spectral-analysis-of-surface-waves method (SASW),
have their limitations. An objective of this project is to investigate at the
Treasure Island geotechnical experimentation site the capability of a new
method, referred to as the controlled-source spectral- analysis-of-surface-waves
(CSSASW), which combines features of the SSRW and SASW methods. Treasure Island,
which belongs to the U.S. Navy, is a man-made island adjacent to Yerba Buena
Island in San Francisco Bay. The Navy is making a site on this island available
for basic research into the dynamic response of soil deposits to earthquake-
induced strong ground motions, and for general geotechnical engineering
experiments - such as this project to investigate the use of the CSSASW method
for site characterization. It is expected that this experiment will also provide
additional valuable subsurface data at this Treasure Island site which will
contribute to the use of this site as a national facility for geotechnical
engineering research.
