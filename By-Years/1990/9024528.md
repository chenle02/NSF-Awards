This project will develop coherent structures in nonlinear problems and obtain
solutions to equations arising in physical problems. The techniques to be
employed include asymptotic and perturbation analysis, numerical computation,
and exact solutions. Especially important in the realm of exact analysis is the
method of inverse scattering transform. This work has generic features and,
consequently, broad applicability. Examples of applications include wave
propagation in surface and internal waves, self focussing and soliton
propagation in nonlinear optics, exact reductions of Einstein's vacuum
equations, and aspects on numerical computation.
