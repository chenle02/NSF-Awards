This award is to fund a 2-day workshop that will examine and identify areas in
which NSF could have an impact on attracting and retaining women in academic
careers in the computing sciences. The workshop will address issues such as
professional support and development, pipeline issues, academic faculty careers,
visibility of women in the field, and partnerships between academia and
industry. It is anticipated that several initiatives and recommendations for
programs will emanate from the workshop. Dr. Susan Conry will be organizing a
workshop directed towards identifying how to extend the scope of opportunities
for women to do research and teaching in the academic computing sciences. The
workshop will be organized around five or six major topic areas. The workshop is
expected to produce for the CISE Directorate, a set of recommended programs and
initiatives.
