This project investigates the design and implementation algorithms for
nonlinear optimization. The research focuses on the solution of large problems,
and has two broad objectives. The first is to develop a new algorithm for
solving large and unstructured unconstrained problems. This work is motivated by
the need of solving large and nonsparse problems efficiently. The new algorithm
uses ideas from both Newton methods and variable metric updating, and is tested
on large problems arising in weather forecasting. The second objective is to
study efficient techniques for handling inequality constraints occurring in
nonlinear programming. This research focuses on large problems, and techniques
are designed to be useful in that case. The use of an ellipsoidal-type method is
explored. This approach has the advantage of leading readily into a sequence of
equality constrained subproblems which can be solved by existing software. An
alternative approach, which consists of extending the primal-dual method of
linear programming to the nonlinear case, is also explored. The algorithm is
posed in the framework of trust region methods, and its relationship with
sequential quadratic programming is fully exploited. The two new approaches for
handling constraints are tested on a set of large problems, and the treatment of
ill-conditioning receives careful consideration.
