The Computer Museum in Boston, MA is requesting a SGER of $49,000 to support
preliminary research into the use of virtual reality as a tool for informal
science. Using a virtual reality environment of the human cell, they will test
to determined: 1) if people gain a physical understanding of the human cell,
including a sense of scale, the shape and location of elements, and the physical
relationship between elements, and 2) if people gain an understanding of the
concept of a system by interacting in the virtual world of the human cell. The
PI will be David Greschler, Exhibit Developer at the Museum. He has developed
two major exhibits at the Museum, has worked at the MIT Media Laboratory, and
has taught educational software design at the Harvard Graduate School of
Education. Eben Gay will be co-PI and will have oversight for the software
development of the virtual reality. He has been Principal Engineer at Digital
Equipment Corporation since 1980 and has been building virtual realities since
1982.
