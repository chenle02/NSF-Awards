By exploiting the new JPEG2000 standard for image data, the project builds a
flexible novel infrastructure by which images can both act as a mini-database
about their content, and at the same time be part of a broader image database
about their general subject. While the focus of this project is on biodiversity
image libraries, the technology does not depend on the subject of the images.
Because JPEG2000 supports complex structure of embedded image metadata and
multiple images in the same JPEG file, highly structured information about the
image content and origin conveniently remains with the image file itself and is
available to anyone who acquires the image. Such a person or software agent can
add more annotation to the image and circulate it further on the Internet.
Roaming metadata encriched images (RMEIs) are used to automate some of the tasks
involved in managing the curation of large image libraries. The project
addresses image curation needs, and enhances the functionality, of the USDA
PLANTS National Database, an important national plant information resource. By
supporting the rapid collation of distributed annotation of plant images by both
experts and the public, the project provides a facility to enhance early
detection and response to invasive plants. A series of continuing workshops for
a group of school teachers who are already accomplished nature photographers
will produce models for image-centric biodiversity K12 instruction.
