This I-Corps team proposes the development of a real-time traffic congestion
detection system from surveillance videos. The proposed technology for detecting
traffic congestion involves two major components: (a) vehicle detection and
tracking; and (b) event classification. The research team will use computer
vision techniques for detecting vehicles in single frames. By analyzing
consecutive frames, vehicle speed and relative locations will be estimated. For
the classification of events, the team will use their expertise in graph kernels
and machine learning. A sequence of consecutive frames can be used to create a
graph, where the nodes represent vehicles labeled with local features, such as
speed and location. Neighboring nodes in the graph are connected by edges
labeled with the distance between their respective vehicles. A fast kernel
function for graphs will be developed and used by a binary classifier which will
be trained for the task of recognizing traffic congestion. As an extension, a
multi-class classifier can also be trained to distinguish different types of
traffic events, such as, high, moderate, or low traffic congestion, accident, or
normal traffic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed product is a great opportunity
for transforming state-of-the-art computational techniques into new technologies
that can directly have societal and commercial impacts. A real time traffic
congestion detection system has as their primary targets government agencies and
departments across the nation. With a real time detector of congestion, one will
be able to track simultaneously hundreds or thousands of cameras at the same
time, discovering incidents that can enhance traffic management. Decision makers
can use the proposed product for dynamic traffic assignment, incident discovery,
and improved management of evacuation systems. Society may be impacted as a
whole with savings in commuting time and delay costs. This product can also be
used for developing web applications or apps for mobile devices, bringing real
time traffic information to motorists.
