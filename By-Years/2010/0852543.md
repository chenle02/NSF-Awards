Abstract&lt;br/&gt;OCI 0852543&lt;br/&gt;Garth Gibson, Principal
Investigator&lt;br/&gt;Carnegie Mellon University&lt;br/&gt;SGER: Investigating
Degrading Failure Recovery in Large Scale, Heavily Utilized Disk Storage
Systems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SGER proposal responds to an
interest from NARA in File Systems and I/O research, specifically, in methods
and factors contributing to fault tolerant, highly scalable, sustained I/O for
very large disk based systems. The P.I. had predicted in a workshop the dangers
of increasing disk sizes in ever larger disk storage
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to better understand the implication of
this speculation, CMU will explore the implications on performance and
reliability in large scale disk storage systems of the increasing size of
magnetic disks, causing the periods of degraded performance during failure
recovery to grow, and the scaling of stored data capacity, causing the total
number of components that might fail to grow. The P.I. and his team will explore
different strategies for trading off capacity overhead, performance overhead and
data reliability, for example, slower recovery in more redundant data, faster
recovery with more performance degradation, and novel uses of redundancy for
point solutions of specific failure modes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
