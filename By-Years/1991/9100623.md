This project extends and tests mathematical models of the growth and decline of
organizations. The main focus is explain- ing why so many different types of
organizations develop. Factors include population density, environmental
stability, market concentration, and niche width. Boundaries around or-
ganizations and social networks within and among groups of organizations are the
two main factors affecting changes in social structure. Models to be developed
and tested sown how changes in boundaries affect the number and diversity of or-
ganizations in a community, and how interactions among popula- tions of
organizations depend upon niche overlap. The work aims to increase understanding
of how new organizations get created, why they vary in form, and how
organizational variation affects market concentration. Applications include
market positioning and siting decisions.//
