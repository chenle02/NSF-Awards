This award provides funds to establish a Research Experiences for Undergraduates
Site in the Microbiology Department of the University of Texas at Austin. The
program is designed to introduce gifted undergraduates into on-going, productive
Cell and Molecular Biology research programs. Participants will be actively
recruited nationwide, but emphasis will be given to undergraduates who would not
otherwise have the opportunity for original research, especially women and
minority students. Minority students will be encouraged to apply by visiting
Texas colleges and universities with high minority enrollments, and at least 40%
of the positions will be allocated to minority students. Participants will have
access to well-funded and equipped labs in which the research covers both
prokaryotic and eucaryotic systems and deals with DNA replication, transcripion,
development processes, immunobiology, oncogenesis, protein transport, and
membrane function. Participants will work individually with faculty mentors but
have access to all faculty through seminars and informal discussions. The three
women (one hispanic) on the Graduate faculty will serve as role models to
encourage the female and minority participants. Follow-up procedures will
promote interest in research careers. UT Austin has already made a strong
commitment to this program, including organizing a Pilot Program in 1988 and
funding recruiting trips plus room, board, and fees for minority participants.
