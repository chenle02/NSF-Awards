Title: Plio-Pleistocene tephra correlations between the Turkana Basin and
Arabian Sea: Constraining Africa climate-evolution hypotheses. The early
evolution of hominids may be tied to fluctuations of the climate in Africa, and
the PIs wish to examine the relationship between climate and hominid evolution
in the Turkana Basin of East Africa. The ages of hominid fossils are estimated
by dating volcanic ash in the same sediments that contain the fossils. Volcanic
ashes of similar age are also present in sediment cores recovered by the Ocean
Drilling Program in the Arabian Sea. These deep sea cores also contain
microfissils that record precisely dated climate history dating back to the
earliest Turkana Basin hominid fossils. The PIs plan to correlate the ashes in
the deep sea cores with an existing data set of ashes in the Turkana Basin, and
to therefore give more precise ages of the hominid fossils, and to correlate
changes in hominid evolution with changes in climate.
