9352199 Lincoln An Inductively Coupled Argon Plasma Spectrometer is being
introduced as a versatile instrument for a variety of analytical tasks, and a
shatter box rock grinder is being used to facilitate sample preparation.
Quantitative analysis is being introduced into the geology curriculum in a
series of courses, beginning with the high-enrollment Introductory Geology
course and culminating in upper-level courses and independent research projects.
The Introductory Geology students, predominantly non-majors, are devoting three
weeks to projects on water quality, in many cases working cooperatively with
City Water Department personnel on real problems in the community. All geology
majors are learning principles of instrumental analysis and rock-sample
preparation in the Petrology and Optical Mineralogy course. They are applying
this to a group project; each year the class will work with a different suite of
rocks. Students in Groundwater Geology are having opportunities for more
involved cooperation with the City Water Department. Students in Geochemistry
and in Igneous and Metamorphic Petrology are engaged in individual research
projects. These experiences are encouraging students to conduct independent
research projects and submit theses dealing with rock and water chemistry. ***
