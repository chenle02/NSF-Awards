Solving many of the most important and troubling problems of human society will
require the ability to interpret the very large, detailed, and highly
informative sets of data collected from billions of people around the world.
These data come from sources such as cell phone records, insurance records,
medical records, social media, and web traffic. However, these data contain
identifying information that, if made available to the public, could be
dangerous or embarrassing to the people involved. It is important, therefore, to
find ways that scientists can conduct the research necessary to learn about what
causes society’s ills and how to fix them without violating anyone’s individual
privacy. This project builds open source, community-based software tools that
will let scientists safely access, analyze, and share sensitive datasets, with
mathematical guarantees for the privacy of the individuals who may be
represented in those datasets. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is based on the
mathematical theory of differential privacy, which changes the data in a way
that hides individual-level information. Even though the individual-level
information is hidden, differential privacy still allows researchers to study
the population-level patterns in the data. The project builds user-friendly,
publicly available interactive differential privacy tools that can integrate
with widely used data repositories. These tools can be effectively employed even
by those without expertise in differential privacy. The project also creates new
statistical methods that ensure that the tools are useful for social,
behavioral, and economic research. The infrastructure created by this project
will allow private companies, government agencies, and other organizations to
share data with researchers while remaining confident that privacy violations
cannot occur.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
