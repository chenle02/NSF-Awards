Cal Poly University - Pomona plans to increase STEM graduation rate from 28% to
48% to match the rate for the rest of campus. The program has three components:
1) course development in three gateway courses that are prerequisites for
further STEM study, 2) enhanced first year experiences including an innovative
orientation course, and 3) apprenticeship opportunities for students.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gateway courses in physics, calculus and chemistry are
being revised to incorporate interactive teaching, inquiry-based learning and
assignments that reveal the societal benefits of STEM fields. The revised
freshman orientation course promotes community, engages students in problem-
solving activities, introduces college survival skills and stimulates interest
in STEM careers. Students are provided apprenticeship opportunities to build
community and establish relationships with other students and faculty. Cal Poly
- Pomona has a diverse student body and produces the largest number of
underrepresented engineers and computer scientists in the state. Successful
strategies will be replicated at other California State Universities.
