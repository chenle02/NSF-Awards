The PI plans to work on problems in harmonic analysis linked by the interplay
among local Tb Theorems, singular integral estimates, Poisson kernel estimates,
square function estimates, and the regularity of boundaries. The goals of the
proposed research are:&lt;br/&gt;1) to develop and apply ``local" Tb theorems to
study the regularity of free boundaries and the solvability of elliptic boundary
value problems; &lt;br/&gt;2) to develop techniques to study the solvability of
boundary value problems for complex elliptic equations, or more generally, for
strongly elliptic systems, with bounded measurable coefficients;&lt;br/&gt;3) to
investigate the relationships among boundedness of layer potentials, properties
of harmonic measure, and uniform rectifiability;&lt;br/&gt;4) to continue to
develop the theory of Hardy spaces adapted to a second order divergence form
elliptic operator; in particular, this work may be viewed as an attempt to find
a sharp solution to the Kato square root problem ``below the critical
exponent."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project lies within the field of harmonic
analysis and its application to, and interaction with, geometric measure theory
and the theory of elliptic partial differential equations and systems. Roughly
speaking, in harmonic analysis one investigates properties of functions and
``operators" (i.e., mappings which transform one function into another) by
decomposing them into smaller, constituent pieces, which are easier to
understand, and then reassembling the pieces. The name itself arose by analogy
to the decomposition of a musical sound into its various frequency components
(``harmonics"). Geometric measure theory involves the study of the relationship
between geometric properties of sets, and their ``measures" (the latter are
generalizations of the notions of length, area, and volume). Partial
differential equations and systems of elliptic type describe a wide variety of
phenomena in the real world, including electrostatics, and steady-state
temperature distributions and elastic deformations. In the last decade the
interplay between these different subfields of mathematics has turned out to be
a fertile ground for investigation, with much exciting work remaining to be
done. Progress on the problems to be considered would in all likelihood open up
further avenues of investigation in these areas. All such progress will be
disseminated by the PI via lectures at conferences, seminars and graduate
courses, and via electronic preprints posted on his website and on the ArXiv.
The PI plans to involve two postdocs and two graduate students in work related
to this project.
