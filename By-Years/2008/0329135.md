This project develops a general methodology for generating and evaluating
confidence intervals/bands for Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves, a
common tool for comparing classification models. Usually two or more ROC curves
are compared in one of three ways: by simple visual inspection without
confidence assessments, by focusing on one particular point of the ROC curve and
generating confidence intervals around that point, or by comparing the areas
under the curves. Little work has studied the soundness of ROC confidence
intervals, or their use for comparing entire curves.

This project consists of six main activities: (1) surveying existing techniques
for generating confidence intervals/bands for ROC curves, (2) creating new
evaluation metrics that are more appropriate for confidence bands, (3)
developing a general framework for generating and evaluating intervals/bands,
(4) developing new techniques for creating and optimizing bands, (5) creating a
suite of benchmark problems, and (6) evaluating the intervals/bands through
large-scale empirical studies to analyze and to characterize their expected
containment.

The work will lead to a new suite of benchmarks for these types of problems, as
well as a general framework for evaluating confidence bands for ROC curves,
enabling future researchers to perform similar studies in a well-understood
setting. More importantly, the knowledge and techniques that this project
produces will affect the many fields, such as medicine, that regularly use ROC
analysis. Finally, this project will produce open-source toolkits, so that ROC
studies will become much easier.
