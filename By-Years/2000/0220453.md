This program provides scholarships to talented, low-income students majoring in
computer science, mathematics, engineering, and engineering technology. Special
consideration for scholarships is given to increase the minorities and women's
participation in these fields. Through the CSEMS Academy at the college,
students in the program receive individualized support and peer mentoring, and
have opportunities to participate in internships with local industries such as
Verizon and IBM, and with other colleges with which the Bronx Community College
has an established relationship. The Academy also provides a physical place at
the college where students can form study groups; receive tutoring and other
services under the guidance of faculty members. Workshops on interviewing and
job search and presentations by alumni from high-technology industry are also
conducted by the CSEMS Academy in order to help students find employment with
local industries once they complete their program. The transfer office at the
college assists students who are interested to transfer to four-year schools to
complete their studies.
