This proposal requests funds to purchase equipment to support research in
molecular and cell biology at Washington State University. The items of
equipment requested are a tabletop ultracentrifuge and a phosphoimager. This
equipment will support the research programs of five scientists representing
four departments (Biochemistry, Genetics and Cell Biology, Botany, and
Microbiology). The research interests of the user group are diverse, including
membrane biochemistry, the biochemical and molecular basis for carbon and
nitrogen allocation in plants, protein-DNA interactions regulating
transcriptional expression of mammalian genes, mRNA degradation in eukaryotic
cells, and genetic regulation of binding of the bacterium C. jejuni, a common
cause of diarrheal disease, to the intestinal tract.
