The long term goal is to understand gene regulation during development in
plants. The area on which the PI has chosen to focus his efforts is regulation
of transcription, specially the initiation step. Assembly of the transcription
complex is the first step at which regulation can occur. In order to evaluate
events during the assembly process it was first necessary to isolate and purify
several plant transcription factors (TFs), then to characterize them (wheat
TFIIA and TFIID), and to establish a heterologous wheat/human in vitro
transcription system using the cauliflower mosaic (CaMV) 35S promoter.
Objectives for the next funding period are: 1. Continued biochemical
characterization of wheat TFIIA 2. Continued biochemical characterization of
wheat TFIID 3. Enzymology of transcription using wheat TFIIA AND wheat TFIID
