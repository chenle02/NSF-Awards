During the period 1800-1600 Ma, the North American continent grew by at least
20%. Amalgamation of these Proterozoic rocks into continental crust could have
been accomplished in a number of ways. This project will investigate the nature,
timing and significance of tectonic blocks of early Proterozoic age in northern
and central New Mexico. Major shear zones separating the blocks will be a focus
of research to specify the timing, sense of displacement, and pressure-
temperature conditions across boundaries. Results are expected to clarify how
these tectonic blocks were assembled, and with other data, to help develop a
model of proterozoic accretion for North America.
