DMS-9500999 Siu Siu will investigate several related problems in complex
manifold theory and Kaehler geometry. These include hyperbolicity problems,
effective freeness and very ampleness, general Bochner type formula and
geometric superrigidity, and global nondeformability of compact hermitian
symmetric manifolds. Several complex variables arose at the beginning of the
century as a natural outgrowth of studies of functions of one complex variable.
It became clear early on that the theory differed widely from it predecessor.
The underlying geometry was far more difficult to grasp and the function theory
had far more affinity with partial differential operators of first order. It
thus grew as a hybrid subject combining deep characteristics of differential
geometry and differential equations. Many of the fundamental structures were
defined in the last three decades. Current studies still concentrate on
understanding these basic mathematical forms.
