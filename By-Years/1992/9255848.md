Twenty one Laboratory Directors representing the Nation's institutions that
enroll large numbers of students in introductory chemistry courses intended for
science and engineering majors are meeting for a three day conference to address
the challenges associated with providing a modern general chemistry laboratory
experience for upwards of 1000 students per term. The objectives of the
conference are: (1) to outline several laboratory curricula based on materials,
reactitivy, and environmental issues and develop detailed plans for implementing
them in large, multi-section courses. (2) to address management issues and
delivery systems. (3) to consider the responsibilities and role of teaching
assistants in implementing the new curricula, and problems associated with
language, cultural differences, and attitudes toward education arising from the
international background of the teaching assistants. (4) to explore the
possibilities for microscale quantitative determinations and the relative
balance between the use of instruments and learning basic techniques.
