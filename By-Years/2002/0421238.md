The objective of this research is the fabrication of a variety of nano-scale
structures and the preparation of transmission electron microscopy samples using
focused ion beam (FIB) to support several active research projects at the
University of South Florida. Among the projects supported are directed assembly
of carbon nanotube devices, the study of microstructure and fracture in thin
films, the preparation and characterization of conducting semi-transparent
inorganic and polymeric films, the investigation of reliability issues in
interconnect layers, the fabrication and characterization of nanostructured hard
coatings, the fabrication of light harvesting "rectenna" array prototypes, the
fabrication of magnetic nanostructures, and the fabrication RF MEMS Switch
prototypes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The proposed instrument will
be installed in USF's new Nanotechnology building. This facility will provide
all campus and the surrounding community with nanofabrication, materials
processing, and analytical facilities. Due to its inherent versatility the
proposed FIB tool will add a significant range of capabilities to USF's
materials research infrastructure, enabling massively cross-disciplinary
experiments previously difficult or impossible. This instrument will bring
together several of the most significant materials research groups at USF's
Engineering and Physics departments, facilitating experiments on new and
innovative materials and device structures. The students of these groups and
across campus will benefit from having a state-of-the-art research tool on their
hands, allowing them to perform cutting edge research, and be involved in
interdisciplinary experiments with their peers from other
departments.&lt;br/&gt;
