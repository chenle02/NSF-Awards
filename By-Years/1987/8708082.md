Grid generation, redistribution and adaptive refinement have emerged as
important current aspects of computational engineering. With the rapid evolution
of advanced supercomputers, large-scale 2-D and 3-D problems can now be
addressed with appropriate grid resolution. To use the associated finite element
or finite difference methods reliably and efficiently, we need improved grid-
generation schemes and algorithms for grid redistribution and refinement. This
research project is directed towards this problem of grid optimization using
both redistribution and refinement strategies. The problem is approached from
the viewpoint of nonlinear programming problems in optimization theory. The
focus of the research will be the development of approximate methods and
algorithms as well as techniques for acceleration of the grid optimization
procedures including parallel processing on subdomains. The key technical issues
are: grid redistribution and optimization, local adaptive grid refinement and
remeshing schemes for moving grids. The institutional support is adequate and
the investigation is a senior researcher with significant contributions in
computational engineering.
