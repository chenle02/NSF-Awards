This grant will fund 30 travel awards to enable young statisticians and more
senior statisticians who have no support to attend the 48th session of the
International Statistical Institute, Cairo, Egypt, September 9-17, 1991. These
biennial meetings bring together experts in numerous statistical fields from
throughout the world, as well as many younger researchers who have a unique
opportunity to meet, converse with, and discuss specific programs with the
outstanding experts in the particular areas. Further, there is opportunity for
various researchers, not only in theoretical statistics, but many areas of
application, ranging from the behavioral, social and physical sciences, to the
health sciences and engineering to mingle and exchange methodology and results.
