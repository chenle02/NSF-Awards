The propagation of waves and the flow of fluids through random media are
important areas of research not only because they are involved in many practical
applications, but also because they exhibit novel phenomena currently under
intense investigation in condensed matter physics. Practical applications
include acoustic geophysical survey, medical imaging, testing of new composite
and porous materials, solar collector design, etc. Modern physical phenomena
which are involved include percolation, fractional dimension structures, and
Anderson localization. The basic physics underlying wave propagation and flow in
random media will be experimentally studied using an ideal liquid, superfluid
helium, permeating a random system. In particular, fourth sound propagating in
various random porous media and third sound in a superfluid film on a random
substrate will be investigated.
