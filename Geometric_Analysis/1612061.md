Abstract

Award: DMS 1612061, Principal Investigator: Robert Young

This project proposes to study the geometry of surfaces in some spaces arising
from mathematics and computer science. Surfaces are fundamental objects in
geometry, and the shape of surfaces in a space provides insight into the space.
The behavior of surfaces that are minimal or near-minimal is especially
important. For example, minimal surfaces, like soap films, are known to be
smooth under many conditions, but surfaces that are only close to minimal can be
rough. The PI intends to develop new tools to study minimal and close-to-minimal
surfaces in a variety of spaces and use them to study geometric and analytical
problems. One proposed application of these tools is the study of the accuracy
of the Goemans-Linial algorithm, an algorithm to approximate the best way of
cutting an object into two roughly equal pieces. This algorithm is a key
ingredient in many "divide-and-conquer" algorithms, which solve complex problems
by decomposing them into simpler ones.

The PI plans to develop new quantitative tools for studying the geometry of
surfaces in groups and spaces and apply them to questions in geometric group
theory, geometric measure theory, and theoretical computer science. First, the
project aims to prove a conjecture of Gromov and Thurston on the filling
functions of lattices in symmetric spaces, providing new understanding of the
large-scale geometry of these spaces. Second, the project will explore
decompositions of surfaces embedded in Euclidean space and try to use new tools
from geometric measure theory to bound the geometry and topology of these
surfaces. Third, the project will analyze surfaces of finite perimeter in the
Heisenberg group and other nilpotent groups. If this last goal is successful, it
would lead to sharp bounds on embeddings of the Heisenberg group into Banach
spaces and sharp bounds on the accuracy of the best known approximate solution
to the Sparsest Cut problem.
