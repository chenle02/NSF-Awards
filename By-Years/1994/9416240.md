9416240 Hushmand On October 9, 1993, new Federal minimum design standards for
Municipal Solid waste landfill Facilities (MSWLF) were released which impacted
the seismic design of landfills. However, these new standards combined little
information and almost no guidelines for establishing the seismic performance of
landfills. On January 17, 1994, the Northridge earthquake provided the first
recorded set of strong accelerations in the OII landfill, the only landfill in
the United States which is instrumented with strong-motion recorders, thus
providing a rare opportunity to analyze a well-documented case history, and to
develop guidelines for the seismic performance of landfills. The objective of
the proposed research is to analyze the strong motion recordings and the
surveyed displacements at the OII landfill after the 1994 Northridge earthquake.
Several types of dynamic analyses will be used to calculate the ground
accelerations, and the permanent ground displacements. The specific objectives
are to determine the wave velocity and the damping properties of landfill
materials that simulate the landfill response. These backfitted data will be
compared to the wave velocities that are measured from geophysical and surface
wave measurement techniques, in an effort to assess the applicability of the
wave velocity measurements in extremely heterogeneous media. The method of
analysis will include conventional engineering methods (e.g. equivalent linear
methods such as QUAD4) and more advanced plasticity models and finite element
models such as LINOS. Comprehensive models will be developed that include
nonlinear behavior of landfill materials, two dimensional geometries, and wave
propagation and reflection. Recommendations will be made for the optimal way to
monitor the seismic performance of landfills. The data collected and generated
during this research will be in digital format to the database of the Southern
California Earthquake Center at the University o f Southern California. ***
