9451091 Hadley This project, which includes the development of several laser-
based experiments in Raman spectroscopy, laser fluorescence, and excited-state
dynamics, will be at the center of a modernization program in our undergraduate
physical chemistry laboratory program. The project will have a beneficial effect
on our other upper-division laboratory courses as well, including instrumental
analysis and analytical chemistry. Students will perform three sets of
experiments using a pulsed nitrogen laser and attendant equipment: 1) The
fluorescence and absorption spectrum of I2, with special attention paid to the
nature of state-selected excited electronic and vibrational states as well as
their lifetimes. 2) A Raman and IR study of CCl4, wherein students will compare
the vibrational information derived from each type of spectroscopy and determine
bond forces. 3) A dynamic study of the fate of excited states of rare-earth
complexes with the intent of studying the effects of fluorescence quenching,
ligand rigidity, and solvent viscosity on the lifetimes of these complexes.
