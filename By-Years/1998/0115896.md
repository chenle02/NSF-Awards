This project, in conjunction with similar support from ARO, ONR, AFOSR and DoE
will support travel expenses to facilitate participation of roughly 50 graduate
students to the 14th U.S. National Congress of Theoretical and Applied
Mechanics. This workshop is held every four years under the auspices of the U.S.
National Committee on Theoretical and Applied Mechanics and this year it will be
hosted by the Department of Engineering Science and Mechanics at Virginia
Polytechnic Institute and State University. It will provide a setting for
exchanging ideas, cultivating friendships, renewing acquaintances, building
networks, and educating graduate students. Key and distinguished individuals
from industry, academe, and government, from all over the world will be invited
to give keynote lectures and presentations in the workshop. A special emphasis
will be placed on the emerging fields of nanoscience, wave propragation in
heterogeneous media, fluid-structure interaction and Mechanics Education. Every
effort will be made to select both an ethnically and scientifically diverse
group of students to represent all areas of theoretical and applied mechanics.
