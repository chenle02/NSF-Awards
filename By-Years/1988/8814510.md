This proposal is for support of the International Conference on Science and
Technology of Synthetic Metals to be held in Santa Fe, New Mexico, June 26 -
July 2, 1988. The program content represents science areas of major importance
to the materials community. These include charge transfer in molecular materials
(TTF/TCNQ type), electronically conducting polymers, and organic and inorganic
superconductors. NSF funds will be used exclusively for the support of Foreign
participants, younger faculty members without grant support and students. **//
