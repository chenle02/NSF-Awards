It is believed that a strongly correlated electron system in two dimensions can
be described by an effective field theory of particles with fractional
statistics called anyons. One important reason for the interest in models with
such an unusual statistics is the claim that anyons could play a basic role in
high-temperature superconductivity. Although anyon superconductivity has been
the subject of intense research in recent years, problems still remain related
to the anyon response to an applied magnetic field at finite temperature. This
project will address these questions. Their solution will contribute to a better
understanding of the fundamental properties of this system and to its relevance
in condensed matter. The second part of this project will be dedicated to the
investigation of large magnetic fields in gauge theories. It is expected that
the outcome of these studies will be relevant for cosmic phase transitions and
will contribute to the explanation of the formation of electron positron peaks
in heavy-ion collisions.
