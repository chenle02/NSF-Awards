The primary objective of this research is to develop mathematical models that
describe growth patterns and to develop alternate methods for the comparison of
growth patterns between different species of animals. It has long been thought
that the process of growth plays an important role in producing the changes in
appearance of animals through evolution. One major theory is that changes in
either the timing or rate of growth can produce profound changes in the
appearance of an animal. The investigators propose to mathematically model
changes in the timing of growth. This will be done using three-dimensional data
from modern animals, providing a realistic representation of how structure
changes through time. Using the mathematical models that they develop and three-
dimensional data on the structure of living forms, the researchers will predict
what that form would look like if it's growth pattern was changed in a
prescribed way. These methods can be used to test ideas about how the structure
of modern animals emerged from more primitive forms.
