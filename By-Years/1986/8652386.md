The University of South Florida will produce videotaped lessons on chemistry for
the use of preservice elementary school teachers and inservice middle school and
school teachers who are not adequately prepared in chemistry. Three tapes,
focusing on density in solids, liquids, and gases will attempt to convey
fundamental science concepts without extensive use of mathematics. A fourth tape
will provide material on effective instructional methods for the benefit of the
instructors using the three instructional tapes. These tapes will be distributed
to inservice teachers of grades five through eleven in southern Florida and to
preservice teachers in the Suncoasts Area Teacher Training program. These
teachers will be asked to complete pretests and posttests on the scientific
content of the tapes and feedback on the effectiveness of the lessons. In
addition, the tapes will be broadcast on channel 16 in Tampa (WUSF), and efforts
will be made to evaluate their impact on the viewers.
