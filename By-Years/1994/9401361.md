Lyubeznik A large part of the principal investigator's research on local
cohomology has been devoted to the study of a number of striking connections
with several quite diverse areas of mathematics, such as etale cohomolgy,
topology of algebraic varieties, D-modules and others. While considerable
progress on this circle of ideas has been made recently, a lot remains to be
done. This is especially true for the applications of D-modules to local
cohomology which is a completely new area of research. The principal investigato
will work on these questions by using methods that have been successful in the
past as well as developing some new methods. This research is concerned with a
number of questions in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. Algebraic
geometry studies solutions of families of polynomial equations. One can either
study the geometry of the solution set or approach problems algebraically by
investigating certain functions on the solution set that form what is called a
commutative ring. This dual perspective creates a close connection between
commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. ***
