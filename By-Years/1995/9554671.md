The impact of Two Year Colleges (TYCs) in the teaching of college level physics
is often not appreciated. This is particularly true for students who have been
historically at risk. Nationally 47% of all minority students are enrolled at
TYCs. Historically the opportunities for TYC faculty members to participate in
professional development have been limited. This two year program is designed to
serve as a continuing model for the utilization of cooperative relationships
between university professors and outstanding TYC physics faculty members
working together to provide professional in-service enrichment opportunities for
TYC physics faculty members from across the United States. The program focuses
on the recent developments in physics research, innovative physics teaching
methods and successful techniques for recruiting local minority students into
two year college science and engineering programs. The program includes an
annual May Institute at Texas A&amp;M University, biannual academic year follow-
up workshops, local projects and staff visits to the 24 participants from across
the United States
