9623071 Wang The investigators studies the partial differential equations
arising in meteorology, oceanography and climatology. The work is the
mathematical analysis part of an ongoing project, jointly with J. L. Lions
(College de France) and R. Temam (Indiana University); that project involves a
combination of modeling, mathematical theory, and scientific computing. Among
the partial differential equations are the core equations in climatology such as
the primitive equations of the atmosphere-only, the ocean-only, and the coupled
atmosphere/ocean systems. Part of the mathematical theory has been attained in
previous work about these core equations of the atmosphere, ocean and coupled
atmosphere-ocean. A large amount of work such as the existence and properties of
strong solutions and long time behavior remains to be done, however. Also, the
mathematical analysis of sea ice equations and some free surface models is also
addressed. Another part of the proposed work is to justify from the mathematical
viewpoint the geostrophic asymptotics and the associated quasi-geostrophic
equations (well-posedness and long time dynamics). The phenomena of the
atmosphere and ocean are extremely rich in organization and complexity. The
study of these complicated phenomena and the relevant scientific issues are very
challenging and necessitate a joint effort of scientists in many fields. The
proposed work takes up this study from the mathematical point of view. As is now
well-known and as pointed out by John von Neumann in the fifties, understanding
and prediction of the weather and climate involve a great deal of mathematical
analysis and a great deal of calculation. This project aims at a better
understanding of the mechanisms of the turbulent behavior of the air and
seawater, as well as tools for better prediction of the weather and possible
global change.
