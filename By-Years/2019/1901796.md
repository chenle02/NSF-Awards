The aim of the project is the study of double affine Hecke algebras (DAHAs) and
their applications in geometry, number theory, topology, harmonic analysis, and
combinatorics, as well as exciting applications in modern mathematical physics,
for instance in string theory. This includes new connections between physics and
number theory via DAHAs, which can connect correlation functions in physics with
count of points over finite fields in geometry. This work is firmly aligned with
Quantum Leap, one of the NSF's 10 Big Ideas, through software to be developed
that will compute the DAHA-Fourier transform at roots of
unity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The major themes of the proposed research are: (1)
DAHA and motivic theory of invariants of algebraic links and plane curve
singularities, including the corresponding Riemann hypothesis, (2) harmonic
analysis on DAHA, which generalizes theory of affine Hecke algebras and is
related to the PI's theory of difference hypergeometric functions, and (3)
applications in number theory, including q-zeta functions and Rogers-Ramanujan
identities. The key is a recent connection between the DAHA superpolynomials
(conjecturally related to the reduced Khovanov-Rozansky polynomials) and the
zeta-functions of plane curve singularities. This connection conjecturally
identifies the so-called super-duality in physics (say S-duality in M-theory)
and that in DAHA theory with the functional equation in number
theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
