The manner in which plant phenolics determine dietary choices of ruminants and
foragine strategies of ruminants govern the phenolic chemistry of plants will be
investigated. Plants have adapted differently to the stresses of browsing and
grazing ruminants. While the grazing interaction can be mutualistic, the
browsing interaction is an evolutionary struggle of allelochemicals and
detoxification pathways. Ecologically important allelochemicals in the browsing
interaction include phenolics. This interdisciplinary study of the
ruminant.phenolic interaction will involve feeding trials of captive deer and
sheep, nutritional analyses of natural forages, and chemical investigations of
plant phenolics and animal metabolism. The hypothesis that condensed tannins
primarily affect nitrogen economy, while hydrolyzable tannins predominantly act
as toxins will be tested. To test this hypothesis, the effects of tannins on
grazers will be compared with the effects on browsers with emphasis on the role
of salivary proteins in tannin detoxification. In addition, the effect of
absorable phenolics on diet selection in ruminants will be explored. Rather than
attempt to determine the metabolic fates of all phenolics, the phenolic profile
of various plants using a simple fractionation scheme based on the polarity and
solubility of phenolics will be established. Single forage feeding trials will
be used to correlate phenolic profiles with intake suppression, and multiple
forage feeding trials will be used to test the predictive power of our method.
It is anticipated that with this scheme, it will be possible to predict which
forages have complementary allelochemical profiles, and which will be selected
as complementary dietary components by browsing ruminants.
