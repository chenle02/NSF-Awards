It was recently discovered that, in the rat, the amounts of a particular
protein, the K-ras p21 protein, contained in the ovary mirror the pattern of
secretion of progesterone from the corpus luteum. Furthermore, when an antibody
against this protein was incorporated into luteal cell in vitro, progesterone
secretion from these cells was significantly decreased, thus demonstrating that
this protein plays a role in the production/secretion of progesterone by the
luteal cell. It is the objective of this proposal to determine the specific way
in which the K-ras p21 protein affects luteal progesterone secretion and to
determine whether this p21 protein plays a role in the secretion of other
hormones from the luteum. The K-ras p21 protein is present in all mammalian
cells. Thus, the results of the proposed studies will have a significant impact
upon the understanding of ovarian hormone secretory mechanisms as well as our
understanding of the ways in which all mammalian cells respond to hormones and
growth factors.
