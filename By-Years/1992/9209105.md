This Science in Developing Countries award will support a Roundtable on
Molecular Biology and Biochemistry of Chemolithotrophs: Applications to
Bacterials Leaching, to be held in New Orleans, Louisiana, May 26-30, 1992. The
organizers are Moselio Schaechter of the American Society for Microbiology and
Emilio Garcia, a Chilean scientist at the Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory, University of California. The Roundtable will bring together
scientists from the United States and Latin America to discuss a range of
fundamental research topics focusing on chemolithotrophs. Through this award,
seven researchers--of whom some are young investigators--from developing
countries in Latin America will participate. The Roundtable is expected to
benefit both the U.S. and Latin American participants through an exchange of
information and the opportunity to develop new ties in collaborative research,
leading to further progress in metals production and recovery, a field of
commercial importance to all countries involved.
