With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
(CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Idaho will
acquire an Electron-spin Resonance Spectrometer. The new instrument will support
the research in the following areas: a) characterization of ansa-chromocene
complexes; b) investigations of protein-small molecule interactions; c) studies
on the coordination geometry of nitrosyl ligands in photoexcited transition
metal complexes; d) molecular-level basis for antioxidant mechanisms of
flavonoids; e) investigation of Cu sorption mechanism on clay minerals; and f)
properties of Pdtc as a bioremediation agent. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An electron
paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometer is an instrument used to obtain
information about the molecular and electronic structure of molecules. It may
also be used to obtain information about the lifetimes of free radicals that are
often essential for the initiation of tumor growth and/or a variety of chemical
reactions. These studies will have an impact in a number of areas, in particular
biochemistry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
