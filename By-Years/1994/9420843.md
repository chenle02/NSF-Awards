9420843 Griffin This project describes a molecular engineering approach to a new
class of materials with remarkable properties. Negative Poisson's ratio
materials (also known as auxetic materials) expand laterally when stretched.
This is at variance with usual expectation since virtually everything thins when
stretched - a rubber band for example. Although theoretically possible there are
virtually no known examples of auxetic materials. It has however been recently
discovered that special geometric features are capable of imparting this
behavior and large scale macroscopic structures can be built to accomplish this.
Also, special fabrication techniques can sometimes produce this effect by
inducing unusual morphologies in certain polymeric materials. The Poisson's
ratio is a fundamental elastic constant of a material and is interconnected to
the other elastic constants which govern mechanical response. Tailoring the
Poisson's ratio offers the possibility of precise control of mechanical
performance. It has been recognized that ultimate control of such behavior lies
in a molecularly designed auxetic material which will permit careful tailoring
of this bahavior and which will give the maximum auxetic response. This proposal
describes the design, the synthetic approach and the characterization of two
polymeric classes each of which reflects at the molecular level the geometric
features known to be mechanistically operative in producing an auxetic response
at the macroscopic level. %%% A variety of extraordinary applications can
follow: fasteners and rivets which will get fatter (tighter fit) upon attempted
removal and gaskets and seals which will seat better (contraction) when under
compression loading. Composites are also envisioned in which an auxetic fiber
will reduce or eliminate fiber pull-out, one of the critical problems in
composite science. ***
