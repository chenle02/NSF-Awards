This award supports research on rotary tool machining (RTM), a process that
offers unique benefits when applied to difficult to machine materials. This
research is aimed at developing new technologies for the precision machining of
workpieces under conditions including a wide range of process, material and
geometry variations. The research has the potential of forming the basis of the
development of machine tools that offer additional control flexibility and
sensor feedback.
