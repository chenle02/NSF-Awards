An experimental investigation of the basic mechanisms responsible for flow-
structure interaction is to be carried out. Flow about single and multiple
cylinders will be modified through controlled motion of the cylinders. The first
major objective is to determine the basic flow structure and loading responsible
for energy transfer both into and out of the cylinders. The second major
objective is to optimize the coherence or destruction of large scale vortical
flow structures through various modes of excitation. The ability to predict and
or prevent excitation of structural oscillations by flows will be enhanced by
the results of this study. It also relates to the enhancement of energy transfer
into various other engineering systems.
