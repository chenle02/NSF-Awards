This project consists of a series of three workshops to be held in successive
summers for approximately twenty women researchers in statistics and probability
who have received their doctorate degree within the five years prior to the
workshop year. The first workshop is scheduled for August 8-9, 1992 and would
immediately precede the Joint Annual Meetings of the American Statistical
Association, regions of the Biometric Society, and the Institute of Mathematical
Statistics to be held from August 9-13, 1992 in Boston, Massachusetts. The
second workshop would likely be scheduled for August 7-8, 1993 and would precede
the Joint Annual Meetings of the American Statistical Association, regions of
the Biometric Society, and the Institute of Mathematical Statistics to be held
from August 8-12, 1993 in San Francisco, California. The third workshop is
tentatively scheduled for August 1994 and would be held either prior to the
Joint Annual Meetings of the American Statistical Association and regions of the
Biometric Society, tentatively planned to be held in Toronto, Canada or prior to
the Third World Congress to be held at a location in the U.S. yet to be
announced. The director of the project is Professor Lynne Billard of the
University of Georgia. The purpose of the workshops will be to increase and
foster the research activity of the participants. It is hoped that the
participants will use the workshop and the resulting professional contacts to
enhance their research and decrease their isolation.
