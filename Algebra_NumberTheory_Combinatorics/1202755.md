The main thrust of the project is to continue joint work with John Shareshian on
the interplay between symmetric function theory, enumerative combinatorics, and
algebraic geometry. This project arose from the study of a class of symmetric
functions that appears in various contexts such as in the work of Carlitz,
Scoville and Vaughan on enumeration of Smirnov words, in the work of Procesi and
Stanley on the representation of the symmetric group on the cohomology of the
toric variety associated with the type A root system, and in the work of the
investigator and Shareshian on a q-analog of the Eulerian polynomials. In an
effort to understand the basis for the relationship between these structures,
the investigator and Shareshian have proposed a far-reaching generalization of
this relationship, which this project will explore. The conjectured
generalization involves a quasisymmetric refinement of Stanley's chromatic
symmetric functions, Tymoczko's representation of the symmetric group on the
cohomology of the regular semisimple Hessenberg variety of type A, and a
q-analog of a generalization (due to De Mari, Procesi and Shayman) of the
Eulerian polynomials. The conjectured relationship would provide an algebro-
geometric approach to attacking Stanley and Stembridge's long standing
$e$-positivity conjecture for chromatic symmetric functions and a conjecture of
the investigator and Shareshian on unimodality of their q-analog of the De Mari-
Procesi-Shayman generalized Eulerian polynomials. The project will also continue
the work of the investigator on the interplay between poset topology and
enumerative combinatorics.

The research supported by this grant is in algebraic combinatorics, which is an
area of mathematics that seeks to develop connections between combinatorics (the
science of counting, arranging and analyzing concrete discrete configurations)
and fields of pure mathematics that involve sophisticated abstract algebraic
structures. The idea is to use these connections to gain deeper insights and
solve problems in combinatorics and in the other fields. The discrete
configurations that are studied in combinatorics arise in various fields of
mathematics, computer science, physics, biology and engineering; DNA sequences,
phylogenetic trees, and communications networks are all examples of discrete
configurations. Combinatorial methods are playing an increasingly important role
in these fields.
