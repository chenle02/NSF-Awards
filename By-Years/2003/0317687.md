The permanent loss of species, called extinction, is occurring on a global scale
at a rapidly increasing rate. Over the long term, only the process of speciation
can increase the number of species. This project will investigate the role
played by small, isolated populations in the rapid speciation of Darwin's
finches, which provide a model system for evolutionary research. The
investigators will compare birds from many island populations in the Galapagos,
using different molecular markers and including recently developed methods of
DNA fingerprinting. These data will provide a rare opportunity to critically
evaluate what many scientists believe to be a very common mode of speciation.

Nature reserves are designed primarily to protect existing species from
extinction, but these designs may also affect future speciation. This project
will provide valuable information about the role of geography in speciation.
Funding for this project will support the training of a post-doctoral
researcher, graduate students and undergraduates. These research opportunities
dovetail with existing host institution programs that include course credit for
research, support for independent research, and fellowships that target
traditionally underrepresented groups. The general interest in Galapagos
organisms will also provide opportunities to educate the public about
evolutionary processes.
