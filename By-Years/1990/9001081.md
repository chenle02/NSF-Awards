Gaeumannomyces graminis, a soil-borne, filamentous fungus, causes crown and root
disease of wheat, barley and rice and for several reasons this plant-pathogen
interaction provides an excellent model for fungal adhesion to host tissue.
First, the fungus, in response to plastic as well as plant surfaces, produces
specialized attachment cells (hyphopodia), which can be at least partially
purified. Second, G. graminis is not an obligate parasite and can be easily
cultured. Third, the fungus can be manipulated by both classical and molecular
genetic techniques. One of our goals is to determine if hyphopodia are important
for fungal pathogenicity as suggested by preliminary work. Gene disruption with
transforming plasmid DNA will be used to generate more hyp strains which lack
the ability to produce hyphopodia. After they are genetically analyzed, mutants
will be characterized as to their colonizing and pathogenic potential.
