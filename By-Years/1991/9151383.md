The conceptual focus of this project is the design, development and construction
of a portable computer-aided data acquisition, analysis and control system
(CADAAC System) where the instrumentation and control capability is appropriate
for Fluid and Thermal Science Instructional Laboratories, and where the system
hardware and software has been designed, configured and packaged with
educational instruction in view. The complete CADAAC system includes a main
computer work station, a measurement instrumentation module, a control
instrumentation module, and an instrument calibration module. The project
includes the integration of the system into a variety of experiments within the
Fluid and Thermal Science Laboratory.
