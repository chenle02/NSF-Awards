The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation -
Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project is to develop a reliable chemical field
test that can easily and quickly differentiate between hemp and marijuana plants
in the field. A miniaturized testing platform results in improved sensitivity
and effectiveness. This technology addresses a need to differentiate plants
quickly and effectively for use by law enforcement, regulatory bodies, and also
by the hemp growing industry. This PFI-TT project will accelerate the
commercialization of a viable solution that will compete favorably with an
existing technology and incorporate engineering expertise to address the scaling
challenges to commercialize the rapid test kit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
proposed project seeks to use a polymer-coated fiberglass substrate and a robust
chemical reaction to provide miniaturized reaction results. The major technical
challenge in the commercialization of the rapid test kit is the development of a
prototype that can be industrially scalable for various market segments. In
order to address the technical challenges, the team will validate the prototype
kit with industry partners and standardize a versatile platform that is
commercially viable and that can address various market
segments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
