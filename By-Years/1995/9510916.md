9510916 Jones The emergence of the R&amp;D-based endogenous growth literature
has led to an overlap between the macro growth literature and a micro literature
on the economics of research and development. Papers in each of these
literature's have documented a number of distortions in the allocation of
resources to R&amp;D that may arise, often focusing on one or two of these
distortions for illustrative purposes. The contribution of this CAREER project
is to incorporate several of these distortions into a single general equilibrium
model and to analyze their effects empirically. The project provides a coherent
framework for thinking about these distortions and estimating their net impact
on R&amp;D. It will focus on four key distortions in the allocation of resources
to R&amp;D: a monopoly markup effect, a knowledge spillover effort ("standing on
shoulders"), a creative destruction effect, and a patent race effect ("stepping
on toes"). The Education Plan consists of the development of an undergraduate
research seminar for exploring the broad implications of the R&amp;D-based
growth model. The seminar will be used to provide qualitative evidence to
complement the formal statistical analysis in the Research Plan. The initial
part of the research seminar will highlight the lessons of old and new growth
theory. After discussing the subtleties associated with testing the R&amp;D
based models, the investigator will explore the historical analysis of
technology and growth and the qualitative literature on population and economic
growth.
