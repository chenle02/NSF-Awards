A large capacity fermentor will be acquired for protein engineering experiments
with overproduction in bacterial cells. The fermentor will support research on
nucleotide excision DNA repair, on the structure and catalytic mechanism of
metal-activated enzymes, on the structure and internal dynamics of protein
function, and on the molecular biology of retrovirus. Other projects in
biochemistry, enzymology, biophysics, microbiology, and molecular biology will
also be supported.
