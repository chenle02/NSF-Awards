9503900 Trigos-Arrieta This award is under the North American Research Fellows
Program, which enables U.S. scientists and engineers from the United States,
Canada and Mexico, to visit research establishments in one or both of the other
two countries for periods of three to twelve months. The program's awards
provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary
facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad. This award will
support a twelve-month research visit by Dr. F. Javier Trigos-Arrieta to work
with Dr. Salvador Garcia Ferreira of the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico
(UNAM) in Morelia, Mexico. This award will support research on open problems in
topological groups involving Bohr compactification, particularly as it relates
to locally compact Abelian groups and its extension to the maximally almost
periodic groups introduced by von Neumann. The researchers will also focus on
various questions concerning the topological definition of resolvability
introduced by Hewitt. The proposed work is relevant to various subfields of
mathematics such as harmonic and functional analysis, set theory, and general
topology. ***
