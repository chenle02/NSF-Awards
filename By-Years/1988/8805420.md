This award will establish a Research Experience for Undergraduates Site at the
State University of New York-Fredonia. The project will foster the intellectual
and emotional development of 10 undergraduate participants by involving them in
an investigation of plant-pollinator interactions. The research will focus on
the role that amino acids play in attracting insect pollinators to floral
nectars. Participants in this project will collect nectars and quantify their
sugar and amino acid compositions using High Performance Liquid Chromatography.
In addition, they will study the behavioral response of various pollinators to
amino acids in the nectars of plants. This project will be divided into two
parts, summer (1988) and winter(1989). The eight summer weeks will offer one
week of introduction to theory and methods, three weeks of directed research on
group projects, and four weeks of independent, participant-originated projects.
During the fall semester, participants will analyze the results of their
individual projects. They will return to Fredonia in January, 1989, when they
will prepare oral presentations of their projects to be presented at the Eastern
College Science Conference (ECSC) in April 1989. Student researchers in this
project will develop through 1) an increased understanding of ecology, behavior,
evolution, biochemistry, and chemical instrumentation 2) hands-on experience
with specific field and laboratory research techniques, 3) practice in critical
reading and analytical thinking, and 4) acquisition of a variety of research
support skills. All of these accomplishments will enhance the emotional maturity
of participants, help to define their career choice as scientists and, in some
cases, raise their aspirations.
