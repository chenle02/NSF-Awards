Professor Ken Feldman of The Pennsylvania State University is developing
efficient methods to prepare human hormone receptor binding agents to serve as
potential drug candidates. This project is funded by the Chemical Synthesis
program of the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation. These
methods are based upon preliminary discoveries in Dr. Feldman's laboratory
involving new approaches to stitch together small pieces of molecules in order
to form larger chemical structures with control over molecular shape. These
product molecules will aid in understanding the structural features that
contribute to selective association with one hormone receptor over another. The
funded research also includes studies on marine water remediation techniques,
and the broader impacts of this latter work might include improvements in the
quality of husbandry for marine ornamentals. The chemistry features a new
approach to forming indolidenes, reactive indole-derived species that engage in
bond formation to append either five-membered rings or seven-membered rings onto
the indole framework. Since indoles with appended rings constitute important
targets for drug discovery, this chemistry may impact several areas of
pharmaceutical science. More specifically, preliminary reports ascribe a
remarkable selectivity for activating the human progesterone receptor over other
hormone receptors by a five-membered ring appended indole called lecanindole D,
a naturally occurring fungal-derived material. The investigation of the
structural basis for this selectivity is a major thrust of the funded research.
