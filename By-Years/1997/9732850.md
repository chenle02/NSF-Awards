This project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program,
focusses on the synthesis and characterization of novel electroactive oligomers,
linear polymers, and dendrimers. Organic materials that have new architectures
will be designed and synthesized in this project. Professor Miller and his
students at the University of Minnesota will use spectroscopic, conductivity,
electrochemical, quartz crystal microbalance, impedance, differential scanning
calorimetry, x-ray diffraction, and rheological measurements in this
multidisciplinary work. New polymeric thin films will be prepared that are
electroactive, electrical conductive, and photoconducting or electroemissive.
The responsiveness of these thin films to adsorbed vapors will be characterized
with the aim of developing new vapor sensors. There are many potential
applications for new organic materials that are electrochemically active and
that exhibit photoconduction. Professor Miller and his students at the
University of Minnesota will prepare and characterize new compounds that are
predicted to have these properties. A wide range of instrumental methods will be
used to determine the electrochemical and photochemical activity of these new
compounds. One example of a potential use for these new materials will be in
preparing thin films that are sensitive to chemical vapors. New chemical sensors
for vapors will be developed for compounds that possess the requisite
sensitivity to target analytes.
