Bridges and concrete structures are subject to ageing and obsolescence and may
be considered as the most vulnerable elements of the infrastructure as their
condition of out-of-service causes great losses in terms of costs, both for the
users and for road owners and operators. Special attention is therefore focused
on maintaining them in a serviceable condition. This research is directed toward
bettering the state-of-the-art in structural health monitoring of bridges and
other similar structure. The research is broad in two parts. The first part
addresses sensing/data interpretation, the second part addresses the transfer of
data from sensors to the location where interpretation occurs. This project ties
together the expertise in the first part provided by the Industry/University
Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for the Repair of Buildings Bridges and
Composites and the networking expertise provided by the I/UCRC for Advanced
Computing and Communication.
