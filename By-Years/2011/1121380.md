Oxygen is needed for the production of sufficient cellular energy to sustain
life. Low oxygen availability, or anoxia, therefore has devastating effects on
the viability of many organisms, including plants. Reduction in oxygen levels
can come from the plant's own consumption of the available oxygen in densely
packed tissues, or from the vagaries of the surroundings such as soil
compaction, seasonal flooding and even agricultural practices related to
cultivation or irrigation. Surviving these conditions requires the plant to
sense the lowering of oxygen availability and shift its energy metabolism to
systems to cope with the impending energy deficit. Although this response is
essential for survival, our current understanding of this sensory system in
plants is highly incomplete, especially at the level of the cellular events that
sense and signal a fall in oxygen availability. Therefore, the research in this
proposal seeks to more fully characterize the early events that trigger,
coordinate and regulate plant responses to low oxygen availability using an
integrated approach of imaging of low oxygen-related cellular signaling
activities, characterization of associated changes in gene expression and
analysis of the responses of mutants impaired in these cell and molecular
events. In addition to advancing fundamental knowledge of how plants adapt to
the environment, the research in this proposal will also be of long-term
relevance to agriculture where seasonal flooding, likely exacerbated by climate
change, may become a significant factor in future crop productivity. Integrated
into this basic research is also an effort to develop a plant biology movie
resource aimed at engaging and educating the general public. This effort will
intimately involve undergraduate students in the making and presentation of the
movies.
