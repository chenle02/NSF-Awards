Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this proposal, the PIs propose to build a
system that would open the SIO shipboard data archives to web access with modern
tools for users that would allow data queries and data mining via the Internet.
This effort is visualized as part of a larger data base infrastructure for the
wide MGG and Oceanographic community. The PIs would first develop a prototype
system, then test the system and ask for comments from community users, and
finally add more data and tools to the system. The effort would extend over a
period much longer than the present 3 year grant, and is partly supported by SIO
and others. An advisory committee would help guide the efforts of the
group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
