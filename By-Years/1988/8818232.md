In multiconstituent polymers there exists a driving force for the lowest energy
constituent to preferentially adsorb at the surface, or for a surfactant-like
species to preferentially reside at a polymer-polymer interphase. The occurrence
of this interphase partitioning can drastically alter the surface and/or
interfacial properties of multicomponent polymers, and is the basis of many
commercial methods for surface property modification. This research represents a
comprehensive effort to understand the fundamental principles underlying these
phenomena by thorough experimentation on several model systems. These include
miscible homopolymer blends, immiscible ternary homopolymer/homopolymer/block
copolymes blends, functionally terminated homopolymers, and immiscible blends of
functionally terminated homopolymer with a second homopolymer. Characterization
of the surface tension, and surface chemical structure and composition is
accomplished by application of a number of current surface and interface
analysis techniques in order to relate these features to the bulk physical and
thermodynamic parameters of the constituents. The availability of this
information will assist in the molecular design of surface and interfacial
modifiers for multiconstituent polymers.
