The University of Hawaii, Institute of Geophysics will continue development,
construction and testing of FOCUS (Fiber-Optic Communication Undersea System).
FOCUS is designed to be a relatively small, lightweight, fiber-optically
tethered real-time video camera system offering maneuverability and deep sea
capabilities at a low unit cost. It will provide ocean scientists with high
resolution, real-time digital color video in depths to 6,000 meters. Its size,
weight, and modular construction will make FOCUS usable from ships of
opportunity, and those without a complex over-the-side support system. The key
to FOCUS' relatively small size is a new electro-optic cable. The phase 2 effort
will consist of deep water field testing and addition of a passive, low-cost
'eyeball' that will hang below the main FOCUS frame. The University is providing
sharing. A variety of geological and geophysical studies of the seafloor can
make use of cost-effective capabilities provided by a vehicle such as FOCUS.
