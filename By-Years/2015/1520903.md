This award will support attendance by U.S. scientists at the Conference on
Evolution of Plant Phenotypes, from Genomes to Traits to be held in Barcelona,
Spain on March 17-18, 2015. The meeting will include presentations by junior and
senior investigators in a format that will promote scientific exchange in both
formal and informal settings. Presentations will address a range of topics
related to plant evolution, with the overarching aim of providing insights with
potential applications to sustainable agriculture and food security.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific goal of the meeting will be to connect
genotype to phenotype by emphasizing two specific areas in plant evolution:
effects of multiple rounds of whole genome doubling and contributions to genome
evolution of proliferation and deletion of transposable elements. In these
contexts, focus will be on domestication, breeding and local adaptation of crop
genomes. To broadly share the outcomes of the meeting, presentations will be
available from the conference website, and a meeting report will be published in
a widely disseminated journal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funded by the Plant Genome
Research Program in the Directorate of Biological Sciences, Division of
Integrative Organismal Systems.
