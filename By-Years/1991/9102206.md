A formalism of quantum optics which takes into account multiple levels of
atomic systems and the spatial variations of the polarization of the light field
will be developed and applied to problems of laser cooling. Computer simulations
of typical situations in three spatial dimensions will be carried out. Finally,
a theory of resonance fluorescence for multi- level atoms will be developed and
applied to various problems.
