The long-term stability of slopes can change due to a progressive reduction in
the shear strength parameters. Seasonal cycles of wetting and drying and
fluctuations in the water table may contribute to the gradual reduction in the
shear strength of natural cohesive soils thus, increasing the probability of
landslides. The study will examine the effects of these environmental loadings
and the reduction in shear strength of natural claystones, cohesive colluvium
and cohesive alluvium, and on the long-term stability of slopes in or affected
by these materials. Ring shear tests will be used to measure the accumulation of
permanent shear deformation and the subsequent degradation in shear strength.
Laboratory data will be applied to documented landslide case histories to
validate the research conclusions. The results will be the basis for the
development of mitigation measures.
