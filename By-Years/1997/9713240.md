This program focuses on the experimental investigation of the dynamics of
magnetic fields and the transport in plasmas. The studies will be performed in
high beta plasmas where the magnetic field topology is strongly modified by the
plasma pressure. Of Particular interest is the parameter regime of electron
magnetohydrodynamics where only the electrons are magnetized. This work is
supported as part of the NSF/DOE Partnership in Basic Plasma Science and
Engineering.
