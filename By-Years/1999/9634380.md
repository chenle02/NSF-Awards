The last decade has seen extraordinary technological, intellectual, and market
developments that have shifted many assumptions underlying research in computer
architecture. Promising avenues for future research will doubtless lead in
directions different from those of the past. This project will convene a group
of approximately 15 experts from industry and academe, who will discuss this and
related issues in a one-day workshop. The proposed date is May 21, 1996, the day
before the start of the ACM/IEEE international Computer Architecture Symposium
to be held in Philadelphia, PA. The product of the workshop will be a final
report published on the World Wide Web.
