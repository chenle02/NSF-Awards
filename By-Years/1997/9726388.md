9726388 Pingali, Keshav Ingrafea, Anthonly Cornell University Challenges in
CISE: Crack Propagation on Teraflop Computers This research effort will focus on
the design of algorithms and systems to support the numerical simulation of
crack propagation problems on parallel computers. The specific focus is on
3-dimensional, time-dependent fracture simulations using unstructured, adaptive
grids on the IBM SP-2 and on EARTH-MANNA, a machine based on a fine-grain,
multiheaded program execution model. The effort will involve three major tasks:
Design and implement 3-D adaptive, parallel mesh generators producing meshes of
provably good quality Develop and implement restructuring compiler technology
that will support the automatic generation of efficient parallel code, starting
equations that arise in the simulation Evaluate the adequacy of existing thread
generation and load balancing mechanisms on the parallel platforms, and
reimplement those mechanisms for crack propagation studies
