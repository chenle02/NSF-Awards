In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry
program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Tonya Kuhl of the University of
California at Davis is determining the structure of model biological cell
membranes and structural changes under various conditions. The research will
examine the chemical forces and principles of self-organizing cellular membrane
systems. Both graduate and undergraduate students will be trained and carry out
this multidisciplinary work at the interface between chemistry, physics,
engineering, and biology. K-12 outreach activities involve Professor Kuhl,
undergraduate and graduate students engaging with K-12 students through hands-on
science demonstrations. A particular goal of the activities is to encourage
young women to pursue science and engineering educations by providing female
engineering role models. Age appropriate demonstrations will be developed to fit
within the existing K-12 science curriculum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A systematic
approach will be used to determine the structure-function relationships of
membranes as a function of composition and environmental conditions and how
these self-organizing, adapting systems respond to specific stimuli such as
protein binding. Such knowledge will enable robust and easily fabricated
biomimetic membrane platforms that recapitulate the desired nanostructured,
chemical and physical environment of the membrane in a controllable manner.
Development of biomembrane based platforms that recapitulate the desired
membrane environment in a controllable manner has potentially wide-spread
application for transforming studies of biological systems, drug screening, and
elucidating the mechanisms of the myriad of biological activities that take
place at the membrane interface.
