ABSTRACT AST-9423744 Shelton, Christopher An adaptive optics system working in
the visible has been constructed for the 100-inch Hooker telescope using private
funding sources. This project will augment the capabilities of the basic system,
refurbish of the Coude spectrograph at the 100-inch Hooker telescope, and
provide a fiber feed connection between the Coude spectrograph and the corrected
starlight output. ***
