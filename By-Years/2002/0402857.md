The primary objective of this research is to study the mechanics of blood
sucking by a mosquito, material and structural characterization of the parts of
mosquito anatomy used needed in accomplishing the task, and translate the
understanding into engineering specifications for a synthetic mosquito or a
swarm of mosquitoes made up of several synthetic mosquitoes operating in
parallel, for painless drawing of blood from a live host, including humans. The
second objective is to explore novel material systems and manufacturing
processes for the mass production of synthetic fascicle and proboscis. Both
analytical and experimental approaches will be used to understand the
fundamentals of blood sucking by a mosquito, structural behavior of the
fascicle, and the manufacture of a synthetic fascicle. The research offers an
excellent opportunity to integrate many different fields of science, such as
biomaterials, micro-scale mechanics, MEMS, nano-manufacturing, and biology
through an inter-disciplinary team. Success of this research will mean that the
monitoring of blood constituents on a regular and frequent basis for diseases
like diabetes in adults, children, and babies will be painless for millions of
people around the world. New courses in bio-mimetic devices design, and nano-
manufacturing will be developed for educating future engineers.
