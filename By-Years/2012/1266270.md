The objective of this project is to develop Optical Micromachined Ultrasound
Transducer (OMUT) technology for high-resolution imaging probes mountable on a
tip of a needle or small diameter tubing. The design relies on laser generated
ultrasound and optical detection of ultrasound. Therefore all signal
communication to and from the device is optical. Ultrasound is generated by
rapid absorption of short laser pulses in a thin film. Optical micro-cavity
resonators having a flexible top membrane form high sensitivity ultrasound
detectors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two key features of OMUTs, miniaturization
and all-optical connectivity, make it an ideal technology for medical
applications such as real-time guiding of cardiovascular interventions,
laparoscopic surgery, and deep brain electrode implantation. Another added value
of this technology is the facilitation of pulse/echo ultrasound imaging and
photoacoustic imaging (PAI) in a single device. Combining ultrasound imaging and
PAI provides a range of possibilities for the design of multi-modality,
functional, and molecular imaging systems for higher specificity in medical
diagnosis and therapy guidance.
