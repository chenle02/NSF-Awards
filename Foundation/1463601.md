This award supports participation in a three-day meeting on mathematical and
philosophical logic at the University of California, Los Angeles, from January
30 to February 1, 2015. This is the eighteenth in a series of biennial logic
meetings at UCLA which, starting in the mid 1970s, has been one of the most
important forums for mathematical logic on the West Coast. The 2015 meeting
honors Donald A. Martin, a key figure in both philosophical and mathematical
logic.

The meeting is a key opportunity for logicians to learn about and discuss
important advances in research, to exchange ideas, and to collaborate on
scientific projects. Conference topics center on mathematical logic, including
set theory, model theory, and recursion theory, and philosophical logic. About
half the grant funds are dedicated to travel awards for graduate students and
early career researchers, to allow them to participate in the meeting. The
conference provides an opportunity for junior researchers to learn about recent
progress in the area and to initiate collaborative research projects.
