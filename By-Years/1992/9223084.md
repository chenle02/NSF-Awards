Cornell University seeks an additional two years of support for its Gatedaemon
Project. This partial support will help the project's mission of implementing
and deploying freely available leading-edge internet routing software for the
general good of the internetworking infrastructure. The Gatedaemon Project
produces "gated," a modular software program which supports multiple routing
protocols. This software was first used to interconnect the original NSFNET and
the emerging regional networks. since gated's routing protocol implementations
are freely available, as they have improved they have become de facto reference
implementations. It is now distributed by several system vendors and used by
several router vendors in their products. It is also considered to be a platform
for routing protocol research.
