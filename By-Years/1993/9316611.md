9316611 Smithson This award provides one-half the funding needed for the
acquisition of a high-resolution reflection seismograph system to be used in
basic research on seismic reflection methods applied to imaging the upper crust.
The instrument system will be operated by the Department of Geology and
Geophysics at the University of Wyoming. The University is committed to
providing the remaining funds necessary for the purchase of the equipment. The
seismic reflection method is the most effective means of imaging the subsurface,
but common seismic recording equipment does not have the capability of recording
the high-frequencies (to 100 Hz) needed to achieve high-resolution images. The
new system will be used by the reflection seismology group at the University of
Wyoming to obtain improved images of shallow crustal structures. ***
