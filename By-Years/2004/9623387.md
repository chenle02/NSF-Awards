9623387 Bergelson Plants are known to produce a wide variety of chemical
compounds, some of which are used in medicine today. Many theories explaining
the diversity of these compounds propose that plants produce them as defenses
against herbivorous insects, but there is little experimental work to
demonstrate the validity of this idea. This award will fund experiments to
address the role of a particular class of plant chemicals, the tropane
alkaloids, produced by members of the potato family (Solanaceae). Three
strategies will be adopted to determine the functional importance of the major
tropane alkaloids using two closely related members of the Solanaceae, deadly
nightshade and jimson weed. The first approach is to add the alkaloids, both
individually and in mixtures, to insect artificial diet in order to ascertain
their effects on insect growth and survival. The second strategy is to test
whether combinations or amounts of the alkaloids showing greatest toxicity to
insect herbivores in the laboratory have a defensive function in natural
populations. The final strategy is the most novel, and takes advantage of recent
biotechnology to insert genes into plants. A gene for one of the enzymes
necessary to create the alkaloids will be inserted into plants in the
laboratory, qualitatively changing their alkaloid production. Individuals having
these 'mutant' alkaloid profiles will be planted out in the field with ordinary
or wild type plants, and the amount of damage and total seed production for
plants of both kinds will be measured. This project has both implications for
our understanding of the evolution of plant chemistry, and for the applied
management of crmps. In particular, findings will help guide genetic engineering
of more resistant plants and, in so doing, allow farmers to be less dependent on
pesticide application.
