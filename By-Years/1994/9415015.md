The Tulane School of Engineering, established in 1894, has long been recognized
for excellent undergraduate and graduate education, and for its research
activities. To ensure the School's continued success, modern research facilities
are essential. Therefore, the top priority of Tulane's Engineering Centennial
Campaign is the renovation of outmoded buildings in the Engineering Complex,
namely, Stanley Thomas Hall, which houses the Department of Electrical
Engineering and Computer Science; the Civil Engineering Building, home to the
Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering; and a section of the
Mechanical Services Building, that houses several computer science, civil
engineering, and environmental engineering facilities. Both Stanley Thomas Hall
and the Civil Engineering Building have served Tulane faculty and students well
since the early 1900s. However, these buildings have not kept pace with the
technological advances of the 20th century, or the needs of the School's
research faculty. Last renovated in the 1950s, the buildings do not have the
appropriate electrical, ventilation systems, or other utilities adequate for
contemporary technology. With the growing interdependence among engineering
disciplines, research programs cannot excel if any of its components are unable
to reach their full potential. Funds from the Academic Research Infrastructure
Program will assist the institution in its endeavor to renovate antiquated
engineering research and research training facilities. Renovations include the
modernization of electrical, HVAC, and plumbing systems, provision of computer
network capabilities, and fixed equipment. In addition to enhancing current
engineering research programs, the improved facilities will promote thriving
interdisciplinary programs in robotics, and sensing, communication and
computing. Furthermore, the renovations will provide the required support that
will accelerate research in advanced materials and processing, advanced
manufacturing technology and environmental research.
