The object of this mathematical research is the analysis of certain singular
integral transforms and their mapping properties relative to various spaces of
functions. In particular, work will be done to establishing the boundedness of
such mappings in those cases where the kernel of the singular integral lacks the
smoothness necessary to be treated by classical techniques. These include
multilinear singular integrals called d-commutators and operators which fail to
carry the Hardy space into integrable functions or bounded functions into BMO.
Some progress has already been made. For example, a result similar to the now
standard David-Journe T1-condition has been developed which permits
consideration of very rough kernels. The work also lends itself to the
consideration of commutators of singular integrals with mixed homogeneity, in
particular parabolic homogeneity. Singular integral transformations form the
basis for much of the important work under active consideration in modern
harmonic analysis. Among the motivating forces behind these studies is the goal
for finding comprehensive techniques for solving broad classes of partial
differential equations. These equations arise as models of many important,
nonlinear physical phenomena.
