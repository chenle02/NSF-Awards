The thrust of this project is the preparation of a series of synthetic analogues
of methanobactin, a small copper-containing protein that is present in methane-
oxidizing bacteria and exhibits potent bacteriostatic activity. Several new
families of copper(I) complexes containing chelating bis(thione) and bis(selone)
ligands will be synthesized with the goal of understanding the influence of the
coordination environment on the high affinity that methanobactin exhibits for
extracellular copper. In addition, the potential antibacterial activity of these
compounds against S. aureus will be explored. The project is interdisciplinary
in nature, ranging from synthetic inorganic chemistry to microbiology, and will
attract students with a diversity of backgrounds and interests.

With this award, the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic (IBO) program is
supporting the research of Professor Daniel Rabinovich of the Department of
Chemistry at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. Professor
Rabinovich?s research efforts in synthetic and structural inorganic and
organometallic chemistry center on the application of a variety of sulfur-donor
ligands to the preparation of synthetic analogues of a variety of sulfur-rich
metallobiomolecules that are biologically active or mimic catalytic industrial
processes such as hydrogen generation.
