This is a study of the hydrothermal systems at the Ridge 2000 East Pacific Rise
Integrated Studies site at 9 degrees north. During the past decade pronounced
temporal variability in the hydrothermal fluids have been observed, and the
chemical data have been interpreted to suggest that the changes in fluid
composition reflect changes in the depth of hydrothermal circulation. Three
hypotheses will be addressed in the current project. Changes in the depth of
phase separation reflect changes in depth to the heat source. Magma has migrated
upward and will soon erupt and/or result in another diking event. Changes in
fluid compositions, reflecting changes in the pressure-temperature conditions of
reaction and phase separation, are the causes of changes in the biological
communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
