The objective of this research is to separate the effects on seismic surface
wave polarizations of lateral heterogeneity and azimuthal anisotropy in the
Pacific Ocean. Polarization anomalies are a good tool for detecting anisotropy.
The results will be mapped to see if anisotropy effects correlate to ocean floor
age. The successful development of this technique would be a real contribution
to our knowledge of anisotropy in the oceanic crust which is an important, but
neglected, effect on surface wave propagation.
