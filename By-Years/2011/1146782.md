During the early development of some animals, the secondary body axis is
patterned by a global signal, often called the embryonic organizer. This event
is crucial for the development of vertebrates including humans, but its origins
are unclear. Studies in several model organisms have suggested that the
Dpp/BMP2-4 signaling pathway is involved in this event, raising the possibility
that this pathway mediated organizer signaling in the last common ancestor of
animals. To establish this, the role of the pathway needs to be examined in the
large group of animal phyla known as the Spiralia. The embryo of the mollusc
Ilyanassa has important practical and experimental advantages, making it a
useful model for understanding development of the Spiralia. This group of
researchers has discovered that the Dpp/BMP2-4 pathway is mediating organizer
signaling in the Ilyanassa embryo, and they have evidence that the pathway is
also acting later to pattern the nervous system. This project will demonstrate
that Dpp/BMP2-4 signaling is mediating organizer signaling in Ilyanassa,
characterize the mechanisms of signaling, and establish the role of the pathway
in neural patterning later in development. These results will significantly
enhance our understanding of the role of the pathway in ancestral animals. The
work will also train young scientists at the graduate and undergraduate levels
for future careers as independent researchers and scholars. It will also involve
students at a nearby predominantly undergraduate institution, affording them the
opportunity for an in-depth research experience.
