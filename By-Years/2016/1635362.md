Long-term, unattended operation of oceanographic instrumentation is dependent on
the availability of power to operate the instruments. The PIs will investigate
new wave power conversion technologies for use in operating oceanographic
instrumentation at sea. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Current wave energy conversion
technologies make wave power bulky and uneconomical for oceanographic and ocean
science applications. The PIs request funding to investigate enhancements that
may enable integration of wave power conversion hardware into small
oceanographic buoys. The proposed effort represents a significant advance over
current wave energy conversion approaches and is expected to be an important
step towards making wave power utilization cost-effective for ocean sensing
applications.
