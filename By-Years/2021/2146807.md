The UN Ocean Decade began in 2021 to stimulate investment and transformation in
ocean science for the benefit of sustainable development and of diverse global
stakeholders. Many scientists and programs are struggling with how to do this,
including with building the right networks and partnerships. With this funding,
the Consortium for Ocean Leadership would organize and support a workshop to
bring together the U.S. leads of some of the observing programs recently
endorsed by the UN Ocean Decade. The focus will be on biological observing
programs (and components of programs) as a critical discipline that is currently
underrepresented in global ocean observing systems. The workshop will support
these programs in planning for how they will collaborate at a national level on
stakeholder engagement and co-design; data standards and access; technology
development and advancement; and outreach and
communications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
