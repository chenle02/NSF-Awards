This project goal is to investigate applications of stream- based functional
programming methodology to the implementation of multiprocessor based real-time
systems, and specifically to signal processing applications. The work is based
on the Sisal programming language. It will use Sisal's stream data types, static
analysis methods, and automatic mapping to map parallel computations on
processors in distributed computer systems. The Paradigm compiler will be
redesigned and extended to perform static analysis and mapping of continuous
stream processing computations. A related objective of this effort is to develop
analytical methods for performance modeling of stream-based computations on
multiprocessor systems. ***
