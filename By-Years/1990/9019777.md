The instrumentation to be developed consists of a custom-designed 16-channel
analog very-large-scale integrated (VLSI) circuit chip, an improved 64-lead
multiple-microelectrode plate (MMEP) assembly, and the necessary circuit boards
and controller units to incorporate four of the 16-channel chips for the sensing
and stimulation of action potentials in cultured neuronal networks. This
instrumentation will be used in the determination of basic neuronal network
organization and function through the analysis of stimulated and unstimulated
network output.
