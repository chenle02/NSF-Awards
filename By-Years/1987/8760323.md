The purpose of this fundamental engineering research is to modify the surface of
a polymer material, so that the material will have a surface which is
significantly more wear resistant than present materials made from polymers. The
surface will be altered by bombarding it with ions from different atoms such as:
neon, titanium, aluminum, chlorine and fluorine. The altered polymer materials
will be tested for changes in surface hardness, coefficient of friction and wear
resistance. If this technique is successful a new generation of polymer implants
could ensue.
