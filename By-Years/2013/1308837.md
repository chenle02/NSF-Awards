The goal of this proposal is to understand the Einstein constraint equations and
to explore new geometric properties of asymptotically flat manifolds. The first
part of the project continues the studies of the PI and co-PI on hypersurfaces
with nonnegative scalar curvature. They propose to classify scalar-flat
hypersurfaces and to apply the arguments to study the ADM mass inequalities. The
second part of the project studies the density theorems to the full Einstein
constraint equations and their relations to the global conserved quantities,
including center of mass and angular momentum. The proposed research will also
have applications to the complex Hessian equations which generalize the Calabi-
Yau equations on Kaehler manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project studies
several fundamental problems to better understand the analytical and geometric
structure of the mathematical models of our universe. The proposed techniques
connect different branches of mathematics and physics, including general
relativity, Riemannian geometry, complex geometry, and partial differential
equations. The new ideas have the potential for setting long-standing questions
in classical differential geometry. Moreover, the proposal will generate
research problems suitable for undergraduate and graduate students and lead to
research activities in the New England area to attract more students into the
current active research fields.
