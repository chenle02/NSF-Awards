This award supports Dr. Erhard W. Rothe of Wayne State University for several
trips to Goettingen, Germany, to collaborate in chemical physics research with
Dr. Peter Anderson of the Max Planck Institute for Flow Research. They are
studying interactions of pulsed ultraviolet laser light with molecules. One set
of experiments they will carry out involves laser preparation of single quantum
states and study of their subsequent interactions with molecules and/or with
other laser light. This requires the use of three lasers on the same experiment.
The second type of research is more applied and involves a new method, developed
at the Max Planck Institute, for laser analysis of combustion involving
laser.induced predissociative fluorescence (LIPF). Much remains to be done to
make a quantitative analysis system for a large number of species. This will be
the subject of joint effort. This collaboration offers the possibility of
enhancing automotive combustion diagnostics in the Detroit area through direct
experience with highly competent and well equipped German collaborators. Lasers
offer many desirable features for application to chemical diagnostics. They have
high intensity, narrow band.width, fast pulses and coherence. The light is
easily manipulated and focussed with mirrors and lenses. Appropriate
combinations of such desirable properties can be readily exploited. LIPF offer
the particular advantage that it can be quantitatively and simply used at
atmospheric and higher pressures, such as those that exist, for example, with
atmospheric flames or with internal combustion. Such techniques are particularly
promising when combined detector and computer technologies are applied to
combustion. These should, for example, lead to optimization of fuels and
minimization of pollutants by appropriate control and feedback technology. Such
quick, accurate and simple techniques are applicable to a variety of commercial
processes, including low and high temperature turbulent environments.
