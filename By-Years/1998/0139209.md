William Evans, University of California-Irvine, is supported by the Inorganic,
Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program for continuing studies of the
special reduction chemistry of the lanthanide metals. Specifically, he is
studying "sterically induced reduction", a recently discovered reaction observed
with (C5Me5)3Sm, a very crowded molecule with unusually long metal-carbon
distances. Evans hopes to extend this size-related reduction to other
lanthanides, which do not usually participate in reductive chemistry. The second
research area involves the chemistry of TmI2, DyI2, and NdI2, highly reducing
compounds that have only recently been prepared. The reactions of these divalent
lanthanides with nitrogen, small molecule oxides, and hydrocarbons will be
studied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The unique properties of the lanthanide
metals offer opportunities to develop new types of reductive reactivity. Since
reduction is one of the basic types of chemical reactions, this can broadly
impact both synthetic and catalytic chemistry. In addition, through this
research, students will be trained in the chemistry of the
f-elements.&lt;br/&gt;
