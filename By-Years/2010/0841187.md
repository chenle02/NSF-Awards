The Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program supports the
efforts of Professor Richard R. Schrock for the study of MonoAlkoxide Pyrrolide
(MAP) catalysts that contain molybdenum or tungsten. MAP catalysts are very
useful in olefin metathesis due to their unusually high reactivity and their
ability to exploit the chirality of the metal center. These catalysts are much
more stable, long-lived and reactive than previous generations. This research
focuses on maximizing the subtle steric interactions of the ligand coordination
sphere. New heterogeneous catalysts are prepared by attachment to silica
supports. The high oxidation state chemistry of compounds containing multiple
metal-carbon bonds has a significant impact on organic, polymer, pharmaceutical
and materials chemistries both in academic and industrial settings.
