During the last three decades both modern engineering and bioscience research
have witnessed experimental and theoretical advances which have led to the
emergence of nano- to microscale engineering and biomolecular research as major
focus for fundamental exploration and applications. This research is concerned
with the properties and interactions of biomolecular motors, ubiquitous
nanoscale protein machines that are principally responsible for nano- to
microscale transport processes insides eukaryotic cells. The hallmark of these
systems is their complex dynamics and organization which are widely believed to
be crucial for understanding, manipulating, and finally controlling these
systems for (bio-) technological use. The main goal of the work is to
characterize and exploit the nonlinear dynamic mechanisms which govern the
cooperative behavior of multiple molecular motors carrying a common
cargo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work will answer several crucial
scientific questions, and will impact a large number of applications.
Understanding how motor proteins function and cooperate to transport cargoes is
a key engineering element in applications such as drug delivery and design, and
has a strong potential to impact medicine (e.g.&lt;br/&gt;clinical paradigms and
treatments of an array of diseases such as Parkinson's and cancer). Such
understanding can be obtained by an approach such as proposed herein, where
quantitative, nonlinear dynamics approaches are used to solve this important
problem in cell biology. Also, the proposed work will provide fundamental
understanding and analysis tools for bio-mechano-chemical processes. The
proposal includes strong integrated educational components and outreach
activities.&lt;br/&gt;
