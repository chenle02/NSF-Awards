The scientists have several research goals. The first goal is ?Understanding the
causes of the very high speeds and directions of some stars in the outer reaches
of our Galaxy?. The second goal is ?Discovering the patters of motions of groups
of stars in disk of our Galaxy?. Their final goal is ?Searching for more of the
remarkable hypervelocity stars, which are probably ejected from groups of stars,
when pairs of stars collide?. These hypervelocity stars are being thrown out of
the galaxy.

The US scientists will observe 8 million Galactic stars from the Large Sky Area
Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) survey, a US-China
collaboration. The scientists will give the public lectures, to communicate
about the similarities and differences between life in Asia and the US,
including insights gained from creating a successful collaboration. Visiting
scholars will give presentations for US students on Asian history, culture,
language, and lifestyle.

Hypervelocity stars probe of a wide range of Galactic sciences, on both small
and large scales. The number density, velocity, and stellar type distributions
of HVSs can reveal the environment around the massive black hole at the center
of our Galaxy. Counting the number of hypervelocity stars gives clues to the
growth of the central black hole. By measuring the trajectory of these
hypervelocity stars, they measured the shape of dark matter halo potential of
the Galaxy.
