PRFB FELLOWSHIP: DEVELOPMENT OF NANOPARTICLE-BASED SENSORS WITH A NOVEL
MICROSCOPIC TOOL

Nanomaterials are often functionalized with biological ligands to enable their
use as sensors of biological activity. However, the intricacies of nano-bio
interactions are poorly understood, which hampers designing nanomaterial-based
sensors. To fill the need for the simultaneous study of nanoparticles and
biomolecules, the proposal awardee will construct a novel instrument for such a
purpose. This instrument will be used for the characterization of high-
sensitivity synthetic sensors, whose preparation depends on proper biomolecule-
nanoparticle conjugation. The design of synthetic sensors based on nanoparticle-
biomolecule hybrids is promising for areas in need of high-specificity sensing
tools, such as label-free detection of molecules within a cell, inexpensive
medical diagnostic tools, and nanoscale therapeutics.

A significant subset of the work to be done will be dedicated to the broader
impacts of the awardee?s research proposal. The awardee will participate in
conference committees dedicated to advancing the participation of minority
groups in science via peer-to-peer mentorship. To increase awareness of
underrepresentation in the sciences locally, the awardee will found a chapter of
the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans (SACNAS) at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Through SACNAS at MIT, the awardee will
organize and lead activities that encourage pre-college students to consider
careers in STEM. Lastly, the awardee will write and submit a grant to hold an
international conference on the topic of low-dimensional nanomaterials and
nanostructures. This conference will focus on increasing dialogue between
researchers in North, Central, and South America by encouraging discussions in
nanomaterial science that can be carried out in resource-limited countries.
