9301168 Mohler This research is on "intelligent control systems" with electric
power applications. Model-based nonlinear adaptive and optimal control
methodologies are to be used. Linear, bilinear, and higher-order nonlinear
approximations may be used. The potential role of artificial neural networks as
a means to adapt to state space changes resulting from switching events or
faults will be studied. Fast adaptation to structural changes of the system
being controlled is a key objective of the research. The investigator proposes a
hierarchial configuration in which an upper level consists of a statistical
detector and an artificial neural network classifier. The combination would act
to select the optimal control configuration to respond to changing power system
conditions. ***
