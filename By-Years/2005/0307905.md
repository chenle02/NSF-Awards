The unnaturalness of synthesized speech found in current interactive voice
response (IVR) systems is due to the lack of natural prosodic variation. While
state-of-the-art IVR systems are often highly intelligible and may sound natural
for short prompts or when the text to be spoken is close to speech recorded for
the system's database, once they deviate from these narrow bounds, results range
from "boring and mechanical" to "odd and confusing." To address these
deficiencies, the PIs are developing a new method for learning contour
assignment for dialogue systems that avoids the sparse data problem without
massive new annotation. They have generated a series of hypotheses about which
features of the dialogue context influence human speakers' choice of contour
from corpora and are testing these hypotheses via a series of targeted
laboratory experiments. By designing a carefully controlled set of production
and perception studies, the PIs will be able to determine which intonational
features prove to be most reliably correlated with contour choice and which are
perceptually most salient for listeners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From a practical
viewpoint, an IVR system that incorporates the appropriate assignment of full
intonational contours will greatly enhance the perceived naturalness of the
system. From a scientific viewpoint, such a model will expand our understanding
of how speakers use and hearers interpret intonational contour variation. From a
social viewpoint, the creation of IVR systems that interact with users naturally
will increase the acceptability of such systems, bringing the vision of
ubiquitous access to information and services for all closer to reality.
