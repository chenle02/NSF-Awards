This award supports a fundamental set of experiments in paleoclimatic research.
Isotopic paleodendroclimatology is founded on the assumption that wood cellulose
hydrogen and oxygen isotope ratios co-vary in a one-to-one fashion with those of
the water available to a tree. Qualitative and quantitative interpretations of
wood cellulose isotope ratios involve the further assumption that post-
photosynthetic processes do not affect cellulose isotopic compositions, and
predict that humidity will influence wood cellulose D/H and 180/160 ratios.
Neither of the assumptions may be valid, and the prediction of a humidity effect
may be incorrect. Experiments that will resolve these fundamental uncertainties
are to be performed with potatoes, avocados, the aquatic plant Lemna gibba, and
protoplasts cultured from a variety of tree species of interest to isotope
paleodendroclimatologists.
