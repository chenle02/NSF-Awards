The goals of this project are to estimate the ranges of plausible changes in
radiatively-active species in the tropical tropopause layer (TTL) in the zonal
average, particularly water vapor, ozone, and volcanic aerosols, and conduct an
initial analysis of the potential contributions of each to the radiative budget
of this region using a line-by-line radiative transfer code embedded in a
radiative-convective model. After consideration of zonally averaged changes,
regional changes in radiatively active species in the TTL will also be explored,
as preparation for a more detailed analysis of the implications of radiative
forcing for the coupling of TTL thermal structure changes to tropical cyclone
activity in all ocean basins. Understanding and being able to predict TTL
temperature changes have the potential to improve predictions of climate change,
as well as increase our ability to project changes in tropical cyclone activity.
This project thus has substantial broader impacts for society.
