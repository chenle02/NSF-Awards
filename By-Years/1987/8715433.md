Professor Naugle will study the superconductivity and electron transport in
amorphous transition metal alloys. Tunneling measurements, critical field and
heat capacity determinations will be made to investigate the variation of
superconductivity and the effects of localization. The determination of the
variation in the sign of the Hall coefficient will be emphasized in studies of
the electron transport phenomena. The use of the unique co-deposition and
extensive rapid solidification facilities is planned.
