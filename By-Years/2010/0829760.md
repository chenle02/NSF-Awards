It is said that the next ten years of advances in computer science could be far
more significant, and far more interesting, than the past ten. To achieve this
significant progress, there needs to be a concerted effort to attract a new
generation of students, especially those willing to obtain a Ph.D. The purpose
of this mentoring workshop is to attract and encourage women and
underrepresented minority (URM) computer science undergraduate students
(specifically those in their sophomore and junior years) and graduate students
enrolled in M.S. programs to obtain a Ph.D. in computer
science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will bring together researchers
(including women and URM&lt;br/&gt;leaders) from academia and industry to give
talks on the kind of research typically performed after obtaining a Ph.D. The
workshop will engage women and URM students specifically interested in systems
research in a process of imagining how they might make significant contributions
to the world through systems research. Researchers from several areas of systems
research will review past research and the current state-of-art, and will
present a number of future problems that we should be prepared to tackle in the
coming decade.&lt;br/&gt;
