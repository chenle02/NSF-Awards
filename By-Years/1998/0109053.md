This is a study of the mechanisms of formation of soot. Shock-tube experiments
designed to clarify he importance of several hypothesized pathways for single-,
double-, and multiple-ring systems are performed. Two different shock tubes are
used: a single-pulse, high-pressure shock tube with species analysis by sampling
and gas chronstography/mass spectrometry, and a "low pressure" shock tube
equipped for laser schlieren and laser flash absorption analysis. Systems
studied include the decomposition of 1, 5-hexadiyne, recombination of propargyl
radicals, reactions of benzyne generated by pyrolysis of phthalic anhydride, and
the chemistry of diacetylene and diacetylene/acetylene mixtures including
formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Elucidation of ring
formation pathways and the quantification of related kinetic parameters over
wide range of temperature and pressure leads to improved models of soot
formation.
