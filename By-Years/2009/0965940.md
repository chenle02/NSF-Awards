The University of San Diego (USD) is implementing the "Attracting students to
Computer Science, Mathematics and Physics at USD" by recruiting two cohorts of
nine students each who demonstrate financial need and academic excellence.
During the first semester at USD, the S-STEM scholars are taking an innovative
interdisciplinary preceptorial course. This course is focusing on physics topics
from mathematical modeling and computational science perspectives and is
illustrating the interconnections between these disciplines. Other support
structures for the scholars include close mentoring by the project faculty
throughout the scholar's undergraduate career, living-learning communities, the
opportunity to participate in undergraduate research or internships, and career
development workshops to assist in pursuing graduate school or industrial
careers. In addition, ongoing assessment during the life of the project allows
for mid-project corrections that is enhancing the experiences of the scholars.
By developing connections with area high schools, a pipeline is being
established that allows the project to target underrepresented students
(minorities, students from disadvantaged backgrounds and first-generation
college students). Currently, thirty percent of USD's 5,100 students are
students of color; thus, the plan to recruit 18 underrepresented students is
realistic.
