"Shearography", a laser interferometry technique, enables direct observation and
measurement of strain concentrations and variation of the displacement field.
Shearography performed with the aid of electronic image acquisition and
processing can eliminate the practical problems that have precluded the use of
other laser interferometry techniques for nondestructive inspection under field
conditions. Electronic Shearography (ES) is being tested as an inspection
technique for detecting cracking and other sources of stress concentration in
structures. The technique offers full- field inspection capability, can be
performed in real time, and is easily suited to automated computer aided data
analysis. The ES images, however, lack clarity due to their speckled nature, and
the technique currently lacks remote detection capability. This drawback has
seriously limited the scope of this technique. Using higher resolution for image
acquisition and processing will alleviate this problem. A newly developed
geometric filtering technique will be applied to reduce speckle noise.
Additional telescopic lenses will be used to facilitate remote measurements. The
combination of the hardware and software tools will result in excellent image
quality that will make this ES technique acceptable for field inspection of
civil engineering structures. The ES technique will then be evaluated during
field inspection of bridges, in conjunction with other state of the art
inspection techniques.
