The purpose of this project is to develop and distribute a complete kit for
starting and conducting an intervention program for high school students,
particularly minorities and women, considering a career in science and
mathematics. This kit, based on the San Antonio Prefreshman Engineering Program
(PREP), will consist of curriculum materials and operational materials. The
textual materials will include modules in Logic and its Application to
Mathematics, Problem Solving, Introduction to Engineering, Computer Science,
Algebraic Structures, Introduction to Physics, Introduction to Technical
Writing, and Introduction to Probability and Statistics--all of which are
academic components in the first, second, or third year of PREP and were
developed by the PREP writing teams. These teams consist of college and high
school teachers as well as some of the students who have gone through the PREP
program. The operational material will include program brochures, sample
application forms, follow-up survey forms, and statistical table forms. Copies
of this material will be made available at cost to those organizations
interested in starting such an intervention program. There will be a two day
workshop and a summer intern program to help those schools interested in such an
intervention program.
