The focus of this research is developing conditions which will make dimethyl
carbonate an industrially viable alkylating agent for the preparation of
quaternary ammonium salts. In a second part of the project, the products of the
alkylation reactions will be transformed into a series of salts with varying
counter ions. Thirdly, several biodegradable quaternary salts will be
constructed as possible alternatives to the environmentally less friendly salts
now used in commercial products. The project will serve as platform for the
education of undergraduate chemistry students. With this Technology for a
Sustained Environment award, the Synthetic Organic Program, as part of the
NSF/EPA Partnership, is supporting the research and educational activities of
Dr. Gary W. Earl of the Department of Chemistry at Augustana College. Professor
Earl will focus his work on developing new and viable methods for the production
of quaternary ammonium compounds. These compounds find wide industrial use as
components of products as diverse as fabric softeners to hair conditioning
agents. Undergraduate chemistry majors will be exposed to the constraints of
industrial processing, both equipment and reaction conditions, as well as
economic limitations.
