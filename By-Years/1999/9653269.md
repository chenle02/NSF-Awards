The Trainer System is a novel way to teach programming to beginners. This unique
approach stresses the development of programming fluency at a rudimentary level.
The Trainer system was designed to help even the weakest students master the
fundamental skills of algorithmic expression. Students who have used the Trainer
system consistently report that it was more helpful to them in learning
programming than anything else - more helpful than lectures, more helpful than
textbooks, more helpful than traditional programming homework. The Trainer
system includes closed lab software and a lab text. These components are
carefully integrated so that students get immediate practice with simple
programming constructs, as soon as those constructs are covered in the text. We
believe that systems developed from the current Trainer will be useful to other
four-year colleges, two-year colleges and high schools. The project will benefit
many students; not only computer science majors, but students from any of the
many different scientific and engineering disciplines that require elementary
computer programming competence.
