Arithmetic statistics is concerned with the fundamental objects of number theory
â€“ such as number fields and ideal class groups, and asks questions such as how
large they can be, or how common they are. It interfaces with a large number of
areas of ongoing mathematical research, including algebraic number theory,
algebraic geometry, representation theory, and Fourier analysis. The focus of
this project will be the study of a family of problems in arithmetic statistics
and applications to other problems in arithmetic statistics. The PI will
continue his development of coursework, with associated book projects, at both
the graduate and undergraduate levels, and the funding will also bolster the
intellectual atmosphere in his home department, by funding graduate students,
inviting visiting speakers, and assisting with the Columbia Math
Circle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technically, the research will focus on the
improvement of upper bounds and error terms in arithmetic statistics. One aspect
of the project will leverage the theory of Sato-Shintani zeta functions to
improve error terms in various number field counting results, bypassing a known
obstacle. A second aspect will bring harmonic analysis into Bhargava's averaging
method, again leading to stronger quantitative results (with partial overlap
with the first aspect). A third aspect aims to improve upon the best known
general upper bound for counting number fields, which is joint work of the PI
with Robert Lemke Oliver.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
