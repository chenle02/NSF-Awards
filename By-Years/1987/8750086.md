Radford University will purchase an automated land resources inventory and
analysis system and field surveying equipment. The data acquisition, data
analysis, and geographic information systems with their peripheral hardware and
software components will be used by undergraduate students at Radford University
as part of their educational program. These inventory and analysis systems are
used by scientists in many fields (geography, remote sensing, urban and regional
planning, environmental protection, civil engineering, transportation planning,
etc.) and are now being employed by private firms, governmental agencies,
academic research institutions, and educational institutions.
