Using assessment as the entry point, the Mathematics Assessment Resources
Service (MARS) group at Michigan State University, University of California-
Berkeley and the Shell Center at the University of Nottingham will create a set
of assessment-related "tools" for educators engaged in reforming mathematics
education in K-12 schools. Using a process of "co-development" with
participating client systems (e.g., New York City, Clark County, Pittsburgh, El
Paso, El Centro, Rhode Island) the project will create a set of specific tools
that address critical issues such as how to use assessment information
productively, designing effective professional development support around
assessment and communicating effectively with parents about data and testing.
The process of tool identification and development has been pilot-tested through
a prior grant.
