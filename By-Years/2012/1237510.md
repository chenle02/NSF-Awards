This grant will provide partial travel support for five U.S. students or post-
docs to attend the 2nd Beijing Normal University International School of Quantum
Gravity, to take place from August 13th to August 18th, 2012. The students will
be selected by a committee of leading experts in the field. These funds will
simultaneously aide these students and post-docs to optionally attend the XXIX
International Colloquium on Group-Theoretical Methods in Physics (GROUP29),
which will have a loop quantum gravity session, and which will be held from
August 20th to August 26th at the Chern Institute of Mathematics, Nankai
University, not far from Beijing.

The broad impact of this proposal will be in the preparation of human resources.
Most of the courses taught at the BNU school are not taught at U.S.
universities. Attendance at this type of conference is a formative event in the
preparation of the new generation of U.S. researchers in the field.
