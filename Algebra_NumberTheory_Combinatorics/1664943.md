This award supports travel for participants in the 4th Lake Michigan Workshop on
Combinatorics and Graph Theory, held at the Department of Mathematics at the
Western Michigan University on the weekend of April 15 and 16, 2017. The
workshop will benefit graduate students and early-career researchers in the
field of discrete mathematics, working at institutions in the area around Lake
Michigan. It will be built around two sets of three tutorial lectures, focusing
on classical techniques and results that the speakers feel are under-represented
in typical graduate sequences, and on emerging techniques on which the speakers
are particularly qualified to expound. There will also be some short talks by
less established researchers. A conference web page is maintained at
http://homepages.wmich.edu/~zyb1431/workshop2017/.

Combinatorics and Graph Theory are two very active areas of research within the
broader field of Discrete Mathematics, with important ties to disciplines such
as statistical physics and network science. In the immediate vicinity of Lake
Michigan there are a large number of researchers and students working on a
variety of graph theoretical and combinatorial problems. This workshop will
bring many of these workers together. Through tutorial lectures, short talks, an
open problem session, and informal collaboration time, the workshop will train
beginning researchers in important classical and emerging techniques of
Combinatorics and Graph Theory. The tutorial speakers will be Tom Bohman,
Carnegie Mellon University (who will speak on dynamic concentration in random
greedy processes) and Penny Haxell, University of Waterloo (who will speak on
edge coloring multigraphs).
