By the end of this decade, it is estimated that Internet of Things (IoT) could
connect as many as 50 billion devices. Near Field Communication (NFC) is
considered as a key enabler of IoT. Many useful applications are supported by
NFC, including contactless payment, identification, authentication, file
exchange, and eHealthcare, etc. However, securing NFC between mobile devices
faces great challenges mainly because of severe resource constraints on NFC
devices, NFC systems deployed without security, and sophisticated adversaries.

This project investigates three techniques to secure NFC: (1) energy-efficient
and fast key agreement mechanisms by exploiting full-duplex capability of NFC
devices; (2) RF signal randomization to provide NFC confidentiality without a
pre-shared key; and (3) a proximity verification mechanism defending against
relay attacks utilizing magnetic sensing. These techniques are expected to
significantly improve the key generation rate and reduce energy consumption
compared with the conventional Diffie-Hellman key agreement protocol, and
achieve high security and usability. These proposed techniques will be evaluated
through theoretical analysis, numeric simulation, testbed experiments, and user
study, and compared with conventional security mechanisms under different system
settings and conditions.

The proposed project will advance research on lightweight, energy-efficient, and
usable security mechanisms in mobile networks for IoT applications. The research
is applicable to important applications, such as mobile payment and access
control. Graduate, undergraduate, minority, and high school students will be
actively involved into the proposed research. The newly established Cyber
Security Engineering (CYSE) BS program at George Mason University will be
enriched through this project. Materials of this project will be made available
online in the forms of tutorials, talks, publications, and software toolkits.
