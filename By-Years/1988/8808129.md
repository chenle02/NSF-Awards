Evaluating the behavioral effects of drug administration is often a very
subjective event depending on the animals being tested and the behaviors being
observed. Dr. Patrick Randall is concerned with evaluating a variety of
mathematical models concerning the relationship between the dose of drug that is
administered to an animal, receptor occupancy, and behavioral responses to drug
administration. Much of the current behavioral research in pharmacology does not
benefit from the more sophisticated pharmacological techniques that can be used
for the analysis of neuropharmacological data. The work to be performed will
attempt to validate some of these techniques in a dopaminergic system, and to
use these approaches to characterize the receptor subtypes that are involved in
specific behavioral responses to dopamine agonists and/or antagonists. By
demonstrating the feasibility of this mathematical approach and perhaps by
developing computer programs by which such data can be readily analyzed it is
likely that Dr. Randall will provide means by which other behavioral
pharmacologists will be able to conduct and analyze experiments with a
considerably greater degree of sophistication.
