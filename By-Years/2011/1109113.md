This award will support a theoretical investigation into the explosions of
massive stars and how the properties of these stars can affect the early
evolution of supernova remnants. Dr. Plewa and his students will develop and
improve models that include neutrino-driven shock propagation, and will study
the details of the explosion mechanisms and shock breakout. The principal goal
of the work is to generate core-collapse supernova models in three dimensions to
account for the most relevant physics and the geometry of mass flows between the
core bounce and the early remnant phases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Plewa will
make models and data products available to the astrophysical community, which
will be useful for other research groups. The work will involve many aspects of
hydrodynamics, modeling of a wide range of physics, and high-performance
computing. This group will continue efforts to provide outreach opportunities
for undergraduate students, especially women and members of underrepresented
groups, and to communicate results to the general public.
