This project provides one-half the funds necessary to acquire a computer
workstation to be installed in the Department of Geological Sciences at the
University of Colorado. The workstation will be used primarily by the
crystallography and mantle petrology research group in Geological Sciences. It
will function as a storage and access device for a large accumulated data base
on mineral structures and sites; as a stand-alone computer for powder and
single-crystal x-ray structure refinements, electron diffraction and channeling
calculations, electrostatic energy calculations, and petrologic mixing model
calculations; and as a front-end for advanced crystal structure modeling
calculations on supercomputers.
