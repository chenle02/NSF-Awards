Prop: AST-0107800&lt;br/&gt;PI: Frye, Brenda&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr.
Frye is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship to
carry out a program of research, education, and public outreach at Princeton
University. Her research program focuses on efforts to measure the total mass of
a galaxy cluster, an important step in understanding the distribution of total
mass in the Universe. Clusters act like massive geometric lenses in space,
distorting the shapes and apparent positions of the light sources behind them.
One can map out the lensing galaxy by studying the effects of shear and
magnification. Using a technique developed in her previous work, she will now be
able to measure the magnification, which enlarges the total field of view and
increases the galaxy brightness. Coupled with measurements of the shear, these
determinations will lead to a unique measurement of total mass. Dr. Frye will
also undertake a three-year mentoring program for girls and young women designed
to encourage them in science and to identify the best ways of mentoring them.
