Title: Mathematical modeling of nano-patterns in electrochemical processes

ABSTRACT

This project is devoted to the mathematical modeling of nano-scale self-
organization and pattern formation in electrochemical processes. The focus is on
(i) electroconvection during anodic dissolution and the growth of anodic oxide
layers; (ii) the growth and stability of pores in dielectric and semiconductor
layers; (iii) the stability and nonlinear dynamics of pattern formation at
solid-solid interfaces in the presence of chemical reactions, electric field,
and elastic stresses. Mathematical techniques to be used are linear stability
and bifurcation analysis, asymptotic analysis, as well as numerical
implementations of boundary integral methods, phase-field models, and level-set
methods for free-boundary problems.

From the scientific point of view, the research is aimed at understanding the
basic physico-chemical mechanisms responsible for the formation of highly
regular nano-scale patterns in electrochemical systems. The goal of this project
is to develop mathematical models of the most important processes leading to
self-organization (pattern formation) on the nano-scale. These mathematical
models can be used in numerical simulations and thus enable the creation of a
new generation of electronic, opto-electronic, and magneto-electronic devices.
From the educational point of view, the proposed project, being essentially
interdisciplinary and devoted to the cutting edge of modern science and
technology, will attract graduate students who will be able to acquire knowledge
and research experience in several interconnecting scientific disciplines and
become capable of carrying out interdisciplinary research.
