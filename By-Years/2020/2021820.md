Axial Volcano is an active seafloor volcano located approximately 470 km (300
miles) west of the Oregon coast. The Ocean Observatory Initiative Cabled Array
has installed a number of instruments to monitor the volcano. The instrument
that is the focus of this work controls the drift of pressure gauges. By doing
so, the instrument can monitor the vertical movement of the volcano. In turn
this will contribute to a better understanding of the potential of an eruption
at this underwater volcano and thus, insight into potential natural hazards.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cabled Self-Calibrating Pressure Recorder (SCPR)
incorporates a hydraulic calibration system (deadweight tester), in order to
estimate and remove sensor drift. This instrument was developed and deployed in
previously funded NSF projects. The SCPR was installed in July 2018. This
project extends the measurements until 2024 to potentially capture a cycle of
inflation, eruption, subsidence, and repeated inflation. Continued deployment is
scientifically valuable and uses public investments and resources efficiently.
The continued deployment will serve complementary and independent
investigations, such as repeated pressure surveys of Axial volcano, drift
control of a co-located bottom pressure gauge, and a test of a different drift
control method for pressure gauges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
