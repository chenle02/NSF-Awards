work on three problems in the geometry of Banach spaces with a strong set
theoretic and/or combinatorial flavor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Firstly, the
principal investigator proposes to work on the classification problem of
complemented subspaces of the classical function space of continuous functions
on the unit interval, and in particular, on the fundamental question of
determining the subspace structure of all complemented subspaces with separable
dual.&lt;br/&gt;The problem is central mainly because of the importance of this
space in other parts of mathematics and of mathematical
physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Secondly, the principal investigator proposes to
continue his work on the existence of unconditional basic sequences in non-
separable Banach spaces. Any result establishing the existence of unconditional
basic sequences has immediate implications to the famous 'separable quotient
problem' posed by Stefan Banach and asking whether every infinite-dimensional
Banach space admits a separable infinite-dimensional quotient. Known results
indicate that the 'separable quotient problem' has the deepest set-theoretic
aspects among all problems in Banach space theory and is closely related to
infinite combinatorics and large cardinal axioms of set
theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Thirdly, the principal investigator proposes to
continue his work on applications of descriptive set theory to universality
problems in Banach space theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The project will promote
the deep interaction between logic and analysis, two major disciplines of pure
mathematics with far reaching applications ranking from theoretical computer
science to physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
