This work will be carried out to further our understanding of the mechanism of
O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase specifically and - replacement reactions catalyzed
by PLP enzymes in general. Two enzyme will be elucidated. The aspect will make
use of initial velocity studies to measure various values for inhibitors
competitive with the substrates as a function of pH. In addition, spectral
intermediates along the reaction proceeds. Second, the location and amount of
limitation of rate determining steps will be determined. These studies will make
use of primary and secondary deuterium, solvent deuterium and multiple isotope
effects and their ph dependence. The isotope effect data should allow
pinpointing the location of rate determining steps and permit a mechanistic
framework for interpretation of covalent catalysis. Finally, positional isotope
exchange in which the ester carbonyl oxygen is labeled with 180 will be used to
determine whether product release in the first half-reaction is partially or
completely rate limiting. The broad range of experiments proposed here is likely
to give considerable more detailed insight to the mode of action of this
important enzyme then is available today, and the prospect studies on the
catalytic consequences of protein- protein interaction gives the project and
additional dimension. Dr. Cook is well qualified to carry out this work.
