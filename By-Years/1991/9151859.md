The Geology Department is acquiring equipment for training in field methods in
hydrogeology. Students are using a borehole resistivity system to study the
geologic environment of groundwater; data collected through the use of the water
level meters, data loggers, and lysimeters enable them to understand the
conditions that result in groundwater flow and storage changes within the
subsurface. The equipment is also being used to detect groundwater contamination
and assess its severity and
