Warren 9729696 The deep hydrographic observations conducted on a Transindian
ocean section from Singapore to Mombasa, along 8 degree South as part of the
World Ocean Circulation Experiment will be analyzed. The first objective of the
study is to describe and estimate volume transports of the three systems of deep
western boundary currents in these latitudes. The second objective is delineate
the deep inflows to the Central Indian Basin across saddles on the Ninetyeast
Ridge and a possible outflow through a gap in the Chagos-Laccadive Ridge by
analyzing the data collected in three small, dense surveys.
