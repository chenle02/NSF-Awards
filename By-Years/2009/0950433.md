The Environmental Chemical sciences (ECS) program of the Division of Chemistry
will support the research program of Prof. Franz Geiger of Northwestern
University. Prof. Geiger's research program focuses on the application for the
first time of a unique spectroscopic method, named the Eisenthal chi(3) method,
to study the adsorption of metal cations on mineral surfaces. The Eisenthal
chi(3)method is uniquely sensitive to the interfacial potential and can be
viewed as an Optical Voltmeter. If successful, the study will provide
environmental scientists with a new and widely applicable tool for studying ion
adsorption on mineral surfaces. The project has the potential to transform our
understanding of interfacial phenomena in complex environmental systems. The
project will provide excellent educational opportunities for trainees desiring
to work at the forefront of environmental science.&lt;br/&gt;
