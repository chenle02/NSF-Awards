The "Rocky Mountain Summer School 2012: Mathematical Modeling in Ecology and
Epidemiology," will be held at the University of Wyoming in Laramie during June
11-22, 2012. This summer school brings together students from diverse
backgrounds in ecology, epidemiology, and mathematical sciences, and provides
focused training in mathematical modeling at the interface between life sciences
and mathematical sciences. Close daily interactions with a group of leading
scientists through class lectures, guided hands-on experience and independent
group projects will not only enable trainees to learn the language and basic
skills for effective cross-discipline communication and collaboration in
critical emerging fields, but will also uniquely position trainees to advance
their career goals in an increasingly interdisciplinary scientific community.
This summer school also enhances local interactions by bringing together
mathematics, life sciences, and the new supercomputing center at the University
of Wyoming.

The purpose of the summer school is to provide effective training for
collaborative research in ecology and epidemiology using mathematical modeling
and qualitative analysis. Our goal is to educate students of mathematics and
statistics to address issues of great importance in ecology and epidemiology,
and to educate biologists as to why and how mathematical and statistical
techniques and tools are useful. Students in the mathematical and biological
sciences will learn how to communicate with one another, preparing them not only
to build models in ecology and epidemiology, but also to be ambassadors capable
of teaching others how to cross the boundaries between biology and mathematics.
It is also hoped that students brought together in this intense learning
environment will develop future collaborations.
