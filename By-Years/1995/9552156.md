This course is designed to unveil physics to students in introductory physics
laboratory by teaching them to discover it on their own. The University
Versatile Eclectic Introductory Laboratory (UNVEIL) course combines several of
the most effective current laboratory teaching methods into one course designed
to (1) meet the needs of both premedical students and science/engineering
students who are mixed together in sections of lab; (2) use technology both to
teach physics and to introduce students to professional-level equipment; (3)
employ successful pedagogy to maximize physics understanding. Computers and
self-discovery pedagogy allow for a versatile laboratory where students in the
same room can perform different experiments. UNVEIL combines Socratic guidance,
self-discovery, computer technology, and modeling methods to create a more
effective lab environment. Equipment and software have been selected that can
largely be used by both groups of students, with each group performing some
specifically tailored experiments. Newly developed, versatile physics laboratory
equipment, along with Power Macs, LabVIEW data acquisition software,
Mathematica, and other software are used. The laboratory course is one in which
students, armed with the laboratory manual, can select appropriate equipment and
design an experiment (with Socratic guidance from the instructor and TAs) to
examine the subject. With the computer, students acquire data or enter data
acquired manually, plot graphs, and look at computer modeling of physical
phenomena.
