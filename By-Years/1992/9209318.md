During the preschool years, children begin to learn that what they believe or
what they see may not always be true. This insight provides the basis for
understanding many kinds of behavior. For example, understanding that a person
might have a belief that is false (e.g., believing her coat is in the closet
when actually it is on the bed), that people may be confused by misleading
appearances, and that two people viewing the same event may interpret it in
different ways all require children to realize that mental representations do
not always correspond to the actual state of the world. This research will
explore the possibility that children first master the distinction between
mental representations and reality in the domain of pretense. Children's ability
to maintain a boundary between what is real and what is pretend will be
investigated in three experiments in which 3- and 4-year-old children will be
asked to imagine a variety of objects under different conditions. In addition,
150 children aged 3 years 6 months, four years, and four years six months will
be given tasks assessing their ability and inclination to engage in pretense and
their implicit knowledge about mental life. Children who are particularly
inclined to engage in pretense are expected to be better able to make a clear
distinction between what is imagined and what is real and to be advanced in the
development of insight about the mind (e.g., an earlier understanding that
people may have false beliefs). Children will also be asked questions about
their fantasy lives, including the existence and characteristics of imaginary
companions. Thus, in addition to investigating how early fantasy is related to
cognitive development, this research will provide descriptive information about
a spontaneous form of elaborate pretense that is common (65% of preschool
children have imaginary companions), but is not well understood.
