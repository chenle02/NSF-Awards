Throughout the developing world, governments have instituted large irrigation
projects and new land policies in hopes of increasing food production. Although
this goal often has been achieved, a consequence of these policies has been a
disruption of traditional land-tenure practices and a degradation in the quality
of the land itself. This doctoral dissertation research project will analyze the
processes of tenure-system change and land degradation in the Senegal River
Valley of Damga province in northern Senegal. Patterns of tenure change and land
degradation will be documented and analyzed using a variety of data sources,
including published and archival records, field observations, soil tests,
geneological studies, aerial photographs, interviews, and oral histories.
Qualitative analyses of physical conditions and of historical and cultural
attributes will permit refinement and testing of a model that focuses on how
individuals and groups relate to and make decisions about land and related
natural resources. This research will provide a well-constructed and thoroughly
documented case study of how persons engaged in cultivation and pastoral
activities respond to changes in land-tenure systems. This case study will
enhance theoretical understandings about this topic, and it will provide an
excellent opportunity for a promising graduate student to expand and refine her
basic research skills.
