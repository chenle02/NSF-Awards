In a variety of applications in modern science and technology, there is a strong
need in accurate statistical inferences from massive sets of high-dimensional
data. To meet this need, it is a must to develop novel methods combining
provably (nearly) optimal statistical performance with computational efficiency
and scalability. The project aims at designing innovative Convex Optimization
based inference techniques meeting the above requirements and utilizing these
techniques in important applications (Positron Emission Tomography, Nanoscale
Fluorescent Microscopy, Quantum Statistics,...). Challenges to be addressed
combined with clear "applied appeal" make the project a good training ground for
Ph.D. students. Project?s outcomes could make a valuable contribution to the
computational tools of "Big Data."

The approach is based on designing statistical tests with near-optimal risk for
multiple composite hypotheses in a class of statistical models where observation
is: (a) affine image of unknown vector ("signal") corrupted by Gaussian noise;
(b) random vector with independent Poisson entries, the underlying parameters
being affine functions of the signal; (c) random variable taking finitely many
values with probabilities affinely depending on the signal; (d) direct products
of models (a) - (c). While restrictive with respect to the allowed models, the
approach is highly permissive with respect to the number and the structure of
the hypotheses. The proposed efficiently computable and scalable tests and their
risks stem from optimal solutions to explicit convex programs, and can be used
as building blocks in more complicated inferential problems. The research agenda
includes the design of sequential tests and dynamical tests; change point
detection; estimating functionals of a signal; "sparsity-oriented"
testing/estimation; applications to Poisson Imaging, Active Learning, and
Quantum Statistics.
