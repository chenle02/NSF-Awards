Novel approaches to reconstruction of two dimensional signals observed under
additive noise are investigated. The techniques make use of third-order
statistics and their noise insensitivity and phase preserving properties.
Conditions and algorithms for reconstruction of two-dimensional signals from the
fourier transform of the third-order statistics (bispectra) are investigated.
Advantages and disadvantages of the proposed method with other existing methods
are established through theoretical analysis and simulation. The techniques are
applied to image registration and reconstruction of moving objects.
