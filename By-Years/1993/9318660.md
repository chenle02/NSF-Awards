9318660 Rincon The subject of this research is the relationship between
aluminum (Al) accumulation and the sensitivity of plants to this element. The
goals of this project are: (1) to determine whether or not Al accumulation in
the root meristems of wheat correlates with differential sensitivity to Al; (2)
to explore mechanisms of Al uptake in the root meristems at tissue and cellular
levels; (3) to explore whether mobilization of Al out of the root tissue and
cells plays a role in Al tolerance mechanisms; (4) to investigate the nature of
Al transport at the organ and cellular level; (5) to define the effects of Al on
the uptake and distribution of ions in the root tips. These objectives will be
achieved by using intact and excised wheat root tissue and isolated protoplasts.
Analyses of Al content in the tissues and protoplasts will be performed by
specific ion chromatography. Overall, the findings of this investigation may
lead to a better understanding of Al stress tolerance mechanisms. ***
