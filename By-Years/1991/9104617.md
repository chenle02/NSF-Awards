Well-exposed, thick, marine stratigraphic sections with an abundance of both
endemic and cosmopolitan Cambrian fossils are present in western Hunan, China.
Such sections are exceptionally rare for the Cambrian System. Detailed
collaborative study of the paleontology, biostratigraphy, and depositional
environments of these Chinese sections is proposed. Reconnaissance sampling will
also be made for stable-isotope analyses. With such study, the sections are
expected to become important references for global biostratigraphic correlation,
and possible stable-isotope correlation. They also are expected to be strong
candidates for selection by the International Commission on Stratigraphy as
world stratotypes for some stage and series boundaries within the upper half of
the Cambrian System, and possibly as a stratotype for the Cambrian-Ordovician
boundary.
