The objective of this US-Poland research project between Dr. Robert T. Siegel
of the College of William &amp; Mary and Dr. A. Adamczyk of the Institute of
Nuclear Physics, Cracow, Poland is to calculate a complete set of those muonic
differential cross-sections which are relevant to muon catalyzed fusion and weak
interaction physics. The planned calculations are based on the development of
numerical methods for estimation of the molecular binding, spin correlations,
and electron screening effects in the scattering of muonic hydrogen atoms on
hydrogen molecules. The numerical methods for these calculations were developed
over many years in Poland. As a result of the project, the researchers plan to
complete an altas of the up, ud and ut mesic atom scattering cross sections on
the ground and excited states of all the molecular targets of hydrogen isotopes
H2, D2, and T2. These results will provide the final information necessary to
the detailed analysis of already performed and planned experiments by an
experimental collaboration between William &amp; Mary, PSI (Switzerland), IMEP
(Austria) and Munich (Germany). This project in physics fulfills the program
objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the
United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool
resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
