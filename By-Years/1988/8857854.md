This research deals with the mechanical interaction of parts with each other
and with a robot during an assembly operation. Since friction is an important
element of these interactions, techniques will be developed to exploit friction,
enhancing both the capabilities and the reliability (robustness) of robotic
assembly operations. One technique involves force-controlled manipulation in
which the relationship between the force sensed by the robot arm and the
displacement of the arm from a nominal position can be specified. A theoretical
understanding of assembly operations performed by a force-controlled robot will
be sought, with the objective of finding and implementing algorithms for the
automated planning of such assembly operations. The important, but more
difficult, inverse problem of designing parts which are easy to assemble will be
considered.
