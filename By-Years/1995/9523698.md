9523698 Lander A history of the occurrence and effects of previous tsunamis is
the essential starting point in devising an effective mitigation plan and a
component of many research efforts. This project will produce a catalog which
will consist of descriptions and summaries of all tsunamis since the last one
was completed in 1982, and include selected marigrams, tables of heights and
effects, location maps, photographs, descriptions and references. It will be
organized chronologically, but indexed geographically. Data will be sought from
various published sources. The catalog will have uses for planners, and add an
important period to the cataloged history for those who need long histories, and
provide a easily accessible source of data and references for other scientific
users. ***
