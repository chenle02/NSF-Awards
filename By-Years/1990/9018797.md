We developed a unique system with which to examine the biogenesis of
chloroplast thylakoid membranes. A major complex of the thylakoid membrane is
the light-harvesting chlorophyll (chl) a/b- proteins complex (LCH-2). Formation
of this complex during development of the chloroplast in the alga Chlamydomonas
reinhardtii y-1 can be measured after exposure to light. Electron microscopy of
such cells has revealed that the site of initial assembly of the membranes is at
the level of the chloroplast envelope. The project will focus on the Chl-binding
apoprotein of LCH-2 (LCHP), which will be studied to determine the site and
mechanism of integration of the protein into the membrane and interaction of the
protein with Chl. Oligonucleotide-directed mutations will be generated in the
cabII-1 gene encoding this protein. After transformation, cells will be isolated
that express the mutant gene. The fate of the wild-type and mutant LCHPs will be
examined kinetically in an in vivo context. These results will markedly enhance
understanding of membrane assembly. Biological membranes are essential to life.
They form a barrier between the cell and the environment and also divide the
cell into various compartments with specialized functions. The maintenance of
differ environments on different sides of a membrane are essential for
respiratory energy production in organelles known as mitochondria and for
chemical energy production from light during the process of photosynthesis in
organelles known as chloroplasts. The ability of these specialized membranes to
carry out these essential functions is based on the complex structure of the
membranes which includes complexes of lipids, proteins, pigments and low-
molecular weight electron carriers. This proposal will address the fundamental
question of how such complex membranes are assembled.//
