The investigators are leading the "Survey of the MAgellanic Stellar History"
(SMASH), a project to observe two nearby dwarf galaxies, visible in the southern
hemisphere. These dwarf galaxies, called the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds
(LMC and SMC), are a unique local laboratory for studying the formation and
evolution of galaxies in exquisite detail. The investigators' goal is to observe
the debris left over from star formation in these galaxies. Using these
observations, they will learn the history of formation of these dwarf galaxies
and determine what type interactions these galaxies have had with our Milky Way
Galaxy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators are working with the Zooniverse
team, which connects research scientists with the volunteers in the general
public that want to help with research. The team will organize the data in a way
that allows non-experts to group the stars into different categories, using web-
based tools. The Zooniverse software tools help researchers make progress, while
making the process enjoyable for the volunteers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A decade
ago, the interaction history of the Magellanic Clouds was thought to be well
understood, with only minor details remaining to be explained. However, in the
last decade, several important discoveries have been made which raise fresh
questions about their structure and past history. The observations indicate LMC-
SMC interactions alone are responsible for the formation of the Magellanic
Bridge, Stream, Leading Arm and neutral hydrogen extending half way across the
sky. These results point to a much richer and more complex structure than was
imagined just a few years ago. The investigators observations will uncover the
vast, but low surface brightness, stellar structures in the Magellanic periphery
and thereby unravel the complex interaction history of the Clouds.
