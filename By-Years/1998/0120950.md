This award will establish a Center for Integrated Space Weather Modeling (CISM).
The overall goal of CISM is to develop advanced computer models to specify and
predict space weather from the surface of the sun to the surface of Earth.
"Space Weather" is a term rapidly entering the common lexicon. It describes the
ways in which the Sun, acting through the intervening space encompassing the
solar wind, the magnetosphere, and the upper atmosphere, adversely affects the
performance and reliability of space borne and ground based technological
systems, or can endanger human life or health. CISM will focus on building a
comprehensive, physics-based, numerical model that describes the environment
from the Sun to the Earth, and can predict arrival time, intensity and duration
of space storms. The Center will achieve three complementary goals: 1) it will
do fundamentally new science, increasing our understanding of the complex, but
closely coupled Sun-Earth system; 2) in partnership with other groups, it will
convert the results of its research into robust and operationally useful
forecasting tools to be used by both civilian and military space weather
forecasters; and 3) it will educate the next generation of space scientists -
taking advantage of the ability of space weather to capture imaginations through
models and visualization tools. The principal knowledge transfer goal of CISM is
to convert research results and models into robust operationally useful
forecasting tools to be used by space weather forecasters and private industry.
The most important legacy of the center will be improvements in the ability to
respond to potential space weather hazards, thus protecting the nation's
technological systems that are increasingly susceptible to conditions in the
space environment.
