How can treatment/intervention effects in a complex social environment be
measured? How can single-cell data be used to diagnose complex diseases such as
autism spectrum disorder? This project aims to address these questions by
developing statistics and machine learning methods that enable robust,
interpretable, efficient, and fast analysis of big datasets routinely produced
in biology, neuroscience, social sciences, politics, and epidemiology. The
project encompasses two main tracks: (1) structured analysis for large datasets,
for which the goal is to devise methods that can make efficient use of the
intrinsic structure of the possibly very high-dimensional data without having to
estimate the structure first; and (2) analysis of large count datasets, for
which the goal is to design robust nonparametric models and algorithms that can
handle complex, likely heterogeneous, count data. The investigator also plans to
mentor and support graduate and undergraduate students majoring in statistics
and related fields and broaden the participation of underrepresented minority
students.

This project will advance the current state of knowledge in big structured and
count data analyses by putting forward two main tracks of studies. The first is
centered on random graph-based statistical inference through nearest neighbors
(NN) or minimum spanning tree. Two main working examples in this track are NN
matching for inferring the average treatment effect and graph-based correlation
coefficients to infer marginal and conditional dependence strength. The
investigator aims to revise and generalize these two families of methods to
boost their efficiency while maintaining their robustness and computational
speed. The second is centered on nonparametric univariate or multivariate
Poisson mixture models. The investigator aims to bridge heterogeneous count-
valued mixtures to nonparametric models (e.g., fully nonparametric, shape-
constrained, nonnegative matrix factorization-based, etc.) under the umbrella of
heterogeneous mixture model-based inference. The investigator will explore and
settle several theory, method, computation, and application questions in the two
tracks. Some preliminary results made in the first track have already stimulated
new work in the causal inference community, and the results produced from the
second track are expected to help with the early diagnosis of autism.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
