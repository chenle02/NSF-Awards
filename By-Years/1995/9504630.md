Dr. David L. Patrick has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Patrick received his doctoral degree from the University of Utah
under the supervision of Professor Thomas Beebe, Jr. Dr. Patrick will continue
research at Cambridge University in Cambridge, England, under the sponsorship of
Professor Ian McDonald and additionally Professor Ruth Lynden-Bell of Queen's
University in Belfast. His postdoctoral research will target modelling of
chemically-specific atomic force microscopy investigations of monolayer films.
The research involves a set of computer-based simulation studies designed to
improve our understanding of the interactions of a chemically-modified probe tip
with adsorbed molecules. The goal is to understand, using molecular dynamics
simulations, the respective roles of adsorbate chemical functionality, solvent
type, and the chemical structure of a probe tip on the forces measured in atomic
force microscopy experiments. The theoretical studies will be augmented by
collaboration with experimentalists conducting atomic force microscopy-based
studies on mixed monolayer systems. The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in
Chemistry Program is viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to
broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph. D.s and attract them into
meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and teaching.
