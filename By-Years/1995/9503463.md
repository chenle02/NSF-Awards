This research is on techniques for testing VLSI circuits directly at functional
levels, while ensuring that standard testing quality goals are met. A high-level
fault model called the induced functional fault (IF) model is being
investigated. With this model, an IF fault class can be coupled to a physical
fault class so that detection of IF faults ensures detection of physical faults.
Advantages of this approach are easy derivation of near- minimal test sets, and
reuse of tests in other circuits. The construction, use and reuse of precomputed
tests for sequential circuits are being explored. In this regard, the
application of balance and functional properties to simplifying test generation
and improving fault coverage are being studied. Built-in self- testing methods
that facilitate the implementation of functional testing methods and the
detection and elimination of design errors are also being explored.
