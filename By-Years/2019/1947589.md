Personalized learning applications can guide students for achievement that
connects a broad partnership ecosystem and links students with work-based
learning experiences. The proposed conference titled "Broadening Participation
in Computer Science: Using Technology to Accelerate Collective Impact" will
bring together regional constituents in order to share early project results.
This work will be used to develop, unite and leverage the partners and
stakeholders necessary to scale students' engagement into computing as well as
align the interests of the regional invitees from corporations, foundations,
educational institutions, government, and non-profits. Conference attendees will
all receive a conference final report summarizing the key findings from each
conference session in order to help them make improvements in the intentionality
of their programs, partnerships and resources.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
