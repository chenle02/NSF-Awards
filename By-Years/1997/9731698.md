Thorne, Kip AST 97-31698 Dr. Thorne will carry out a program of theoretical
research addressing issues in the generation of gravitational waves by
astrophysical objects and in relativistic astrophysics. The gravitational wave
research, which makes up the majority of the research program, will focus on
waves detectable by LIGO (the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave
Observatory). Thorne and his research group will identify what wave-generation
computations are needed for LIGO and will carry out some of these computations,
and give advice on others to other researchers. Thorne's work is particularly
concerned with waves produced by the inspiral and merger of binary systems made
of black holes, neutron stars, and hypothetical compact objects, such as boson
stars, soliton stars, and naked singularities. The calculations will produce
detailed, high-accuracy waveforms, computed by solving the Einstein field
equations for the binaries' inspiral, merger, and ringdown, which will provide
guidance for the search and extraction of information from LIGO data. ***
