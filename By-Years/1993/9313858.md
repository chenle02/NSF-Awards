9313858 Rus This proposal is for the first of a series of international
workshops on algebraic methods and real-time systems in cooperation with the
Algebraic Methods and Software Technology(AMAST) conferences. This workshop
would be hosted in the United States to foster collaboration in this research
area among US, Canadian, and ESPRIT computer scientists. The goals of the
workshop are to provide a forum for bringing together practitioners in real-time
systems development and theoreticians in algebraic methods, to develop
directions for the unification of these fields, and to integrate the software
development practices. The results of this workshop are expected to contribute
to progress in algebraic methods for real-time and computer controlled systems.
Support for this workshop will ensure publication and distribution of the
workshop results.
