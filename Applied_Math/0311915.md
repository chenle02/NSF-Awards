The PI will develop and analyze fast and accurate spectral methods for solving a
large class of partial differential equations and apply them to investigate
several important problems of current interest, including in particular the
inter-facial dynamics of multiphase complex flows, stability and dynamics of
stratified shear flows and micro-structural evolutions in advanced materials
processing. The proposed research will result in fast and accurate numerical
algorithms which will allow simulations of three-dimensional time-dependent
problems within a reasonable turn-over time, and provide capabilities to
numerically attack challenging problems arising from emerging engineering and
scientific applications.

As computer simulations are playing an ever increasing role in many branches of
science and engineering and are rapidly replacing much of the expensive
prototyping and testing phases in manufacturing and in science explorations,
fast and robust numerical methods are becoming an indispensable tool for many
scientists and engineers, especially for computational scientists in fluid
dynamics and materials science. It is expected that our numerical simulations
will contribute towards better understandings of the complex physical and
mathematical problems, and provide valuable information for the designs of
advanced materials and of a space experiment on stratified shear flows.
