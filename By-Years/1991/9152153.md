A new astronomical observatory at Bennington College equipped through this
project provides undergraduate students at all levels with an enriching
experience in observational astronomy. The centerpiece is a high quality, easy
to use, computer- controlled reflecting telescope. It is equipped with a CCD
camera and photometer. Beginning students are able to find and observe more
celestial objects, while more advanced students are able to complete laboratory
projects in astrophotography and photometry in conjunction with advanced
courses, and undergraduate thesis students use it for research projects such as
studying variable stars. This observatory enriches the whole physical science
curriculum at the college. In addition, the observatory is a community resource
through programs for local elementary and secondary schools and for in-service
training of teachers in those schools.
