The goal of this project is to develop a scaleable fault tolerance framework
that can be customized to economically cover a wide range of fault models,
applications, and computational environments. The system is based on the
N-modular redundancy (NMR) concept to uniformly handle all types of failures. A
specialized NMR (SNMR) protocol that can tolerate malicious failures has been
developed to improve the system performance and to enhance its scalability. In
this research, the SNMR protocol will be enhanced in several ways, including
adaptations for wide- area network applications and for efficiently tolerating
general and fail-stop failures. By adjusting the parameters, such as the
replication level and error-checking algorithms, the system can be customized to
satisfy various application requirements and cost constraints. A prototype of
the SNMR core will be implemented in the two-year period. The customizability,
applicability, performance, fault coverage, and scalability of the SNMR system
will be thoroughly studied and compared with existing approaches. ***
