9512867 Lazen This award will provide partial support of an 18 month study by a
study committee to be convened by the National Research Council. The study
committee will construct a comprehensive data profile of the career paths of
recent Ph.D. recipients in the life sciences. The committee will use the profile
to identify trends and potential implications, if any, for both the government
and institutions in development of new policies and practices intended to foster
research and education in the life sciences. ***
