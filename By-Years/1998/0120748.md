The proposed continued affiliation is considered crucial to the mission of the
Center in at least three ways. First, the affiliation adds immeasurably to the
credibility and salability of the Center to prospective members of the U.S.
Glass industry and the continuation of the present members. Second it allows the
NSF to carry out an annual evaluation of the Center (a total quality management
function). Third, it permits the Center Directors to participate in the national
I/UCRC meetings and programs offered by NSF. Beyond this, of course, the
additional funding from NSF relieves some of the financial burden of Center
administration from the members and university.
