9704174 Feehan The project lies in the interface of geometric topology and
mathematical physics. Specifically, the investigator is to establish the
equivalence between Donaldson and Seiberg-Witten invariants for smooth four-
manifolds. The investigator is to use the approach first suggested by
Pidstrigach and Tyurin, which is based on non-quantum ideas. The tools to be
used for implementing the Pidstrigach-Tyurin approach include Taubes's gluing
maps and nonabelian monopoles. Smooth four-dimensional spaces have received a
great deal of attention in recent years due to their applications in relativity
theory and due to a recent mathematical discovery allowing their coarse
classification. It is notable that instantons and monopoles, two major
ingredients in the classification of smooth four-manifolds, both were originally
introduced by the physicists studying elementary particles.
