In response to a recent decline in requests for UNOLS facilities, two separate
Chief Scientist&lt;br/&gt;Training Cruises are proposed on an Intermediate
General Purpose Research Vessel to serve&lt;br/&gt;as forums for teaching early
career marine scientists how to effectively plan for, acquire,&lt;br/&gt;utilize
and report on time at sea for multi-disciplinary research and educational
activities.&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this program will develop from
opportunities given to new investigators&lt;br/&gt;to test compelling research
ideas, work collaboratively, use equipment, and acquire
samples&lt;br/&gt;critical for developing future oceanographic field
programs.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts are that as many as 28 new investigators
will be trained in the mechanics&lt;br/&gt;of leading expeditionary ocean
research while coming to understand how oceanographic
research&lt;br/&gt;infrastructure is scheduled, maintained and upgraded. They
will also be exposed to standard&lt;br/&gt;sets of observations appropriate to a
variety of oceanographic disciplines (e.g., physical,&lt;br/&gt;chemical,
biological and geological oceanography) inspiring new ideas for research and
the&lt;br/&gt;transfer of science information to the public.
