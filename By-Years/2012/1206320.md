NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: Oxide surfaces are increasingly important for both
scientific and technological areas ranging from more energy-efficient catalysts
to new types of electronic devices. Currently not enough is understood about the
structure of oxide surfaces to predict what type of materials will be best for
future needs. This project is developing tools to understand both the structure
of oxide surfaces, as well as how they react with gaseous species. The tools
that are developed can then be used by others who are designing interfaces
involving these systems, or are exploring their use in new fuel cells, more
efficient water-splitting catalysts or substrates upon which to grow new types
of oxide-based electronic devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS: The
strategy employed combines extended density-functional theory (DFT) methods
including exact-exchange hybrids and the bond-valence chemical concepts in a
combined experimental-theoretical approach exploiting some unique ultra-high
vacuum (UHV) electron microscopy facilities. The main experimental tools are
transmission electron microscopy imaging and diffraction to solve the surface
structures. In addition to using DFT methods for the surface structures found,
the research team is expanding the database of published atomic positions and
tests of the bond-valence approach by performing calculations on other oxide
surfaces where full details of the atomic positions are not publically
available. One additional component is developing algorithms for DFT and related
optimization codes, particularly quasi-Newton methods. The software for DFT has
already been incorporated into one large package used by more than 1800 groups
around the world (www.numis.northwestern.edu). In terms of education, the
research helps support both local outreach to high-school students as part of
existing programs, as well as more international efforts involving the general
public license (GNU) software electron direct methods (edm).
