This is a long-term investigation of the effect of variation in fuel properties
on the emissions and performance of single- cylinder and multicylinder diesel
engines. In particular, the mutagenic activity of the organic material found in
diesel soot will be studied. A variety of operating conditions will be tested in
a high temperature, high pressure turbulent flow combustor. The cooperation of a
leading US engine manufacturer has been established. The data base to be
collected from these experiments will allow for the design of efficient and non-
noxious diesel engines. It will also broaden the current knowledge of fuel
properties for a new range of chemicals and operating conditions. The
understanding of soot generation is of particular interest to many other forms
of combustion as well (fires, jet engines ...).
