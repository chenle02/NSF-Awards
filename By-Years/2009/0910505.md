University of Hawaii proposes to support technical services on R/V Kilo Moana
(KM), a 185? general purpose research vessel operated as part of the University-
National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. The proposal requests
support for basic services and specialized services. For basic services, they
will provide two shipboard technicians on each cruise of R/V Kilo Moana to
support seagoing research projects and to maintain, calibrate and provide for
qualified users items from their pool of shared-use research instrumentation.
The Institution also supports some operations on the Research Vessel Ka`imikai O
Kanaloa (KOK), which is not a UNOLS vessel, but does support some federally
sponsored research, including some for NSF. As part of basic services, they will
maintain and operate a multibeam sonar system (both 12 kHz and 95 kHz
instruments are available) on the KM. As specialized services, they offer two
towed seafloor mapping systems (HAWAII MR1 and IMI-30) for shallow- or deep-
towed imaging and bathymetry, and they provide services to evaluate the quality
of data from acoustic current profilers installed on UNOLS vessels. The budget
included with this proposal is for the first year of a 3-year continuing grant.
