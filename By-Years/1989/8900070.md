This grant supports a program of research in experimental nuclear physics,
conducted by faculty and undergraduate students at Oberlin College. Measurements
probing the alpha-cluster structure of Li-6 will be carried out using 500 MeV
proton beams from the TRIUMPF accelerator in Vancouver, B. C. and the results
will be analyzed at Oberlin. In addition, total cross section measurements for
Li-6 and Li-7 interactions with Si will be carried out with beams from the Notre
Dame University tandem accelerator. These measurements will provide new
information and test theoretical models of the nucleus Li-6. The participating
undergraduate students will gain a working familiarity with modern nuclear
physics concepts and instrumentation.
