This study examines the role of internal waves in mixing near source
&lt;br/&gt;regions of internal waves by studying several different types of
&lt;br/&gt;non-linear internal-wave interaction problems. Numerical experiments
&lt;br/&gt;will be used to examine three different regimes. The first will look
&lt;br/&gt;at the nonlinear cascade of energy between short and long internal
&lt;br/&gt;waves in a run-down experiment initialized with a high-energy,
&lt;br/&gt;random-phase internal wave field with a spectrum similar to that
&lt;br/&gt;postulated by Garrett and Munk. The second set of experiments will
&lt;br/&gt;look at energy transfer from internal waves at the frequency of the
M2 &lt;br/&gt;tide, forced by tidal excursions over topography, to higher
frequency &lt;br/&gt;internal waves when that tranfer is catalyzed by the
presence of a &lt;br/&gt;background field of internal waves. The third focus is
on interactions &lt;br/&gt;between wind-forced near-inertial waves and non-
inertial internal waves. &lt;br/&gt;The numerical experiments will be conducted
with a three-dimensional, &lt;br/&gt;non-hydrostatic, psuedospectral code. The
numerical results will be &lt;br/&gt;compared to field data collected during a
variety of prior oceanic and &lt;br/&gt;coastal experiments.&lt;br/&gt;
