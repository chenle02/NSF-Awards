Pang 9509304 This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) is centered on
enabling low-cost multimedia communications on the desktop computers in a
typical corporate/campus network environment. The motivation behind this effort
is the rapidly decreasing costs of desktop computers and peripherals, and the
large installed base of data network infrastructure. A mandate on this research
is interoperability with the international ITU-T H.320 suite of teleconference
standards. Interoperability with the H.320 standards would ensure that the
system being developed be able to communicate with existing room teleconference
systems and future H.320 compliant products. The major benefits of this research
are: (i) use of low-cost desktops and existing network infrastructure, (ii)
enhanced functionalities, (iii) significant cost reduction over existing desktop
teleconference solutions.
