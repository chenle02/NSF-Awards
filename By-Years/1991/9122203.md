The project has two objectives: one, to organize a United States-Brazil Workshop
on the Technology of Large Structural Systems to be held in Washington, D.C. by
late 1991, to develop the final research agenda for cooperative research
activities between the two countries in this specific area as agreed upon in the
Science and Technology Initiative signed by both countries in 1988. Two, to
organize the visits of Brazilian experts in structural engineering to pertinent
U.S. research centers. Proceedings from these activities will be published and
disseminated to organizations and colleagues interested in these topics. The
research agenda will identify areas of concern and opportunity for both Nations
and the links established among experts will benefit all concerned.
