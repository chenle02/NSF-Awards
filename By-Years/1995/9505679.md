9505679 Grodzicker Drosophila (fruit flies) provide a model system for the study
of problems in brain organization, brain development, and behavior. The power of
this model system is increased because with this organism techniques are
available to analyze both the genetic and biochemical substrates of brain and
behavior. This award will provide partial support for younger scientists
(especially women and minorities) to attend an important core meeting on
Drosophila neurobiology. Thus the award will help stimulate neuroscience
research, as well as the training and development of young scientists. ***
