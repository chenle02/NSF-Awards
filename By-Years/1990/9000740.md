Professor Kenneth W. Chan and other members of the Chemistry Department of
California State University-Fresno (CSU-Fresno) are being supported to conduct a
Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry. During the
summer of 1990, ten (10) undergraduate students will spend eight (8) weeks
actively engaged in a variety of research projects. Projects range from
development of a method for determining carbofuran in groundwater to
modification of sample introduction methods used for atomic spectroscopy. These
undergraduate students will participate in the Summer Research Institute
sponsored by the CSU-Fresno Chemistry Department. This institute involves
students from the high school to the graduate level and provides opportunities
for seminars, field trips, and other professional activities.
