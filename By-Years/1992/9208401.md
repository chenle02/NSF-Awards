The Principal Investigator will analyze mathematical models for certain
plastics and metals and will develop criteria to predict the failure of such
materials under external forces. The types of failures of interest are those due
to the formation of microscopic holes which grow in size and combine to form
cracks in the material. Particular problems that will be addressed are the
initiation and dynamic growth of a solitary hole, and the formation of secondary
cracks upon the surface of a solitary hole. Mathematically, the proposed
problems involve the analysis of existence of singular solutions to quasilinear
elliptic systems, the existence of, and admissibility criterion for, singular
solutions to hyperbolic systems, and the existence of minimizers with
singularities for problems in the calculus of variations.
