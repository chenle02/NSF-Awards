Abstract Jorgensen/Han

The GPOTS series has a strong record of serving as a source of research problems
for graduate students, fresh Ph.D.'s and postdocs. And it has always attracted a
large number of younger researchers. The organizers have been consistent in
their effort of attracting members of underrepresented groups. Deguang Han and
the analysis group in the math department at the University of Central Florida
have established a close collaboration on wavelets in image and signal detection
theory with the Lockheed Martin ATI division in Orlando, who have shown great
interest in this conference and its theme of applying operator theory to
wavelets. GPOTS-2005 could have impact on strengthening the collaborative
activities between Florida universities and industries. The senior people who
have been attached to the GPOTS series have a clear record of Ph.D. production,
and they all have had a number of Ph.D. students from underrepresented groups,
including women. All are committed to the recruitment and retention of women and
minority students in mathematics. Raul Curto recently won the Catalyst Award
(2000) given by the University of Iowa Office of Affirmative Action in
recognition of persons that enrich diversity within the UI community. The
University of Iowa has now a graduate population which includes 25%
underrepresented minority students. With the help of an AGEP grant, the U. of
Iowa has recently joined forces with sister institutions in Alabama, Florida,
and Texas in an Alliance for the Production of African American Ph.D.'s in the
mathematical sciences, and has helped to support REU-type activities for
undergraduates. If supported, the two GPOTS conferences will invigorate these
activities that are vital to involvement of underrepresented groups in the
research community. Another way the universities in central region have involved
their graduate students is through the series of bi-annual weekend research
meetings (INFAS) involving three universities in Iowa and three in Nebraska.
