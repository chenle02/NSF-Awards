This project establishes a microcomputer based teaching facility for non
computer science majors who need to know how to use the computer as a problem
solving tool. The facility consists of thirty workstations connected to the
instructor's console by a device that will enable him to see and interact with
each student's computer from the console. Also connected to the console is a
projection system to facilitate group instruction. The system will allow the
instructor to take over any workstation, interact with it, and project it onto
the screen for class discussion. This facility greatly enhances the
lecture/recitation instruction format and the teaching of high level computer
skills to non-majors in an effective way. Personalized "hands-on" instruction is
provided to many students simultaneously. The award is being matched by an equal
amount from the principal investigator's institution.
