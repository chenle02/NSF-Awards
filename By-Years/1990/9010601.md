This Research Initiation Award is for the application of Markov random field
(MRF) theory to interpretation of image features. Although probabilistic and
constraint based interpretation systems are not new, they remain a promising
direction for high level computer vision. Dr. Zhang will give special attention
to energy based design of clique potentials for hierarchical object recognition.
