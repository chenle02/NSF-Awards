This grant supports the Mid-Atlantic Drosophila Stock Center at Bowling Green
State University. This center contains over 4,000 genetic stocks of Drosophila
melanogaster and a small number of lines of the eight melanogaster subgroup
species. The center maintains and distributes flies to researchers and teachers
from all over the world. It also provide them with information through
telephone, letters, printed catalogues, and computerized information system.
These stocks include basic mutants as well as complex mutant combinations and
chromosome rearrangements that are used in genetic, molecular biology, and many
other types of biological research, and are an important tool for teaching
genetics in colleges and high schools.
