For this research, two- photon resonances will be used in xenon, krypton, and
argon to achieve tunable outputs by mixing with visible dye laser radiation or
near infrared radiation obtained by stimulated Raman scattering. A Fizlau
wavemeter with an accuracy of one part in ten will be completed
andcharacterized. Measurements of scattering from rare gas Rydberg states will
be compared. Also, the current coherent extreme ultraviolet source will be used
in four-wave mixing as a basis for very high resolution optical studies.
Experiments are planned to simplify the system for extending the outputs to
shorter wave lengths.
