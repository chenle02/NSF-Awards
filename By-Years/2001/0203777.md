This grant supports the management of the 2002 US/Africa/South American
Materials Workshop on Civil Infrastructure and Manufacturing that will be held
January 6-7, 2002 in San Juan, Puerto Rico. This international workshop will
host eleven scientists and engineers from North America and none of their
counterparts from Africa, South America, Asia and Europe. On the first day,
invited papers on materials for infrastructure and development, and papers on
materials and manufacturing are scheduled. The second half-day will focus on
discussion, planning future interactions and collaborations, and drafting a
workshop report. In addition to reporting the workshop results by publications,
they will immediately be reported to the broader research community attending
the 2002 National Science Foundation's Design, Service and Manufacturing
Grantees and Research Conference at the same venue on January 7-10,
2002.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Developing the infrastructure to support the global
practice of engineering and manufacturing is a key issue for the economic well
being of all nations. This group of experts from around the world will advise
and develop a joint agenda on collaboration among nations to provide the
technical and educational infrastructure needed for the 21st century.&lt;br/&gt;
