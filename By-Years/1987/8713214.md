The upper atmosphere in the polar cap region glows in complex patterns as a
result of collisions of precipitating electrons with molecules of air, and as
light is emitted by recombining ionospheric plasma. The upper atmosphere is
continually in motion, being driven by heating and electric fields as energy
comes in via the magnetosphere from its interaction with the supersonic solar
wind. The motions are being studied by use of modern versions of all sky
cameras, that electronically record images of the whole observable sky in
specific wavelengths. Sets of such images are then analyzed by using newly
developed techniques of computerized image motion analysis to derive the
velocities of auroral and airglow forms. Systematic observation and analysis of
these velocities will have far reaching implications in the understanding of
ionosphere- magnetosphere coupling. The principal investigator and his
associates are leaders in the field of imaging atmospheric emissions from space
and from the ground. The observations from Sondre-Stromfjord, Greenland, will be
analyzed in conjunction with ongoing radar and spectrographic measurements.
