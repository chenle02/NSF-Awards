Both lasers and plasmas have the ability to alter a substance on contact. The
key is to alter that substance to some particular aim; to create a new material,
new product, or new technique. The U. of Illinois is part of the multi-
university Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Lasers
and Plasmas for Advanced Manufacturing (LPAM) anchored at the U. of Virginia.
The Center focuses on the next advances in manufacturing. U.S. country makes all
kinds of things. This support from the NSF allows LPAM to continue working with
industrial members to use the latest in laser and plasma technology to make
those things better, or cheaper, or faster, or all
three.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The U. of Illinois's role in the Center is in
specific uses of plasma engineering. The site brings a wide spectrum of plasmas
and plasma manufacturing techniques, and works towards solving a multitude of
research problems in plasma manufacturing that are both near-term and long-term.
More specifically, the U. of Illinois focuses around development of large-scale
plasma deposition system, directed etching assisted by lasers, and atmospheric
plasma induced polymerization.
