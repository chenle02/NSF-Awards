About 1.5 million students take an earth-science course each year. All global
environmental issues can be linked to an earth-science topic. Existing earth-
science course therefore provide an efficient route for reaching a significant
number of the nation's students. A survey of 1000 members of the National Earth
Science Teachers Association yielded a 49% response, with 97% of the respondents
favoring the use of imagery-based activities in their courses. Based on these
and other data, it is likely that these materials will reach 750,000 students
per year, greatly increasing the awareness of the nation's next adult generation
to the environmental issues that they will face. Fifteen hands-on modules using
satellite and high altitude imagery that will confront students with the
problems and challenges of our global environment, will be developed. Twenty
master earth-science teachers will work with the staff on the development of the
activities during each of three summer institutes. The materials will be field
tested by these teachers during two academic years for commercial publication. A
series of implementation workshops in cooperation with the commercial publisher
to disseminate these materials will be held.
