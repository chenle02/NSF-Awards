Mission-critical scientific simulations (e.g., climate simulation and fluid
dynamics simulation) and enterprise workloads (e.g., search and encryption)
running on large-scale computing systems are jeopardized by the increase of
faults and errors in hardware and software. Understanding the vulnerability of
these large-scale applications is important to minimize performance and power.
Lack of the knowledge of application vulnerability forms a major bottleneck of
execution efficiency, and jeopardizes HPC simulation capabilities. Previous
works rely on random fault injection or detailed architecture analysis to
evaluate application vulnerability. They can be slow and inaccurate. There is a
big gap between the needs of reliable and efficient HPC and what the current
methodologies can provide. &lt;br/&gt;This research explores a new methodology
to understand application vulnerability. It investigates new analytical and
statistical models to quantify and characterize application vulnerability based
on a novel metric and application semantics (including algorithm semantics and
data semantics). The PI integrates modeling techniques into a broader context
for vulnerability analysis to improve the modeling accuracy and explore reliable
and efficient protection for applications while examine the interplay between
reliability, power, and performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcome from this
research will provide support for execution correctness and efficiency of large-
scale applications running on future computing systems that demand high data
integrity. The proposed research will affect design of reliable applications and
algorithms. Built upon the collaboration with industry, the research outcome is
expected to be tangible and have direct impact on realistic scientific problems.
Furthermore, the tight coupling between research components and education
components creates a HPC learning culture to engage students in HPC, addressing
HPC workforce shortage in the nation.
