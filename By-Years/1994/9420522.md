9420522 Rix ABSTRACT This proposal describes a plan to develop and implement an
undergraduate civil engineering curriculum track based on the following
concepts: {SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 13 \h} Focus on Assessment, Rehabilitation,
and Reconstruction Issues: Assessing the rehabilitation and repair needs of
older facilities requires different knowledge and problem solving skills than
those needed for new construction. {SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 13 \h} Include
Input from the Public and Private Sectors: Engineers must be trained to
understand and accommodate the economic and political aspects of public works
projects in addition to the technical aspects. The curriculum development effort
includes support from the Construction Industry Institute and the City of
Atlanta to incorporate these views. {SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 13 \h} Develop a
Sustainable Combined Research and Curriculum Development Program: A framework
will be created and implemented that provides formal mechanisms for continually
integrating research and public/private sector issues into an undergraduate
curriculum track on infrastructure assessment, rehabilitation, and
reconstruction. {SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 13 \h} Capitalize on Cognitive
Science and Educational Technologies: The proposed curriculum utilizes
innovative dissemination techniques and incorporates research on engineering
learning and pedagogical methods. ***
