9408851 Taylor Research in particle physics will focus on the study of abnormal
states of matter that will be formed during high energy collisions. The specific
topic to be studied concern the formation and subsequent decay of metastable
states in these processes. The occurrence of this phenomenon will give rise to
copious production of particles called mesons with unusual distributions in the
number of charged particles. The project will involve active participation in an
experiment to look for such events. The results of the study will furnish a
better picture of how particles interact. ***
