Powers 9603009 The keystone symposium on molecular mechanisms of evolution will
be held at Santa Fe, n. M., February 16 through February 21, 1997. The meeting
will consider molecular mechanisms of evolution regulating development, the
organization and expression of multigene families, the role of insertion
elements in evolution, the functional consequences of evolutionary change in
protein structure and ancestral sequence reconstruction among other topics. This
meeting will bring together scientists from several disciplines and from all
scientific ages in a setting conducive to meaningful interactions.
