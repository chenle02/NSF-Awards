9319254 Greenwald This award supports a two-year cooperative research project
between Professor Gilbert Greenwald, Department of Physiology, University of
Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, Kansas, and Professor Kazuyoshi Taya,
Laboratory of Veterinary Physiology, Tokyo Univesity of Agriculture and
Technology, Tokyo. The joint project focuses on mechanisms regulating species-
specific ovulation rates in mammals. The investigators will investigate the
factors responsible for one species ovulating 1-3 ova (guinea pig) and another
ovulating 10-12 ova (hamster). They will analyze the hypothalamic- pituitary-
ovarian axis, with the Japanese group focusing on in vivo approaches and the
U.S. investigator emphasizing in vitro methods. The question being addressed is
timely and important to students of reproductive physiology and will enhance our
understanding of the mechamisms underlying the determination of the numbers and
extent of folliculat development during each follicular cycle. ***
