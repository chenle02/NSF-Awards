The ability to produce transgenic plants in the laboratory has expanded
significantly since 1983, the date of the first successful production of a model
transgenic plant. Transgenic plants have been produced for many food and feed
plants, e.g., alfalfa, canola, potato, rice, soybean and tomato, and within the
next few years are expected for most food and feed plants. Substantial
scientific discussion has occurred with respect to the agricultural and
environmental risks of field introduction of genetically-engineered plants for
research and commercial production. The purpose of this workshop is to examine
scientific issues in the regulation of genetically-engineered plants used for
human food and animal feed, especially that class of near-term applications
involving genetically-engineered plants in which small (single or a few) well-
characterized gene changes have been made to introduce new proteins. The goals
of the workshop are: (1) to reach a consensus on what can be reasonably
concluded about food safety and risk, given the current state of knowledge; (2)
to identify what needs to be known about the specific applications so that
credible regulatory decisions can be made; and (3) to develop recommendations on
how research need can be fulfilled.
