Statistics at the University of Pittsburgh will purchase computer equipment
which will be dedicated to the support of research in the mathematical sciences.
The equipment will be used fir several research projects, including in
particular the research of: 1.) H. Block and A. Sampson on isotonic regression
and degradation processes; 2.) H. Block and T. Savits on reliability and burn-
in; 3.) D. Stoffer on categorical time series; 4.) S. Iyengar and T. Savits on
