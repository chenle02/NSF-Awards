The use of organisms that are naturally tolerant to limiting supplies of oxygen
to probe nature's molecular and metabolic defense strategies against hypoxia is
a tried and tested experimental paradigm in biology. We have found in recent
studies that the present day descendent of the lowlanders. In pilot position
emission tomography (PET) studies of glucose metabolism in heart and brain in
these subjects, we found that biomedical adaptations were utilized in order to
maintain each organ in energy balance despite the imposed and chronic hypoxia of
their home environments. The heart data demonstrated a significant dependence on
glucose for basal energy needs, even following an overnight fast. This
provisionally has been interpreted as an adaptation, serving to maximize the
amount of useful energy obtainable per unit amount of oxygen. Interestingly, the
subjects resolved partially, and in one case entirely, to the normal pattern of
substrate preference after only 20 days living at sea level. Brain uptake levels
of glucose were at the extreme upper end of the normal range and may indicate at
least some non-oxygen dependent metabolism to maintain energy balance. Because
control and manipulation of the adaptive response could be of immense practical
importance, it is imperative to ascertain if these defense mechanisms are
general to the human species. For that reason, we propose to extend our study to
include subjects that would be expected both genetically and individually also
to be hypoxia-adapted, the Sherpas of Nepal.
