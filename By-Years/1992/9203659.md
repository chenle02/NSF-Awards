This project focuses mathematical research on problems of approximation and
special functions. The latter comprise the basis of much of approximation
theory, although there is a considerable body of work concentrating on analysis
of the functions themselves. Work to be done includes studies of weighted
potential and weighted polynomials in the complex plane, asymptotics for
orthogonal polynomials and special functions, roots of polynomials and extremal
problems for Blaschke products and rational functions. Work will also be done on
the degree of approximation by Bernstein operators and Bergman kernel methods
for numerical conformal mapping. Approximation is the defining feature of
mathematical analysis. Compact expressions of solutions of problems arising in
the physical universe rarely occur. More often, the solutions must be
approximated by known quantities which have desirable properties and are easily
computed. This research contributes to the dual goals of understanding the
special functions of analysis and discovering their approximation properties.
