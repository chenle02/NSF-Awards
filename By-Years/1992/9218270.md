Professor Wolczanski of Cornell University will conduct investigations of early
transition metal oxo and nitrido compounds with funding from the Inorganic,
Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program. In one phase of the studies he will
investigate small molecule activation by low-coordinate electrophilic metal
centers such as zirconium and titanium compounds of bulky hard pi donors.
Reactions of these compounds with alkanes, alkenes, and arenes will be studied
for their ability to cleave the C-H and C-C bonds. The other phase of the work
will be directed towards preparing new materials by use of early transition
metal complexes as precursors. These precursors will have strong pi donor
ligands such as nitrides and amides. It is anticipated that use of these
precursors will enable the synthesis of materials that are more complex than
those obtained by conventional high-temperature methods. %%% The chemistry of a
class of early transition metal molecules that have bonds through nitrogen and
oxygen atoms will be studied for two reasons. One is that these compounds
display unusual and unique reactivity with C-C and C-H bonds in other molecules.
The other is that they can be used as molecular precursors in the synthesis of
novel materials of high complexity. It is hoped that these studies will lead to
improved methods of controlling the reactivity of hydrocarbons and of designing
interesting materials.
