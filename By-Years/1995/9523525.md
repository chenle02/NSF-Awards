ABSTRACT CTS-9523525 Ronald So The proposal is to partially support a conference
on Turbulent Heat Transfer in March, 1996 in San Diego. The conference centers
on the investigation of the coupling between momentum and energy transfer in
turbulent flows, in situations of practical interest. The conference will bring
together experimentalists, modelers, and numerical analysts to discuss various
aspects of turbulent convective heat transfer.
