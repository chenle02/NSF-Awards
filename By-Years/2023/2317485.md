The Midwest Research Experience for Graduates (MREG) is a workshop at the
University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, from July 24 2023 to August 4, 2023. It is
designed to provide early graduate students in pure and applied mathematics an
opportunity to experience the research environment by learning and working with
advanced mathematics under the guidance of an early-career faculty member or
industry professional on a project of their choosing. At the same time, we aim
to promote and help start conversations around various initiatives and issues
centered on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). Early graduate students will
network and collaborate with early-career professionals and other graduate
students from across the region, giving them long-term support in their graduate
careers. Furthermore, by having mentors and role models with similar shared
experiences, participants will form stronger connections and gain invaluable
insight.

The workshop is structured as a summer school focused on replicating the
research experience, in terms of literature review and taking the first steps
toward tackling a novel problem. There will be five research projects: Geometric
structures & curves on surfaces; The virtual Euler characteristic for graphic
matroids; Utilizing stochastic modeling techniques in interdisciplinary studies;
Using analysis and PDE to study traffic flow; and Trade-off between
interpolation and generalization. Additionally, there will be plenary talks and
panels focusing on topics of diversity, equity, and inclusion in mathematics.
The plenary talks will broaden awareness in various topics affecting the
representation and the experiences of under-represented groups in STEM. The DEI
panels will focus on providing relevant advice and information to participants.
