Lemmon Michael&lt;br/&gt;CCR-0208537&lt;br/&gt;"Performance Based Soft Real-time
Scheduling in Networked Control Systems"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is
developing novel methods for the design of high performance networked control
systems. The networked control system under consideration distributes controller
functionality over a collection of micro-controllers that communicate over an
ad-hoc communication network. The project uses a soft variation of the
(m,k)-firm guarantee model to characterize task scheduling in networked control
systems. The project consists of three tasks. The first task obtains upper
bounds on dropout probabilities that assure robust performance of the closed
loop system. These bounds define the soft (m,k)-model, which is one major
emphasis of the research. The second emphasis is on the design of implementable
schedulers that enforce the soft (m,k) model arising from the control
design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project's broader impact is achieved through
the inclusion of methods and concepts developed in this project in undergraduate
courses that introduce embedded system principles. &lt;br/&gt;
