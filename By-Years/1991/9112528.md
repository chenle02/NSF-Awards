A user mode research program will be carried out in photonuclear reactions on
few-body systems. The experimental work will be carried out at the University of
Saskatchewan electron linac and pulse stretcher ring, and will make use of a
large acceptance charged hadron spectrometer and a mono- energetic beam of gamma
rays. Results will lead to improved understanding of the structure of light
nuclei, and our ability to predict properties of such systems based on the
latest nucleon-nucleon potentials. Equipment development, simulations, data
analysis, and interpretation will be carried out at Virginia Polytechnic
Institute and State University.
