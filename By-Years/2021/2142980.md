The GRACE series of satellite missions have been making measurements of Earthâ€™s
changing gravity field since 2002. These observations detect present day ice
loss in ice sheets and glaciers. The ice loss plays a key role in determining
21st century sea level rise, which threatens hundreds of millions of people
living in coastal regions. Improving observations of where and when ice is being
lost today is key for improving estimates of future ice and sea level change.
These estimates are critical to assess the corresponding risks and implement
mitigation policies. Here the researchers develop and test new tools to improve
satellite measurements of gravity, specifically in the polar regions. These
state-of-the-art developments improve the spatial and temporal resolution of
satellite observations. They allow a better understanding of how ice sheets and
glaciers physically respond to changing climatic conditions, notably at the
regional scale, an outstanding scientific question. The project also provides
support and training in geophysics and remote sensing to graduate and
undergraduate students at the University of Arizona. Its educational aspects,
integrated with the research, are carried out both in a classroom setting and
research-lab setting. Specific efforts are geared toward including students from
underrepresented groups in STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Current global satellite
gravity data products have spatial resolution that is fundamentally limited in
polar regions by how they are constructed. Here the team uses spatio-spectral
localization techniques to construct polar-only time-variable gravity fields
directly from the in-situ measurements at satellite altitude. These polar
gravity fields significantly improve spatial and temporal resolution over global
products. They are here used to analyze two problems relevant to 21st century
sea level rise: 1) to constrain the thickness and shape of the Laurentide Ice
Sheet at last glacial maximum using a Bayesian inversion procedure; 2) combined
with GPS surface displacements in Greenland, to investigate how ice mass change
is expressed in solid Earth surface motion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
