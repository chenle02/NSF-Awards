The project will provide science teachers in the middle schools in the
Springfield, Massachusetts school district with opportunities to acquire science
content knowledge and training in inquiry and project-based teaching, including
the opportunity to conduct research as a part of a team with GK-12 Fellows, and
UMass faculty. The Fellows and faculty will gain an understanding of the needs
and culture of the schools, laying the foundations for future collaborations.
The project will provide Fellows with increased experience in effective
pedagogical approaches, and will also provide a diverse population of middle
school students with role models and mentors. Middle school teachers in a
master's degree program will work in teams (six in all) consisting of a UMass
faculty participant, two GK-12 Fellows, and up to three middle school teachers)
on the implementation of research projects with theirs school students. STEM
Connections will start with summer workshops for the Fellows and teachers. Teams
will then work together for two semesters in a course focused on teacher
learning of project-based instruction while concomitantly developing similar
projects with middle school students. This project is receiving partial support
from the Directorate for Engineering.
