Abstract

Award: DMS-0071372 Principal Investigator: Xiaobo Liu

This research program addresses problems in two areas. The Virasoro conjecture
in symplectic geometry asserts that the generating function of the Gromov-Witten
invariants for a compact symplectic manifold must be annihilated by a sequence
of differential operators in the Virasoro algebra. The principal investigator
will study whether the genus-one Virasoro conjecture and perhaps more general
constraints hold for all projective varieties. It is even possible that the
generating function of genus-one primary Gromov-Witten invariants can be
computed explicitly from the genus-zero invariants, although this is more than
the Virasoro conjecture implies. The second area to be addressed is submanifold
geometry, especially the properties of isoparametric submanifolds, including
infinite dimensional submanifolds. We know some good constructions of
isoparametric submanifolds, but important aspects of the classification theory
are in early stages of development.

Geometric descriptions of classical or quantum mechanical systems are based in
symplectic geometry, which takes as its basic measurement the area of two-
dimensional surfaces. The Gromov-Witten invariants of a symplectic manifold can
be described as a family of number that count the number of surfaces of a nice
sort that satisfy certain constraints, such as intersecting specified subsets of
the manifold. Enumerative invariants of this kind are an ancient concern in
algebraic geometry, where we count the number of solutions to a system of
equations, and the subject was recently found to be connected to high energy
physical theory, where the partition functions of certain quantum systems on a
manifold have been found to be related to generating functions that collect
families of Gromov-Witten invariants into a manageable form. The Virasoro
conjecture proposed by a group of physicists and mathematicians asserts that
these generating functions satisfy a family of constraints that simplify
computations and connect the Gromov-Witten invariants to the mathematics of
completely different problems. A different kind of geometry arises in the study
of submanifolds as curved objects, where we use several measurements of bending
to capture the intuitive sense that a sphere in three-space is more curved if
its radius is small than if its radius is large. An isoparametric submanifold is
an imbedded object which has particularly simple curvature properties with
respect to the larger space, and the character of this specialty is driven by
the fact that this local condition frequently imposes strong symmetry properties
the whole submanifold.
