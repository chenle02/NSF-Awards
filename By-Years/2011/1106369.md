Technical: This research project investigates growth and properties of dilute
nitride GaNP core/shell nanowires and studies their potential for efficient
solar cell applications. The dilute nitride GaNxP1-x is unique among the common
semiconductors in that it has a large bandgap bowing and its bandgap can cover a
wide range of solar spectrum for relatively small concentrations of nitrogen.
Photons are absorbed in both the core and the shell of the GaNxP1-x/GaNyP1-y
core/shell nanowires, and photogenerated electrons and holes are separated by
the type-II staggered band alignment of the core and the shell, relaxing the
requirement of long minority carrier lifetime in a planar solar-cell device. The
GaNP-based coaxial nanowires can potentially be a viable alternate to the
current triple-junction technology because of its less stringent requirement on
material quality (due to spontaneous electron hole separation), simpler
processing (due to only one junction), and lower materials
cost.&lt;br/&gt;Nontechnical: The project addresses basic research issues in a
topical area of materials science with high technological relevance. The
research, if successful, can have significant impacts on solar-cell development
using nanoscience and nanotechnology. The research activities promote
interdisciplinary training for graduate and undergraduate students in growth and
characterization of novel compound semiconductors and in solar cell design,
fabrication and testing, as well as written and oral presentations. The PI is
the Director of the California State Summer School for Mathematics and Science
(COSMOS) residential summer program for more than 100 high school students. The
results of this research can be incorporated into the curriculum and extend to
the high schools through the Teacher Fellow program of COSMOS.
