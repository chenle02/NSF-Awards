9352401 Baker Undergraduate Laboratory for Geographic Information Systems This
project is developing a laboratory for undergraduate instruction in geographic
information systems (GIS). The laboratory has a file server, a set of
workstations and graphics terminals, plus peripherals to enable high-quality
input and output of maps and other data. The lab provides extensive hands-on
experience in basic and advanced undergraduate courses in GIS for both majors
and students from other disciplines. The equipment and software exposes
undergraduate students to advanced vector-type GIS software, input of large maps
and spatial data, analysis procedures, and innovative methods of display and
visualization of spatial data. The lab also hosts demonstrations for
introductory courses in geography, and is available for other departments and
for student projects in cartography and remote sensing. ***y
