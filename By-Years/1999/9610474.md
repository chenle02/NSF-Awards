9610474 Epstein There are three primary objectives of this study: To furnish the
design community procedures for appropriately incorporating block shear
considerations for connections of structural shapes not previously tested
(mainly structural tees); to provide further experimental data and analytical
evidence concerning the effect that eccentricity has block shear, and; to
evaluate the capacity of existing structures. All specimens will be ones that
could reasonably be used in an actual design. Various individual parameters of
the connection geometry will be varied and both 36 and 50 ksi yield steels will
be used. Finite element studies of the problem will play an integral part in
meeting the objectives.
