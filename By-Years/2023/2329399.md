This award supports the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Conference
Board of the Mathematical Sciences (CBMS) conference "Inverse Problems and
Nonlinearity", which is to be held June 3--7, 2024 at Clemson University in
Clemson, South Carolina. The conference will feature ten hour-long main lectures
delivered by the Principal Lecturer Professor Gunther Uhlmann, who is a leading
expert in the field of inverse problems for partial differential equations
(PDEs). In addition to the main lectures, two supplementary lectures will be
given by Dr. Ru-Yu Lai and Dr. Yiran Wang, who are both early career active
researchers working in the subject areas covered in the main lectures. These
lectures along with other activities will give plenty opportunities for the
conference participants, especially those young researchers and students from
underrepresented groups, to learn and discuss the fundamental ideas and the most
recent development of inverse problems for nonlinear PDEs. The regional emphasis
of this conference will also strengthen the research collaborations among
researchers working in inverse problems and related fields in the southeast, as
well as establish new research programs.

Inverse problems, which are interdisciplinary in nature, occur in the
mathematical modeling of real-world applications where direct observations of
certain properties are not possible. While there have been many important work
on inverse problems over the past few decades, most of them have focused on
linear PDEs or PDE systems. Contrary to the common belief that the presence of
nonlinearity is an obstacle, a recent major breakthrough has shown that
nonlinearity can actually be used as a tool to solve inverse problems. The
series of lectures given in this conference will show in detail how nonlinearity
may help for a variety of inverse problems arising in nonlinear wave
propagation, nonlinear analogs of Calderon's inverse problems, nonlinear
transport equations, and inverse scattering for nonlinear PDEs. In particular,
the role of higher order linearization as a key technique to deal with the
nonlinearity, will be emphasized. Several open problems will be formulated by
the principal Lecturer and actively discussed by the lecturers and participants.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
