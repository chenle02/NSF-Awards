Professor Orlando will investigate the superconducting and transport properties
of bulk samples and thin films of the high temperature oxide superconductors.
The experiments will include: 1) sputtering to optimize the processing of thin
films, 2) superconducting and normal state properties measurements of the rare
earth and 3d metals substituted compounds, 3) critical current and high magnetic
field measurements, and 4) microstructure characterization and correlation of
this microstructure with transport and high field properties.
