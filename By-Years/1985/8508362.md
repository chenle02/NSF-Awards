The goal of this research is to design, construct, and evaluate an interactive
VLSI designer's assistant called "Agent". The assistant captures the design
graphically; estimates its speed, space, and power (S/S/P) complexity; explains
its analysis; indicates potential trouble spots; and suggests changes. To
construct the assistant, several elements are required: a design language (Gdl)
as a communication medium between the designer and the assistant, and as the
external view of the internal design representation (database); procedures to
mechanically estimate the S/S/P complexity of a Gdl description; and an
interactive tool to edit and manage the design, invoke the analytical
procedures, explain results, and make suggestions. To gain experience with the
design language and Agent, it is intended to design, fabricate, and test a
Content Addressable Processor. The Content Addressable Processor approach is
being applied to first order logic, semantic nets, and production rules, and
shows promise as a new kind of non-numeric computing architecture.
