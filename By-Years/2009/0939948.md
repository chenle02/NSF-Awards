Traditionally, computing systems have been designed to always compute correctly
- i.e., they are designed for error avoidance under all system conditions; fault
tolerance strategies are implemented primarily to ensure continued correct
execution in face of unforeseen and infrequent faults in the system. This
conservative, worst-case design philosophy often leads to very inefficient
designs, especially in terms of power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project looks
at the feasibility of developing a new class of computing systems, referred to
as stochastic computer systems that perform best-effort fault avoidance in face
of other objectives like latency and power. The primary benefit of a stochastic
computer system will be allowing the use of very low-power, but unreliable
technologies, as well as allowing aggressive low-power optimizations.
