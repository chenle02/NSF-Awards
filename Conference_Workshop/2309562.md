The conference "Groups of Dynamical Origin, Automata and Spectra Conference"
will take place March 19-24, 2023, at the SwissMAP Research Station, Les
Diablerets, Switzerland. The conference follows a long tradition of schools and
workshops on Geometric Group Theory and beyond in the Swiss Alps. The 2023
conference's interplay of three subjects: dynamics of group actions, spectra of
operators on graphs, and automata theory, will draw the interest of PhD students
studying not only geometric group theory, but also low dimensional topology and
metric geometry, as well as combinatorics. The interdisciplinary nature of the
conference will engage novel pedagogical methods. The conference will extend the
traditional form of minicourses across different subjects, giving each
minicourse a vantage opportunity to reflect different ways to attack a certain
problem. A single minicourse's lectures will be given by different specialists,
each offering his or her own perspective. Ph.D. students will also benefit from
the planned informal discussions, tutorials, and group research work. The NSF
funds awarded will serve to defray the travel costs of US participants. The
organizers will give priority to graduate students and early career
mathematicians, as well as participants from underrepresented groups.



The conference will cover a wide range of related topics from geometric and
combinatorial group theory, ring theory, complex dynamics, and other areas. The
conference's benefits extend beyond the mere reporting on recent research
developments. The conference will bring together a wide variety of researchers,
from established leaders to graduate students and early career mathematicians.
Given the presence of the large number of researchers working in adjacent areas
at this conference, the organizers anticipate highly productive
interdisciplinary interactions. The purpose of the conference is to expose and
train researchers in the many facets of geometric group theory and dynamical
systems, and to forge new and productive collaborative relationships. The
conference plans to provide a wide variety of the latest research,
methodologies, techniques, and valuable tools to young researchers and all
participants. The SwissMAP Research Station has all the facilities to
accommodate the planned conference.
