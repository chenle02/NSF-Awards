Some of the most serious crimes investigated by the legal system involve adults'
memories of traumatic childhood experiences. Laws that permit adults to initiate
criminal and civil actions about childhood victimization have raised scientific
and legal interest in eyewitness identification of persons involved in acts that
occurred decades ago. The present study will help guide theory and application
when adults exposed to early trauma are asked to identify perpetrators of
legally relevant actions experienced in childhood. The justice system will
profit from development of scientifically based techniques to better ensure the
accuracy of eyewitness identifications after long delays. The study will also
aid the judiciary by providing guidance about the validity of techniques in
cases where victims are asked to identify perpetrators from childhood.

This research examines whether false identifications can be minimized through
scientifically based techniques incorporated into a widely used, science-based
interview protocol, called the Cognitive Interview. The research goals are to
examine: (a) effects of the Cognitive Interview with mental and context
reinstatement on eyewitness identification in adults who have documented
histories of childhood trauma; (b) effects of prior interviews and lineups in
childhood versus no initial interviews or lineups on adults' long-term
recognition memory; and (c) individual-difference predictors of photo
identification accuracy after a 20 year delay. The research benefits from a
prospective-longitudinal study of a large sample of child victims. Researchers
will collect a second wave of data (Time 2) on these participants assessed
earlier as children (Time 1). Participants' abilities to correctly identify Time
1 individuals will be assessed at Time 2 along with the participants' confidence
of the identifications. Individual differences measured at Time 1 and 2 will be
analyzed to determine predictors of accuracy. This innovative project provides
much needed longitudinal information on eyewitness memory in adults with
histories of childhood trauma.
