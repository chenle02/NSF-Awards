Inverse optics is the problem of recovering 3-D scene information by
mathematically inverting an image formation process. This grant is for study of
inverse optics in active vision systems, where camera motion, focus, and stereo
vergence are under computer control. The goal is to discover principles by which
active computer vision can approach the capabilities of human vision.
