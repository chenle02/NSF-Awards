This is a proposal to fund the design development of the MECO detector in FY
2003. The MECO experiment is a large part of the Rare Symmetry Violating
Processes (RSVP) program approved by the National Science Board in February
2001. However, for a variety of reasons MREFC funding for construction of the
experiments has not yet begun. In order to proceed in an orderly manner with the
RSVP experiments the Physics Division has provided modest R&amp;D funds to
develop the experimental detectors required. This proposal is part of that
activity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, this proposal seeks funding for a
variety of essential R&amp;D tasks to prepare for detector construction. These
tasks include beam line studies, superconducting solenoid magnet design, target
design, straw tracker design, electron calorimeter R&amp;D, trigger and data
acquisition (DAQ) design, and project management. The proposal does not
prioritize the various projects except to note that the large state-of-the-art
superconducting solenoids are on the critical path for the experiment.
&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Regarding broader impacts, the proposal discusses the
profound impact on all of science a positive result for the MECO experiment
would have. Also, in this R&amp;D proposal, the education and training of
undergraduate students, graduate students and postdocs are discussed and
reference is made to the RSVP construction proposal in which activities to reach
a much broader audience for science are discussed. &lt;br/&gt;
