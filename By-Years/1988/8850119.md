The Computers, Graphics and Research Program (CGR) at Pennsylvania State
University is designed to introduce senior high school students to the skills,
research methods, ethics and careers of engineering in an intensive two-week
residential program. The CGR program will offer twenty-five talented students
extensive interaction with faculty, teaching assistants and residence hall
counselors in both formal and informal settings. A special effort will be made
to ensure participation by female and minority students. The program will be
administered by the Summer Honors Academy of the University Scholars Program. In
the tradition of past Summer Honors Academy programs, CGR will grant two
academic credits to the participants. Follow-up activities include an option for
pursuing one additional credit.
