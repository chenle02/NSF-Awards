This research is concerned with the development and implementation of general
and efficient numerical algorithms for solving a wide range of nonlinear
variational problems as well as nonlinear eigenvalue problems. Two complementary
principles are utilized for creating new computational solvers. They are the
method of transformation of the objective functional and the use of matching
numerical techniques for solving the resulting problem. Methods developed will
be used in a number of applications which include solving two and three
dimensional free boundary problems in magnetohydrodynamics, finding new
solutions for problems in the theory of solitary waves in fluids, and developing
new numerical techniques for evolution problems with a large number of
conservation laws.
