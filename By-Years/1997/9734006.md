This grant provides funds for a CAREER award with goals to explore a theory for
collaborative design, develop a knowledge infrastructure to support
collaborative design, and create new courses to teach principles of design and
collaboration. A new organizational decision-making framework will be developed
to characterize collaborative design that views collaborative design as a set of
individual decision-making processes that interact with each other through
coordination links. Based on the organizational decision-making framework, an
agent-based knowledge infrastructure will be developed to support collaborative
design. Unlike the conventional Internet-based information infrastructure, the
knowledge structure will function as a knowledge media that acquires, stores,
and applies knowledge to support designers' decision-making and coordination
processes. The new courses to be developed include two academic courses,
Engineering Information Modeling and Design Theory and Methodology, and an
industry-oriented short course, Emergent Technologies for Collaborative
Engineering. The theoretical exploration and technology development described
above will provide important insights and materials for the courses. The
experiences gained from the courses will, in turn, provide important feedback to
the research as well. If successful, this research will contribute to knowledge
by integrating ideas and literature of engineering design, collaborative work,
and organization theory and by identifying coherent links among the design,
coordination and organizing processes. The knowledge infrastructure represents a
novel technology direction beyond the connectivity of the Internet and will
impact on future development of collaboration support technologies. The new
courses address the future requirements for mechanical engineers and aim to
respond to the requirements by combining theory of design and collaboration,
together with information technologies and add them into engineering design
curriculum.
