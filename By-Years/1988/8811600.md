The focus of this research is in the area of high-temperature ceramic
superconductors involving the production of a superconducting fiber and further
to produce a superconducting cable from a collection of superconducting fibers.
For the production of superconductive fibers a new piggyback process is
employed. Hollow or c-shaped carbon fibers serving as micromolds are dipped in a
ceramic precursor, then dried and fired. Through atmospheric control, either
ceramic or ceramic/carbon fibers result. The presence of carbon promotes added
strength, toughness, abrasion resistance, and crack resistance in the fiber.
Precursors can be either of the wet chemical (sol-gel) type or particulate
suspensions. Both methods will be examined. The most difficult aspect of the
procedure is the determination of an adequate firing schedule. Production of
bicomponent fibers (ceramic/carbon) will be investigated first. Although ceramic
superconductors are usually formed at high temperatures, recent experiments
indicate that formation reactions take place at fairly low temperatures. Both
high and low temperature formations will be investigated. This project involves
a comprehensive interdisciplinary approach which includes knowledge of fiber
physics, textile science, mechanical engineering, solid state chemistry, and
ceramic engineering and processing.
