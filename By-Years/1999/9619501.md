9619501 Hotchkiss The Zoological Society of Florida and Miami Metrozoo will use
this award to plan their strategy for "Attracting New Neighbors". During their
planning activities they will address issues involved in attracting the
traditionally underserved and large Hispanic population of Dade County, Florida
to the educational programs of the zoo. The planning grant will support 1)
audience research within Dade County, 2) a national study to see what others
have done to attract diverse audiences, 3) a three-day invitational planning
conference, 4) site visits and focused research by Metrozoo staff on attracting
a diverse audience, and 5) dissemination of the information about marketing
strategies and programming techniques developed during the planning activities
to zoos and science museums across the country. The planning process will
culminate in the development of a long-range exhibition, educational program,
and marketing plan for the zoo's new Education Court scheduled to open in 1998.
