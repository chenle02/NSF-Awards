Bloxham 9526914 The PI proposes to study the dynamo process responsible for the
generation of the Earth's magnetic field. The focus of the work is on a
numerical investigation of the work is on a numerical investigation of the
dynamo process using a dynamically-consistent, three-dimensional dynamo program
that the PI has recently developed and tested. The fundamental question of the
Earth's magnetic field is generated has only recently become accessible to
modeling efforts as a consequence of development of advanced computer
technologies. Geodynamo models are also of great interest. In solid earth
geophysics because an understanding of care dynamics is essential to unraveling
the complex process in the deep interior.
