This award funds a planning grant for an Industry/University Cooperative
Research Center for Nanostructual Materials Research. The Center plans to
perform fundamental research in the characterization of a wide variety of
materials at the atomic level. The materials that will be investigated are
metallic, ceramic, polymer, semiconductor and biological tissue. The
nanostructure of ferrous and non-ferrous alloys have an impact on physical and
chemical material properties such as tensile strength, creep resistance,
corrosion resistance and fatigue life. In semiconductors trace the impurities
have a significant impact on the electrical characteristics and a clearer
understanding of the mechanisms and kinetics of impurity origin and transport
could have a significant effect on device yield. Characteristics of the kinds to
be studied will be also have a significant impact on their utilization in
industry. The Program Manager recommends a grant in the amount of $10,000 for
six months to plan an Industry/University Cooperative Center for Nanostructural
Materials Research.
