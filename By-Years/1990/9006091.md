Two separate methods for the study of dynamical properties of fluid-flows will
develop in the context of specific problems. In part I, the quasi-periodic and
chaotic motions of vortex systems with a large number of particles and
unrestricted vorticity will be considered. These vortex systems include the
point-vortex model, and desingularized versions such as the vortex blob model. A
combinatorial approach that for the first time will enable the study of
dynamical problems that are relevant vortex methods and particle methods in
general to be used. This approach will overcome the severe restriction on the
size of perturbations in Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser theory, which has hitherto
limited its applications to problems with few degrees of freedom. In part II,
periodic and chaotic motions of stokes spheres in sedimentation theory will be
studied. Near-equilibrium dynamics of identical sedimenting particles will
emphasized. Equivariant version of the Melnikov theory will be attempted.
