9703382 O'Malley The University of Washington proposes that the research project
Analytical Approaches to Singular Perturbation Problems of Significance in
Applications be continued, with Professor Robert E. O'Malley, Jr. as the
Principal Investigator. The research develops asymptotic methods to solve
nonlinear boundary value problems for both ordinary and partial differential
equations when solutions feature narrow boundary, shock, or transition layer
regions of rapid change. The research will emphasize stiff computation and
dynamic metastability, through a consistently hybrid asymptotic/numeric
investigation. Special notice will be paid to asymptotically exponentially small
terms, which have previously received scant attention, since we are now well
aware that asymptotics beyond all orders can be of critical physical
significance. Throughout science and engineering, problems often occur which
involve singularly perturbed boundary value problems. The best known example is
fluid dynamical boundary layers. Analytical and numerical techniques must be
combined to effectively attack these important problems. This work rests on a
hybrid approach to solving both ordinary and partial differential equations for
model problems motivated by application needs.
