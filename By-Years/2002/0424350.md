The NSF-supported University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW) Materials Research
Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) on Nanostructured Materials and
Interfaces and the Discovery World (DW) science museum in Milwaukee, WI, carry
out a collaborative Internships in Public Science Education (IPSE) program that
has three fundamental goals: &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;1) to focus on intern
professional development and create future leaders in science communication who
can bridge the increasing gap between science and the public; &lt;br/&gt;2) to
develop effective museum exhibits and digital visual media about nanotechnology;
and &lt;br/&gt;3) to improve public science literacy by using cutting-edge
nanotechnology research to explain core science concepts. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Through the UW IPSE program, a diverse group of graduate students
from all disciplines teams with UW MRSEC researchers and DW personnel to develop
their science communication skills while simultaneously developing and assessing
their team projects. These two-person projects consist of either a short
educational video or a prototype museum exhibit. In addition to national impact,
these products also contribute to DW's new building to open in 2006 or 2007. The
program impacts about 20 graduate students who, through developing their
interpersonal science communication skills, their technical understanding about
nanotechnology, their knowledge about their team project medium, and their
assessment skills, have an exceptional professional development experience while
working to increase public understanding of science and nanotechnology. In
addition, interns have the opportunity to earn a science education certificate
through their project and completion of courses on science education. In turn,
the interns' outreach efforts and team project products affect tens of thousands
individuals each year through museum events, professional workshops, public
events, video dissemination, and museum exhibits. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
