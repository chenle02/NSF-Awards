This project introduces undergraduate non-science majors to topics in science
and technology through a laboratory experience involving robotics. The equipment
supporting this project includes: Rhino Robot mobile and articulated arm robots,
pneumatic actuators, ultrasonic ranging devices and visual imaging systems.
Laboratory exercises are designed to introduce students to various reference
frames, linear and rotational motion, concepts of work, energy and power,
feedback control and various sensing devices. This award is being matched by an
equal sum from the grantee.
