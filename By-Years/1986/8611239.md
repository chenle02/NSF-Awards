The principle investigator is looking into the problems of distortion in
circuits that contain multiple p-i-n diodes. These diodes are used widely in
cable television as well as in military systems. This research is being carried
out in a predominantly undergraduate institution. Previous studies indicated the
need for further investigation of distortion in multiple p-i-n diode circuits.
The level of distortion in these circuits is studied as a function of such diode
parameters as i- region thickness, carrier lifetime, and DC forward bias
current, as well as frequency, and attenuation level. Theoretical results will
be verified by experimental measurements of multiple p-i-n diode circuits.
Multi-pin diode circuits are heavily used in radio circuits. The non-
linearities of these circuits create distortion when a radio frequency signal is
applied. This project focuses on understanding these problems of distortion.
