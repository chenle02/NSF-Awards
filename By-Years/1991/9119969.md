This is a joint seminar proposed by Dr. Ward Winer, Georgia Institute of
Technology, and Professor Shui-Shong Lu, National Taiwan University supported by
the AIT (U.S.) - CCNAA (Taiwan) Cooperative Science Program. This seminar will
discuss recent research results on advanced manufacturing processes in the U.S.
and Taiwan. Advanced manufacturing processes is an important topic for both the
U.S. and Taiwan. The researchers proposed for participation in this meeting are
the leading scientists in this field. A workshop on this topic can benefit the
scientists and the manufacturing industry in the U.S. and Taiwan. The Materials
Processing and Manufacturing Program contributed $5,000 in joint funding for
this workshop.
