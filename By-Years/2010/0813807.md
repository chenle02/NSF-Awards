The United States Supreme Court recognizes that youthfulness affects juveniles'
competence to exercise Miranda rights, but does not mandate special procedural
protections for immature suspects. Most states use the adult legal standard,
"knowing, intelligent, and voluntary" to gauge the validity of juveniles'
waivers of rights. Developmental and social psychologists strongly question
whether juveniles possess the competence and judgment necessary to exercise
legal rights effectively or to resist coercive questioning. This study examines
empirically how police routinely interrogate older youths charged with felonies
and addresses psychologists/ concerns about juveniles/ competence and
vulnerability during interrogation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Minnesota requires
police to record custodial interrogations of criminal suspects and conducts
trials of sixteen- and seventeen-year-old felony delinquents as public
proceedings. Five urban and suburban County Attorneys generated lists of older
felony youths. Staff paralegals or law student assistants searched, identified,
and copied 340 case-files in which delinquents invoked or waived Miranda rights
and police interrogated them. In each case, quantitative and qualitative data
will be coded and analyzed: tapes and transcripts of interrogations, police
reports, juvenile court petitions, probation reports, and sentences. Police
interrogation techniques will be analyzed: tactics officers use initially to
elicit juveniles' Miranda waivers; psychological maximization and minimization
techniques police use to question youths who waive their rights; effectiveness
of those techniques to elicit statements or evidence; and the impact of youths'
decisions to invoke or waive their rights on subsequent case-processing, pleas,
and sentences. Interrogation practices will be comparatively analyzed in
different contexts-- urban versus suburban departments and juvenile officers
versus detectives from other divisions--and of youths with different gender and
racial characteristics. The findings will provide a scientific basis to support
state law-reform efforts to regulate interrogation by requiring recording of
custodial interrogations and limiting the lengths of interrogations.
