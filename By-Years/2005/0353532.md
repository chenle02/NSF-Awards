This research focuses on detailed studies of the few-body problem, one of the
fundamental, unsolved problems in physics. Atomic ionization processes are
particularly practical to experimentally investigate the few-body problem
because the final space state involves at least three unbound particles, in
contrast to pure capture or excitation processes. The PI will investigate single
and double ionization of helium and hydrogen by ion, electron, and positron
impact as a prototype for few-particle reactions. In the double ionization
experiments the interest is focused on the role of electron-electron correlation
effects. The broader impact involves understanding how many-body interactions
affect fields ranging from atomic physics involving simple systems to chemical
and biological processes involving complex molecules to elementary particle
reactions.
