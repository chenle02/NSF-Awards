Research will be carried out in electromagnetic nuclear physics at the CEBAF
laboratory. The principal focus will be on instrumentation development for an
experiment to study the photodisintegration of the deuteron at high energies.
Signatures for the presence and effect of quark degrees of freedom are sought in
this study. The CEBAF High Momentum Spectrometer will be used for proton
detection; and the detector package, specifically the drift chambers, will be
the Hampton University group's contribution to the large collaboration formed to
carry out the experiment.
