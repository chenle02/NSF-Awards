9727166 Banaszak-Holl This project explores the synthesis and study of simple
molecules that can provide models of silicon/silicon oxide device interfaces
consisting of 1-4 layers of silicon oxide, silicon nitride, or silicon
oxynitride on silicon. The models will be used to properly interpret the
infrared (IR) and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of 6-16 Angstroms thick
stoichiometric interface regions. Also, physisorbed, well-defined cluster
molecules will allow an additional 10-30 Angstroms of silicon oxide to be placed
on top of the model interface to make a crude model of stoichiometric silicon
dioxide in close proximity to the interface. XPS and surface IR spectra of the
stoichiometric model, and the stoichiometric interface model covered by
additional oxide, can be obtained over the full range of actual electronic
device dimensions. %%% The scaling of device dimensions has resulted in
commercial gate oxide thicknesses ranging from 100 Angstroms to as thin as 20-50
Angstroms. These extremely thin oxide films are primarily interfacial in nature,
with the stoichiometric silicon dioxide exhibiting different properties from
bulk silicon dioxide. The growth and optimization of these nanostructured thin
films are crucial for the overall optimization of electronic device performance.
