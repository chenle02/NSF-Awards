The proposed center seeks to establish a new Industry/University Cooperative
Research Center (I/UCRC) addressing the research of cyber-physical systems for
use in the hospital and operating room environments. The center will focus on
computational science and technologies to advance, develop and promote research
into the principles and technology of computational surgery science. This will
be achieved through research, development, education, and technology exchange
among academic, industry, hospitals and government entities via the I/UCRC
framework. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new center seeks to address an
interdisciplinary area of central national economic importance. The center will
endeavor to create a confluence of computational science, robotics, biomedical
engineering, and medical expertise to positively impact the delivery of quality
procedural and surgical interventions. The proposed center has the potential to
bring together a diverse set of member companies and academics to achieve its
goals as well as spawn new start-ups. The center plans to leverage an
international network and new curriculum in computational surgery in order to
achieve research and student impact. &lt;br/&gt;
