0128991&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kloosterziel&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"Inertially
Unstable Currents and Internal Waves"&lt;br/&gt;In the ocean, inertial
instability is thought to be the primary mechanism that maintains anticyclonic
shears and vortices at stable and marginally stable values. This project will
utilize a series of numerical simulations to study the evolution of inertial
instability in detail. Theoretical predictions will be made for the occurrence
and physical location of the instabilities initial growth from a variety of
ocean models of vortices and currents. Both methods will be used to help
determine the nature of the internal wave radiation that is generated by the
inertial instability. Analytical and numerical work will then be undertaken to
investigate the complex behavior of packets of dimensions and amplitudes
consistent with the oceanic investigations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
