***&lt;br/&gt;9733999&lt;br/&gt;Salgado&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first goal of
this proposal is to promote the inclusion of under-represented minorities in the
field of Nuclear Physics, through the participation of Norfolk State University
students in the experimental program at the Thomas Jefferson National
Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Lab). Most matter is made of various
combinations of quarks, of which there are six kinds. This research will focus
on the properties of combinations of so called 'strange' quarks and their anti-
matter equivalent (called 'strangonia'), up to a mass of twice the mass of the
proton (hydrogen nucleus). Measurements of their properties are of great
importance for the understanding of how quarks interact with each other through
the strong force, the basic interaction of nuclear physics. Strangonia decay to
several more common final state particles (pions and kaons) before they can be
detected. The CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer at Jefferson Lab offers an
unique large acceptance detector and a high intensity beam to study these rare
multi-particle final states.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
