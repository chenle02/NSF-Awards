Abstract: This project will pursue two main themes. One portion of the research
will address one of the most difficult open problems in wavelet theory; namely,
the development of a general framework for the construction of nonseparable
orthogonal wavelets and multiwavelets in higher dimensions. The starting point
is the recent time-domain characterization by the PI of the accuracy conditions
for multidimensional multiscaling functions under an arbitrary dilation matrix.
Combined with insights from self-similarity and iterated function systems, this
suggests the possibility of weak substitutes for the factorizations that play
the key role in one-dimensional constructions. The second portion of the
research concerns frames in Banach spaces, especially Gabor or windowed Fourier
frames. Issues for Gabor systems arising from the interaction between algebra
and analysis will be addressed, and Gabor frame decompositions will be applied
to analyze pseudodifferential and other operators, utilizing the principle that
Gabor frames provide unconditional decompositions for the class of function
spaces known as the modulation spaces.

This project addresses the mathematics underlying the processing and analysis of
signals, such as images, music, and speech, but also more abstract types of
signals. A signal can be processed by first breaking it down into simple, basic
units and then manipulating those units in several different ways. This can be
done in a nonredundant fashion, where each basic unit is independent of the
others and contains one essential part of the total signal, or it can be done in
a redundant way, where the information contained in different basic units
overlaps. Nonredundant decompositions ("bases") may provide the most compact
representation of a signal, whereas redundant decompositions ("frames") allow
reconstruction of the signal even if some of the basic units are lost in
transmission. The objective of this research is to construct and apply both
types of decompositions in various settings. Wavelet bases in higher dimensions
are especially suitable for the analysis of images. Gabor frames are related to
decompositions that have been used throughout mathematics, quantum mechanics,
and signal processing, and will be applied in this project to the analysis of
operators, or transformations, of signals.
