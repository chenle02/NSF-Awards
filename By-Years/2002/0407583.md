Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0407583&lt;br/&gt;Principal
Investigator: Craig R. Guilbault, Fredric D. Ancel,&lt;br/&gt;Dennis J. Garrity,
Frederick Tinsley, Gerard A. Venema&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides
partial support for active research&lt;br/&gt;mathematicians and graduate
students participating in three&lt;br/&gt;meetings in an ongoing series of
workshops on geometric topology.&lt;br/&gt;The 2004 workshop will be held in
Milwaukee, Wisconsin at the&lt;br/&gt;University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee, with
Peter Teichner of the&lt;br/&gt;University of California, San Diego as principal
speaker. The&lt;br/&gt;2005 workshop will be take place at Colorado College in
Colorado&lt;br/&gt;Springs, Colorado and the 2006 meeting will be hosted by
Oregon&lt;br/&gt;State University in Corvallis, Oregon. &lt;br/&gt;These
workshops are designed to focus on recent work, reported by&lt;br/&gt;one of its
leading investigators, and to provide a serious but&lt;br/&gt;informal research
atmosphere in which graduate students can meet&lt;br/&gt;and learn from others
in geometric topology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An additional component of this
award supports work to edit,&lt;br/&gt;type, and distribute several unpublished
works of longtime&lt;br/&gt;workshop participant Bob Edwards. These important
contributions&lt;br/&gt;to topology include seminal work on double suspensions
of&lt;br/&gt;homology spheres and approximations of cell-like maps
by&lt;br/&gt;homeomorphisms, and will be posted on the workshop Web pages as
a&lt;br/&gt;step toward more formal publication.&lt;br/&gt;
