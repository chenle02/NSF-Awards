Dr. Rouse is tracing the emergence of new images of science and new ways of
conceptualizing and investigating scientific knowledge from criticism of
philosophical and sociological disputes over realism and the rationality of
science. These disputes typically presume a conception of scientific knowledge
as a body of representations whose content and relation to the world must be
explained, whether by reasons and evidence "internal" to science, or "external"
social and practical embodiment of scientific knowledge and its temporal
dynamics. Dr. Rouse believes that these disputes oversimplify and distort the
political and cultural significance of the sciences in their attempt to
vindicate or challenge the legitimacy of the scientific enterprise. Dr. Rouse is
attempting to develop a more adequate account of these aspects of the sciences,
using his account to criticize directly the concepts of the "content" of
scientific knowledge and the "ontological status" of its objects which are at
issue in the rationality and realism disputes. He aims to show how the positions
in these disputes derive their apparent significance from their place within
what he sees as problematic cultural conflicts over the "legitimacy of the
modern age."
