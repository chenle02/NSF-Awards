This proposal will support U.S.-based participants attending the ``Young
Geometric Group Theory'' meeting to be held at the Centre International de
Recontres Mathematiques (CIRM) at Luminy, France on January 20--24, 2014. There
will be four senior speakers giving mini-courses on fundamental topics, as well
as several outstanding postdocs giving short talks on their work. The mini-
courses and short talks will be on subjects central to geometric group theory,
but will also explore connections with other fields, including dynamics, logic,
topology, algebraic geometry and measure theory. The topics of the in-depth
mini-courses include dynamics and circle packings, hyperbolic geometry and
expanders, and Thompson's groups. The shorter talks will cover various topics in
CAT(0) geometry, hyperbolic groups, Teichmuller theory, and other areas of
current interest.

Geometric group theory is a young and dynamic field of mathematics, studied by
an international community of researchers. Most of the workshop attendees will
be early-career mathematicians; the schedule is designed to maximize the
interactions among young researchers, as well as to give them extended contact
with leading experts in the field. A website for the conference can be found at:
