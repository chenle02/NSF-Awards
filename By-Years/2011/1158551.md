Intellectual Merit. Some microorganisms, notably cyanobacteria, are known to
synthesize secondary metabolites that serve a sunscreen function to protect them
from damaging effects of exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UV). In
cyanobacteria, two main types of such compounds have been described: scytonemin,
a unique alkaloid of interesting biological properties, and mycosporine-like
amino acids (MAAs), a family of small water-soluble compounds derived from amino
acids. In the past few years we have successfully developed the cyanobacterial
strain, Nostoc punctiforme ATCC 29133, to study the genetic and molecular basis
of such sunscreens. Great strides have been made during the past few years in
this field of research. In this project we will be probing aspects of sunscreen
biology that relate to the association of gene function with cell
compartmentalization, to their regulation and their evolution. This work will
provide links between existing knowledge at the molecular, physiological and
environmental levels of organization, eventually enabling an integrated
understanding of microbial sunscreens and setting the basis for their potential
application. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. Sunscreens are important
factors in the ecological physiology of adaptation of many organisms in Nature,
from plankton to corals at a time when increased UV-fluxes are of concern.
Microbial sunscreens have attracted interest not only because they represent
novel classes of secondary metabolites, but also because of their potential
applicability for biotechnological purposes. &lt;br/&gt;Additionally, this
research will represent a very attractive opportunity to populate ongoing
efforts in outreach to STEM underrepresented minority K-12 students and the
general public in Arizona, where protection from UV exposure is a constant
concern, and where, we think, microbial sunscreens may offer an enticement to
get to know the world of science.
