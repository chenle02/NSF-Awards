Many autocracies rely solely on repression, patronage, and manipulated elections
to rule. Other autocracies are distinguished by their adaptive qualities. As a
top-down political system, autocracies with single-party states simultaneously
issue commands from the top and selectively conduct policy experiments. How are
the two actions linked? When do central authorities encourage experimentation,
and when do they insist on strict enforcement of policies? This project examines
how a single-party autocratic government issues a mixture of ambiguous and clear
directives to guide policy experimentation, as well as the conditions under
which different types of commands are issued. This project compiles an original
dataset on both the central directives issued and the policy experiments
conducted by a single-party government from 1978 to 2020.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research program will serve three key objectives.
First, the project will produce the first and most comprehensive dataset to date
on both commands and experiments in the single-party autocratic bureaucracy.
This will shed empirical light on how adaptive governance works and has evolved
in the adaptive authoritarian state, and whether or not the regime is likely to
remain adaptable and resilient. Second, for comparative political scientists,
the project will bring attention to and illuminate the neglected theme of
adaptation in the study of authoritarianism. Third, the project will help
advance the emerging field of adaptive governance in political economy and
international development by demonstrating a testable theory of adaptive
governance that goes beyond description and motivates new data
collection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
