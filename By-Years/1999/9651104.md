The purpose of this project is to introduce atomic absorption spectrophotometry
as an analytical tool into eight lower-division undergraduate laboratory science
courses in the areas of chemistry, physical science, earth science, geology,
anatomy and physiology, and nutrition. The technique can be used for the
quantitation of metals in water samples, fossils, food samples, and simulated
clinical specimens. Students served in the intended courses include majors in
elementary education at the baccalaureate level, nursing at both the
baccalaureate and associate-degree levels, and the associate-degree level
college transfer programs and occupation/technical programs. A significant
number of students enroll in the involved courses to satisfy general education
requirements, so the project should have an impact on improving general science
literacy as well as improving the scope and quality of required courses in a few
selected major areas.
