This grant provides funding for the development of a new method for selective
assembly in manufacturing to allow the use of low precision mating parts to
achieve high precision mechanical products. The new method will provide a
mathematical model to predict the matchable degree of mating parts before
assembly, and correspondingly a quantitative criterion on how to adjust
manufacturing processes so that the desired match between mating parts could be
guaranteed. A recursive algorithm will be developed and implemented in design of
selective assembly for optimally allocating the machining tolerance range for
each selective group to achieve the minimum surplus parts. Experimental work and
industrial testing will be carried out to validate and further improve the new
method developed. If successful, the results of this research will have a
significant impact on manufacturing industries to improve their competitiveness
through reduced manufacturing production cost of mechanical parts. The results
will also provide effective integration of design, manufacture and assembly of
mating parts that have high fit accuracy requirements. Specifically, the
outcomes of the research project will provide a completely new yet much more
effective way to design for selective assembly with the capability to improve
mechanical product performance by achieving tighter tolerances at lower cost. In
particular, the proposed new selective assembly method will have a significant
economical impact on small-business industries to achieve high precision
mechanical products based on their limited manufacturing facilities.
