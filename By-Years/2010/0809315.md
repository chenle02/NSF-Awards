This project will continue and expand the ongoing investigation on new and
efficient higher order cycloaddition and cyclohydrocabonylation reactions. These
reactions allow for constructing multiple bonds all at once and for converting
linear starting materials to polycyclic compounds in one step. In addition, the
fine-tunable phosphorus ligands developed successfully in the last funding
period will be applied to the development of highly efficient catalytic
asymmetric reactions that are useful for the synthesis of enantiomerically pure
compounds. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular
Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor Iwao Ojima of the
Department of Chemistry at the State University of New York at Stony Brook.
Professor Ojima's research efforts revolve around the discovery of highly
efficient catalytic methodology for the rapid construction of polycyclic and
enantiomerically pure compounds. These compounds are of significant biological
and medicinal importance. In addition, the proposed chemistry is green in
nature, as it has high selectivity and generates little waste materials.
