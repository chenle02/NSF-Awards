A group of eight undergraduate students will conduct independent research at the
Bermuda Biological Station for Research for a time period of three months each
fall. The topics of these research programs will be in the fields of
oceanography and marine biology. Each student will be assigned to a faculty
mentor whose interests match those of the student. The research program will
begin with a two week orientation phase that involves lectures on a wide range
of subjects, followed by an eight week laboratory and/or field research phase.
At the end of the program, the students will present the results of their
research at an REU symposium modeled after a scientific meeting.
