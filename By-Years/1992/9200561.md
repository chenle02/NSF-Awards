This grant is the study of photonic waveguide devices and electronic quantum-
confined devices. Because they are based on the same wave nature, a cross
pollination effect can be expected by linking them together. The performances
and limitations of quantum-confined devices will be studied. Computer aided
design tools for future-generation electronic devices will be developed. New
photonic devices with applications in optical communications systems will also
be explored.
