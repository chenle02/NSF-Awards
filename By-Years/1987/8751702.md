Is a 12 month program that will equip 40 Advanced Placement chemistry teachers
to be more effective in the presentation of advanced placement chemistry
courses, and to provide in-service assistance to their colleagues. The project
includes intensive training for five weeks on five key topics: chemical
equilibrium, chemical thermodynamics, oxidation-reduction reactions and
electrochemical cells, chemical kinetics, and bonding and geometry of molecules.
There is a strong emphasis on laboratory experiments designed to effectively
teach these fundamental topics.
