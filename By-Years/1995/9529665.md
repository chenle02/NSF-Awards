9529665 Fink The study deals with the development of a technique which allow the
deduction of rates of eruption of small submarine volcanic constructs from their
morphology and texture. The PI will use a combination of observations from
submersible, data from camera and sonar systems, along with laboratory
simulation and theoretical analysis of cooling and rheological behavior of lava
flow assemblages to arrive at a quantitative model of volcanic edifices.
