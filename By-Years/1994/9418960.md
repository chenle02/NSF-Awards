9418960 Flurchick Parallel computers require users and programmers to understand
many different concepts and programming models to obtain performance from an
application. With increasing availability of parallel computers for researchers,
it is important that researchers and students become better trained in the
concepts of parallel processing. The North Carolina Supercomputing Center and
North Carolina State University with support from Cornell Theory Center, the
National Center for Supercomputer Applications and the Center for Research
Parallel Computing propose to develop and distribute with its partners,
multimedia computer based instruction materials to students from industry and
academia. These materials will allow for self paced education covering all
aspects of parallel processing. One important aspect of the materials developed
will be a strong interactive component to help the students evaluate their
progress.
