Research in hadronic and electromagnetic nuclear physics will be carried out.
Most of the near term experimental effort will be directed towards LAMPF, Bates,
and NIKHEF. Longer term CEBAF projects are under development. Polarization and
other related techniques will be used to explore the quark substructure and
fundamental form factors of the nucleon. Experiments will be sensitive to the
strange quark content of the nucleon through pion nucleon phase- shifts, to the
electric form factor of the neutron, and to the flavor-singlet proton charge
form factor. Similar studies for neutrons will be carried out using few nucleon
targets. The nuclear structure of few-body and selected complex nuclei will be
carried out, the latter with oriented, polarized targets.
