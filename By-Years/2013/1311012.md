This action funds Tyler Anthony Pritchard of The Pennsylvania State University
to conduct a research project in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences area
during the summer of 2013 at the Kavli Institute for Physics and Mathematics of
the Universe in Kashiwa, Chiba at the University of Tokyo Campus. The project
title is "Modeling the Ultraviolet Properties of the Death of Massive Stars."
The host scientists are Ken Nomoto and Keiichi Maeda.

Core-Collapse Supernovae are the result of a massive star exploding at the final
age of its stellar evolution. These cosmic explosions are extremely important as
our understanding of them influences a number of astrophysical subfields in
addition to that of particle and plasma physics at high energies. This project
incorporates Ultraviolet (UV) light observations--important at early times but
are rare and difficult to obtain--into cutting edge numerical models of these
explosions in order to increase the understanding of these astrophysical events
and the stars that create them. In concert with the recent unparalleled UV
observations of the supernova 2012aw by the NASA Swift space telescope and
supporting ground-based optical and near-infrared multi-wavelength observations,
this enhanced code is used to examine the properties of this stellar explosion.
Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce. Furthermore, outcomes from this work will also be
presented at scientific talks at research conferences and Astrophysics
departments as well as talks for undergraduate students considering post-
graduate education.
