9322122 de Pater Dr. de Pater will conduct a world-wide observing campaign at
centimeter wavelengths when Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 passes through Jupiter's
magnetosphere and into its atmosphere. The passage of the cometary fragments and
dust particles through the magnetosphere followed by a series of impacts into
the planet's atmosphere are expected to cause dramatic changes in Jupiter's
synchrotron radiation that will yield new information on magnetosphere
processes. ***
