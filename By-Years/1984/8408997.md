This research in the area of communications and signal processing will make
contributions to problems in detection, estimation, and modeling of signals.
Solutions to many problems of this nature depend upon the enhancement of the
signal-to-noise ration (SNR). A fundamental investigation of theperformance
bounds for system design will be conducted. Of particular interest is the
enhancement of SNR when the signal characteristics and the noisecharacteristics
are so alike that separation and improvement become difficult. Perturbation
analysis will be used to understand the fundamental performance of SNR
enhancement. Further, previous approaches will be extended to a more general
formulation, and the very large scale integrated (VLSI) implementation of the
proposed algorithms will be studied. The results of the investigation will be
applied to such communication problems as intersymbol and interchannel
interference in data transmission and in signal processing problems such as
speech analysis in noise.
