This project is designed to increase participants' knowledge of contemporary
mathematics and techniques for teaching contemporary mathematics, and unify the
secondary school mathematics program. For each of the two years, 35 teachers of
grades 9-12 will enroll in a 12-credit program that will be taught by a team of
mathematicians and mathematics educators who will integrate the mathematics
content and teaching methodology into the program. Participants will be expected
to implement TIME materials and ideas in their classes and to share project
materials and ideas with their colleagues. Participants will be selected from
the New York Metropolitan area. A handbook will be produced that includes course
outlines, course notes, approaches, techniques, bibliographies, and other
materials suitable for use by college-school cooperative programs throughout the
United States.
