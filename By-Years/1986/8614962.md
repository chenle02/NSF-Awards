The purpose of the proposed research is to define the dynamic loads generated by
in-situ occupant movements. The work will focus on the coherence of motion
(i.e., the group effect) associated with public assembly occupancies. The
investigation will be conducted through three goal-oriented tasks devoted to: a)
analytically modeling the group effect by spatially and temporally extrapolating
loads produced by individuals; b) experimentally measuring the group effect on a
prototypical floor system; and c) using the analytical models developed to
produce structural load criteria. The work begun under a former grant wherein
periodic, transient, and random dynamic loads produced by individuals were
studied will be extended. Data from an existing force platform will be utilized
for a limited population to mathematically model group loads in both the time
and frequency domains. Approximate design envelopes for both load amplitude and
frequency will be produced and test sample sizes will be determined for the
third task. The group load models will be verified with a full-scale floor
system constructed from lightweight components. Design guidelines will be
formulated using an improved road-measuring platform. Anticipated results and
suggested design models will entail load-versus-frequency spectra for either
static or dynamic analyses of structures. Because of the nature of the problem,
special attention will be given to developing channels of communication for the
continual exchange of information and ideas with researchers, as well as those
directly involved in design practice. Special attention will also be given to
the widest possible dissemination of the end results of the program on the
local, national and international levels.
