This project is using undergraduate independent study and research projects to
train students to use mathematics as a tool for exploration and to view
mathematics as an experimental science. The pedagogical idea is to use student
research projects which require computer skills, written reports, and other
skills from mathematics as well as social sciences and physical sciences to
integrate exploration into the undergraduate mathematics curriculum. The
institution plan for both the BA and BS programs in mathematics requires that
mathematics majors complete a project for graduation. To strengthen the central
interdisciplinary role of mathematics in both the social and physical sciences,
the lab is open to non-mathematics students with math intensive projects. The
program seeks to support recruitment, retention and graduation of minority
students through projects and one-on-one interaction between student and mentor.
The project also (a) provides a classroom/demo-room for math courses such as
matrix analysis, differential equations, optimization, statistics and modeling;
(b) expands the computer-based Calculus program; and (c) provides evening and
Summer Workshops for in-service teachers as well as programs in mathematics
education for pre-service teachers.
