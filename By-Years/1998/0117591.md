The Summer School for Chemical Engineering faculty is organized by the Chemical
Engineering Division of the American Society for Engineering Education and is
currently held every five years. The 2002 Summer School will be the thirteenth
in the series begun in 1931 and will be held on the campus of the University of
Colorado in Boulder from July 27 through August 2. This Summer School is unique
amongst the various engineering disciplines as it strives to promote development
of primarily new faculty with the assistance of established faculty,
representatives from governmental agencies such as NSF and EPA, and industrial
participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main purpose of the Summer School for
Chemical Engineering Faculty is to disseminate innovative and effective teaching
methods to a wide spectrum of primarily new chemical engineering faculty who
will be teaching courses and laboratories in undergraduate programs.
Additionally, the Summer School will introduce new faculty to a number of
promising research areas from which concepts, principles, problems, and
laboratory experiments can be incorporated into undergraduate course work. The
Summer School also brings new faculty together with mid- career and senior
faculty to discuss educational methods and educational delivery and to provide
tested educational materials directly to new faculty for use in a variety of
courses. Workshops are planned in many areas that receive NSF and EPA research
support, including molecular modeling, nanoparticle technology, bioengineering,
green chemical engineering, and effective use of computers and educational
technology. The educational techniques and extensive course and laboratory
materials produced will be distributed widely via CD-ROMs and the Internet to
the entire chemical engineering educational community. It is the objective of
the upcoming Summer School to have an impact on every single B.S. graduate in
chemical engineering as early as the spring of 2003, as well as all those
graduates who will follow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
