Given a manifold and a Riemannian metric, the investigator has defined and
intends to study a real-valued linking number of a pair of cycles generalizing
the ordinary integer topological linking number. This pairing is a "lift" to the
real numbers of the Abel-Jacobi homomorphism in Algebraic Geometry. The initial
definition is by differential forms with suitable singularities (going back to
Gauss in Euclidean 3-space). The investigator studies an exactly analogous
complex linking number (originally due to Beilinson and Bloch) called the
(Archimedean) Height Pairing. This pairing enters into their conjectures
relating cycles and values of L-functions, but it has been possible to calculate
it in extremely few cases. The investigator will consider an equivalent
construction of the pairings based on the kernel of the heat operator. It turns
out that this new approach is well-suited for obtaining concrete formulas in
some cases, e.g., cycles introduced by B. Gross and C. Schoen involving
correspondences on a product of three curves. The investigator would like to use
this approach in many more cases coming from Algebraic and Riemannian Geometry,
and also to find relations with index theorems and with Quantum Field Theory.
Basically, the investigator and his student Bin Wang will attempt to make more
accessible a previously defined invariant of Riemannian manifolds. Their
approach will be two-fold. First, they will explore an alternative to the former
abstract definition, one which is rooted in geometric and physical concepts and
so may provide more insight. Second, they will use this approach to calculate
the invariant explicitly in more cases, again in the hope of assisting insight
into its true meaning.
