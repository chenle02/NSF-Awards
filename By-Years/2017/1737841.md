Funding is being requested to support the Physics and Control of Turbulent Shear
Flows (PCTSF) symposium which will be held at CUNY in New York City on the 10th
and 11th of July, 2017. This international symposium will bring together
researchers in the field of turbulence from all career levels (Graduate
Students, Young Professionals and Senior Members) to exchange ideas on the
current state&lt;br/&gt;associated with the physics of large scale structures in
turbulent shear flows and how to control them. It is anticipated that there will
be approximately 100 participants at this specialized symposium which will
highlight work associated the control of turbulent shear flows. The intellectual
merit of the symposium lies in the exchange of scientific ideas, presentations
of cutting edge research and exposure to a diverse array of approaches to study
the physics of turbulent shear flows and how one can control them.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of the Physics and Control of Turbulent
Shear Flows symposium will be to present/evaluate state of the art techniques
for extract flow physics from turbulent shear flows, to present/evaluate state
of the art applications in flow control of flow dominated by&lt;br/&gt;turbulent
shear layers, to bring together researchers and practitioners to exchange
experiences, disseminate up to date information associated with the physics of
turbulent shear flows and their control, and to expose young or new researchers
to the state of the art in the field by means of attending conferences.
