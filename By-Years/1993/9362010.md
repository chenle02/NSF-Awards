9362010 Moss Piezoresistive properties of materials form the basis of many types
of sensors, including strain gauges, micromachined accelerometers and pressure
sensors, tactile sensor, and flow sensors. As greater demands are placed on
devices from the standpoint of size and cost per controlled point, easier
methods of processing which can produce smaller devices with greater performance
are required. Brewer Science has developed a processable polyaniline, as well as
conductive, ion implanted polymer films. Much of this prior work was performed
in collaboration with Southwest Missouri State University, who is subcontractor
in the proposed work. Preliminary investigations indicate that devices
constructed from ion implanted polymers may have particular advantages over
devices using ceramic, metallic, crystalline silicon and carbon-filled
materials. These advantages include improved radiation hardness, greater
flexibility and range of travel, low manufacturing cost, abrasion resistance,
and environmental inertness. The polyaniline-based sensors are easily deposited
onto the substrate and can be patterned to small or large goemetries by standard
photolithographic procedures. These materials have potential in the
micromachining industry because of the high quality of the films that are
produced on a micro-scale (&lt;1 micron), and their ease of processing. In the
proposed work, we will determine the feasibility of using the soluble
polyanilines and ion implanted films for piezoresistive devices. Specific goals
of this research are to determine the piezoresistive gauge factor, to minimize
temperature effects, to improve environmental stability, and to construct
prototypes of a precision laboratory weight scale and a vacuum/pressure sensor
based upon devices made from these materials. ***
