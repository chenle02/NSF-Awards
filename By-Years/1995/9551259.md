The university's Advanced Computing Laboratory (a) introduces parallel
processing (PP) and high performance computing (HPC) into a spectrum of
mathematics and computer science (Math/CS) courses; (b) increases the breadth
and depth of undergraduate multidisciplinary student research; and (c) creates
and widely distributes PP and HPC user guides specifically tailored to
undergraduate needs. The equipment purchased through this grant enables new
instruction, creating two new courses and enhancing seven existing Math/CS
courses. Student research, utilizing the new laboratory, is integrated within
the curriculum at three levels, including the required multi-year seminar
courses. Drawing on their course and research experiences, students develop
user-friendly guides for PP machines and HPC software. In addition to its
primary audience of Math/CS majors (including pre-engineering and teacher
education students), the laboratory serves Biology and Chemistry majors. The
Ohio State University provides a software library to facilitate student work in
graphics related projects. As a result of the new laboratory and software (a)
graduates are better prepared for professional careers; (b) students are more
motivated to pursue graduate school; (c) students assist in advancing scientific
education through dissemination of user guides and presentation of research
findings at conferences, in journals and through various on-line methods; (d)
partnerships with local companies are strengthened through collaborative
research projects; and (e) the course model can be replicated at other
institutions.
