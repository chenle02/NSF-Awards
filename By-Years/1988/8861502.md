This is an SBIR Phase I award for development of a neodymium-like soft x-ray
laser. The Nd-like isoelectronic sequence of high Z elements could provide the
basis for a soft X-ray laser. If successful, coherent radiation around 70-100
Angstroms would be available to the larger scientific community. The development
of an X-ray laser of this type would permit advances in many areas of science
and engineering. These areas include photobiology, crystallography, materials
research, and x-ray lithography.
