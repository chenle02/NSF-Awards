This action funds Michael James Duchene of The University of Notre Dame to
conduct a research project, entitled "Speeding up hurricane storm surge
simulations on supercomputers" during the summer of 2012 at Tokyo Institute of
Technology in Tokyo, Japan. The host scientist is Takayuki Aoki.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to improve large-scale
hurricane storm surge simulations by utilizing the latest supercomputers
equipped with GPUs (graphics processing units). The discontinuous Galerkin (DG)
ADvanced CIRCulation (ADCIRC-DG) model (www.adcirc.org) is more accurate than,
but also has more overhead than, the continuous Galerkin (ADCIRC-CG) version of
ADCIRC. However, the localized nature of the DG method makes it suitable to
parallelize for the supercomputers and GPUs, which would help reduce simulation
times and allow for larger problems to be simulated, and all with better
accuracy. ADCIRC-DG represents the next-generation of hurricane storm surge
models, and the ability to perform large-scale simulations promises to provide
enhanced flood protection systems that could minimize negative environmental
impact, and perhaps even be applied to real time forecasting as part of a safety
warning systems.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
