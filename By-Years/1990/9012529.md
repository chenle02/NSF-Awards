During a 1987 expedition to the Marquesas island chain, the principal
investigators mapped part of a high ridge that lies at the intersection of the
Marquesas swell with the Marquesas fracture zone. They concluded that the
fracture zone is a weak zone within the Pacific plate that allowed magmas from a
weak hotspot to reach the surface. This project will survey sections of the
Marquesas fracture zone using multibeam bathymetric tools, gravity, magnetics,
single-channel reflection, and dredging. The survey will study the magmatic
expression of three hotspots before, during, and after they encounter the
fracture zone. The morphology of the fracture zone at the hotspot intersections
will be contrased with other segments that have not encountered hotspots. The
overall goals are to better constrain the origin of fracture zone topography,
the intrinsic dimension and temporal continuity of hotspots, their interaction
with lithospheric discontinuities, and the azimuth and extent of the oldest
sectionof the Marquesas fracture zone.
