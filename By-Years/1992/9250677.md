This project is establishing a modern optics laboratory course and completing
the equipping of a recently constructed teaching laboratory. The aim of the
project is to improve the advanced laboratory component of the physics
curriculum by initiating a laboratory based course centered on modern optical
devices and techniques, with signal detection and processing. The project is
significant in that it provides an important next step in an intentional plan to
improve the physics program and utilize the interests, commitment, and expertise
of new faculty leadership in the department. The project also has the added
benefit of encouraging students to pursue graduate study by exposing them to
contemporary topics in physics. Steady-state and time- resolved experiments are
being performed with equipment provided for this project, which include as major
pieces, an optical table, a photon-counter and associated detector, an air-
cooled Argon ion laser, an acousto-optic modulator, and a data acquisition and
analysis system. Steady-state experiments to be performed include single photon
diffraction, optical fiber communication, heterodyne and Mach-Zender
interferometry, coherent backscattering, and microstatistical speckle
correlation spectroscopy. The time-resolved experiments include pulse
propagation through disordered media, fluorescence measurements, and temporal
pulse width measurements by autocorrelation.
