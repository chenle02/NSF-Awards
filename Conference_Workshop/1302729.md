The summer school entitled "Compactifying Moduli Spaces" will take place at the
Centre de Recerca Matematica (CRM) in Barcelona, Spain from May 27 to 31, 2013.
The theme of the school is the different aspects of moduli spaces in algebraic
geometry, with particular attention to questions related to compactification.
Compactness is a fundamental property needed in order to apply degeneration
techniques (e.g., for Brill-Noether type arguments) and for intersection theory
(e.g., to define Gromov-Witten invariants). Generally, a natural moduli problem
is not compact: understanding how to compactify the moduli space and how this
compactification depends on choices is the main topic of the school. We will
focus on two moduli problems: the moduli of varieties and the moduli of vector
bundles.

The school has three goals: to introduce a new generation of students and
researchers to the subject; to collect and survey recent development in the
theory of moduli spaces; to formulate and disseminate new problems and
directions of research. There will be five mini-courses, given by the leading
experts in the field. The lectures will be complemented by afternoon sessions,
where young algebraic geometers will present their work and explain examples and
further insights on the material seen in the main courses. This funding will be
used to support the participation in the summer school of graduate students and
young postdocs from universities in the U.S. The conference website is
