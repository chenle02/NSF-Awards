This award supports participants in the geometry and topology research training
group at the University of Iowa. The project seeks to build a robust vertically
integrated math community, maintain the department's legacy of graduate training
for people underrepresented in STEM, and expand activities to undergraduate and
postdoctoral levels. The research training group faculty team will recruit and
work with undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral associates
in a vertically integrated setting. The postdocs will enhance interactions
within the department and connections to the outside mathematical community. The
project also aims to benefit faculty and students in other departments, regional
colleges and universities, international collaborators, and the public through
symposia and conferences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each year six undergraduates and
twelve graduate students will be awarded Research Training Group fellowships to
boost research and competitiveness. The group will institute two summer topology
courses, an undergraduate seminar, an undergraduate career workshop, and will
host three conferences: Panorama of Geometry and Topology, Underrepresented
Students in Topology and Algebra Research Symposium, and Topological Data
Analysis. The latter will particularly help to connect participants with applied
disciplines. These activities, which span all education levels and career goals,
will assist postdocs in building balanced and successful careers in academia,
place more graduate students in academic or research jobs, and encourage more
undergraduates to enter graduate schools in mathematical sciences. The
underrepresented students symposium will provide networking opportunities and
promote the research performed by minority students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
