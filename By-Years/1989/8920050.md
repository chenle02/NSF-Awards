The objective of this project is to test several ideas concerning the dynamic
processes responsible for cresting spatial and temporal variation in ridge
geometry on the slow- intermediate spreading rate ridge system in the South
Atlantic from 31 to 36 South. Program involves two ship board legs to conduct
geophysical studies including gravity, magnetics, and seismic refraction, along
with Seabeam and dredging. Shipboard program is to be followed by lab based
geochemical analysis and 3 dimensional numerical modeling of results. %%% This
is an exciting project from a first rate team of investigators who are
attempting a very thorough study of fundamental processes at ridge crests. The
multi-disciplinary approach is a positive step forward, as is the idea of
studying deep seated process such as mantle upwelling in conjunction with their
surface expression in gravity, and geochemistry.
