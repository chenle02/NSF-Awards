Recent trends in computing have prompted users and organizations to store an
increasingly large amount of sensitive data at third party locations in the
cloud outside of their direct control. In order to protect this data, it needs
to be encrypted. However, traditional encryption systems lack the expressiveness
needed for most applications involving big and complex data. The continued
adoption and deployment of cloud computing hinges crucially on the ability to
provide cryptographic measures that protect the privacy of our data, and new
encryption schemes have the potential to affect how successful this computing
paradigm will be.

Functional encryption is an emerging paradigm for public-key encryption that
enables more fine-grained access control to encrypted data. Functional
encryption provides the ability to specify a decryption policy in the ciphertext
so that only individuals who satisfy the policy can decrypt, or the ability to
associate keywords to a secret key so that it can only decrypt documents
containing the keyword. This project investigates methods to obtain more
efficient pairings-based functional encryption, and methods to realize new
functionalities and more expressive functional encryption schemes.
