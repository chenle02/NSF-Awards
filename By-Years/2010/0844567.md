This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). The Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry
Program supports the research of Professor Anne Richards of Texas Christian
University for the study of novel, functionalized phosphonic and phosphinic
acids. These new compounds are employed in the systematic exploration of oligo-
and polymeric main group metal phosphonates, bimetallic phosphonates and related
phosphinates. Professor Richards' graduate and undergraduate students work to
understand the role of the metal phosphinates, arsonates and heterometallic
materials in a large range of applications from single molecule magnets to
catalysts, gas absorbers, and photoluminescent materials. Collaborations with
scientists at Georgetown University and Monash University in Australia aid in
the characterization of the new materials. Professor Richards also mentors a
high school chemistry teacher and is a faculty advisor to the TCU Chemistry
Club, which has an outreach program to high school seniors.
