The Urban Systemic Program for the San Diego Unified School District (SDUSD)
aggressively targets the academic success of all students in K-12 mathematics
and science through a comprehensive program of support for improved instruction.
The San Diego Urban Systemic Program (SDUSP) engages the public and private
sector community in building an infrastructure that will support quality
mathematics and science education over the long term. &lt;br/&gt;The goals of
the SDUSP are:&lt;br/&gt;1. Substantial improvement in student achievement in
the fields of science and mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;2. Substantial improvement of
the quality of instruction in science and mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;3. System-wide
implementation of high quality standards-based inquiry learning in science and
mathematics using exemplary curriculum materials and technology
tools.&lt;br/&gt;4. Ongoing collaboration to improve teacher education and the
district's science and mathematics programs through well-defined partnerships
among the school district, the universities, educational centers, and the
private sector.&lt;br/&gt;The San Diego Urban Systemic Program (SDUSP) builds
leadership in every school by engaging principals and enhanced department chairs
in understanding the content, pedagogy and curriculum of standards-based reform,
and in supporting the classroom teacher and monitoring results. The teacher in
every classroom receives exemplary curriculum materials, substantial
professional development, and job-embedded coaching. &lt;br/&gt;The students in
each science and mathematics class receive instruction that is pedagogically
sound and content rich, with clear course expectations, standards-based
materials, and the integrated use of technology. The end result is that each
student is equipped with the mathematical and scientific knowledge, skills, and
dispositions to make their own choices regarding post-secondary pursuits.
