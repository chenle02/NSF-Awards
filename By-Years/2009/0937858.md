This project will design, fabricate, and deploy a longitudinal network of
instruments along the magnetic equator in the Indo-Pacific region in order to
facilitate investigations of day-to-day low-latitude ionospheric variability,
particularly with regard to migrating and non-migrating tidal structures. Such
measurements will be able to resolve space-time ambiguities in satellite
observations of wave structures, and the project will determine whether such
structures are produced as a standing wave pattern or by zonally propagating,
non-migrating waves. Specifically, the instrumentation will include magnetometer
pairs and radars capable of obtaining both 150 km and equatorial electroject
echos. This project will build upon previously established international
collaboration and foster new partnerships with international investigators.
