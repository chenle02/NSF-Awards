We propose to develop a new family of stable high-order finite difference
methods suitable for the solution of wave problems involving many interfaces and
significant geometric complexity. These complications are addressed by embedding
the computational problem into a Cartesian grid and formulating methods such
that the position of the material interfaces as well as the physical properties
of the solution across the interface is accounted for properly to the order of
the scheme. Staggered grid as well as non-staggered grid methods will be
explored with the emphasis on the development of a rigorous mathematical
foundation for these schemes to ensure robustness and uniform stability for all
grid sizes and embedded geometries. Appealing properties of embedding methods
such as the ability to model moving interfaces and the introduction of virtual
interfaces to enhance parallel performance will be exploited to model a variety
of wave problems in electromagnetics, acoustics, seismology, and elasticity.

The increasing interest in the accurate and efficient solution of wave-dominated
problems, e.g. problems in acoustic and electromagnetics, over very long periods
of time has spawned an interest in the formulation of high-order accurate
computational methods for such problems. In this effort we propose to develop a
new class of computational techniques, specifically aimed at the reliable and
robust modeling of problems of a realistic size and complexity, e.g., the
modeling of the propagation of electromagnetic and acoustic noise and its
environmental impact, and the modeling of underground waves of interest to the
oil industry. The proposed methods are unique in maintaining a very simple
computational structure without sacrificing the accuracy, hence overcoming a
number of well known difficulties associated with existing methods which require
some kind of automated generation of the computational grid on which the
solution is computed. These proposed developments will enable the modeling of
very complex and realistic scenarios and will, in combination with high-
performance computing facilities for which the methods are well suited, allow
for the modeling and analysis of complex wave dominated problems in a variety of
areas of interest to engineers and scientists.
