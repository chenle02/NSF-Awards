This project will evaluate the characteristics and capabilities of the world's
largest SWATH ship, the Japanese vessel KAIYO. Because of its superior
seakeeping characteristics, the SWATH (Small Waterplane Area Twin Hull) is of
considerable interest to the oceanographic community as a platform for ocean
science research. The SWATH shows promise of taking science into adverse sea
conditions currently inaccessible to conventional monohull designs. This study
will be the most extensive SWATH performance evaluation ever conducted. It will
examine the ship's structural integrity, its acoustic and vibration transmission
characteristics, its sea keeping and maneuvering ability in a variety of sea
conditions including validation of and correlation with scale model tank tests.
It will evaluate the ship's utility as a platform for a variety of ocean science
research and the long term effects of the SWATH's motions on personnel. The
project will gather data on SWATH ship design essential to long range planning
for new ship construction and to the proper and safe management of the academic
research fleet. The knowledge gained will be of great benefit to ocean science
planning and assessment activities of National Science Foundation, the Office of
Naval Research, the Naval Sea Systems Command, other Federal agencies, the
University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System and the academic science
community. Through a Memorandum of Understanding between the Naval Sea Systems
Command (NAVSEA) and the National Science Foundation (NSF), NAVSEA will provide
funds to NSF for this "SWATH RESEARCH VESSEL EVALUATION STUDY" to be carried out
under the direction of Dr. George D. Grice, Associate Director of the Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution. The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will be
responsible for overall project management including subcontracts to provide
engineering and technical expertise.
