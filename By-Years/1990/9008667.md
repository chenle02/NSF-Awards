Components are acquired to upgrade a crude molecular-beam apparatus to permit
direct observation of surface kinetics and to allow the study of weakly adsorbed
species. After the upgrade, the apparatus will be close to the state of the art.
The apparatus will be used in the experimental tests of the investigator's
theory of structure-sensitivity of surface reactions and for the study of metal-
organic chemical vapor deposition.
