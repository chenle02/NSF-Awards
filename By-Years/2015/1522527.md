Sleep is a major problem for parents of young children. This is demonstrated by
the large number of best-selling books on "sleep training" geared toward new
parents, and by the numerous courses offered to new parents focusing on helping
them get a better handle on their infant's sleep. But despite the attention
given to educating parents about how to teach their children to sleep, getting a
good night sleep remains one of the most anxiety-provoking aspects of parenting.
There are a large number of baby monitors currently on the market, but none
provide direct information about sleep. The majority of devices provide an audio
monitor so that parents can hear whether their baby is crying. But sound is a
poor proxy for sleep. The proposed project will solve this problem by developing
the high-fidelity baby sleep monitor for use at home by parents.

This I-Corps team will develop a consumer product that will provide better and
more direct information about sleep. The team will leverage recent developments
in both hardware and software to make measuring and monitoring sleep simple and
cost effective, so that parents will be able to monitor their infant's sleep.
The team will develop a product that provides parents with useful information
about their baby?s sleep by comparing measurements from their baby with the rest
of the database. The team intends to apply the technology in a wide range of
neurometric consumer products including self-monitoring of sleep throughout the
lifespan, monitoring arousal/vigilance of professional drivers (e.g.,truck
drivers) and pilots, and monitoring arousal/vigilance of security personnel
(e.g.,TSA).
