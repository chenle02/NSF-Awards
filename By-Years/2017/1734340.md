This project systematically tracks the development of a major legal term over
time. Using a multi-method research design, this project draws on quantitative
and qualitative analyses of court cases, news media reports, and in-depth
interviews with legal and non-legal actors to determine how a legal term of art
has been defined; how it articulates a principle that has shaped the trajectory
of subsequent law; and how both legal actors and non-legal actors have become a
part of shaping its use over time. The research will offer important insights
into how specific legal terms, adopted for a chosen policy purpose, can possibly
shift in meaning over time in response to new legal doctrine and, potentially,
due to changing social understanding. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will
analyze data from a variety of institutional settings [federal courts, federal
statutes, state statutes], popular media coverage [print media stories and op-
eds] and political actors [interest groups, social movements, and lawyers]. It
includes analysis of 487 Federal court decisions and accompanying case
documents, legal analysis of 265 federal and state statutes, textual analysis of
840 news stories and op-eds, and 40 interviews with stakeholders.
