The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) consists of 4 km
baseline interferometric gravitational wave detectors in Livingston, LA and
Hanford, WA, and an additional 2 km detector in Hanford. The LIGO Science
Collaboration, of which Louisiana State University (LSU) is a member, has begun
taking data with the LIGO detectors, and analyzing it looking for gravitational
waves from different kinds of astrophysical sources. The detectors are expected
to achieve their design sensitivity in late 2004-early 2005, when science runs 6
months or longer will begin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI's group at LSU will
work on three different critical aspects of the final phase of the commissioning
of the LIGO Observatories and the initial phase of data analysis activities of
the LIGO Science Collaboration:&lt;br/&gt;(1) diagnostics and control of angular
degrees of freedom in the LIGO detectors;&lt;br/&gt;(2) several detector
characterization projects (studying statistical properties of
the&lt;br/&gt;noise, the presence of bicoherence in the gravitational wave
signals, cataloging transients, improving calibration of the gravitational wave
channel); and&lt;br/&gt;(3) using the results of these studies as veto criteria
in the data analysis effort for bursts and inspiral gravitational wave
signals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The group's results will contribute significantly
to the improvement of the detectors' sensitivity, to the understanding of the
quality and features of the data obtained, and to the data analysis looking for
astrophysical signals. This project involves faculty, postdocs, graduate and
undergraduate students doing research at the cutting edge of gravitational wave
astrophysics. The work is a combination of hands-on experimental work,
investigations of noise sources, and data analysis techniques that will provide
a great learning experience for the undergraduate and graduate students in the
project, who will be able to perform their research at the LIGO Livingston
Observatory itself, only 30 miles from LSU.&lt;br/&gt;
