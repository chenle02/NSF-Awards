This research is to extend the study of earthquake fault rupture surfaces to
higher frequency radiation, above 3 hertz. In this range, waveform inversion has
proven impractical due to earth's complexities and a procedure has been
developed using seismic wave energy envelopes. The technique locates high
frequency energy sources on extended faults by means of strong motion
seismograms. Preliminary results indicate that the high frequency energy sources
are located along or near the boundaries of large slip zones. This supports the
hypothesis that high frequencies are most strongly generated from rupture
stopping areas or areas with large slip variation, which has implications for
earthquake hazard estimates. The current work will extend the analysis to more
earthquakes. This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard
Reduction Program.
