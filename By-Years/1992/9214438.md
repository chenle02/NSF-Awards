This award is for repair and rehabilitation of the Glassell Building and its
contiguous pen. This seawater facility is utilized by every scientific research
program on the RSMAS campus that requires direct access to seawater. These
programs include investigations in coral ecology, plankton ecology, pathology,
physiology, animal behavior, bioacoustics, biochemistry and the culture of
marine organisms. It also provides space and instrumentation for both graduate
and undergraduate students being trained in one or more of these disciplines.
This renovation is indispensable for continuing and expanding these and future
programs at the School and is essential if they are to achieve and maintain
state-of-the- art capabilities in experimental marine biology. Currently, users
are handicapped by the difficult environment of a building that has served as
the School's major seawater facility for 28 years. Within the last two years,
the School has conducted a major renovation of the entire exterior of the
Glassell Building, including various structural repairs, supervised and
certified by structural engineers. These have assured that the building will be
safe and secure for many years to come. This award will complete the renovation
of the entire facility.
