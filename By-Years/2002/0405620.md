This is a nanomagnetism collaboration that involves researchers from New York
University and IBM, Yorktown Heights, NY. The aim is to further understand and
apply nanoscale spin-transfer devices and materials. In miniature magnetic
devices an electrical current can transport spin angular momentum between
magnetic layers and produce magnetic reversal as well as magnetic excitations.
This may enable rapid and coherent reversal in nanomagnets with large magnetic
anisotropy -- a reversal that would otherwise require large local magnetic
fields. This is important to increasing magnetic information storage density.
This project will address important fundamental questions about the nature of
the interaction between the current and the magnetization through studies of new
device structures and materials. An essential component is the application of a
new batch-fabricated nanostencil-substrate methodology to enable the rapid
prototyping of multilayer structures with nanometer scale lateral dimensions
(<100 nm). This research will be integrated with the training of young
scientists: Graduate and undergraduate students involved in this collaboration
will gain by interactions between academia and industry and through the many
planned student exchanges between NYU and IBM. High school students (with
interests in Intel Science Research) will also participate in this research.

This project brings together researchers from New York University and IBM with
the aim of furthering the understanding and application of nanometer scale
magnetic devices and materials. Magnetic nanostructures are widely used in
technology with the most advanced applications found in information processing.
This is a significant industry in the United States that is growing rapidly,
with ever-increasing worldwide demands for data processing and storage. It has
recently been discovered that in miniature magnetic devices a direct electrical
current can switch the direction of magnetization by a mechanism know as spin-
transfer. This is an exciting development that may enable dramatic improvements
in magnetic information processing and storage. There are many important and
fundamental questions about the nature of the interaction between the current
and magnetization that this project will address through the investigation of
new device structures and materials. This research will be integrated with the
training of young scientists in this forefront area of magnetism research.
Graduate and undergraduate students involved in this collaboration will gain by
interactions between academia and industry and through the many planned
exchanges between NYU and IBM. High school students (with interests in Intel
Science Research) will also participate in this research.
