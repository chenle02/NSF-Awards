9522010 Sadeghi Failure of lubricated tribological contacts is in most cases
caused by debris in the lubricant. This study will develop analytical and
experimental techniques to calculate and measure the effects of debris on
performance parameters such as pressure, temperature, film thickness, and stress
distribution in the solid surfaces. The stress calculations will be used to
model crack propagation in fatigue spall development leading to mechanical
failure. A multi-purpose tribotester will be used to obtain experimental data to
validate the model from tests with lubricants that contain various
concentrations and sizes of debris. ***
