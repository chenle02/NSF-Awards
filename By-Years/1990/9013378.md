Isolated teeth, and jaw fragments containing teeth, represent a significant
proportion of early hominid fossils. These specimens are the focus of continuing
interest and study, and will contribute to future debates on hominid phylogeny.
Current methods of analysis of differences between teeth of purportedly
different species are limited by current methodologies. This project will
implement new three dimensional laser scanning technologies to record and
analyze differences between postcanine dental crowns of known hominoid species
and apply the same technology to the assessment of fossil molars. The data for
each crown surface, which generally exceeds 33,000 discreet 3D surface points
per crown, will be stored and analyzed in a modified computer assisted design
system. Superimposition and simple finite element scaling techniques will be
used to analyze surface data from the teeth. These data should prove
instrumental in revealing new and useful phylogenetic as well as functional
patterns in hominoid molars.
