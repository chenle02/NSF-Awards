This research seeks to improve the accuracy of methods to solve some particular
eigenvalue problems. The first is the classical symmetric eigenvalue problem.
Recent results have shown that there is a large class of symmetric eigenvalue
problems for which small structured perturbations result in small changes in the
eigenvalues in the relative sense. This class of matrices is called ``well-
behaved''. The problem of finding a necessary and sufficient condition for a
matrix to be ``well-behaved'' is being investigated. A number of related issues
have to be considered, including: analysis of methods for updating indefinite
eigenvalue problems; investigation of methods for updating the ULV and ULLV
approximations to the singular value decomposition and generalized singular
value decomposition; and development of analysis of methods for computing the
sparse generalized singular value decomposition. The last two issues are
extremely important in the solution of ill-posed least squares problems and
total least squares problems. The implications of derived results for these
problems are being investigated.
