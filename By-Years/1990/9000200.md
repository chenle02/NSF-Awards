The work generalizes switching regression models and limited dependent variable
models in order to apply them in a dynamic context. Using the Panel Survey on
Income Dynamics, the investigators will estimate the parameters of a lifecycle
model involving Euler equations. Incorporated in this model will be the
assumptions of a lifetime budget constraint as well as a liquidity constraint.
One of the important developments in this research is the use of the method of
simulated scores to estimate the model. Households do appear to switch their
consumption and labor supply patterns over long periods. They are likely to be
constrained early on in their lifetime, at the time of major purchases or
unforseen events (such as unemployment, catastrophic illness, etc). The
incorporation of the endogeneity and imperfect observability of liquidity
constraints in the type of model that is being estimated will make it easier to
confirm the importance of these constraints on household behavior. Because of
the methods used, the techniques can be generalized to the constraints that
firms face, as well.
