The quality of undergraduate education in the scientific process has been
enhanced through the acquisition of routine gas chromatograph/mass spectrometers
for use in courses which service chemistry majors, premedical students and non-
science majors. The primary us of the instrumentation is in the two semester
organic chemistry course. Instead of first learning reaction details in lecture
with subsequent verification in the laboratory, students are first guided to
predict major reaction products (often based on results from molecular mechanics
calculations), conduct the reaction (representative of that introduced in
lecture without mechanistic detail) and observe trends in product formation. In
most instances, each student executes experiments under slightly different
conditions; the class results are pooled and displayed with a computer
projection system by the instructor. Students participate as a group in the
analysis and discussion of their results to formulate and test plausible
mechanisms. Utilization of instrumentation in this "discovery" approach promotes
true student involvement in the study of organic chemistry, increases interest
in the discipline and thus betters chances of attracting and retaining chemistry
majors. The school contributed to this project in an amount equal to the NSF
funds.
