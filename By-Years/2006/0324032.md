Richland College is providing scholarships for full-time computer science
majors&lt;br/&gt;qualifying for financial aid. The scholarships are increasing
the number of students&lt;br/&gt;graduating with an associate degree in computer
science and increasing the number of&lt;br/&gt;students transferring to a four-
year college or university in the field of computer science. The academic
program is founded on the instructional approach of learning communities and a
program design of block scheduling. This approach provides greater coherence in
curriculum, builds a community of active learners and creates diverse, academic
peer groups for enriched learning and student development. The integrated
educational experience imparts communication skills, critical thinking skills
and a developed sense of citizenry to students creating a broader impact to
society beyond college environment and a greater benefit to employers. A cohort
of twenty students is receiving two-year scholarships during each of the first
three years of the project. &lt;br/&gt;
