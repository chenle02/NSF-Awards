This project has been designed for 30 participants representing minority high
school students from rural areas of North Carolina. It grew out of the
realization that in many rural areas of our nation, particularly the Southern
states with low educational budgets, and specifically in North Carolina, there
may be few (2-5) minority students in a science class, and the budgets of these
schools do not permit the kind of scientific and technical experiences that
would motivate these students to careers in science and engineering, regardless
of their potential. Whereas urban students can participate in special Saturday
or after-school activities, for rural minority science students, their best
opportunity comes through Institute experiences such as proposed in this
proposal. Specifically, several objectives have been proposed: (1) to identify
and recruit thirty (30) minority (black) high school students in North Carolina
who possess the attributes and academic potential for pursuing a career in the
sciences and engineering; (2) to prepare the targeted students to enter a four-
year college, and to pursue a course of study that will lead to entry into a
science or engineering career by providing the courses in the basic sciences and
mathematics; (3) to provide role models and career counseling by bringing
speakers on campus; (4) to stimulate interest in the study of science and
engineering by providing "hands-on" laboratory experiences, computer workshops,
and field trips; and (5) to provide for the targeted students, an opportunity to
explore options available to them in science and engineering, by providing field
trips and workshops. Plans are described for a six-weeks program, with M T Th F
being devoted to classroom work, W to seminars and field trips, and Sa and Su
devoted to cultural awareness experiences. One weakness of the proposal is the
lack of involvement of business and industry in providing financial support and
opportunities for cultural awareness experiences and industrial trips. No
letters of support were found. However, the similarity of the problem in many
rural areas could make this a "model."
