Based on recent work on reverse micellar solubilization of hydrophilic proteins
and recent observations of reverse micelles in supercritical fluids, it is
hypothesized that hydrophilic proteins may be readily taken up by and
precipitated from reverse micelles in a supercritical fluid. Since aggregation
numbers of reverse micelles vary tremendously with the solubility parameter of
the organic used as a solvent and since the solubility parameter of a
supercritical solvent varies dramatically with the location of the system in
phase space above the critical point, aggregation numbers of reverse micelles
should vary dramatically with pressure and temperature in a supercritical
solvent. Since the partition coefficient of proteins in reverse micelles is
strongly dependent on the size of the reverse micelles, slight changes in
conditions above the critical point might readily force the proteins from the
reverse micelles into an aqueous phase. This phenomenon, if it can be
demonstrated, would form the basis of a potentially valuable separation process
for biomolecules. This system has many elements which make it highly promising
with regard to industrial applications in the area of bioseparations.
