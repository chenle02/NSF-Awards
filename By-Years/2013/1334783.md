The research objective of this project is to develop a robust computational
fracture tool to simulate pervasive three-dimensional fracture processes in
materials and structures. Under extreme loading conditions, the extent of
fracture is pervasive in materials and structures - multitude of cracks can
nucleate, coalesce, branch, and propagate in arbitrary directions. Cohesive
tetrahedral finite elements (4 facets per element) are presently the method-of-
choice for such complex simulations, but show mesh-dependencies in such fracture
simulations. Due to the presence of many more facets than in a tetrahedral mesh,
a polyhedral mesh provides more pathways for crack formation and growth. Issues
pertaining to weak convergence (fragment mass distribution, crack path) in the
numerical simulations will be examined, and verification studies will be
conducted to assess convergence of the fracture simulations. These novelties in
a computational fracture simulation tool can overcome the existing limitations
of deterministic tetrahedral finite element meshes and thus pave the way for a
breakthrough in this key area of computational fracture research.

A successful outcome in this project will change the way the largest and most
complex failure simulations are done, and open the way for many new applications
of polyhedral finite element methods. The potential impact of this project will
be significant in physics-based fracture modeling: for example, brittle and
ductile fracture of metallic materials, biomaterials, geophysics, rock
mechanics, CO2 sequestration, and fluid-driven fractures (hydraulic fracturing)
are pertinent applications. The educational plan focuses on the integration of
the research within graduate curricula on advanced finite element methods and
fracture. The external collaboration with Dr. Bishop at Sandia National
Laboratories will enable the new methods developed to be incorporated in large-
scale software codes at the laboratory, and also provide an enriched summer
internship opportunity for graduate students to work on topical areas at the
forefront in computational failure mechanics.
