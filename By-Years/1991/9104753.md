The relationship between paleotopography and modern morphology is necessary to
understanding the formation of barrier islands and lagoons, two of the most
critical environments along the U.S. coastline. This doctoral dissertation
project will study the processes of barrier island lagoonal development on the
southern Delmarva Pennisula of the eastern shore of Virginia. It will examine
the implications of those processes for barrier coastline development. Pollen,
grain size, microfossil, and x-ray radiography analyses will be used to develop
a clear picture of the nature of the topography before the spread of the sea
over the area and of the timing of the inundation of the surface. This project
will generate valuable information about barrier island evolution by increasing
our understanding of the position of present coastal morphology in the continuum
of Holocene coastal change. By adding to our knowledge of this evolution, this
project will contribute to our ability to deal with the potential increase in
the complexity of the management of these coastal environments should the sea-
level change. This project also will provide an excellent opportunity for a
promising young scholar to continue to develop independent research skills.
