County&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NGS: Workshop on Manufacturing Software Integration
Research: Status and Future Directions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop is to
support travel and registration expenses for invited speakers, and students to
attend The Workshop on Manufacturing Software Integration Research. It will be
held at NIST and will bring together researchers to discuss systems software
issues on supporting the integration of heterogeneous software components, a
very important issue in enabling modern manufacturing planning and control
support systems.&lt;br/&gt;
