Large oceanic plateaus are enormous submarine volcanic platforms that are
probably marine equivalents of catastrophically erupted continental flood basalt
provinces. Recent research on exposed volcanic rocks in the Caribbean suggest
that both the Caribbean crust and surrounding ophiolites may have been formed
during a major volcanic episode. Research on this award will explore this
hypothesis by detailed dating of these volcanic rocks.
