This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2009
and is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public
Law 111-5). The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host
laboratory for the Fellow. The title of the research and training plan for this
fellowship to Erin M. Myers is "Comparative genetics of wing shape across
Drosophila." This research is being conducted at the University of Houston under
the sponsorship of Dr. William A. Frankino.

The genetics underlying the expression and evolution of most ecologically or
medically important traits is largely unknown. This research uses a variety of
approaches in a model system to determine the genetic architecture of
interspecific wing shape for several species pairs within the genus Drosophila,
as well as the degree of conservation of this architecture. To elucidate this
genetic framework, the research integrates geometric morphometrics, quantitative
genetics, and comparative genomics to identify the number of genetic regions
contributing to interspecific variation in wing shape and the type (e.g. major
vs. minor effect, additive vs. non-additive) and magnitude of these effects. In
so doing, the project necessitates the development of new software to assist in
data acquisition and incorporates novel genotyping and analytical techniques.
The research addresses significant questions in evolutionary biology and
provides a research template for future studies in non-model systems.

As part of the fellowship, training goals include genetic mapping and using
model systems. Broader impacts include broad dissemination to the biological
community, including advancements in methodology and software to assist in the
collection of morphological data as well as mentoring undergraduate students.
