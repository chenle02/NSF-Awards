This study will focus on compiling existing knowledge from arctic water balance
studies. This will be accomplished through 1) data collection through a survey
of individual sites, 2) integrated data set development, and 3) comparative
analysis. This research will create a unique database of water balance elements
for the high latitude basins. The data will be used to compare and understand
the water balance results from high latitude watersheds, with special emphasis
on inter-annual variability, regional variability, long-term averages of the
various hydrologic components (annual and seasonal), methodology for
computations and scientific framework. Common issues, both strengths and
weaknesses in northern hydrologic studies will be identified and collaborative
research efforts to address these common issues will be recommended. The overall
goal of this effort is to advance our understanding of circumpolar hydrologic
processes through the synthesis of existing international data sets.
