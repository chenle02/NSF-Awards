9308662 Eshaghian A novel parallel programming tool called Cluster-M will be
implemented. Cluster-M provides an environment for efficiently designing highly
parallel machine independent software. Using this tool a single parallel program
can be ported, mapped and executed on various multiprocessor systems, therefore,
significantly reducing the cost of software development. Also designing parallel
algorithms using Cluster-M is simple and need not be done by an expert. The main
components of this paradigm are the Cluster-M specifications and
representations. Cluster-M specification is a highly parallel program which
specifies the communication and computation requirements of a solution to a
given problem by exploiting and emphasizing all the concurrent tasks at every
step of an algorithm. On the other hand, Cluster-M representation represents the
processor interconnection topology of the underlying architectures. The
specification can be mapped onto different Cluster-M representations, using the
mapping methodologies, which are proposed to be implemented. ***
