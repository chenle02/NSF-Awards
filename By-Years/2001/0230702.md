Abstract

Engineering Our World The purpose of this proposal, Engineering Our World. is
to plan and pilot a program for improving teacher knowledge and student
understanding of the concepts of various engineering disciplines and how these
relate to their current science and mathematics curriculum. The program will be
designed to both engage and educate middle school students through the use of
hands-on, inquiry-based experiments in a mathematically rich environment. One
unusual feature of this program is the inclusion of teacher workshops and
monthly follow-up classroom visits. Another feature is development of a course
for pre-service teachers. The existence of this new course will increase the
impact of this project in years to come.

The focus of the summer teacher workshops will be threefold: 1) to improve the
middle school teachers' backgrounds of engineering disciplines and their
relevance to physical science and associated mathematical concepts in their
current curriculum, 2) to introduce the teachers to techniques for integrating
content and learning standards (including content literacy) into the curriculum,
and 3) to provide teachers with instruction concerning how to use inexpensive
materials to provide hands-on learning experiences in their classroom. . The
purpose of the follow-up classroom visits will be to assist the teachers in
implementing the hands-on engineering experiments in their classrooms and to
respond to teachers' questions concerning science and engineering concepts. In
other words, members of the CSM faculty team will become a valuable classroom
resource for both students and teachers alike.

In parallel with this effort, a program for pre-service teachers will be
developed. The University of Colorado at Colorado Springs will pilot a one-
semester course for pre-service teachers covering the .Fundamentals of
Engineering.. The pre-service teachers will use materials developed through this
project during classroom visits with in-service teachers and apply these
materials during their student teaching experiences at the middle school level.
This proposal is intended to develop/adapt an appropriate set of course material
for the teacher workshops and in-class lessons, and to test and evaluate the
materials in urban and suburban classrooms. The joint effort of addressing both
in-service and pre-service teachers will provide a continuous stream of
knowledgeable instructors that can use engineering principals to illustrate the
practical applications of science and mathematics to middle school students.
