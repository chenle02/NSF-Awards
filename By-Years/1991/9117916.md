During Mesozoic and Tertiary time the western margin of North America developed
by the accretion and rearrangement of numerous fault-bounded blocks or terranes.
Detritus shed from these blocks accumulated in basins and may record some of the
history of this tectonism. This project will address several questions by use of
Sm-Nd and U-Pb isotopic studies of Mesozoic sequences in northern Washington
State and southern British Columbia, including determining when the terranes
arrived and began to contribute detritus to the basins and whether the volcanic
activity recorded in the basins reflects oceanic or continental margin volcanic
arcs. Results are expected to provide new insights to the tectonic development
of northwestern North America and to further demonstrate the utility of this
technique.
