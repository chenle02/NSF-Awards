The prehistory of the Aleutian Islands is poorly known and there is little
understanding of the development of cultural complexity in this region. This
archaeological investigation involves the excavation and analysis of structures
and middens in the Shumagin Islands. The project is designed to determine how
many of the structures were occupied simultaneously and what variation exists in
larger and smaller structures. In addition to determining the distributions of
implements and prestige goods, the excavations will render food remains
indicative of diet. Combined with this new information, overall patterns of site
densities in the Aleutians will enable estimates of prehistoric Aleutian
populations.
