The Institute for Astronomy (IfA) at the University of Hawaii will host a summer
REU (Research Experiences for Undergraduates) site in astronomy. With about 50
faculty members and a share of all the telescopes on Maunakea and Haleakala, the
IfA offers undergraduate students a wide range of opportunities. This REU site
will provide research experience and professional development training for 5-6
students on O'ahu and a cohort of 3-4 students on either Maui or the Big Island
each year; along with the research training, the program will benefit society by
enabling scientific collaboration and interaction between native Hawaiian and
non-Hawaiian students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Distributing students across
multiple islands provides the best diversity of research opportunities: (1) IfA-
Hilo carries out state-of-the-art instrumentation projects for the
optical/infrared telescopes on Maunakea; (2) IfA Maui has a strong solar focus,
including developing two first-light instruments for the Daniel K. Inouye
Advanced Solar Telescope on Haleakala; and (3) IfA-Manoa has the largest staff
and research breadth, with over 40 research faculty in areas ranging from
planetary science to cosmology. In addition to a mentored research project, the
professional development activities include an intensive short-course a weekly
professional development in research skills at the start of the summer (on
O'ahu), a weekly professional development lunch series, and visits to the
observatories and nearby cultural landmarks on Maunakea (Big Island) or
Haleakala (Maui). IfA is ideally positioned to attract Native Hawaiians and
Pacific Islanders into their first research experience through the REU program.
