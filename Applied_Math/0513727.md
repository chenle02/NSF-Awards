Title: Conference on Nonlinear Waves, Integrable Systems and Their Applications

The proposed conference will bring together a diverse group of world's leading
experts under the complementary topics of nonlinear waves, integrable systems
and their applications. The conference participants will be comprised of experts
in both theory and applications. There will be a substantial emphasis on
problems of optical communications, Bose-Einstein condensates, and ultra-short
pulse lasers. Mathematical topics include inverse scattering and other
theoretical aspects of integrable nonlinear evolution equations. The topics
slated for discussion are in the forefront of research in nonlinear science, and
have witnessed enormous progress at a phenomenal pace in recent times. In
particular, the past few years has seen new applications of soliton theory to
lightwave communication and rare event simulation of lightwave systems, and
rapid experimental progress in the fields of Bose-Einstein condensation and
ultra-short pulse lasers; all of these application fields are strongly corelated
with the theory of nonlinear waves and integrable systems. Consequently, a
comprehensive conference covering these topics is planned.

The conference speakers will report the latest theoretical and experimental
results in the areas mentioned above. Participants, especially younger
scientists, will benefit from becoming aware of the latest results in their
respective fields, and will also be able to discuss with leading international
experts. Because of the inter-disciplinary nature of the conference, experts
will become aware of the latest work in fields related to but different from
their own. Thus, the conference will provide a forum for cross-fertilization of
ideas amongst various disciplines. In addition, the inclusion of students and
scientists at the beginnings of their careers in the conference will promote the
transfer of this expertise to the next generation of mathematicians and applied
scientists.
