The APQC workshop will help define Quantum Performance Assessment, an emerging
research field that seeks answers to the overarching question "How do we assess,
probe, measure, quantify, and report the quality or performance of quantum
computational devices?". Experts from diverse subfields of physics, computer
science, and quantum information will discuss aspects of quantum tomography,
benchmarking, algorithms, compilation, hardware design, computational
complexity, error correction, and experimental physics. The APQC scientific
program will include talks in four areas of interest to quantum performance
assessment: (i) Quantum characterization, verification, and validation, (ii)
Quantum algorithms, (iii) Quantum error correction, (iv) Quantum "supremacy".
Participants will share best practices, identify gaps in knowledge, and nucleate
interdisciplinary collaborations to address challenge problems in quantum
performance assessment.

This project advances the objectives of two of 10 Big Ideas for Future NSF
Investments: "Quantum Leap" and "Growing Convergent Research at NSF". The 10 big
ideas will push forward the frontiers of U.S. research, provide innovative
approaches to solve some of the most pressing problems the world faces, as well
as lead to discoveries not yet known. This project also advances objectives of
the National Quantum Initiative (NQI), a coordinated multiagency program to
support research and training in Quantum Information Science (QIS).

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
