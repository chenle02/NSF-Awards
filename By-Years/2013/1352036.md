In this project funded by the Chemical Catalysis program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor Xuan Zhao of the University of Memphis is developing new
catalysts for the generation of hydrogen (an important chemical feedstock and
future fuel) from water and sunlight. To accomplish this, new catalysts that are
based on economically attractive metals such as cobalt are being developed.
Additionally, the details of how the catalysts function are being determined.
This information will provide a guide to form yet more efficient materials to
convert water to hydrogen and may be applied to other potential applications
such as the reduction of carbon dioxide. The project involves the training of
undergraduate and graduate students in catalytic science. An outreach program
will provide Memphis area students and faculty at predominantly undergraduate
institutions with opportunities to participate in renewable energy research and
to learn about solar energy conversion and photocatalysis through weekend
workshops, summer research opportunities and local meetings.

The central hypothesis of this project is that the complexation of a metal ion
by a single polydentate ligand that leaves one open site on the metal will
result in stable metal complexes with high catalytic activity toward the
photocatalytic reduction of water. The research centers largely on cobalt
complexes for which preliminary data supports the hypothesis, but includes other
earth abundant metals. In addition to synthetic studies aimed at forming these
complexes with a variety of ligands, a detailed mechanistic investigation is
being carried out to determine the active species for proton binding and
reduction, whether H-H formation occurs through a homolytic or heterolytic
pathway, and the general factors that control the mechanism of H2 evolution. The
mechanistic studies are being conducted in collaboration with research
scientists at Brookhaven National Laboratory.
