This projects incorporates several recent developments in optimization methods
and nonlinear multigrid methods to provide a new technique to improve the
computational efficiency of practical applications. Successful integration of
our fast optimization methods will open a wide new area of applications ranging
from numerical solution of partial differential equations to optimization
methods for large-scale machine learning. Social media such as Facebook and
GitHub will be used to disseminate basics on applied and computational
mathematics and promote the research to a wider audience in both academia and
industry, as well as increase the public awareness of how computational
mathematics help the advancement of research in other physical and data
sciences. This project will provide training opportunities for graduate
students.

The project focuses on a particular nonlinear multigrid method, the fast
subspace descent (FASD) method, for solving optimization problems arising from
various applications such as numerical solution of partial differential
equations and data science problems. For example, the nonlinear multigrid
methods to be studied can address the challenging problems in engineering
applications including gradient flow in phase field models, Poisson-Boltzmann
equation in math biology, and convex composite optimization problems in data
science. Acceleration has been one of the most productive ideas in modern
optimization theory. This framework brings more insight and mathematical tools
for the design and analysis of old and new optimization methods, especially the
accelerated gradient descent methods. Another important aspect of this project
will be the rigorous theoretical foundation for a large class of optimization
methods.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
