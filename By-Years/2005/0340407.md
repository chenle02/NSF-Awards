This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
explore the development of a fundamentally new class of ferroelectric liquid
crystals (FLCs) containing germanium. Only one germanium liquid crystal compound
has been prepared until this year. A new germanium compound has shown tremendous
promise in revolutionizing the scope of FLC devices. The Phase I objectives are
to synthesize 20 new compounds and to explore the unique properties of this
fundamentally new class of LCs, applying the findings towards commercial
application. Anticipated results include an improved understanding of the
physical, chemical, and optical properties of these new materials, and the
identification of further FLC material and cell advances that need to be
achieved in Phase II for subsequent commercialization. The new class of FLCs may
afford a more durable device showing broader temperature range and lower
birefringence (ease of manufacture), and most of all, operate in both analog and
bistable modes.

The commercial application of this project is in optical communications. Because
germanium FLCs have the potential to afford both analog and bistable operation
(a result of bookshelf layer structure) many areas will be opened to
commercialization. Phase modulation is the foundation for electro-optical beam
steering and optical wave front correction, which find application in free-space
optical communications, in beam steering and beam shaping for laser radar in
aviation, and in active optics. The new FLCs will also enable higher performance
megabit write-heads for emerging holographic data storage, and will be useful
for optical information processing. In addition, fast, bistable LCs have been
needed for FLC displays, allowing access to the multibillion-dollar projection
display market.
