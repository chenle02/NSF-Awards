SSC-9353260 Kishton, Joseph M. University of North Carolina at Wilmington
Wilmington, NC "Cape Fear Summer Science Camp" Cape Fear Summer Camp is a four-
week summer program combined with academic year follow- up activities aimed at
increasing minority representation in the areas of science, engineering and
mathematics. Objectives of the program include providing students with hands-on
experience developing the process skills of observation, measurement and
analysis. Successive groups of fifty minority students will be taught by
experienced public school science and mathematic instructors. Classroom and
laboratory instruction will be integrated with field exercises with a coastal
science emphasis. Some of the accomplished graduates from each group will serve
as peer mentors for subsequent students and will also participate in focused
career exploration activities including involvement in mentoring relationships
with professionals working in science, technology and engineering occupations.
