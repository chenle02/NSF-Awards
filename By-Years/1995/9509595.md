Collaborative: Alternate States and Ecosystem Metabolism in Lakes: Interactions
of Nutrients and DOC Some lakes are blue, but most are green or brown. We have
learned a great deal about eutrophication, the process that turns lakes green
and leads to nuisance blooms of algae. Dystrophy, the process that turns lakes
brown, is less understood but has important interactions with fisheries, gas
flow to and from lakes, and cycling of metals such as mercury. This project will
study the interactions of biogeochemical inputs and food web structure that
control dystrophy and eutrophy in lakes. We will quantify conditions that lead
to change in lake ecosystem state, and assess responses of ecosystem production,
respiration, gas exchange, and energy sources for fish production. This research
is a collaborative study by limnologists, microbial ecologists, biogeochemists
and fish ecologists. We will conduct a three year program of whole lake
experiments and modeling studies to find the mechanisms, response rates, and
constraints associated shifts from eutrophy to dystrophy and vi ce versa.
