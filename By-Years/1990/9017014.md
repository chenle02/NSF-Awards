Applicants to the NSF fiscal year 1989-90 Minority Graduate Fellowship
competition who were given "Honorable Mention", and who enrolled as graduate
students in Computer Science/Engineering at a university, were eligible to apply
to the CISE Directorate for a Special Graduate Student Education and Research
Award. Eleven universities attended by these students are being provided awards
of $6,000 each to assist the students with their education and research. The
students will receive $5,000 of each award. These awards are designed to provide
special encouragement to students who were judged worthy of a Minority Graduate
Fellowship, but who, for lack of funds could not be awarded one.
