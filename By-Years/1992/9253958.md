This collaborative project is being implemented at the University of Iowa,
University of Wisconsin-La Crosse, and Brigham Young University. Renewed
calculus materials developed through the NSF supported project at the University
of Iowa will be revised, tested, and refined at these three institutions. The
project involves extensive training of faculty and teaching assistants to use
these materials and approaches. In addition to ideas through large open ended
projects on a variety of scientific and mathematical problems.
