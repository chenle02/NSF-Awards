This award to University of Arizona is supported by the Advanced Materials
Program in the Chemistry Division.The research by Professors Seth Marder and
Joseph Perry will address structure-property relationships and applications of
molecules and molecular ensembles that exhibit two-photon absorption. The goals
of the research are to develop a detailed understanding of how to optimize the
two-photon absorption cross section in centrosymmetric and noncentrosymmetric
(dipolar,quadrupolar, octupolar and hexadecapolar) molecules and to design
chromophores that utilize effectively the excited states to efficiently drive
chemical reactions that create reactive radicals and Bronsted or Lewis acids and
bases. The research will enhance the three dimensional spatially resolved
patterning of materials. Processes enabled by either photoinduced electron or
energy transfer, will yield species that will microscopically photopolymerize
reactive monomers, photodeposit metals and semiconductors,and photogenerate
catalysts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Highly efficient two-photon initiators allowing
the patterning of a range of materials,will make three dimensional
microfabrication a viable technology for the production of micro-optics, micro-
mechanical components and microfluidic circuits. The scope of this
interdisciplinary research is broad, encompassing synthesis, materials, theory,
characterization and fabrication. Students will be trained across the fields of
chemistry, physics, materials and optical science.
