Regulation of RNA stability plays an important role in gene expression, but the
mechanisms involved are poorly understood. This proposal addresses molecular and
biochemical factors that regulate differential turnover of higher plant plastid
mRNAs during organelle biogenesis. Emphasis is placed on the study of highly
conserved inverted repeat (IR) sequences found at the 3' ends of plastid mRNAs.
Plastid 3' IRs bind proteins, and act as RNA processing elements and stability
determinants in vitro. I propose to investigate whether protein:RNA associations
at the IR are involved in the regulation of plastid RNA turnover. These studies
will entail mutagenesis of 3' IR sequences, and purification of RNA-binding
proteins These proteins will be used in functional assays and to raise
antibodies, which will be used to investigate developmental changes in protein
concentrations, and eventually in isolation of the genes encoding them. The in
vivo structure of plastid mRNAs will be probed by analyzing ribonucleoprotein
particles (RNPs) from plastids, and their half lives will be quantified by in
vivo labeling. The long-term objectives are to develop a model for the
developmental control of plastid mRNA stability, and to determine if nuclear
gene products are among the factors that influence plastid mRNA decay.***//
