The growth, differentiation and survival of nerve cells, or neurons, depend
upon signals exchanged between them and the structures they innervate with
synaptic contacts. A protein that is believed to be important in synapse
formation is agrin. This project exploits a well-known neuromuscular synapse in
the eye, and a novel technique for molecular analysis of single neurons to
examine the control of the expression of the genes which produce agrin.
Molecular and cellular biological techniques allow examining changes in agrin
expression during development, and the origins within single cells of the four
alternatively spliced messenger-RNA sequences involved in the expression.
Results will be important to understanding cell-cell interactions that direct
synapse formation during development, which is fundamental to organization of
the nervous system.
