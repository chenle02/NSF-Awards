With this proposal the principal investigator will continue his analytical and
numerical studies of discontinuous solutions of mathematical models of viscous,
compressible flows in two and three space dimensions. In particular, he will
investigate the well-posedness of the boundary value problems for the systems of
nonlinear hyperbolic equations resulting from the models, and he will design
improved numerical schemes for resolving the discontinuities present in the
solutions. Very often mathematicians and fluid dynamicists study one-
dimensional models of complicated flow phenomena in order to gain insights into
the behavior of real flows in two and three space dimensions. In the present
grant the principal investigator will extend some of his results for one-
dimensional models of the gasdynamic equations to more realistic models in
higher dimensions. Problems in more than one dimension are difficult, and so the
investigator will employ a combined analytical- numerical approach to study
discontinuous solutions called "shocks".
