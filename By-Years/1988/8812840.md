This is a project to process and interpret two seismic reflection lines and two
sonobuoy reversed refraction profiles using state of the art techniques. Data is
from the continental shelf and slope off southern central California. The hope
is to produce an image and velocity-depth profile beneath the Santa Maria Basin
in order to determine how deep reflections beneath the continental slope are
related to those beneath the coast and to determine how far the Pacific plate
extends beneath the North American margin. %%% Seismic reflection and refraction
studies of the type to be carried out in this project can help elucidate the
detailed structure of continental margins and can help constrain models of their
geological evolution. This is important because continental margins are
important areas of hydrocarbon formation and preservation as well as for mineral
resources.
