This Minority Research Initiation (MRI) planning grant will support release
time, travel and other related costs for the investigator to prepare a
competitive proposal to study toxic substances in ash that results from the
combustion of municipal wastes. Specifically, the research project will: (a)
study the toxic nature of residual incinerator ash generated from the combustion
of municipal waste; and (b) examine the suitability of developing technology to
allow safe and cost effective disposal (or resource recovery). The principal
investigator is a well-trained minority scientist who has several publications
in refereed journals. The research will have a significant impact on resolving
this Nation's waste disposal problem.
