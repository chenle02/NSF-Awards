This research is concerned with determining individual differences in feeding
behavior in ring-tailed lemurs, Lemura catta. The researcher will compare
feeding behavior and resource utilization in two groups of free-ranging lemurs
in Madagascar. Specifically, the researcher will investigate the time spent in
feeding, food consumption, and use of feeding sites by male and female adults.
She will identify the effects of reproductive state, activity level, gender, age
and social ranking on feeding behavior and diet. Even though ring-tailed lemurs
are the best studied prosimians in captivity, wild Lemur catta have never been
the subject of an in-depth study of this kind. It is expected that in addition
to providing data on individual feeding behavior, the study will provide much-
needed behavioral comparisons to other primates and humans. The research is
timely and important. Information on feeding behavior is Lemurs, especially
those living in the wild is sadly lacking. Prior studies have concentrated on
differences in feeding behavior between different species or members of
different groups of the same species, but very few have looked at variation in
understanding the relationship between habitat, social structure, and the
individual. In addition, the dwindling habitat of primates and the increase in
hunting means that research of this type must be conducted soon in order to
enhance the survival of species.
