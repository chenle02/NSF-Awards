The broad goal of this project is to understand the processes that support
perception and action in complex settings. The research focuses on spatial
perception and navigation in the echolocating bat, an auditory specialist that
produces high frequency sonar calls and listens to echo returns to determine the
location of objects in its environment. The echolocating bat modifies its sonar
calls in response to echo information from targets (insect prey) and obstacles,
and quantitative analyses of this animal?s adaptive vocal behavior will be used
to infer its perception of a changing environment. The biological component of
this research combines behavioral and neurophysiological experiments to gain
insight to how sensory information from complex scenes is coded and used to
guide behaviors. Analysis of behavioral and neural data will be coordinated with
modeling efforts and the development of a robotic spatial navigation system.
Together, the biological and engineering arms of this research project will
generate new knowledge that contributes to a deeper understanding of perception
and action in complex, natural environments. Students and postdocs working on
this project will learn to translate knowledge and methodologies across biology
and engineering, ranging from ethology and neurobiology to computational
modeling and robotic demonstrations. These individuals will be poised to make
major contributions that impact both basic science and future technology,
enabling breakthroughs that cannot be achieved through work solely within
traditional disciplines. This research project will contribute to a rich library
of multimedia materials that will be made available to educators and scientists
working in both the private and public sectors:

wide-ranging impact for neurobiology, interdisciplinary research training,
neuroscience techniques, robotics, and the design of assistive devices.
