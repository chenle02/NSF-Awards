A new field of study has emerged very recently linking biology and politics.
Scholars are investigating the ways in which human DNA affects the workings of
the brain, and how the brain then affects political attitudes and behaviors.
They are also analyzing and evaluating the ethical, legal, and social
implications arising from the knowledge being generated by this research.

This project will establish a one-week program on biology and politics. Graduate
students and junior faculty will be invited to the program to receive training
in this developing area of scholarship. Natural science and social science
enrollees will work side-by-side under the direction of faculty experts who have
made responsible for making the biology and politics connection a reality. Armed
with these multidisciplinary skills, they will return to their home campuses and
establish their own teaching initiatives and enhance the flow of research
productivity.

The broader impacts of this project will include providing graduate students and
junior faculty with a unique opportunity to gain training in a cutting edge area
of research. In addition, the training institute will serve as a foundation for
organizing a graduate curriculum focusing on the new biology and politics
linkage.
