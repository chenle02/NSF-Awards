Lin This work continues research into the collision of electrons with excited
metastable atoms such as He. Measurements of total cross sections from these
difficult to produce beams are used to elucidate the differences in collisions
between atoms in their ground and excited states. New techniques will be
developed to increase beam densities and to detect radiation from the various
sublevels excited by the impacting electrons. The cross sections which are to be
measured are needed for numerous applications to discharges, lasers and plasma
processing of materials.
