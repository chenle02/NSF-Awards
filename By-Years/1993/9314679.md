Lonsdale 9314679 A pair of marine geophysical surveys, on each margin of the
Pacific-Antarctic East Pacific Rise, will establish how this rise lengthened by
2500 km during the Cenozoic, and how it produced major offsets which define the
large-scale segmentation of the present spreading center. Existing data indicate
that growth of the rise was by creation and capture of risecrest microplates,
rifting of old oceanic lithosphere, and migration of triple junctions, so the
project will include investigation of these processes. Principal survey tools
will be a multibeam sonar, magnetometer, and single channel seismic profiler.
