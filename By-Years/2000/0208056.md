This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY2002.
The goal of the fellowship is to prepare minority scientists for positions of
scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the
fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training of the highest
quality to recent doctoral recipients. This program is an effort by the NSF to
increase the number of research scientists from underrepresented minority
groups, thereby contributing to the future vitality of the Nation's scientific
enterprise. It is expected that Fellows trained through these fellowships will
play important roles in training of the future workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Influence of
Nutritional Cues on Reproduction in Nomadic Songbirds." The objectives of this
project are to investigate the influence of nutritional cues on the
neuroendocrine regulation of reproductive development in two closely related
nomadic songbirds (pine siskin and lesser goldfinch) that depend heavily upon
foods that vary widely in availability between years and across broad geographic
ranges.
