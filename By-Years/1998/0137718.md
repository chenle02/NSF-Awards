This award supports a major revision of the Core Plus Mathematics Project (CPMP;
marketed as Contemporary Mathematics in Context) student materials for high
school mathematics, the development of more informative teacher materials, and
the development of materials for parents and other community stakeholders in
mathematics education. The revision of student and teacher materials will be
based on studies of student achievement conducted over eight years; a large
collection of suggestions from teachers who have used the materials in their
classrooms; results from expert panels, including the U.S. Department of
Education, the American Association for the Advancement of Science;
recommendations in the Principals and Standards for School Mathematics and a
special review by university mathematicians sponsored by the developers. The
development is done by a team that includes teachers, mathematics education
specialists, mathematicians and statisticians. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
