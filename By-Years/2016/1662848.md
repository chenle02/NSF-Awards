Decision-makers across a wide range of sectors and industries must schedule
complex activities so as to balance and coordinate competing demands on
resources while achieving maximum efficiency of operations. Problems where the
timing of activities plays a critical role are pervasive. Such problems arise in
diverse applications, such as scheduling surgical facilities, electric power
generation, design and operation of military air- and sea-lift networks for
national defense, and in same-day and next-hour delivery of online orders. This
project addresses fundamental research leading to computational methods to solve
challenging optimization problems that underly these operations. Improved design
and operation of these systems is expected to result in significant
socioeconomic benefits. The research findings will be incorporated into existing
undergraduate and graduate courses in optimization, logistics, and supply chain
management.

This project will advance the fundamental understanding of time dependent
integer programming (IP) problems. By developing dynamic discretization methods
that can discover exactly which times are needed to obtain an optimal solution,
in an efficient way, the resulting IPs become computationally tractable. The
research will involve a priori partial discretization approaches, which divide
the planning horizon into time intervals, and base model variables for placement
of activities in these intervals. The methods will embed three key components:
(i) extended, discrete time, IP models, based on a partial discretization of
time, i.e., using only a subset of the possible time points, whose solution
yields a dual bound on the value of the original problem; (ii) a "repair"
mechanism for the solution to the dual bound IP, or a different extended IP
model based on the partial discretization, to obtain feasible solutions to the
original problem; and (iii) a refinement technique, that identifies time points
to add to the partial discretization, so as to improve the dual bound.
Theoretical bounds and quantifiable approximation errors in terms of
discretization granularity will be studied.
