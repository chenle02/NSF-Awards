This action funds Morgan Levy of the University of California, Berkeley to
conduct a research project entitled "Reconstructing Historical Agricultural
Water Use from Crop Records to Observe Changes in Agricultural Water Use
Efficiency and Productivity" during the summer of 2012 at the Fenner School of
Environment and Society at the Australian National University (ANU) in Canberra,
Australia. The host scientists are Dr. Karen Hussey (Chair, ANU Water
Initiative) and Professor Stephen Dovers (Director, Fenner School of Environment
and Society).

This research responds to well-documented gaps in knowledge about historical
trends in agricultural water use efficiency and productivity. The research aims
to provide important, missing historical water use information based on
empirical analyses, rather than upon generalized models. The aim of this
research is to better inform sustainability-focused policy and management
efforts targeting agricultural water use.

This research improves the understanding of technology and policy impacts on
agricultural water use efficiency and productivity in water-scarce environments.
It uses methods from hydrology, environmental systems science, and statistics to
develop agricultural water use estimation methods, as well as policy-relevant
data analysis to aid in the assessment of regional-scale water management
decisions in developed and developing countries alike.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
