This STEP Type 2 project is a three-year study that is examining the
matriculation, persistence, and degree attainment of full-time, first-time
enrolled women, minorities, and low-income undergraduate students in STEM
(science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) fields at a consortium of 11
large research universities. This project is using statistical and qualitative
research methods to identify key individual and institutional factors that
affect underrepresented students matriculation, persistence, and degree
completion in the STEM fields. It is evaluating the impact of course offerings,
policies and practices, and program interventions designed to increase
educational outcomes. This study is contributing to understanding by using large
samples of underrepresented students and placing them into meaningful categories
(by racial/ethnic sub-group, academic preparation, and STEM major), as well as
the intersection with critical demographic characteristics, such as
socioeconomic status.

The findings from the study are intended to increase understanding about how
postsecondary institutions can use mechanisms and program interventions to
improve the persistence and degree attainment of underrepresented students in
the STEM fields. The study will benefit the academic community by creating a
graduate-level course to be offered to students enrolled at any CIC institution
to discuss the empirical, methodological, policy, and program issues that impact
the representation of women and minorities in the STEM fields, with specific
attention to students attending large, research universities.
