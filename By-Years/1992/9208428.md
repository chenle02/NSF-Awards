Polymer surface coatings strongly affect colloid stability in a broad spectrum
of important engineering processes. Polymers are used as flocculants or
stabilizers in water and waste treatment, mineral processing, coal-water slurry
stabilization, paint production, food colloid stabilization, separation of
bacterial suspensions, paper making, brewing, ceramics fabrication,
pharmaceutical preparation, and agrochemical formulation. The stability,
mobility, and chemical reactively of colloidal particles naturally present in
groundwater and other aquatic systems are strongly controlled by surface
coatings of organic molecules. Since these particles influence the transport of
chemical or radioactive contaminants and the survival of pathogenic
microorganisms, the presence of organic-coated colloids must be accounted for in
models that predict the fate of hazardous wastes in the environment. This
research seeks to clarify the mechanisms by which surface-adsorbed polymers
influences colloid stability in aqueous systems. Theoretical and experimental
studies indicates that the stability of coated colloidal particles depends
critically on the conformation of the adsorbing molecule. Despite the implied
importance of polymer conformation on colloid stability, there are no
experimental techniques which directly measure the conformation of adsorbed
polymers. A major goal of this research is to develop a method for examining the
conformation of single-stranded DNA molecules adsorbed to colloidal latex
particles using a technology called "DNA footprinting". This technology,
originally developed by biochemists to investigate protein/DNA interactions,
will be used to ascertain the fraction of adsorbed DNA that is distributed
between trains, loops and tails. The response of this distribution to changes in
surface and solution chemistry will be investigated and related to concomitant
changes in colloid stability.
