This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). The proposal seeks funding to determine a complete set of
cosmic ray response functions for the ice Cherenkov detector used by the surface
air shower IceTop array that is part of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory at the
South Pole. This would be accomplished by means of a global latitude survey
conducted with a detector (identical to the IceTop sensors) built in a freezer
van, which will be installed on the Swedish icebreaker Oden. The cosmic rays
shower data will be recorded on the Oden voyage from Sweden to McMurdo and
return during the 2009-2010 austral summer season. The potential use of Oden for
scientific research has been announced in the NSF Antarctic Science solicitation
NSF 08-535. Continued reliance on students provides a broader impact to this
proposed research and firmly grounds this effort in its educational mission.
