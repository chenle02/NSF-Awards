ABSTRACT EEC-9705688 Hocken Manufacturing is the prime component of the economy
for all leading nations. Precision metrology is the ingredient that makes
advanced manufacturing possible. Precision metrology research is required to
keep the United States among the leaders in productivity. This planning award is
funding an industry/university planning meeting to determine the feasibility and
viability of an Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Precision
Metrology at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. The research
projects proposed for consideration by the meeting are Vector Touch Sensor,
Coordinate Metrology Using surface normals, Computational metrology for datum
features, A white light interferometer for absolute thickness and distance
measurements, High-pressure phase transformation of ceramics, Characterization
of hybrid coordinate measuring machines, Scanning coordinate measuring machines,
Real-time error correction for machine tools, High-speed machine tool checking,
Measurement of cylindrical parts.
