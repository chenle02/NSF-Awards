This SGER project aims to prepare and derivatize rigid carbon clusters known as
"Fullerenes." These new compounds will be hollow molecular spheres consisting of
pi-conjugated carbon atoms attached to various functional groups and a large
variety of elements to yield novel molecular solids. Due to the high symmetry,
electronic character and structural design of these clusters, it is expected
that these molecular solid state materials will exhibit unprecedented condensed
matter properties.
