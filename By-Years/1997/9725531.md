9725531 Berger Quantitative measurements of thermoluminescence (TL) of minerals
in unheated sediments provide a dating technique useful in a variety of
applications in paleoclimate, paleoseismic, volcano, and stratigraphic research.
The TL method is especially useful for age-dating extending to ages beyond the
practical application of the radiocarbon technique (ca. 40 to 50 thousand
years). This award provides fifty percent of the funds required to purchase
instrumentation for the upgrade of a TL dating laboratory at the Desert Research
Institute of the University of Nevada. The institution is committed to providing
the remaining funds necessary for the purchase of the equipment. ***
