This award provides partial support for a three month research visit by Dr. Wick
Haxton of the University of Washington to Australia in order to collaborate with
Dr. Bruce H. J. McKellar of Melbourne University. This visit is in exchange for
the visit in early 1992 by Prof. McKellar to the University of Washington. Both
investigators are acknowledged experts in weak interaction phenomenon, and this
visit will extend the collaborative research on several topics in weak
interactions. The investigators intend to collaborate on the theory of atomic
electric dipole moments with the goal of defining the relationship between
measurements and the parameters of the underlying CP (charge/parity) violating
Lagrangian. They also intend to consider current treatments of the parity-
nonconserving NN (neutron/neutron) interaction in view of recent chiral
Lagrangian arguments that S-quark components in the nucleon lead to new
interactions, including important three-body nuclear terms.
