0136019&lt;br/&gt;Kirk&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A steering committee formed under
the auspices of the Board on Agriculture and Natural Resources and the Board on
Life Sciences will help to plan and host a workshop focusing on domestic animal
genomics and its integration with other genomics and functional genomics
projects. The diverse group of experts who participated in the sequencing of the
human, mouse, C. elegans, Drosophila, Arabidopsis, rice, E. coli, and other
genomes will be brought together with others involved in genomics mapping and
sequencing for important livestock and companion animals and their pathogens.
These experts, along with appropriate policy makers and stakeholders, will
participate in a one-day meeting designed to 1) provide a forum for exchange
among the diverse communities of genomics and functional genomics experts, 2)
elicit discussions of research directions in animal genomics that would benefit
agriculture and society while leading to greater biological understanding, and
3) identify opportunities and obstacles that might be encountered in developing
a coordinated, multi-organism functional and comparative genomics effort that
would include domestic animals.&lt;br/&gt;
