Serious problems may arise when uncontrolled vibrations occur in machine
systems, causing component and system wear and ultimate failure, as well as
noise problems. This research envisions a method of reducing the vibrations and
the problems associated with them. It is a combined theoretical and experimental
project dealing with the measurement of damping resulting from thin fluid layers
trapped between either stationary plates or objects in relative motion.
Preliminary work in this area suggests that this method of damping may be very
effective at low frequencies where conventional treatments fail. The work is
fundamental in nature but potentially applicable to the effective design of
lightweight, low-frequency damping treatments.
