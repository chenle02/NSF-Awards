This project explores through several inter-related activities the uses and
abuses of anonymous communications on the internet. The benefits and drawbacks
of anonymous computer communication are just now beginning to be examined, an
examination rendered more difficult by the fact that the value of anonymous
communication in a non-networked environment is itself a matter of debate.
Nevertheless, a growing number of computer and network professionals, lawyers,
social scientists, and ethicists agree that anonymity is an important issue that
needs to be addressed from a variety of perspectives. Building on an earlier
project focusing on the ethical, legal, and technological aspects of computer
and network use and abuse, the American Association for the Advancement of
Science (AAAS) plans to develop 1)criteria setting forth contexts in which
anonymous communications are desirable (to be encouraged), permissible (to be
tolerated), or undesirable (to be discouraged), and 2) preliminary guidelines
for those situations where anonymity is to be either encouraged or tolerated.
AAA will conduct several interrelated activities: 1) background information and
guidance will be provided through commissioned papers on such topics as the
individual and social uses and ramifications of anonymous communications, legal
issues regarding anonymity, and the current and anticipated technical
capabilities pertinent to anonymity on the net; 2) development of case studies
based on individual experiences with anonymity; 3) convening of focus groups to
frame issues for a two-day conference at which invited individuals from a
variety of professional backgrounds and perspectives will discuss criteria and
guidelines that can form the basis for normative and legal standards regarding
anonymity. Results will be disseminated in a number of forms, including the
World Wide Web page.
