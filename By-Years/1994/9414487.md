9414487 Fourer This research focuses on the identification and investigation of
difficult conceptual issues that must be resolved in designing languages,
interfaces, and algorithms for a broad classes of combinatorial optimization
problems. The research aims to identify strategies for transferring discrete
optimization technology to a broad range of users and to design general-purpose
languages and environment that support application development in discrete
optimization. The foundation of the research is provided by two system design
elements, the algebraic modeling language and the algebraic toolkit, that have
been used in the development of software in statistics and continuous
optimization problems. This work will jointly consider the issue of
representation and algorithms in developing the general-purpose software for
combinatorial optimization. The research will have direct practical value to
engineering education and the American industry. American industries engage
daily in resolving problems that are combinatorial in nature. The outcome of
this research will facilitate the ease of use of explicit models and powerful
optimization technologies to resolve these problems. Industry will also benefit
from the quality solution that can be obtained from the use of optimization
models as against heuristic algorithms. From the engineering education view
point, development of a general-purpose modeling software will play a key role
in the teaching of large-scale optimization. This will allow student to
formulate, solve, and analyze realistically large and complex models instead of
dealing with textbook type problems that are generally small and contrived.
