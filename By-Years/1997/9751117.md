The focus of this project includes building an observatory to serve two new
courses in astronomy and planetary science; enhancing post-secondary science
education for all students by bringing an astronomy component to the basic
sciences curriculum; increasing awareness of the different fields of science to
students majoring in the Associate of Science degree; and providing a resource
for training the laboratory skills in planetary and astronomy science to area
teachers in the elementary, middle, and high schools. The department is building
an observatory with remote access capability to area schools. This upgrade is
being done through a 16 inch Meade Schmidt-Cassagrain telescope in conjunction
with a 416 CCD Autoguider/Imager. The system is connected through a computer to
a network of computers in the area. Four 16 inch Dobsonian telescopes are being
used for experiencing the original incoming photon from an astronomical object
and enhancing the hands-on observation techniques for the students. This project
is introducing astronomy to a remote area of the country, with a high
concentration of many minority populations, and taking advantage of the clear
skies of northern New Mexico.
