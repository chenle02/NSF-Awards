Professor Feldman will continue his research in ergodic theory with the
following areas singled out for attention: (i) the extension of some of the
ideas of equivalence of systems from the situation where the group which is
acting is the integers or the reals to the case where the group is only assumed
to be amenable, (ii) geodesic flows on smooth manifolds, and (iii) subrelations
of ergodic equivalence relations. Research in ergodic theory involves trying to
understand the average behavior of systems whose dynamics is too complicated or
chaotic to be followed in microscopic detail. Under the heading "dynamics" can
be placed the modern theory of how groups of abstract transformations act on
smooth spaces. Another important theme in ergodic theory is the classification
of systems into broad categories which are mathematically identical in an
abstract sense. Professor Feldman's research will make contact with these areas.
