The CVD deposition process will be studied with the goal of controlling and
limiting the growth of columnar grains and promoting the growth of fine,
equiaxed grains with improved tribological properties. The process development
will be based on equilibrium and other thermodynamic calculations, followed by
experimental deposition studies and tribological testing. Initial work will
concentrate on tungsten carbide films.
