Short term load forecasting is an important and complex task requiring in-depth
understanding of the technique and the system. Many statistical and expert
system based techniques produce fairly accurate forecast. However, most
statistical techniques are computationally burdensome as these methods need
updating with changing conditions. Expert systems are more adaptable to changing
conditions, but it is not always easy to express the available expertise
(knowledge) in clear quantitative terms, often leading to inconsistent rules.
The objective of this research is to develop a new load forecasting technique
which combines the capabilities of both the expert systems approach and the
statistical techniques, but avoids their drawbacks. Expert systems approach is
adopted to utilize the available body of knowledge to form a subset of
historical data which are most pertinent to the forecast point. The priority
vector method, explained in the proposal, is applied to quantitatively express
any qualitative factors involved in the process. This approach is fundamentally
different from the others, because we create subsets of historical data
according to the conditions at the forecast point, instead of the traditional
approach of analyzing the whole historical data set. Further, the updating
function becomes automatic in our technique since the subset of data is
continually reconstructed and the relationships redetermined to match each
forecast point. The development of the technique in its simplest form is
outlined and the application is demonstrated in weekly load forecast. We have
identified and briefly discussed the areas which need further work to make the
model sophisticated for better performance, and to extend it to perform interval
forecasting.
