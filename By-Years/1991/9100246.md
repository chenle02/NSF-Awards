Low molecular weight hydrocarbons, labeled with deuterium, will be synthesized
and isomerized in order to determine the intimate details of the mechanisms of
the isomerization reactions. Stereochemical and kinetic data will be used to
assess the course of these isomerizations. One- and two-centered stereomutation
processes of cyclopropane will be studied with deuterium labeled chiral
trans-1,2-diethynylcyclopropane. The stereochemistry of the isomerization
pathways of allene, cyclopropene, spiropentane, vinylcyclopropane, and bicyclo
Ä±3.1.1! hept-2-ene will be studied with the appropriately deuterium labeled and
chiral molecules. Also, the four possible stereochemical pathways available for
the vinylcyclopropane to cyclopentene thermal isomerization will be quantified.
These molecules are sufficiently small that high level molecular orbital
calculations can be used in conjunction with the experimental results for a
better understanding of these processes. New experimental techniques,
vibrational circular dichroism and tunable diode laser spectroscopy, will be
brought to bear on these problems. This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program
supports the continuing research of Professor Baldwin at the University of
Syracuse. This research will study the details of the reorganization
(isomerization) of atoms in small molecules that contain only carbon, hydrogen,
and deuterium. The results of these studies can be compared to high level
theoretical calculations in order to gain further insight about these reactions.
