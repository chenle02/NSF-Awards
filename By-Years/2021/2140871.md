The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation â€“
Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project is to enable the improve the performance
of communications within data centers. Data traffic in data centers has tripled
since 2016 and will continue to grow. Data centers are central to our
interconnected way of life and have become critical as remote meetings and
online interactions become commonplace. The proposed technology is a device
capable of managing these higher volumes of activity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
proposed project will significantly reduce the cost of attaching arrays of
fibers and specialty fibers to silicon photonic transceiver devices. Silicon
photonic devices offer unparalleled performance and low cost by leveraging the
CMOS electronics manufacturing infrastructure; however, up to 80% of the cost of
a photonic device is in the packaging, and the main cost driver is permanently
attaching optical fibers to the silicon photonic chip. The proposed project will
develop the novel technology developed to permanently attach a fiber to a
photonic chip using fusion splicing to address the needs of optical transceivers
for datacenters. The proposed project will develop the process of fusing (i)
arrays of up to twelve fibers, (ii) polarization maintaining fibers, and (iii)
high numerical aperture fibers to enable next generation, high bandwidth optical
transceivers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
