ABSTRACT: 9526358, Rochester Institute of Technology, "GOALI: Modulation Codes
for Multiamplitude Recording Channels", PI-McLaughlin: This research is in the
area of high density high data rate optical recording. The optical recording
technology receiving the most attention is magneto-optics. While magnetic-optic
drives are among the highest performing in both storage capacity and data
transfer rate, their performance is limited. In particular no commercially
available high data rate (&gt;40 Mbits/sec) digital recording system using a
single head magneto-optic (or magnetic or optical) disk exists. An optical
recording technology known as electron trapping optical memory (ETOM) developed
by Optex will be capable of providing single head data transfer rates in excess
of 100 Mbits/sec. The ETOM material allows one to store multiple signal
amplitudes on the media as opposed to conventional saturation magnetic or
optical recording. This project is a joint Optex and RIT project in the
development of modulation codes for the multiple amplitude recording channel.
The codes considered include both runlength limited and partial response
techniques. The principal investigator will spend time at Optex.&lt;br/&gt;*****
