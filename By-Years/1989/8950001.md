The inadequate exposure of undergraduates to laser physics in the U&gt;S&gt;
stems in large part from insufficient experience and expertise within
undergraduate faculties. By capitalizing upon an existing pilot program that
focusses upon the introduction of laser physics and modern optics in
undergraduate programs nationwide, the Department of Physics is offering a pair
of intensive, NSF-sponsored workshops that will help undergraduate faculty
develop the necessary background to incorporate laser topics into their own
curricula. Twenty faculty members from across the U. S. are spending five days
at these workshops in order to become acquainted with both the subject and
practice of laser physics. Participants in this project are becoming familiar
with eight different types of laser skystems and a gradation of laser
experiments that demonstrate basic principles and serve as powerful vehicles for
undergraduate instruction. The workshops are emphasizing experimental aspects of
laser physics and hands-on exposure of the participants to a large assortment of
laser hardware. Lectures and discussions are dealing with practical matter such
as choices of equipment, space requirements, costs, sources of supply, safety
considerations, and support services. Near the end of the workshop, attendees
and the staff will scrutinize the specific, individualized plans developed by
participants to incorporate laser material and experiments into their respective
curricula. The universities whose faculty participate will provide partial
support for this program.
