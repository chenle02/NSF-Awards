In this research project supported jointly by the Analytical and Surface
Chemistry Program and the Atmospheric Chemistry Program, Professor Roberts and
his coworkers will carry out basic studies of the chemistry of ice and solid
acid hydrate multilayers. The effects of ice surface structure on the catalyis
of reactions of importance in stratospheric chemistry will be examined. In
addition, the adsorption and reaction of small molecules on solid sulfuric acid
and sulfuric acid water solid solutions will be explored. The mechanism of the
heterogeneous nucleation and growth of ice and acid hydrate layers will also be
investigated. Ultra high vacuum electron spectroscopic probes as well as
reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy will be applied to these studies.
The information obtained in this research will be useful for developing an
understanding of the stratospheric chemistry which governs catalytic ozone
destruction, and will provide a basic understanding of the surface chemistry of
important molecular solids. The chemistry of small molecules of atmospheric
importance on the surface of ice and solid acid hydrates forms the focus of this
research project. Adsorption and reaction of molecules such as HCl, HOCl, and
HNO3 on ice and solid sulfuric acid surfaces will be examined using electron
spectroscopy and reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy. The information
obtained from these studies will be important in developing an understanding of
the chemistry leading to ozone depletion in the stratosphere, and in our basic
knowledge of infrequently studied molecular solids such as ice and sulfuric
acid.
