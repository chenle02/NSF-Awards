9727762 Bennett This study examines how the pulmonary and cardiovascular systems
respond to increased metabolic demands for increased oxygen delivery and carbon
dioxide removal in very different tissues: the skeletal musculature and the
intestine. Is the pattern of increased ventilation and circulation stereotyped,
such that the same response (heart rate, stroke volume, breathing frequency, and
tidal volume) is used for equal energetic demands in the two different tissues,
or is it plastic, dependent on which tissue is active? If both tissues are
active simultaneously, which receives priority allocation for oxygen delivery
and carbon dioxide removal? Large reptiles will be used as model systems to
investigate these patterns, because metabolic increments associated with
digestion are extraordinarily large in these animals, approaching those
associated with physical activity.
