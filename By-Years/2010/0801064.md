This project deals with algebraic dynamical systems and their applications to
number theory. It has been observed for a long time that many problems
concerning diophantine approximation an be cast in terms of the behavior of
orbits of a suitable homogeneous flow. In particular, various phenomena related
to the theory of integer equations or inequalities can be in a useful way
interpreted as certain trajectories being generic with respect to some natural
measures on homogeneous spaces, while other call for constructing trajectories
with exceptional behavior. The principal investigator plans to continue his
study of those orbits, aiming at new applications to number theory. Dynamical
tools to be used are: measure rigidity, ergodic theorems, mixing and
equidistribution, reduction theory, and quantitative
nondivergence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A dynamical system here stands
for an abstract set of points together with an evolution law which governs the
way points move over time. It turns out that many problems concerning
simultaneous approximation of real numbers by rational numbers can be understood
in terms of the behavior of certain orbits. Furthermore, systems that arise in
this context are of algebraic nature, which makes it possible to use a wide
variety f sophisticated tools for their investigation.
