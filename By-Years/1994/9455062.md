"Enhancement of Faculty Design Capabilities" is a two-week workshop offered
during the summer at Southern Methodist University. The workshop is offered for
all engineering disciplines and faculty that intend to or are presently teaching
design in engineering courses to undergraduate students. The workshop strives to
address needs of faculty from two-year and four-year institutions who teach non-
design, or engineering science, courses and desire to include design into the
course work. The workshop addresses topics in design methodologies, design
content, design constraints, design tools, and teaching design through a multi-
faceted format using lectures, laboratory sessions, discussion sessions, work
sessions and industrial tours. Participants will be expected to develop a design
plan, design problems, design projects, and design case studies. Workshop
participants will work individually, in single-discipline teams, and in multi-
discipline teams to design materials for use incorporation into courses at their
home institution. Faculty leaving this workshop will have a design plan, design
materials for courses, a plan of implementation at the home institution, and a
network of design faculty with whom to interact. This workshop will guide
faculty to a different way of thinking, a freshened approach to processes and
procedures of design synthesis as opposed to highly analytical skills generally
emphasized in research activities and engineering science courses.
