A new type of integration, called motivic integration, has been proposed by M.
Konsevitch and developed by Denef and Loeser. They show that many of the
classical properties of p-adic integration can be extended to to the motivic
context. The research of this proposal will adapt motivic integration to the
representation theory and the harmonic analysis of reductive groups over fields
of formal Laurent series in characteristic zero. This new theory will be
developed from first principles, starting with the existence of motivic Haar
measures.

The starting point of much of modern mathematics is the theory of integration,
as developed by Isaac Newton, and generations of mathematicians that have
followed him. An unexpected development came in 1995, when the mathematician M.
Kontsevich developed an entirely new way to integrate. This new tool will allow
mathematicians to significantly enlarge the scope of mathematics. The research
of this grant will accomplish part of this project, by using this new tool to
enlarge the scope of representation theory, a branch of modern algebra.
