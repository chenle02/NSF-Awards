This research will focus on the study of the dynamics of manifolds. Interest in
this topic stems principally from Thurston's work on the classification of
diffeomorphisms of surfaces. The questions to be addressed concern invariant
sets of automorphisms of torii, flows on surfaces of negative curvature and
diffeomorphisms of Lorenz manifolds. Albert Fathi will use his knowledge of
pseudo-Anosov flows to construct and investigate compact invariant subsets of
hyperbolic toral maps. In particular he will investigate estimates for the
Hausdorff dimension of these sets. Fathi will also continue his investigations
of the connections between the intersection of geodesic currents and metric
entropy. The final part of the project involves the study of Anosov
diffeomorphisms of Lorenz manifolds. The objective here is to try to extend
established results about flows on Riemannian manifolds of negative curvature to
time-like geodesic flow on certain Lorenz manifolds. Special attention will be
devoted to those manifolds of importance in general relativity.
