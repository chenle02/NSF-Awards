The study of female criminality is still in its infancy. There is much that
remains to be understood and explained about women's crime. There is some
literature on contemporary women criminals. Historical accounts, sensitive to
the social construction of crime, however, are almost nonexistent. Yet, such
study is essential to comprehending fully gender and social control. This
research uses the courts in Paris during the 19th century as an arena for
examining the interactions and assumptions regarding female crime. Through
systematic analysis of court dossiers, monograph and journal literature, and
official reports and statistics, the meaning of female criminality will be
traced and compared to male criminality. The investigation will include an
analysis of why particular discourses about the female criminal emerged, who the
contenders were who sought to attribute meaning to female deviancy, how changes
in institutions and practices affected female offenders, and how activity
related to the female criminal served broader efforts to stabilize gender and
class relations. Several theoretical perspectives are woven together: changes in
standards of criminal responsibility; the role of the expert in defining norms;
narrative representations of crime; the meaning of patterns of conviction and
acquittal; and the role of the courts in articulating "the woman question." This
study should reveal the ways in which penal practices and procedures mediated
and reflected larger processes of social and political redefinition. In
addition, the research promises to break new ground, theoretically and
methodologically, by drawing on recent theoretical advances across several
disciplines to examine an important but rarely studied topic. Finally, this work
can have a major impact on the way social scientists define and study
criminality by providing a model in which gender is no longer absent or
peripheral to the analysis.
