9731494 Person This project involves the development of a new mathematical model
capable of representing the circulation of sea water through mid-ocean ridge
systems near shallow magma chambers. A unique feature of this model is its
ability to represent seawater boiling and halite precipitation at high
temperatures. This model will be used to study the chemical and isotopic
evolution of a well studied mid-ocean ridge vent system at 9-10 N along the East
Pacific Rise. This vent system was discovered and sampled shortly after the
emplacement of a shallow magma body; its composition and temperature have
changed dramatically over the past few years due to seawater boiling.
