With National Science Foundation support, Johnson C Smith University will
establish a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) Learning
Community to produce STEM undergraduates well able to use problem-based
learning, interdisciplinary inquiry, in-depth analysis, technology, and critique
for reflection and change. The STEM Learning Community will include a freshman
STEM experience, second year STEM problem-based learning activities, field-
specific upper level college courses and research experiences, and continuous
faculty/student research opportunities and career and graduate school
advisement. This model will serve as a national competency-, performance-based
curriculum to produce capable STEM graduates who will successfully pursue
graduate study or enter the STEM work force.

The intellectual merit of this project lies in the proposed STEM infrastructure
enhancements and their potential to result in significant and sustainable
improvements in the overall quality of STEM instruction at the institution.

The impact of the proposed efforts is to broaden the participation of under-
represented minorities in STEM disciplines and the national STEM workforce and
provide a model for enhanced undergraduate STEM learning.
