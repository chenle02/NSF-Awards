9361595 Groat Polymeric materials are used extensively in a multitude of
applications due to a unique balance of cost and structural properties. However,
where thermal applications are concerned, the utilization of polymeric materials
is extremely limited due to poor thermal transfer. Structural polymers typically
exhibit thermal conductives orders magnitude lower than most metals and
ceramics. particulate fillers have been utilized with only marginal improvements
due the isolated arrangement of the filler particles. ART proposed a research
program which will create research quantities of shaped AlN particles, and test
the relative improvement in thermal conductivity of a polymeric matrix. This
information will be incorporated into the existing models of filled matrices
which will be modified to include particle shape.
