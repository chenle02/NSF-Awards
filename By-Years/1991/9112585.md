The proposed research will explore the application of newly available
morphometric methods to phylogenetically significant complex characters in
plants. These methods rely both on landmark and outline data used in, for
instance, thin plate spline, resistant fit, and eigenshape analyses, as well as
on the fractal geometry of strange attractors. The characters examined as models
are seed shape and testa patterns in Orchidaceae. These characters appear to
have systematic significance, but quantification is essential to objective
analysis. The characters have the potential to resolve difficult phylogenetic
questions, as do similar characters in many botanical taxa, but without a
quantitative methodology allowing them to be utilized consistently, their
potential remains unrealized. New techniques will be evaluated in the context of
more traditional characters already available as part of ongoing studies.
