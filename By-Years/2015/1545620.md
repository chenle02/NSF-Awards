While there is broad agreement that indigent defense counsel is vital to the
proper functioning of the criminal justice system, there is relatively little
understanding of the effect resources have on the process of providing defense
and on criminal justice system outcomes. This project will take advantage of a
financial crisis in Louisiana to better understand the production function of
indigent defense systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From January 2015 through June
2016 the public defender systems in 25 of Louisiana's 42 judicial districts are
expected to fall into insolvency on a rolling basis, and will balance their
budgets by restricting services delivered to indigent defendants in juvenile and
criminal cases. There will be substantial variation across districts in the
extent, timing, and specific indigent defense service restrictions imposed. This
project will quantitatively assess the impact of these restrictions on both
defense effort and case outcomes in three of the larger districts. Interviews
from key judicial stakeholders will be done to provide a deeper understanding of
the quantitative results, as well as to assess the impacts of restrictions in
districts too small to analyze quantitatively.
