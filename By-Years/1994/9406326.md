The diversity of neuronal cell types in vertebrates derives from regional
differences along the anterior-posterior (A/P) as well as the dorsal-ventral
(D/V) axes of the developing nervous system. Previous work has shown that A/P
properties are extremely labile during the initial phases of regionalization. In
order to investigate the corresponding stages of neural regionalization along
the D/V axis, this investigator initiated a series of experiments examining the
early phases of D/V neural patterning using the amphibian Xenopus as a model
system. Preliminary data suggest a model in which D/V pattern in the prospective
spinal cord region is fixed at relatively early stages in contrast to the
anterior brain region in which D/V pattern remains labile for a prolonged period
of time. Using tissue manipulations in conjunction with molecular approaches,
this proposal will test and extend this model by systematically examining the
tissue interactions governing the early stages of D/V neural patterning. These
experiments will not only provide a framework for linking gene expression with
biological processes mediating D/V patterning events but will also contribute to
an understanding of the unique properties of embryonic neuronal tissue,
particularly its enormous plasticity.
