The repressor of the E.coli bacteriophage 434 is similiar in overall structure
to lambda repressor and, like lambda repressor, it binds cooperatively to
adjacent operator sites on DNA. Unlike lambda repressor, however, 434 repressor
does not bind cooperatively to separated sites on DNA as assayed in vitro. The
objective of this proposal is to investigate the basis of this difference in an
array of experiments. Genetically engineered 434-lambda repressor hybrids will
be generated and studied in order to determine the basis of the observed
differences in the abilities of 434 and lambda repressor to bind cooperatively
to nonadjacent operator sites. A system for studying cooperatively "at a
distance" in vivo using 434 operators will be established. This system will be
used to detect and investigate hybrid and mutant repressors. Efforts will be
made to ascertain whether specific "DNA-bending" sequences in the OL region of
the phage allow 434 repressor to bind cooperatively to nonadjacent sites. These
studies should provide new insight into those aspects of protein structure
necessary for interaction of DNA-bound regulatory proteins "at a distance".
