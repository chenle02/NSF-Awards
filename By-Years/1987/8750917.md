A laser doppler velocimeter will be installed in the thermo-fluids laboratory.
This will enable the students to make non-invasive measurements of fluid flow in
generalized test sections. Students from the fields of mechanical, electrical,
civil and chemical engineering will be able to perform open ended experiments of
varying degrees of complexity. Typical experiments planned are measurement of
boundary layer velocity profiles in drag reduction, measurement of fluid
velocities in radial and sonic flow, and measurement of velocities in a pump
turbine test stand.
