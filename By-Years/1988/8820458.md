The objective of this research is to gain a better understanding of the
molecular mechanisms at work in regulating bacterial gene expression in the
absence of growth. Specifically, we will study gene expression in Escherichia
coli during stationary phase by initially focussing our attention on
transcriptional promoter known to be induced by the cessation of growth. We
intend to isolate promoter mutations which affect this novel form of regulation,
as well as mutations in other genes involved in this process. These genetic
studies will be complemented by a biochemical analysis of the factors required
for transcription from this promoter. Finally, using the results from these
lines of experimentation, we will attempt to identify and characterize other
bacterial genes whose expression in maximal during stationary phase.
