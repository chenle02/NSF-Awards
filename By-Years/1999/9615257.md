9615257 Brearley This grant provides $90,000 as partial support of the costs of
acquiring a new, state-of-the-art scanning electron microscope (SEM) with a high
resolution backscattered electron detector, an ultrathin window for light
element energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) analysis, a computer controlled
stage for X-ray mapping and a digital image processing system. The new SEM would
benefit a large group of researchers in the Department of Earth Sciences and
Institute of Meteoritics as well as regional users. Additional funds for the
purchase of this instrument will be provided by University matching funds
($70,000) and a funded NASA proposal ($90,000). The new SEM will replace their
current Hitachi S450 SEM (circa 1980) which has a faltering EDS and thus
provides unreliable backscattered electron images and poor quality high-
resolution (x5000) images of geological and planetary materials. The new SEM
will benefit a large number of projects including studies of the mechanisms and
kinetics of phase changes of olivine to beta and gamma-spinel at depth within
the mantle via analysis of the backscattered electron images from SEM scans to
elucidate nucleation rates, identification of clay mineralogy during early
sedimentary diagenesis, X-ray mapping of crustal xenoliths to help unravel the
geochemical evolution of the Proterozoic crust beneath the Colorado Plateau,
characterization of magnetic mineral phases as ancillary to paleomagnetic
studies, SEM mapping of thin sections to select appropriate regions for
subsequent SIMS analysis and analyses of surface textures of subaerial volcanics
and planetary materials etc. etc. The remarkable level of funded research in
this group's portfolio will fully subscribe the new SEM which will also aid SEM
research projects conducted by both graduate and undergraduate students. ***
