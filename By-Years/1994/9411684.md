This proposal is for funds to purchase a digital imaging system in support of
several research programs, including, in particular, the study of the formation
and burning of sprays of liquid fuels. The equipment includes a Nd-Yag pumped
dye laser, a CCD camera and a dedicated computer for data acquisition and
processing.
