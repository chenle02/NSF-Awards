This research will further develop a three-dimensional chronostratigraphic
framework of a carbonate platform, and, secondly, to extract a platform flooding
history (relative sea level curve) from a high energy, windward bank margin. The
extremely successful magnetostratigraphic dating of four 60-m cores from Little
Bahama Bank is beginning to unravel the nature of platform deposition. This
dating technique has renewed interest and understanding of carbonate platform
depositional models and has extended age control beyond the Late Pleistocene and
Holocene. The new Little Bahama Bank chronostratigraphy reveals a considerably
different depositional sequence than proposed from just lithostratigraphy. This
project will complete the remaining cores from the platform and extend downward
the existing reversal stratigraphy to achieve the first three-dimensional
platform history. The second part of this project will consist of dating three
cores from the eastern side of Great Bahama Bank, part of a high-energy/bank
interior facies that preserves a record of platform flooding (regional sea level
curve) events.
