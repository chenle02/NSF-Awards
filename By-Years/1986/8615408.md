The primary objectives of the proposed research are to investigate the behavior
of strip footings located above continuous voids and to develop an analytical
method for foundation stability analysis. It is planned to study different
loading conditions in combination with different void shapes, sizes and
locations. These experiments will be conducted with different types of soils.
Such as kaolinite clay, silty clay, and sandy clay. The behavior of the footings
will also be analyzed by using a finite element method, and the upper bound
limit theorem of plasticity. Based on these results, equations for computing
bearing capacity of strip footing will be developed. The PI is uniquely
qualified to conduct this research which is a combination of experimental and
theoretical study. The outcome of the research will be of major importance to
geotechnical engineering in design of foundation where the ground has natural
cavities. An award is recommended.
