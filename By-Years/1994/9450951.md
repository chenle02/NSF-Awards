9450951 Bopp The project will purchase a Dual Beam Atomic Absorption
Spectrometer for use in a variety of chemistry courses. These include
Quantitative analysis, Ecology, Field Biology, and Advanced laboratory. The
equipment will enhance student skills and experience with this important
instrumental technique, and more students will be able to study a wider range of
chemical phenomena than is possible with existing equipment. This development
will fit curricular goals of the department including: 1. To continually update
lecture material in all courses to reflect advances in the field of chemistry;
2. To strengthen all laboratory courses by providing hands-on experience with
modern instrumentation of the quality and type comparable to that used in
research and industry; 3. To enrich the Chemistry Department program by
providing increased opportunities for students to engage in independent projects
using research quality instrumentation; 4. To acquaint the students with modern
techniques in computational analysis and computer data acquisition methods; 5.
To upgrade existing equipment for purposes of increased efficiency and
versatility in all laboratory courses.
