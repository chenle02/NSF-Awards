9553068 Johnson The research agenda is to develop a new way of solving
bioelectric field problems using computational steering. This involves
integrating the basic scientific formulation of the problem and its mathematical
model with the development of computational paradigms for its solution and with
the engineering of computer implementations that allow interactive design and
visualization of the results.
