Basic research studies to address issues of both fundamental and practical
importance concerning primary physical processes which influence the type,
density and thermal stability of ion implantation induced defect accumulation in
silicon will be conducted. The approach utilizes photo-injection of
electron/hole pairs, coupled with either an intrinsically built-in electric
potential, or a secondary externally controlled vertical or lateral electric
field, during implantation to modulate and control the density, lifetime and
complexing behavior of point defects. %%% This research addresses basic aspects
of silicon processing fundamentally related to advanced device and circuit
fabrication. The innovative research proposed offers possibilities for
significant improvements in devices and integrated circuits used in computing
,information processing, and telecommunications.
