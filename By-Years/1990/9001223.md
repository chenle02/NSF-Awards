This project is concerned with work in algebra, particularly in descent theory
and its applications. This will include work on the structure and cohomology of
affine algebraic group schemes, with emphasis on those arising as automorphisms
of other structures. One area of application will be the structure of
nonclassical simple Lie algebras in positive characteristics. A second
application will be to Galois extensions of commutative rings. A third will be
to the twisted forms of determinants. This research covers a wide range of
topics in algebra. In particular, areas related to affine group schemes and
descent theory will be considered. The results will provide insight into many
areas of algebra.
