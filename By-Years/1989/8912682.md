This research is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of separation science. This research involves the use of mass
spectrometric tracer pulse chromatography (MSTPC) for the determination of phase
distribution isotherms of a variety of relatively simple systems involving only
one or two components and/or phases. Three major objectives are to be achieved
in this research. These include 1) to investigate more complex systems for
analysis by MSTPC, 2) the use of the acquired data for evaluation of current
molecular solution and adsorption theories, and 3) development of a practical
method for surface coverage programming in gas-solid chromatography. An
experimental technique which uses stable isotope tracers in combination with
mass spectrometry and chromatography to investigate molecular interactions has
been developed and applied to a number of chromatographic systems. This
technique will be used in this research to study the phase distribution at
constant temperature for systems containing more than one component. These
studies are designed to provide a better understanding and model for different
chromatographic systems.
