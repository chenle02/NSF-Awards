9707821 Thompson The University of Texas will operate the Research Vessel
LONGHORN during 1997 as a general oceanographic vessel in support of NSF-
sponsored research projects. The R/V LONGHORN is a 103' research vessel
constructed in 1971 and stretched to its present length in 1986. The vessel is
owned and operated by the University of Texas and has a 1997 operating schedule
of 100 days of which 6 are in support of NSF-sponsored programs. The ship will
operate primarily in the Gulf of Mexico. The LONGHORN is part of a fleet of
ships used by the National Science Foundation to support marine research. Most
oceanographic research requires highly specialized equipment and extensive
support from the ship's crew. An increasing number of research projects require
equipment that must be permanently installed on a ship and for which the ship
must be specifically designed. Such equipment also requires highly trained crew
members for maintenance and operation. These vessels do not operate in the same
manner as general cargo or fishing vessels. NSF supports the operation of a
variety of ships specifically dedicated to oceanographic research. These vessels
are operated by universities and institutions around the country.
