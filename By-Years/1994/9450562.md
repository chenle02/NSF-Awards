9450562 De los Santos The Phoenix USI focuses on linkages and communication
among the independent school districts within the city of Phoenix. The
initiative proposes to reform teaching and learning of science, mathematics, and
technology in the Phoenix inner city by creating a "seamless web" of
administrative, and instructional support services. Using the Maricopa
Comprehensive Regional Center for Minorities (CRCM) model of school clusters,
built upon feeder patters, as a basis for addressing communication and
articulation between the initial participating districts and among grade levels.
It is anticipated that this model will assist Phoenix in developing a continuum
of K-12 programs and services designed to prepare all students for success at
the next grade level. Over the five year period of the award, the city will
reform its science and mathematics education delivery system for all students
from elementary school through post-secondary education. A Council of
Superintendents, created to facilitate communication among the participating
independent school districts, elected one member to represent them as Principal
Investigator with overall responsibility for project outcomes.
