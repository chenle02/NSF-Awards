The most troublesome problem in the philosophy of mathematics arises quite
early on and quite simply: if mathematical truths are facts about mathematical
things, and if mathematical things are eternal, unchanging, non-spatiotemporal,
etc., as understood on the common Platonic reading, then how can human beings,
with the usual cognitive faculties, ever come to know any of these truths? Dr.
Maddy has argued in a series of papers over the past decade that an answer can
be found by "naturalizing" mathematical objects, i.e. by taking them to be as
familiar as a set of encyclopedias on a shelf, and to see the first stages of
our cognitive contact with them as rooted in ordinary perception. Development of
this view has led to discussions of the relation of sets with numbers, the force
of Wittgenstein's philosophy of mathematics, and the justification of complex
set theoretic axioms by methods more familiar in the natural sciences than in
mathematics as it is usually understood. Under this current grant, Dr. Maddy
will bring together her previous work, and supplement and extent it in order to
make it accessible to mathematicians and professional philosophers of science.
