9319567 Weinreich The present proposal is for work that generally continues our
highly successful investigation of physical phenomena that underlie the
functioning of musical instruments, with important ramifications for vibrating
systems in general, sound production and control, wave propagation in irregular
spaces, computer modeling, and nonlinear mechanics. A new feature is the
emphasis on the dynamics of the driving mechanism of wind instruments, an
example of nonlinear coupling between separate oscillators with many
implications for the vibration of systems subject to nonlinear dynamical laws.
