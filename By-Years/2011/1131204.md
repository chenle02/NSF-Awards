Doctoral Dissertation Research: Transnational Interlocks and Global

Brook&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Economic globalization raises
questions about whether the emerging transnational business class acts in unison
or whether this global business class is internally factionalized. In this
context, interlocking directorates that connect transnational corporations play
an important role. However, we know surprisingly little about the impact the
growing number of such transnational interlocks has on national-level economic
and political strategies. This study tests the relationship between
transnational interlocks and actions taken by members of the global business
community that aim to influence national governments, for instance by forming
political action committees, making political donations, or placing former
government officials on a firm's board of directors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
analysis combines data on such business strategies with information about
corporate interlocking directorates in Fortune 500 companies for the years
2000-2010. First, panel regressions are used to test the hypothesis that firms
with strong transnational interlocking directorates will be more likely to
engage in globally and collectively oriented political behavior than firms that
are not characterized by such interlocking directorates. Subsequent analyses
focus on interlocks as a source of unity by using longitudinal random-effects
regression models to test the related hypothesis that firms linked to each other
through transnational interlocks will be more likely to exhibit similar
political behavior than non-interlocked firms. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts&lt;br/&gt;This project is timely, given the current public discourse
about the intended and unintended long-term consequences of changing regulations
regarding corporate spending and political action. This has also found its
reflection in a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision that lifts limits on
corporate funding of political broadcasts (Citizens United vs. Federal Elections
Commission, 558 U.S. 50, 2010). In addition, political analysts and the public
have raised questions regarding the influence of foreign entities in U.S.
elections. This study seeks to contribute to our understanding of the conditions
under which the power of business in a globalized context has ramifications for
the strategies of national governments.
