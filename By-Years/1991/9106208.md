Little is presently known about the conditions under which dissolved organic
carbon (DOC) is produced or destroyed in modern oceans or about the role of DOC
in the structure and dynamics of aquatic marine microbial ecosystems. The
objective in this research is to develop a mass spectrometric method for
shipboard determination of carbon-isotopic compositions of organisms
constituting the marine microbial food web. Availability of such techniques
should facilitate large-scale studies of the origin and recycling of DOC. DOC is
the largest organic carbon reservoir in seawater and, accordingly, is
particularly important in the global carbon isotopes, high- temperature
catalytic combustion techniques for the determination of the abundance of DOC,
flow cytometry for the separation of individual cell types and experimental
growth of mixed bacterial populations.
