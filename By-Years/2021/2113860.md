Solving machine learning (ML) problems requires efficient and scalable
optimization algorithms. State-of-the-art general purpose algorithms often need
to compute a large number of iterations and hence have limited applicability to
real-time applications. To circumvent this shortcoming, learning to optimize
(L2O) methods aim to learn a shorter (i.e., faster) optimization path over a
task distribution at meta-training, based on the tasksâ€™ common structures and a
more global view of their geometries, and then apply the learned optimizer to
new similar tasks at meta-testing. Despite extensive empirical success, the
existing L2O methods perform well mainly on optimization tasks with similar
structures, but likely perform poorly on out-of-distribution tasks. Furthermore,
there has been little theory understanding the convergence and generalization of
L2O algorithms. Thus, the proposed program will design novel L2O approaches, so
that the trained optimizer can generalize to a broad range of practical tasks,
particularly out-of-distribution tasks, and will have guaranteed convergence and
generalization performance in L2O training and
testing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the proposed program will design new
L2O approaches with both generalizability to out-of-distribution tasks and
safeguarded feature for guaranteed worst-case convergence, will develop a
theoretical framework for analyzing the convergence rate for L2O meta-training,
and will provide comprehensive characterization of the generalization
performance for L2O meta-testing. The new algorithms and theory will be
evaluated over applications of on-device model adaptation in internet-of-things
(IoT) systems, sparse recovery for images and wireless signals, and algorithmic
adaptation in reconfiguration of communication systems. The project is
anticipated to significantly mature the field of L2O, and provide training
opportunities for a diverse group of students at the new intersection of
optimization, machine learning, signal processing, and data
science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
