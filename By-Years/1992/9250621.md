The acquisition of a Distributed Numerical Control (DNC) System at Camden County
College enables students to fully integrate Computer Aided Design (CAD) to
Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) to the Computer Numerical Control (CNC)
machining. This acquisition allows data to move automatically onto the factory
floor, truly integrating computers in manufacturing. The broad goals of career
education, education for life and employment, form the core of the Computer
Integrated Manufacturing (CIM) curriculum. The CIM curriculum provides students
at the community college with the education and skills to respond to the present
and future needs of business and industry, and the addition of the DNC system to
the CIM laboratory creates a fully integrated industrial environment for the
program.
