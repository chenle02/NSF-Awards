Developing fast and efficient quantum compiling tools is critical to translate
theoretical gains in quantum computation power to real world performance.
Finding robust techniques to compile a quantum algorithm into the shortest
sequence of standard universal quantum gates has profound impact to quantum
computation in both near and long term. In the near term with the quantum
hardware available currently or in the near future, halving the circuit lengths
can mean the difference between success and failure of a computation task. In
the long term, these techniques make fault-tolerant computing possible, which
requires optimization of vast, complex circuits. The most viable approach to
achieve this goal is to break up a large circuit into few-qubit subcircuits
where reduction of the circuit length even merely by a constant factor manifests
as an exponential improvement in computation performance. While optimal
algorithms for single-qubit circuits have been well-understood, current efforts
focus on solving the optimal compiling problem of two-qubit circuits.
Achievement of this important milestone leading to further applications to
larger circuits relies on a convergent effort with cross-disciplinary expertise,
engaging students at both undergraduate and graduate levels in research and
education programs, and participation of industrial
collaborators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The general quantum compiling problem being
addressed here is as follows: given some unitary matrix representing the
operation of a computation algorithm and a universal set of quantum gates, find
a sequence of gates that either is equivalent to the unitary matrix (called
exact synthesis) or approximates the unitary matrix within a desired precision
(called inexact synthesis). The most efficient compiler is a circuit synthesis
algorithm optimized by minimization of a given cost-metrics, such as the gate-
count, especially for the gates that are difficulty to implement in a fault-
tolerance manner. Optimal or at least nearly-optimal algorithms of two-qubit
circuits for exact and inexact synthesis are achievable utilizing techniques
based on number theory and matrix decomposition. It is estimated that the gate-
count can be reduced by a constant-factor ranging roughly 1~10. Algorithms for
either case have stand along values and are complementary to each other. They
can be explored simultaneously and completed independently. Furthermore, these
algorithms can be the basis to build synthesis techniques for even larger qubit-
number circuits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
