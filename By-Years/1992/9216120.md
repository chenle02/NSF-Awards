This award supports a conference entitled: "Numerical Analysis with Automatic
Result Verification: Mathematics, Applications, and Software". The conference
will be held from February 25 to March 1, 1993, in Lafayette, Louisiana. The
conference will be concerned with automatic verification of computations
(interval analysis) in numerical analysis. The conference has three goals: 1.
Bringing U. S. researchers up to date on automatic verification of computations;
2. Apprising young researchers and graduate students of the status and
technology for automatically verified computations; 3. Providing a forum for
interactions between industrial mathematicians and researchers in automatically
verified computations.
