Daanish Mustafa University of Colorado Boulder The doctoral dissertation
research will examine the social structural factors underlying the inequities
and inefficiencies of the Pakistani irrigation and flood management regime. The
primary hypothesis is that the working of three structures of state, property
ownership regime and relevant power relations on water resources management
practice leads to increased vulnerability to flood hazard and irrigation water
scarcity for underprivileged social groups. The technique of realist
epistemology is employed to investigate the relationships in the water geography
of Pakistan. The research will entail field work in four central Pakistani
communities using ethnographic methods and household surveys, a government
institution and NGO surveys and library research.
