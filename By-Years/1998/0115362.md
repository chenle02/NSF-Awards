0115362&lt;br/&gt;Feldhaus&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description: This award supports
the US-India Workshop: Region and Regional Consciousness in India, Pune, India,
December 2001. The conveners are PI Anne Feldhaus, Arizona State University and
coPI Rajendra Vora, University of Pune, India. This symposium will bring
together scholars from the humanities and social sciences that are researching
various aspects of conceptualization and loyalty to regions in India. They will
examine regions from differing disciplinary perspectives and a variety of scales
with the goal of advancing understanding of ways in which people express,
create, and foster a sense of their area as a distinct and coherent unit to
which they belong. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scope: The symposium will foster new
institutional arrangements between Arizona State University and the University
of Pune that will promote collaborative research in the near future including
the convening of a follow-up symposium at Arizona State University, December
2003. This symposium will also provide an occasion for the founding of the
Centre for the Study of Regions in Pune. Participants include senior and junior
scholars, and recent Ph.Ds. This award is supported by the Division of
International Programs and the Division of Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences.
