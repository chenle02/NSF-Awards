This program includes research on a wide range of theoretical topics within the
context of Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs). The main objectives are to: (i) use GRBs as
lighthouses of the high-redshift Universe, to probe the physical conditions of
the Interstellar Medium in star-forming regions and their evolution with
redshift; (ii) generalize previous dust echo calculations and use them to
reconstruct the properties and distribution of dust around the massive stellar
progenitors of GRBs; (iii) use the properties of short GRBs to learn about the
various channels of binary star merger; (iv) perform a generalized study of
ultra-relativistic shockwaves in arbitrary media; (v) study gravitational
instabilities in the hyper-accreting disk believed to provide the GRB source of
power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the work include training of
undergraduate and graduate students, and development of a planetarium show on
GRBs at the Fiske Planetarium.
