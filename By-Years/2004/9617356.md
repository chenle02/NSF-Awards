OCE 96-17356 Swift The project will evaluate the ability of polarimetric
radiometry (a passive microwave remote sensing technique) to measure wind speed
and direction over the ocean. In particular, the polarimetric technique will be
compared to scatterometry (an active technique presently used from satellites).
This proposal will support data analysis focussing on the characteristics of the
polarimetric radiometry measurements, their evaluation in the context of
theoretical models, and direct comparison to scatterometric and in-situ
observations of the wind vector. The expected result is a thorough assessment of
polarimetric radiometry for the measurement of the ocean wind vector.
