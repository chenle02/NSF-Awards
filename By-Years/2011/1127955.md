The "Deaf STEM Community Alliance: Supporting Postsecondary Deaf and Hard-of-
Hearing Students in Science, Technology,Engineering and Mathematics," is led by
the Rochester Institute of Technology's National Institute for the Deaf with two
parterning institutions: Cornell University and Camden County Community College.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project's goal is to establish a model for a Virtual
Academic Community that will increase graduation rates of Deaf and Hard of
Hearing STEM majors in postsecondary education in the long term. Two objectives
support progress toward this goal: 1) Document and disseminate a description of
the process of creating the Virtual Academic Community in order to create a
scalable model that can be replicated to fit the needs of other students with
disabilities in STEM majors; and, 2) increasing the grade point averages and
retention rates of Deaf and Hard of Hearing postsecondary students in STEM
majors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An independent external evaluation of the work is
being conducted by Dr. Babara Lee Gelesko McKee. Results from the work will be
available to the public on the project website, at professional presentations
and in professional journals.
