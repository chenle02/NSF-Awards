The theory of operator algebras originated in the 1930s with
the&lt;br/&gt;efforts of J. von Neumann and others to develop rigorous
mathematical&lt;br/&gt;models of quantum mechanical systems. A fundamental
precept of this&lt;br/&gt;theory is that the time evolution of such a
mathematical model is&lt;br/&gt;prescribed by a one-parameter group of
automorphisms. A more general&lt;br/&gt;picture is obtained if one considers
evolutions of systems that can move&lt;br/&gt;forward but not necessarily
backward in time. This notion leads to the&lt;br/&gt;study of one-parameter
semigroups of endomorphisms, as opposed to (time&lt;br/&gt;reversible) one-
parameter groups of automorphisms. Price hopes to&lt;br/&gt;continue his work
with two leaders in the field, Alexis Alevras and&lt;br/&gt;Robert T. Powers, on
classifying families of semigroups of endomorphisms&lt;br/&gt;that act on the
operator algebras of all bounded operator on a
Hilbert&lt;br/&gt;space.&lt;br/&gt; Price also plans to continue his study of
endomorphisms on the&lt;br/&gt;operator algebra called the hyperfinite II_1
factor. The hyperfinite&lt;br/&gt;II_1 algebra R is of fundamental importance in
the study of operator&lt;br/&gt;algebras and is itself related to certain
mathematical models of spin&lt;br/&gt;systems. Previously he has used number-
theoretic ideas to arrive at a&lt;br/&gt;complete classification of the family
of endomorphisms on this algebra&lt;br/&gt;known as binary shifts. His current
work in this area is focused on&lt;br/&gt;obtaining a complete classification of
all endomorphisms on R whose&lt;br/&gt;image is maximal in R. This work uses
ideas from combinatorics and&lt;br/&gt;linear algebra as well as number theory.
The linear algebraic and&lt;br/&gt;combinatoric aspects of this study are
expected to lead to some research&lt;br/&gt;problems that are accessible to
gifted undergraduate students. Price&lt;br/&gt;proposes to continue working with
mathematics majors who are interested&lt;br/&gt;in honors projects related to
this work.&lt;br/&gt;
