As a result of this award NSF will partially fund an international workshop on
Clusters, Clouds and Grids for Scientific Computing. This workshop will explore
the transformation taking place through the combined used of clusters, clouds
and grounds in the context of multicore and hybrid microprocessor designs,
escalating volumes of data and by the spread of computational and data intensive
methods across nearly every research domain. The topic is relevant to the
cyberinfrastructure for U.S. science and engineering researchers.
