Iron-sulfur clusters are small inorganic entities necessary for the activities
of enzymes whose activities are essential to the life-sustaining processes of
respiration, nitrogen fixation and photosynthesis. One of the most important
roles of iron-sulfur clusters is to serve as agents of the electron transfer
reactions necessary for many biological processes. Several proteins required for
formation of iron-sulfur clusters have recently been identified and they are
among the most conserved proteins found in living cells. These proteins have
been designated IscU, IscS, IscA, HscB, HscA, and Fdx. This project is designed
to determine how these proteins work together to combine inorganic iron and
sulfur to create the clusters. Purified proteins will be used to duplicate the
cellular process in vitro and the physiological and biochemical consequences of
impairing the function of each protein in vivo will be assessed. In nitrogen-
fixing cells there is also a specialized set of homologous proteins that
specifically target iron-sulfur cluster formation for the activation of
nitrogenase. This project will also involve analysis of these proteins to
determine how they target iron and sulfur for the support of biological nitrogen
fixation. How iron-sulfur clusters are formed biologically is important because
free inorganic iron and free sulfur are metabolic poisons. Furthermore, cellular
defects in an ability to properly form iron-sulfur clusters is known to have a
profound effect on the metabolism of iron, which can be manifested in a variety
of debilitating genetic disorders. Finally, the controlled manipulation of
metabolic pathways by altering or increasing the cellular capacity for iron-
sulfur cluster formation could have practical application in increasing crop
yield, the prevention or treatment of microbial pathogenesis, as well as
improving the capacity for certain microoganism to serve as agents of
bioremediation.
