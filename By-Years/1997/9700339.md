9700339 Raskin This is an award to assist in the purchase of equipment for
conduct of research on microbial ecology of biological processes used for
treatment of wastewater, bioremediation of xenobiotic compounds, and for the
detection and viability of waterborne pathogens. The major use of the equipment
will be for research on performance of anaerobic bioreactors, development of an
oligonucleotide probe data base and to study causes and control of foaming in
suspended growth bioprocessing reactors. In addition the equipment will support
research by the investigator's colleagues Dr. Snoeyink in his research on
adsorption water treatment processes, Dr. Marinas in research on chemisorption
capacity of titanium dioxide for treatment of air, and Drs. Werth and Sanford
who are working on insitu bioremediation of contaminated aquifers. This award
will provide the investigator and her colleagues with equipment that can be used
to address a unique approach to studying anaerobic ecosystems and re-addressing
the "long- standing problems" of foaming and bulking experienced with suspended
growth bioreactors as well as the newer challenges in nutrient removal from
wastewater by use of biological processes. The proposal leading to this award
was submitted in response to NSF 93-155, Research Equipment Grant Program. ***
