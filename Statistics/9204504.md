Research efforts under this award lie in three areas: nonparametric and
semiparametric estimation, stationary point processes and the history of
twentieth century statistics. Specific goals for estimation of functionals in
nonparametric models include a study of convergence rates for sieve estimators,
the construction of optimal or near-optimal estimators, and an examination of
ways to reduce the dimensionality of the covariate space. The study of
stationary point processes will examine methods of inference for these, also for
stationary random sets and for the prediction of areal averages of random
fields. One facet of this research involves the development of methods of
accurate estimation based on complex data from the physical sciences. These new
methods should reduce the assumptions needed for the statistical analysis to
proceed correctly. The research will also investigate the effect of mild errors
in even those necessary assumptions. A second aspect of this project focusses on
the analytic techniques for data gathered over wide areas, for example,
measurements of atmospheric ozone. The goal of this work is to develop
statistical analytical methods which can be used to evaluate relationships among
different measurements and to examine potential causal mechanisms. The third
aspect of this project is the historical study of the relationship of the
conceptual structure of mathematical theories to their areas of scientific and
policy applications.
