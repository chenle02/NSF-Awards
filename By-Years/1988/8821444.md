This proposal seeks to extend the capabilities of probabilistic networks as the
basic mechanism of representing and managing uncertainty in automated reasoning
applications. Extensions include the development of distributed inference
schemes for the classification and interpretations of objects and scenes, the
development of enhanced diagnosis systems based on distributed computation, the
formalization of causation and relevance and the mechanization of qualitative
non-monotonic reasoning based on sound probabilistic semantics.
