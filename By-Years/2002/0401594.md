Abstract for award DMS-0401594 of Coleman

I propose to determine semi-stable models of the modular curves. One now knows
that every elliptic curve defined over the rationals is a quotient of a modular
curve. It is said to be semi-stable if the singularities are only on its
reductions and are ordinary double points. One knows, thanks to Mum-ford, that
every curve has a semi-stable model, after a base extension, but for most (eg.,
those of prime cubed level) one doesn't know one. I plan to remedy this defect.

I propose to determine semi-stable models of the modular curves. Modular curves
play a prominent role in contemporary algebraic number theory. For example, they
were crucial in Wiles' proof of Fermat's last theorem. One now knows that every
elliptic curve defined over the rational numbers (a.k.a. the rationals) (i.e.,
defined by equations with only rational coefficients) is a quotient of a modular
curve and this has been used to provide most of the theoretical evidence for the
Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture on the structure of the set of rational points
on such a curve. Modular curves first arose as smooth curves defined over the
complex numbers. Shimura proved they could be defined over he rationals. A model
for a curve defined the rationals is essentially a set of equations with integer
coefficients. It is said to be semi-stable if its singularities incorporated in
the equations are of the simplest sort. One knows, thanks to David Mumford, that
every curve has a semi-stable model but for most modular curves one doesn't know
one. I plan to remedy this defect.
