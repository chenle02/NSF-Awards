Dr. E. Hadjimichael is an important contributor to the field of electromagnetic
processes in nuclear physics. He proposes to study photoreactions and
electroreactions of few-nucleon systems in order to learn about the off-shell
nature of nucleon-nucleon interaction phenomenon as they manifest themselves in
electromagnetic and weak currents. He also plans to investigate neutrino and
antineutrino reactions with the deuteron, so as to check the sources of exchange
axial currents and to test the standard model of electroweak interactions. Major
new experimental facilities are planned at CEBAF and BATES for studying the
electromagnetic processes of nuclei by electron and photon scattering. The
proposed research is important for developing an understanding and explanation
of the experiments which will be performed at these facilities. The present
level of theoretical research in this area is sufficiently low so as to pose
serious problems for the field given the substantial investments in new
experimental facilities. Relevant research in this area should be encouraged.
