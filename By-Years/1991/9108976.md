The purpose of this project is to analyze the productivity within manufacturing
industries using the longitudinal research data base at the Bureau of the
Census. The goal of this research is to determine why some industrial plants are
more productive than others and, to ask whether there is any systematic relation
between trends in the productivity growth of an industry and changes in the
distribution of productivity of the plants within that industry. This project is
important because it will help us better understand the factors governing
productivity at the plant and industry level. The first part of the analysis
will use the rankings of productivity of plant and nonparametric tests to
determine whether, when productivity growth slowed, was the slowdown uniform
across plants or did some plants slow more or less than others? Did the plants
that were on the productivity frontier slow more or less? Similar questions can
be asked for the period of the rebound in productivity. The second part of the
analysis will follow the productivity of plants over time in order to assess
alternative models of the productivity distribution.
