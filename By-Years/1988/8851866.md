A computer-controlled, modern, high performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC) is
providing the capability for students to study state-of-the- art methods for
separation and analysis of complex liquid solutions. Computer control is being
achieved by purchasing appropriate hardware and software in lieu of the
dedicated terminal normally supplied with the chromatograph. With this
modification, the new chromatograph is being integrated into the existing
computer network at the university, which will vastly increase the effectiveness
of the instrument. Data acquisition, processing and storage and instrument
control is becoming more flexible, and interaction with other instruments on the
network (e.g., visible/ultraviolet spectrometer and gas chromatograph) is
becoming feasible. The modernization of the HPLC capability is necessary for the
department to maintain adequate faciltities for the education of the small group
of chemistry majors and the considerably larger group of health science majors.
The instrument is being used throughout the chemistry curriculum as well as
throughout the Natural Science Division for undergraduate student research. The
grantee is matching the award from non-Federal sources.
