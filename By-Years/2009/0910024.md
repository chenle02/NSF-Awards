Bee pollination plays a major role in maintaining the plant diversity of
tropical ecosystems. Worldwide, agriculture also relies upon bee pollination,
which plays a central role in many economically important crops. Increased
destruction of bee-friendly habitat and declines in honey bee populations have
led to interest in other bee pollinators, such as stingless bees, which have a
key role in preserving native plant diversity and agriculture. However, little
is known about how stingless bees influence plant gene flow by where they choose
to forage. In particular, the role of competition, aggression, and interceptive
eavesdropping (the ability of some stingless bee species to intercept foraging
information intended for nestmates) on flower visitation and pollination are not
well understood. The researchers will combine field studies of stingless bee
foraging and mathematical modeling to determine how these foraging patterns vary
with foraging strategy and how competition among stingless bees can change
foraging patterns. Their results will increase our understanding of how
interceptive eavesdropping shapes bee foraging and contribute to mathematical
models useful for preserving native plant diversity and the management of these
alternative agricultural pollinators. The research will also allow minority and
underprivileged students to gain direct field research experience and provide
outreach teaching the importance of native pollinators and the scientific method
through the web and science workshops.
