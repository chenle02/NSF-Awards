This Nanoscale Exploratory Research (NER) award to Illinois Institute of
Technology is supported by Divisions of Chemistry (MPS) and Chemical Transport
Systems (ENG), and this proposal was submitted in response to the solicitation
"Nanoscale Science and Engineering" (NSF 01-157). With this award, Professor
Khan in collaboration with Drs. Chris Marshall (Argonne National Laboratory) and
Robert Doedens (Univ. California Irvine) will design and develop novel
nanostructured zeolite like materials based on nanometer-sized transition metal
oxide clusters. Porous nanocomposites will be prepared from clusters of
polyoxometalates such as polyoxovanadate and their derivatives with linker
groups such as pyrazine, 1,4-dicyanobenzene and related organic ligands. The
composites prepared will be characterized by a number of physicochemical
techniques including spectroscopy (infrared, UV-visible, and x-ray absorption
spectroscopy), single crystal structure analysis, thermal methods, and surface
area measurements. Detoxification of oxides of nitrogen will also be carried out
using the catalysts prepared. Training undergraduate and graduate students in
this interdisciplinary program is part of the project.

Zeolite-type porous catalytic materials based on transition metal oxides will be
synthesized and characterized for the eventual application in the detoxification
of oxides of nitrogen. These nanocomposite catalysts will be based on nanometer
sized clusters of polyoxometalates and their derivatives linked by organic
ligands. With this award, both graduate and undergraduate students will be
trained in this interdisciplinary research program.
