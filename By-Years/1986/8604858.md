A fluorescence spectrophotometer is purchased for biochemical engineering
research. The proposed applications include determining the reduced NAD
concentration in strict anaerobes when cultivated under known reducing
environments and monitoring the change from gram negative to gram positive forms
of Clostridium acetobutylicum. Measurements will be used for developing
quantitative metabolic models. This equipment will provide a means of
significantly improving the scope of research in monitoring and controlling
fermentations.
