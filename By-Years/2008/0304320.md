The focus of this research involves the preparation of metallodendritic
nanosensor architectures susceptible to a specific change in fluorescence in the
presence of anions. The building blocks will be composed of a receptor moiety
capable of anion binding, and a ligand, connected by a fluorescent pi-conjugated
oligomer. The metal-ligand coordination will drive the assembly of nanosized
dendritic architectures. The ligand and metal template are selected to form
fluorescent tris(quinolato)AL3+, bis(quinolato)Zn2+ or
tris(1,10-phenanthroline)Os2+ complexes exhibiting metal-to-ligand charge
transfer states. The resulting metallodendrimers would form a highly fluorescent
architecture that would be susceptible to a change in optical properties in the
presence of anionic substances that can bind to the receptors contained in the
architecture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this Nanoscale: Exploratory Research
(NER) award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program and the Chemistry
Office of Special Projects are supporting the research of Dr. Pavel Anzenbacher
of the Department of Chemistry at Bowling Green University. Professor
Anzenbacher will focus his work on the development and characterization of self-
assembled optical nanosensors for chemical sensing in multianalyte environments.
The research could have an important broader impact on the production of
materials for sensing multiple anionic substrates such as inorganic anions,
fertilizers, and pharmaceuticals at very low
concentrations&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
