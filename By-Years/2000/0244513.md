This project will involve work on several related, but different topics, all of
which are associated with mathematical aspects of Einstein's General Theory of
Relativity. The first and probably the most significant of the topics is the
study of what is referred to as families of null surfaces, families of three-
dimensional surfaces embedded in space-time on which high frequency
electromagnetic waves travel. It turns out that General Relativity can be
reformulated as equations for these surfaces. This forms a rich research area
which borders on both physical and mathematical issues and their intimate
relationships. The second topic deals with a practical aspect of properties of
these null surfaces. The entire theory of gravitational lensing - now a basic
astrophysical tool - can be formulated in terms of null surfaces and their
properties. Using these null surfaces one can go beyond the (usual) thin lens
predictions and find corrections to the thin lens predictions that could be
tested. A third topic is a return to the long neglected study of the physical
meaning and applications of certain mathematical expressions that appear in
algebraically special Einstein-Maxwell fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first
topic will clarify some beautiful and deep relations between ideas associated
with the propagation of high frequency electromagnetic waves in space-time and
very abstract mathematical theorems concerning ordinary and partial differential
equation theory. It also should shed light, via a very unconventional point of
view, on the structure of the Einstein equations. The second topic should or
could be useful for the explanation of certain anomalies in the observations of
magnifications in gravitational lensing. There is evidence that the last topic
will clarify the potentially deep relationship between intrinsic magnetic
moments and spin angular momentum that appears to arise naturally in general
relativity.&lt;br/&gt;
