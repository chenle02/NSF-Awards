In this project, the PI will test a novel hypothesis that eukaryotic cells use
wave fringe counting to measure their lengths and shapes. The project was
inspired by an experiment showing that strong alternating electric fields
disrupt mitosis in a way that is resonant at radio frequencies. The PI will
bring ideas from physics, where it is well understood that fringe counting is
the method for measuring lengths stable at large scales. The PI hypothesis that
fringe counting work cells uses simulated inertia: a method commonly by human
engineers in designing microchips and also playing role in biology in the
functioning of the cochlea. The larger objective of the proposed research is to
identify the meter sticks of life. The intellectual merit of the proposed
research might lead to a fundamentally new understanding of cell regulatory
machinery. A potential discovery that cells can and do measure lengths by means
of fringe counting would open a new chapter in our understanding of
morphogenesis and biology in general and can lead to transformation of medicine.
