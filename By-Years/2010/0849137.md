Dr. Andrea Ghez (University of California - Los Angeles), along with
collaborators Marshall Perrin (University of California - Los Angeles) and
Rachel Kuzio de Naray (University of California - Irvine) will organize and
conduct the seventh annual symposium of the National Science Foundation
Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship (AAPF) program. The
symposium, to be held January 3-4, 2009 in Long Beach, California, will bring
together the AAPF fellows, faculty mentors, prospective AAPF applicants, and
interested members of the astronomical community. This will allow the fellows to
present their research and educational activities, and to better establish ways
to enrich the fellowship experience itself. Additionally, fellows will obtain
opportunities to establish interdisciplinary projects with colleagues during the
symposium.

The integration of educational activities into the research efforts of the
fellows provides for a broad impact of the fellowship program. Many fellows
participate in K-12/public outreach activities, leading to enhancement of the
public's interest in science. The symposium will allow the fellows to share
their ideas and experiences, not only among themselves, but also with faculty
mentors and with others in attendance.
