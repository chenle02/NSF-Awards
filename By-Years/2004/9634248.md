Abstract Law 9634248 The proposed program represents a continuation of the PIÄ±s
present NSF supported research. The major focuses of the proposed effort are:
(1) The study of the oxidation mechanisms and flame structure of C2-chlorinated
hydrocarbons and their mixtures with non-chlorinated hydrocarbons. Laminar flame
speed determinations will be made on the premixed flames, and extinction stretch
rates measured for the nonpremixed flames. The effects of C/H/Cl ratio, fuel
structure, flame temperature, and inhibition due to chlorination will be
assessed along with the development of a comprehensive chemical reaction
mechanism; (2) The study of soot formation in chlorinated hydrocarbon diffusion
flames. This will include the quantification of the structure of non-sooting and
near sooting flames, the determination of the soot inception and extinction
strain-rate limits, the mapping of the soot profile in order to assess the
effects of chlorination on soot nucleation, growth and oxidation, and the
development of detailed kinetic models of soot formation in C/H/O/Cl systems.
This latter task represents a new area of research for the PI.
