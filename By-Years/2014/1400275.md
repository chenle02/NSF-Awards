This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the
"Subfactor Theory in Mathematics and Physics Conference 2014" that will be held
July 14-18, 2014, on the Maui campus of the University of
Hawaii.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This interdisciplinary meeting focuses on the
interactions between the theory of operator algebras and mathematical physics.
Talks will be arranged under four main headings: subfactors, free probability,
and random matrices; approximation properties for groups, von Neumann algebras,
and subfactors; classification of subfactors; conformal and quantum field
theory. The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students,
postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.
