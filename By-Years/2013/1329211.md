The Chemical Catalysis Program of the NSF Division of Chemistry supports the
request of Professor Peter C. Stair of Northwestern University, and Nancy R.
Gray of Gordon Research Conferences, to partially support the travel and
registration of twenty U.S. graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to attend
the 2013 Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) and Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on
Chemical Reactions at Surfaces held at Les Diablerets Conference Center in Les
Diablerets, Switzerland on April 27-28, 2013. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Gordon
Research Seminar informs the participants about the conduct of science in the
USA and Europe, encourages young scientists to fully participate in the
scientific process by making presentations to their peers and mentors, and
exposes less experienced researchers to diverse research areas in surface
science. The international conference location and the expected participation by
young USA and European scientists provides a first-hand comparison of scientific
research on the two continents and the informal atmosphere formed from a group
of peers promotes participation. Student attendees/presenters span diverse
fields so as to inform the audience broadly. This conference is a leading venue
for dissemination of research spanning fundamental surface chemistry, catalysis
at surfaces, synthesis of surfaces, surface photochemistry, solid-liquid
interfaces, environmental and aerosol interfaces, tribology, gas-surface
scattering and reactions, and novel materials and environments. Along with a
panel of senior surface scientists, selected students address fundamental
questions about challenging research in the field of surface science as well as
questions on future career opportunities, and differences and similarities in
career paths available in North American and Europe.
