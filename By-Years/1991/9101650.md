The principal investigator will continue his research in complex differential
geometry and nonlinear analysis. He will be particularly concerned with a study
of Kahler manifolds through Kahler-Einstein metrics. In the 1950's Calabi asked
if one could find a Kahler-Einstein metric on a compact Kahler manifold with
positive first Chern class and no nontrivial holomorphic vector fields. Tian
will try to answer this question by obtaining estimates for the associated
Monge-Ampere operator on the underlying Kahler manifold. The methods involve
nonlinear partial differential equations, compactness arguments, and collapsing
of Riemannian manifolds. The existence of Kahler-Einstein metrics on spaces has
become an important problem in differential geometry. It is related to the
structure of space-time in which the curvature of space-time is proportional to
the stress field. Spaces in which curvature is proportional to distance are
called Einstein spaces. The principal investigator will try to determine if a
class of spaces with a "complex" structure can be given the additional Einstein
structure.
