Abstract

Award: DMS-0405873 Principal Investigator: John Loftin

A geometric structure on a manifold is a set of restricted coordinate charts and
gluing functions. There are often partial differential equations which behave
well with respect to these gluing functions, and in turn these PDEs can be used
to study the geometric structure. Dr. Loftin will continue to apply the theory
of Monge-Ampere equations to manifolds with geometric structure. In particular,
the relationship between Goldman's Fenchel-Nielsen type coordinates on the
deformation space of convex real projective surfaces and the holomorphic
coordinates introduced by Loftin will be further studied. Together with Eric
Zaslow and S.T. Yau, Dr. Loftin will study parabolic affine sphere metrics on
certain affine manifolds with singularities. These metrics are degenerate real
slices of the Calabi-Yau metrics. Yau, Zaslow, and Loftin will follow the
conjecture of Strominger-Yau-Zaslow to relate these metrics to a larger program
arising from string theory of understanding mirror symmetry of Calabi-Yau
manifolds.

Monge-Ampere equations have an illustrious history in differential geometry.
Yau's celebrated theorem constructed important notions of distance on a large
class of spaces (so-called Calabi-Yau manifolds) by solving a Monge-Ampere
equation. Dr. Loftin will study Monge-Ampere equations on other spaces. Some of
these spaces are useful in the study of string theory, a physical theory which
proposes a unification of all the forces in nature. In particular, there are
singular Calabi-Yau spaces which Dr. Loftin, together with Yau and Zaslow, will
study in order to shed light on the physics of string theory. Also, Dr. Loftin
will put also into practice curricular extensions in teaching precalculus. These
extensions were developed in a program involving other faculty and high school
teachers, in July, 2003, associated with Columbia University's VIGRE program. He
will also continue to develop similar curricular extensions.
