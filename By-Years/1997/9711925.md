The objective of this research is to develop a system for similarity based
retrieval from video and pictorial databases. The system is based on an
expressive query language called Hierarchical Temporal Logic (HTL) that
represents the temporal and pictorial content of video data. HTL predicates are
then matched with the database using multidimensional similarity measures. The
approach includes development of representation and preprocessing methods for
pictorial feature extraction both for generic objects and generic motion. The
features extracted include spectral signatures of shape and motion, local and
global color histograms and texture. Articulated motion in video is decomposed
into basic components using Motion Spectral Signatures (MSS). Generic objects
are recognized using Affine Invariant Spectral Signatures (AISS) and Expansion
Matching (EXM) based indexing in the frequency domain. Motion and object
representations are then utilized to construct a dictionary of HTL atomic
predicates with multidimensional hyper-regional representation. An on-line
learning capability for expanding the dictionary is also planned. Improved
methods for video shot and scene segmentation are to be developed as well. The
results of this research will provide an efficient means for query retrieval
from video and pictorial databases. Such a system will have many applications in
digital libraries and in TV movie industries.
