ABSTRACT

Information Technology Workforce (ITWF)

Proposal Id: EIA-0119858 Investigator: Louis Tornatzky Institution: Tomas
Rivera Policy Institute Title: Catching Up: A Longitudinal Study in Latino
Participation in the Information Economy

This award provides support for a 3-year study to better understand the factors
relevant to Latino's involvement in Information Technology (IT) careers. The
study will examine various factors influencing the attenuated representation of
Latinos in IT jobs, career paths, and appropriate educational experiences. The
research approach will be longitudinal using a cross-sectional approach to
gather quantifiable as well as qualitative data that encompasses the many
decisions and influences that occur between late-adolescence and early IT
careers. The research approach will also be multi-level examining the decisions
and behaviors of Latinos as affected by: (1) family dynamics including
socioeconomic standing, role models, and immigration history; (2) school
structure, policies, student population, and programs, at three levels within
K-16; (3) community characteristics and dynamics; and (4) regional economies and
markets. Data will be gathered from four metropolitan areas with high
concentrations of Latino residents: Los Angeles, Houston, Chicago and New York.
