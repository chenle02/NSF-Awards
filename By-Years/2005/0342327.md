Project Abstract&lt;br/&gt;SES 0342327&lt;br/&gt;Robert Malone, History of
Science Society&lt;br/&gt;"SGER to Support the Summer 2003
Workshop"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The proposal is for support of a
summer workshop that brings together historians of science and faculty and
administrators from Historically Black Colleges and Universities in an effort to
introduce more history of science into the curricula at these institutions. Such
an introduction may lead to the recruitment of young scholars into the STS
community, which lacks the diversity of underrepresented groups in the United
States.&lt;br/&gt;
