9710207 Wager This GOALI proposal, co-supported by MPS/OMA, and the DMR
Ceramics and Electronic Materials programs, addresses basic chemistry and
materials science aspects of commercially-relevant phosphors, and through a
multidisciplinary approach aims to both develop new phosphors appropriate for
electroluminescent(EL) flat-panel displays, and to systematically analyze and
optimize structure/performance properties of EL phosphors. The research strategy
is to understand fundamental phosphor defect chemistry and relate this
fundamental chemistry and solid state physics to the performance behavior of EL
phosphors. Several synthesis and processing routes will be explored including a
novel combination of MOCVD and RF sputtering for luminescent dopant
incorporation and/or deep level doping, and the synthesis of two classes of
nitride films with cations that are valence and size-matched to rare earth
luminescent dopants(Eu, Ce, Tm). Joint collaborative activities include staff
exchange with graduate students spending time at Planar America, Inc. The
proposed research emphasizes understanding of fundamental mechanisms and
processes along with some practical aspects of electronic/photonic materials and
device technology. %%% The project addresses forefront materials science
research issues in a topical area of materials science having high technological
relevance. The research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a
fundamental level to important aspects of display devices and photonic devices,
in general. Additionally, the fundamental knowledge and understanding gained
from the research is expected to contribute to improving the performance of
display technology by providing a fundamental understanding and a basis for
designing and producing improved photonic materials. An important feature of the
program is the integration of research and education through the training of
students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area. ***
