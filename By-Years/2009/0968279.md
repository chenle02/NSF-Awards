The project has three components, all concerning interactions between low-
dimensional topology and quantum algebra. The first main theme of the proposed
research is multivariable link invariants. The Principal Investigator and
Patureau-Mirand have shown that Lie superalgebras naturally give rise to
multivariable link invariants. The project continues this work with an aim of
further understanding these invariants and how they relate to other link
invariants. This initial work suggests that these multivariable link invariants
are related to the Volume Conjecture. The proposed research will also focus on
the categorification of a quantum invariant arising from a particular Lie
superalgebra. This could give a topological categorification of the Alexander
polynomial, in the sense of Bar-Natan's topological interpretation of Khovanov
homology. A final theme in the proposed research is the construction of a
3-manifold invariant associated to a Lie
superalgebra.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Knots appear in many places ranging from
everyday items such as tied shoe laces to string theory and protein folding. In
mathematics, knots and more generally links are fundamental basic objects in
topology. &lt;br/&gt;Knots have been studied since the 19th century. More
recently, with the quantum field theory point of view moving into low-
dimensional topology, the late 20th century saw the emergence of a revolution in
the theory of knots and links. In particular, the theory of quantum groups
associated to Lie algebras has been widely and productively used in low-
dimensional topology. Not as well developed is the theory of quantum groups
associated to Lie superalgebras and its applications. The theory of Lie
superalgebras has particular properties that do not arise in the theory of Lie
algebras. The focus of this proposal is to use these unique properties to gain
new information about well known problems and objects in low-dimensional
topology.&lt;br/&gt;
