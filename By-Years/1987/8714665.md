Through this research we seek a fundamental understanding of the mechanical
behavior of materials of scientific and engineering interest. The objective
underlying the work is a complete characterization of the resistance of material
to deformation and fracture. Research in this area is necessarily
interdisciplinary with activities that span the spectrum from basic theory,
through experiment and observation, to detailed modelling and simulation.
Theoretical studies provide the framework for discussing phenomena and for
postulating physical mechanisms of materials deformation and fracture as well as
provide definitions of physical quantities that should be measured. Experimental
studies, on the other hand, provide the means of identifying complex material
phenomenology and provide quantitative information on the physical quantities
identified in theoretical work. To complete the loop, analytical modelling and
computer simulation provide the means to examine the validity of theoretical
concepts and to draw conclusions about the behavior of materials that could not
be inferred directly from experimental data. It is essential that each of these
ingredients be included in a comprehensive research program if significant
fundamental contributions are to be made. Major themes of this research include:
(1) the effects of rate and temperature on inelastic deformation mechanisms and
fracture behavior; (2) the establishment of quantitative links between
microscopic microstructural mechanisms and macroscopic behavior; (3) exploration
of the role of interfaces on the mechanisms of deformation and fracture; and (4)
the study of unstable and localized deformation, especially as a direct
precursor to failure.
