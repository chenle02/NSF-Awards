9304555 Langston This research is to conduct a study of the crustal and upper
mantle structure in Tanzania by means of passive-source seismic recording with
the PASSCAL array and by means of analysis of gravity data. The existence of
thick, depleted mantle lithosphere beneath ancient continental regions forms the
basis of the model for deep continental structure. A principal assertion of this
model is that cratonic nuclei with their lithospheric keels are true islands of
tectonic stability within a generally mobile and less stable lithosphere. This
work will test this model of deep continental structure by examining the
stability of cratonic lithosphere in an area of active tectonism, East Africa.
The cratonic lithosphere in East Africa (the Tanzania Craton) has been subjected
to Cenozoic extensional tectonism, providing a unique opportunity to determine
if deep cratonic structure can "survive" an extensional event which has
thermally and mechanically disrupted adjacent younger lithosphere. Similar
structures in the U.S. are the sites of current seismic activity and these
results will bear on the mechanism of the earthquake generating structure. This
research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program. ***
