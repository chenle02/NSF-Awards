9626846 Vanhoy This research is a three-year program to study the structure of
low angular momentum states in tellurium nuclei by inelastic neutron scattering
followed by gamma ray emission. The research involves undergraduate students
from the U.S. Naval Academy and utilizes facilities of the University of
Kentucky Van de Graaff laboratory in addition to those of the Naval Academy, and
is a collaboration with students and scientists from the University of Dallas as
well as the University of Kentucky. ***
