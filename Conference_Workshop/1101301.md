The Palmetto Number Theory Series (PANTS) is a series of number theory meetings
managed jointly by Clemson University and University of South Carolina, the two
&#64258;agship research institutions in South Carolina, the Palmetto State. The
Southeast Regional Meeting on Numbers (SERMON) is an annual number theory
meeting that has been in existence since 1988. While PANTS has been
predominantly held at institutions in South Carolina, SERMON has always rotated
around institutions in the Southeast. Starting in 2011 there will be one PANTS
meeting held in the fall and one in December along with one SERMON meeting in
the spring. The December PANTS meeting will rotate annually between Clemson
University and the University of South Carolina. The fall PANTS meeting will be
held at another Southeastern school. The fall PANTS meeting is one or one and
one-half days and features two plenary talks, while the December meeting is two
days and features four plenary talks. Leading number theorists from outside the
Southeast give the hour-long plenary talks. The annual SERMON meeting will be
held over one and one-half days with one plenary speaker that will deliver a
public lecture on the Friday before the conference begins and then an hour-long
plenary address during the conference. The meetings also have 20 minute
contributed talks from Southeastern participants.

The primary goal of PANTS/SERMON is to provide the number theory community in
the Southeast with an opportunity to hear about recent research in number
theory, pure and applied. PANTS/SERMON meetings attract prominent number
theorists. They also provide regional mathematicians, particularly graduate
students and junior faculty, with an opportunity to speak. PANTS/SERMON
participants come from Ph.D. granting institutions, institutions whose highest
degree awarded is a master's degree, and from institutions granting only
baccalaureate degrees. Students and faculty at some of these schools do not have
access to travel funds nor to research seminars, so PANTS/SERMON funding is
especially crucial to them. The organizers will also continue to try to attract
a demographically diverse participant base, including women and other
underrepresented groups.
