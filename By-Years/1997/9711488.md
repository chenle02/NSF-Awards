TITLE: Improved Methods for Modeling the Atmospheric Aerosol Size and
Composition Distribution for Regional to Global Climate Change Applications.
This proposal is for modification of an integrated air pollution assessment EPA
model widely in use. These modifications are necessary steps in the right
direction to apply the models for climate change issues. The generalization of
the present modal aerosol dynamics to allow for more than usual two modes, to
allow more generality in creation and destruction of modes, and to allow for
multi-component systems with size dependent composition, is attempted in the
work proposed. This research enhances in the long run societal abilities at
estimating regional environmental impacts.
