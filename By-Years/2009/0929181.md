Strategies: Exploring Databases: STEM learning and authentic research in the
high school classroom

The investigators will develop a new curriculum and teacher professional
learning community to support a research experience for students using an
existing data base of the genetics of a sample of humans along with indicators
of behavior such as smoking. This project will emphasize the STEM areas of
genetics and neuroscience, as well as development of skills in conducting
scientific research, scientific reasoning, and using information and
communication technology. The project builds on a previous project, which
involved high school students conducting a research study on smoking behavior.
That study collected genetic and environmental data from 300 adult smokers and
nonsmokers and entered them into a smoking behavior database. In this study
students will use the database to answer their own research questions about
factors that affect smoking behavior.

The project is expected to test a model of how to design a curriculum so that
students can effectively conduct research using databases. Their study examines
the effects of this research experience on how students think about scientific
research, student learning of STEM knowledge, and student interest in STEM
learning and careers.
