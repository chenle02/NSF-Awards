The objective of the present work is to develop a fundamental knowledge base
for microscale dropwise melt deposition, and to explore possible applications
and equipment design for those applications. A variety of modes of controlled
microdrop deposition will be investigated, followed by detailed quantitative
studies aimed at identifying the controlling thermo-physical processes and the
parameters that determine satisfactory deposition in each mode. These studies
will be made using microdrops of various waxes in a test system which is capable
of generating very reproducible droplets at various melt temperatures and
droplet deposition speeds over a broad range of deposition frequencies. Although
these investigations use waxes, one of the main objectives of the program will
be to develop scaling laws for the various deposition modes, and possibly also
some useful analytical models based on simplified models of the thermo-physical
solidification processes that are involved. This will lead to an understanding
of how the data for wax extrapolates to other melt materials. Some tests will
also be made with low melting point metals like tin as a check on the proposed
scaling laws derived from analysis and data on waves. The buildup of materials
or physical objects by controlled deposition of melt microdrops has potential
applications in rapid prototyping, 3D copying, direct fabrication of small
structures including electronics packaging and materials processing.
