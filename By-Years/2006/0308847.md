While fine roots are a key component of ecosystem carbon cycling,
interactions&lt;br/&gt;between soil resources and roots are typically studied
without considering potential&lt;br/&gt;interactions with root herbivores and
their natural enemies. We propose to use field and&lt;br/&gt;greenhouse
experiments to investigate the influence of resource availability,
resource&lt;br/&gt;heterogeneity and root herbivory on above- and belowground
biomass and preliminary&lt;br/&gt;competitive outcomes in early-successional
southeastern U.S. forests. Preliminary data&lt;br/&gt;has shown that herbivores
play a strong role in this system, and demonstrated strong&lt;br/&gt;positive
responses of root herbivores to small-scale (&lt;50cm 2 ) resource-rich patches.
This may have strong negative impacts on plant species that preferentially
forage in such patches, while allowing less-aggressively foraging plant species
to persist where they would otherwise be outcompeted.&lt;br/&gt;
