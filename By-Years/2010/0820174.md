Humans positively regard the groups to which they belong (i.e., ingroups) and
enact favorable beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors toward their groups. Such
positive ingroup regard is ubiquitous in the sense that it is evidenced in
multiple cultures, arises in response to both momentarily-formed groups and
enduring groups, and activates quickly under the most minimal of conditions. By
integrating the social psychological literature on groups, multi-level models of
human evolution, and a neuroscience literature that details the affiliative
effects of the mammalian hormone oxytocin, the proposed research develops and
tests a bio-social model of positive ingroup regard. The model suggests that an
activated sense of group membership (i.e., "we are a group") triggers the
release of oxytocin which in turn promotes a favorable orientation toward the
group and its members (i.e., positive ingroup regard). According to the model,
positive ingroup regard functions as part of an evolved intragroup social-
regulation process that promotes the stability of the group and an individual's
membership therein. Three proposed experiments test the bio-social model.
Experiment 1 tests whether a sense of ingroupness triggers oxytocin release and
whether oxytocin serves as a hormonal mediator of positive ingroup attitudes and
behaviors. Experiment 2 examines whether oxytocin is released differentially or
differentially affects behavior in an intragroup context that lacks a rival
outgroup versus an intergroup context in which a rival outgroup is present.
Experiment 3 examines the more nuanced issue of whether oxytocin is triggered in
response to ingroup members, the abstract concept of the ingroup, or both
individual members and the ingroup construct. By integrating traditional social
psychology, evolutionary theory, and the neuroscience literature on oxytocin the
proposed research advances the extant conceptual and empirical understanding of
why humans positively regard the groups to which they belong.
