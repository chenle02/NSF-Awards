For at least two decades it has been recognized that the magnitude and vertical
distribution of heating in the tropics has major effects upon the general
atmospheric circulation including the weather in mid-latitudes. In tropical
regions, the most important source of heating is the release of latent heat
which predominantly occurs in mesoscale convective systems. In the winter of
1987, a large field experiment was held off the northern coast of Australia to
investigate, among other goals, the vertical distribution of heating in deep
convective systems. The Principal Investigators propose to continue their
analyses of this rich data set to accomplish several research objectives
including: to determine the processes that modulate the vertical heating
profiles in deep convective systems; and to determine the variability of the net
heating and drying processes in mesoscale convective systems. //
