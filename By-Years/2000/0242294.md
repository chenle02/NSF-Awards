This project would develop a module in economics for high school students. The
module would be structured as 12 investigations on national economic
performance, linked to various sets of economic education standards. Starting
with well publicized economic indicators, such as the Gross Domestic Product or
the Consumer Price Index, the module will investigate the meaning of these
indicators, then get students to ask questions about the economy which may (or
may not) be answered by an examination of these statistics. Materials will be
developed to work best with an interactive instructional mode, as students play
roles or engage in simulations about the behavior of the economy.

The project will be "teacher-driven:" the writing team will consist of three
classroom teachers, three economics educators on the university level and an
experienced curriculum writer. The materials will be pilot tested, revised, then
field tested and published.
