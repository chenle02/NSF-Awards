The brain controls reproduction through chemical mediators called hormones. The
brain hormone that is known as the master control of reproduction, and an
important one for all vertebrates is gonadotropin-releasing hormone, GnRH.
Studies in recent years on the jawless vertebrate called the lamprey,
representing the most primitive lineage of vertebrates, show that its GnRH has
more than one molecular form that acts at a gland called the pituitary that sits
at the base of the brain. This project utilizes molecular and physiological
techniques to isolate and characterize the genomic sequences that encode the
molecular receptor molecules on cells in the pituitary and the hormones
(gonadotropins) produced by the pituitary that respond to GnRH. Results will
tell whether lamprey GnRHs share common functional and developmental features
with the GnRH found in other vertebrates, and how these multiple forms of GnRH
are used by lampreys to regulate reproduction at different life stages under
different environmental conditions. The comparative approach allows inferences
about how the control of reproduction arose in the evolution of vertebrates.
This project will increase our understanding of reproductive control and how it
evolved, and so will have an impact beyond neuroscience on endocrinology and
vertebrate biology in general. This project also has potential for developing
controls for a predatory animal that affects commercial fisheries, has strongly
integrated educational and training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate
students, and has a strong component of international collaboration.
