This project provides support for acquisition of laboratory research equipment
for seismic engineering experiments. The equipment to be purchased is a moderate
speed, one hundred and four channel data acquisition system, eighty channels for
use with strain gages and twenty-four channels for use with load cells and
LVDTs. Increasing testing of larger and more complex structural systems has been
conducted at the large scale structural engineering laboratory at the University
of Michigan. These test structures require more instrumentation in order to
completely interpret their behavior under severe loading conditions. The
reliable and large capacity data acquisition system acquired will further
enhance the capability of large scale seismic testing. This is an equipment
grant.
