This grant continues support for a very successful research program in law and
economics in which the investigator applies economic models to legal issues. The
first topic on patent law and antitrust policy extends the investigator's prior
work on joint R&D ventures involving two or more firms. A model has been
developed illustrating conditions under which joint ventures which can be
protected by joint patents will either be optimal or suboptimal incentives for
R&D. The second project studies contingent fees for professional services. The
analysis offers a new perspective on this fee system regarding why lawyers do
not buy cases from clients and collect 100% of the reward. The third project
involves looking at the logic behind the rules of evidence as it relates to ex
ante deterrence and protecting the rights of innocent parties who may be
accused. The question is asked why, in deciding facts, juries are generally
prohibited from considering the accused's criminal record, although judges are
not prohibited from considering it in sentencing. The fourth project looks at
why the government is so heavily involved in regulatory testing. The analysis
will explain when and whether multiple tests should be allowed and why testing
fees should sometimes exceed their social costs. All of these topics have broad
theoretical and practical implications for both the field of economics and law
and social science.
