The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program and the Chemical Instrumentation
Program support Professor Johnson in experimental studies of size-selected
cluster anions. The work will emphasize the investigation of negatively charged
water clusters, the cluster analogue of the hydrated electron. Specific issues
being investigated include the evolution of the visible absorption spectrum with
cluster size and the relaxation processes that trap the electron in the cluster.
Reactions of the excess electron are being studied in collisions involving size-
selected cluster anions. Information is also being obtained on the size
dependence of cluster morphology and on the diffusion of various adsorbate
molecules from the cluster surface into the cluster interior. High resolution
spectroscopy is also being used to characterize the structure of smaller binary
clusters.
