This starter grant award to the University of Minnesota will support the
research of Professor Carl D. Frisbie. The theme of the research is the use of
atomic force microscopy (AFM) for the direct measurement of the binding forces
between biological molecules. The work will provide quantitative and dynamic
information on single biomolecular recognition events such as occur in an
antigen-antibody complex or between single strands of complementary
oligonucleotides. The research will probe forces between simple biomolecules
such as peptides and oligonucleotides by anchoring them to surfaces and AFM tips
in oriented monolayers using methods developed in Frisbie's postdoctoral work.
The chemically modified AFM tips will be brought into contact with the sample
surfaces and the force needed to rupture the adhesive contact will be measured.
The studies provide a general methodology for obtaining direct quantitative
measures of the binding forces between a variety of biomolecules. Dynamic
information such as binding force and bond rupture length obtained in this work
will enhance molecular level understanding of biological molecular recognition
and should ultimately be useful in drug design and protein engineering.
