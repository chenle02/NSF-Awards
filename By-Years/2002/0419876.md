This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I research project will
demonstrate an innovative application of ion mobility spectroscopy (IMS) and
electrospray ionization (ESI) aimed at separation and detection of biologically
active macromolecules in environmental and food product sample matrices. This
innovative application of ESI-IMS will enable real time aqueous phase
measurement of protein bio-toxins and other proteins of public health
significance without the need for expensive diagnostic reagent additions or
complex sample preparation procedures.

The commercial application of this project will be in the areas of homeland
security, environmental monitoring and food safety.
