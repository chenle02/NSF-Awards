9314527 O'Connor The basic hypothesis of this research is that the practice of
constructability will be enhanced if a systems is available to assist the user
in conducting the analysis. To test this hypothesis the investigators will
develop a decision support system for the constructability analysis of
industrial piping. Computer methods include a hybrid scheme consisting of rule-
based and case- based reasoning for representing knowledge and a virtual reality
environment to serve as analysis and visualization platform. In addition to
developing the system, this research will result in (i) an investigation of the
adaptations required to apply the computer methods to the construction domain
and (ii) definition of a methodology for developing computer integrated
construction systems. The first phase will identify the variables influencing
constructability and model the process in the form of a decision sequence. The
second phase will focus on the development of schemes to represent the data and
basic knowledge required for the analysis. In the third phase the
representations will be integrated with a virtual reality environment.
