This action funds Andrew Zuza of University of California at Los Angeles to
conduct a research project in Geoscience during the summer of 2013 at Chinese
Academy of Geological Sciences in Beijing, China. The project title is "Tectonic
Development of the Tibetan Plateau: Insights from the Qilian Shan Thrust Belt."
The host scientist is Professor Rui Gao.

Determining the Cenozoic evolution of Qilian Shan thrust belt, along the
northern edge of the Tibetan Plateau, is fundamental in understanding how
continental deformation and shortening induced by the India-Eurasia collision is
accommodated across the plateau. This research investigates the structural
framework, fault geometries, and Cenozoic shortening magnitude of the Qilian
Shan thrust belt by systemically mapping a transect of the thrust belt. This
surface geology is being compared with high-resolution seismic-reflection data
recently obtained by the SinoProbe Project in order to see how mapped surface
structures continue at depth. Furthermore, this work involves mapping active
faults that are responsible for producing large (momentum magnitude scale
greater or equal to 8) earthquakes. Increased knowledge regarding these faults
is valuable for evaluating the seismic hazards associated with these structures.

Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
