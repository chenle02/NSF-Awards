The aim of this SGER research project is to develop solid acid based fuel cells
that take advantage of the many benefits inherently offered by anhydrous, warm-
temperature, proton conducting electrolytes. Composite electrolytes comprised of
phosphate solid acids and nanoparticulate oxides will be studied. Such materials
are known to exhibit high proton conductivity at temperatures lower than what is
normally required for the pristine solid acid, and are likely to display
mechanical properties sufficient for thin membrane fabrication. The specific
combination of materials to selected for investigation is a cesium / rubidium
phosphate solid acid and a proton conducting oxide, yttrium doped barium
zirconate. This class of materials is anticipated to have excellent chemical
stability in the fuel cell environment. Key scientific questions center on
interfacial phenomenon that are believed to be responsible for the enhancement
of the conductivity for composite materials over pristine solid acids. To
address these questions, samples will be examined by in situ high temperature
X-ray diffraction and solid state NMR spectroscopy. In parallel, complete fuel
cell characterization of membrane-electrode-assemblies will be performed, and
the suitability of these materials for applications assessed. With a fundamental
understanding of the mechanisms by which composite materials can give rise to
high conductivity, in combination with fuel cell performance evaluation, it will
be possible to engineer composite architectures which fully exploit the
potential for excellent electrical and mechanical properties.
&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;The proposed studies will help to clarify the
phenomenon of enhanced proton conductivity in composite materials, while
simultaneously providing an assessment of the suitability of such materials to
fuel cell applications for sustainable energy production. &lt;br/&gt;***
