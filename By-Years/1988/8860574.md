This Phase I SBIR award is to explore a novel technique for generating small
ceramic oxide particles. A metal salt of the desired oxide is mixed with an
organic, atomized, and combusted. The salt decomposes due to the high
temperature generated by combustion, vaporizes, and then condenses to form small
particles. Particle so generated will be analyzed for size and degree of
agglomeration. This technique is identical, in principle, to the mechanism of
forming small ash particles in coal combustion. However, it should be much more
controllable due to the choice of salt, salt concentration, organic drop size,
and combustion conditions.
