This project focuses on recruiting students to high technology disciplines,
increasing retention through mentoring and support and facilitating career
placement through industry partnerships. To meet these ends, the School of
Natural and Applied Sciences (NAS) awards 29 NSF scholarships in each of four
years in the areas of Computer Science, Computer Information Systems, Computer
Systems Engineering and Mathematics. A strong mentoring component grounds the
project. In addition to joining an NSF Scholars Organization, students meet with
faculty and peer mentors regularly to address academic, career and personal
progress. Mentoring strategies tap institutional resources as well as
established industry linkages to further career goals. A Steering Committee,
composed of industry, community college and institutional representatives,
ensures effective integration and communication of all project components and
resources.
