Tiny, embedded computers will collect real-time data on our homes, our cities,
and our planet. Collecting and processing rich streams of sensor data will
transform public health, medicine, natural resource management, science,
engineering, and disaster response. But today, despite years of research and
engineering, these sensor networks often fail to meet their performance goals.
Data yields are low; networks last weeks, rather than months; long downtimes are
common.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Levis proposes a long-term agenda of
research and education to improve the robustness, manageability, and scalability
of low-power wireless sensing systems. The dominant design principle behind this
agenda is network visibility. Described colloquially, visibility measures a
user?s ability to identify the cause of a network event, such as a packet drop.
We propose to research how to make networks more
visible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research agenda is grounded in the
exploration, development, and evaluation of the Mote Network&lt;br/&gt;(MNet)
architecture, an open-source protocol suite and toolkit for sensor network
application development and deployment. The protocol suite will include existing
dominant protocols redesigned for improved visibility as well as novel protocols
whose designs maximizes visibility. Our principal goal is to make long-lived
sensornets significantly simpler to deploy and maintain. Our second goal is to
apply our lessons learned to wireless meshes more
generally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
