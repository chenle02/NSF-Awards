This project will study solutions to elliptic equations derived from multiple
integrals with symmetries. The topics to be emphasized are estimates up to the
boundary, global regularity, isolated and removable singularities, apriori
gradient estimates, and the relation between quasiconvexity and rank one
convexity. The equations to be studied model phenomena in geometry, optimal
design and nonlinear elasticity. Thus this project has applications in various
branches of mathematics and engineering.
