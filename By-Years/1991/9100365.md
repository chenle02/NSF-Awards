This project supports the dissertation research of a cultural anthropologist
from Cornell University in Nepal. Using ethnographic methodology, the student
will study a diverse group of Tibetan refugees to see how they maintain and
construct their Tibetan ethnic identity in the face of alternate ethnic
identities and foreign influences. The project will focus on the production of
Tibetan religious artifacts and their sale to foreigners. Using in depth
interviews, the student will study how the Tibetan emigrant population defends
its sense of itself as a separate ethnic group. This research is important
because the rate of inter-cultural mixing, borrowing and merging in the
contemporary world is unprecedented at the same time that the strength of
particular ethnic identities (and inter-ethnic hostilities) seems to be growing.
This is a global phenomenon, and the micro-processes by which groups maintain
and re-create their ethnic identities to fit novel social situations is
relatively little studied. Understanding the issues involved in this one case
will help develop general theory.
