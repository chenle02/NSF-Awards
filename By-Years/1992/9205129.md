Professor Morales will study invariants associated to integral trace forms in
normal tame finite extensions of number fields. He wants to see whether there
are Stickelberger like conditions for classes associated to trace forms in
fields of even degree. This project falls into the general area of arithmetic
geometry - a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of mathematics: number
theory and geometry. This combination has proved extraordinarily fruitful -
having recently solved problems that withstood generations. Among its many
consequences are new error correcting codes. Such codes are essential for both
modern computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
