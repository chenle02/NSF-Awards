This research is concerned with computational problems in differential geometry,
calculus of variations and applied mathematics. In particular, the computational
problems of interest are the implementation of algorithms to solve problems in
partial differential equations arising from physical problems and the
development of scientific graphics. Critical to this research is the ongoing use
of advanced computing equipment and collaboration with a number of researchers
in other areas such as a computer graphist. This has resulted in the creation of
a facility for computational mathematics and in the development of tools used in
research in other disciplines and several collaborators.
