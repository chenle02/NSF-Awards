The Infinity Scholars program at Iowa Lakes Community College provides
scholarship assistance to 32 academically talented, financially needy students
enrolled full-time in computer science, computer technology, engineering and
mathematics programs. The overarching goal of the program is to
increase&lt;br/&gt;the number of talented, low-income students enrolled and
retained in these degree programs&lt;br/&gt;enabling them to enter the high
technology workforce. The program establishes and maintains an infrastructure of
support services for Infinity Scholars that includes a one credit hour Infinity
Scholars Course that concludes with the completion of a capstone project. The
Infinity Scholars program focuses on &lt;br/&gt;delivering a menu of educational
services and learning experiences that retain students and support a seamless
transition to job placement upon degree attainment from the community college,
or transfer of students to 4-year institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
