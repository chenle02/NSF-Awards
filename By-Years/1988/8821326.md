The Organic Synthesis Program is supporting the work of Dr. William Wulff.
Wulff, a professor of chemistry at the University of Chicago, is investigating
how metals can be used to develop novel reagents that provide unique methods for
constructing complex organic molecules. Wulff's work is characterized by the
basic new knowledge that results as well as interesting applications to natural
products syntheses. A goal of the work is the development of metal-carbene
complexes that allow for immediate assembly of ring systems. The chemistry of
chromium, molybdenum, tungsten and manganese carbene complexes, and their use in
organic synthesis is the basis for this proposal. New annulation protocols are
being developed which will find application in the construction of polycyclic
systems characteristic of a number of classes of natural products. Included in
these studies are ı2 + 2! and ı3 + 2! cycloaddition reactions. Basic
investigations of the influences of structure, solvent, and metals to the
success of the reactions will be an integral part of this work. Detailed
mechanism analyses will provide the basis for predicting how structural and
electronic features of the metal-carbene complex and the substrate will
influence the scope of the reaction.
