Multilayer coatings can vastly improve the performance of X-ray optical
elements. They have a variety of current applications in scientific and
analytical instruments, and are likely to be useful in X-ray microlithography
systems to make increasingly miniaturized semiconductor devices. A prototype
reactor has been constructed to begin production of multilayers by atomic layer
epitaxy (ALE). Some calculations have been done which indicate that smoother,
thinner layers yielding higher reflectivity at shorter X-ray wavelengths are
possible.
