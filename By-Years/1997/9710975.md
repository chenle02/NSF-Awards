The STW Project is a three-year career information project having the goal of
familiarizing teachers, counselors, and STW coordinators in North Carolina and
Arizona with practical strategies known to engage young women's interest in
science, engineering and mathematics. The project will use a systems approach to
saturate the two states education systems via Internet, television, workshops
and other activities supported by the State Departments of Public Instruction
Offices of Equity and STW. Project activities will emphasis skills necessary for
trade and technical occupations as well as occupations requiring college
degrees. A one - hour training video on SEM: STW and gender equity, along with a
trainers guide and participation manual will be project products.
