The objective of the proposed research is to analyze quanti- tatively the
magnitude of volume diffusion in compositionally zoned garnets and examine the
impact that the process of diffusion has on the determination of pressure-
temperature-time paths for metamorphic rocks from medium-grade terranes.
Specific research goals include 1) development of numerical models to describe
accurately the lattice diffusion of cations in chemically zoned minerals during,
as well as after, growth; 2) measuring the change in P-T trajectories caused by
diffusion during the growth of compositionally zoned garnet; 3) evaluation of
the importance of diffusion to P-T path calculations previously obtained from a
nappe and dome terrane in west-central New Hampshire. The fundamental goal of
this research is to clarify in a meaningful way the conditions under which
pressure-temperature histories can be retrieved from zoned metamorphic
porphyroblasts. In addition, this study will week to improve our understanding
of the effect of volume diffusion on metamorphic parageneses. It is anticipated
that these results will lead to an improved capability for accurately describing
the thermo-tectonic behavior of the crust in orogenic belts.
