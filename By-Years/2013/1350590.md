In modern signal processing, one is frequently faced with statistical inference
problems involving massive datasets. For example, the experiments at the Large
Hadron Collider at CERN generate hundreds of petabytes of data each year, which
must be stored and processed efficiently in order to further our understanding
of particle physics. Similar challenges also arise in seismic monitoring where
massive amounts of data are acquired over large areas via cellphone
accelerometers. Analyzing such large datasets is usually viewed as a substantial
computational challenge. However, if data are a signal processor?s main resource
then access to more data should be viewed as an asset rather than as a burden,
and larger datasets should lead to a reduction in the runtime of data analysis
algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project blends concepts from computer
science and from statistical signal processing to address the challenge with
massive datasets by developing ?algorithm weakening? frameworks in which a data
analysis procedure backs off to simpler methods as the data scale in size,
leveraging the growing inferential strength of the data to ensure that a desired
level of statistical accuracy is achieved with reduced runtime. The approach is
concretely illustrated across a range of statistical estimation tasks, with
convex relaxation techniques playing a prominent role as an algorithm weakening
mechanism. In seeking a precise characterization of the computational and
statistical tradeoffs obtained via convex relaxation, the investigator
formalizes and studies new measures for characterizing the quality of
approximation of one convex set by another. An interesting feature of this
research is that convex relaxations which provide poor performance in
combinatorial optimization problems may nonetheless yield useful solutions when
employed in problems with inferential objectives.
