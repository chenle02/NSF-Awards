The purpose of this project is to better understand the behavior of nearly
inviscid fluids near a boundary. Such behavior has been of interest to engineers
and physicists for at least a hundred years and has been a pressing concern of
mathematicians working in fluids for at least half of that time. There is much
practical knowledge about the boundary behavior, but little precise mathematical
understanding. The proposal is to investigate the boundary behavior of the fluid
in the limited setting of a two dimensional bounded domain, focusing on a disk,
where important aspects of the analysis are simplified, but where the behavior
is still physically relevant. The goal is to strengthen existing partial results
concerning the boundary behavior of the fluid and to attempt to integrate the
partially heuristic methods of engineers and physicists into a mathematical
setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many fluids have reasonably low viscosity and
nearly all fluids are in contact with a boundary. How is the flow of blood
affected by imperfections in vessel walls? How is the lift of a wing determined
by its shape? How do a submarine's propellers induce turbulence when running at
certain speeds? In all of these problems and many more the flow of the fluid can
be constrained by the interaction of the fluid with the boundary in ways that
are currently only partially understood. Almost any progress that can be made in
the understanding of this interaction would ultimately be beneficial in
addressing all of these problems, whether by giving better control on the error
bounds in numerical computations, by giving a qualitative understanding of the
interaction, or even by demonstrating that the boundary behavior is even more
complex than is currently believed.&lt;br/&gt;
