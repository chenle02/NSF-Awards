This project provides scholarships for academically talented students with
financial need to study computer science, engineering, or mathematics at Hope
College, focused on recruitment and retention. The objectives of this project
are to increase the number of students, especially members of minority groups
and women, pursuing majors in computer science, engineering, or mathematics at
Hope College; to increase the retention of students in these majors; and to
attract students to these majors after they arrive at Hope College. The
scholarships continue until the end of the student's fourth year of
undergraduate study as long as the student meets eligibility requirements,
including continuing progress toward a degree in one of the three target
disciplines. Recipients are selected after personal interviews and a review of
their work, and are based on the promise for academic success and potential for
the scholarship to influence the candidate's career
choice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recruiting activities are focused on high schools
in western Michigan with high minority enrollments, and are initiated through
contact with mathematics teachers at those high schools. Retention scholarship
recipients are recruited from among students enrolled in introductory computer
science, engineering, and mathematics courses at Hope College and selection will
be based on nominations from the instructors of those courses. Students
receiving CSEMS scholarships are supported by intensive faculty advising, timely
and appropriate academic assistance, peer mentoring, career counseling and
education, internship and research opportunities, and a program for building
community among all CSEMS scholars.
