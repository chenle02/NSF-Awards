ABSTRACT Rama is an obsolescent Chibchan language of Nicaragua. The goal of this
project is to produce a 2500-entry dictionary by consolidating, correcting,
updating and adding to data already available such as Lehmann (1914),
Diccionario Elemental Rama (Craig, 1987) and the data base produce for a grammar
of Rama (Craig, 1988). The dictionary will include a grammatical sketch. The
entries will include illustrative sentence examples in addition to grammatical,
semantic and cultural information. The dictionary is intended as a model for
future dictionaries of the other indigenous languages of Nicaragua, as a
reference work for general linguists and as a tool for Chibchan comparative
studies.
