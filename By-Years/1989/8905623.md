This is a grant under the Scientific Computing Research Equipment for the
Mathematical Sciences program of the Division of Mathematical Sciences of the
National Science Foundation. This program supports the purchase of special
purpose computing equipment dedicated to the conduct of research in the
mathematical sciences. This equipment is required for several research projects
and would be difficult to justify for one project alone. Support from the
National Science Foundation is coupled with discounts and contributions from
manufacturers and with substantial cost-sharing from the institutions submitting
the proposal. This program is an example of academic, corporate, and government
cooperation in the support of basic research in the mathematical sciences. This
equipment will be used to support three research projects in the Department of
Mathematics at the University of California, San Diego: Computer Explorations in
Algebraic Combinatorics, directed by Adriano Garsia and Jeffrey Remmel; Feasible
Logics for Programming and Proof Systems, directed by Jeffrey Remmel and Samuel
Buss; and Hecke Algebras and Generalized Brauer Algebras, directed by Hans
Wenzl.
