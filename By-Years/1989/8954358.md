Introductory physics teachers are being helped to develop the computing and
laboratory interfacing skills necessary to help their students learn physics by
using the computer in the exploration of real world phenomena. The two week
seminar is being offered for twenty college and university teachers.
Participants remain in contact with one another and with the seminar instructors
via a BITNET teleconference during the academic year after the seminar is
conducted. The topics include: computer interfacing; use of spreadsheet, and
graphing techniques; the application of laboratory interfacing and real time
data analysis to lecture demonstrations; and numerical problem solving and
modeling. The participants home institutions contribute about 15% additional in
providing travel funds for the faculty who are attending the program.
