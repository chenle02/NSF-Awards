9616443 Crane The paleobotanical collections of the field Museum are an
important national and international resource for systematic plant biology. In
the past five years these collections have grown by over 7800 specimens (10%),
and currently total approximately 77,800 specimens. This collection is severely
overcrowded in its current quarters, and many specimens cannot currently be
accommodated within the collection space. The Field Museum has recently
constructed new collections space at a cost of $4.25 million; of this space
1,929 square feet (worth $240,000) have been dedicated to the paleobotanical
collection. The Field Museum is also providing graduate student and summer
intern stipends to match the graduate student stipends and equipment funded by
NSF. The total cost of the project is $550,000, of which the Field Museum has or
will carry 48%, in partnership with the NSF. Once the project is complete, the
paleobotanical collections will be moved into new compactorized storage near the
neontological plant collections, have no backlog (as that will be integrated
into the collections as part of the move), and a detailed description of the
entire collection will be available on the World Wide Web. This project will
also benefit the Field Museum's other fossil collections, as they will be moved
into space vacated by the paleobotanical specimens, thus alleviating
overcrowding in vertebrate and invertebrate paleontology.
