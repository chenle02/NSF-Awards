The Department of Oceanography at Texas A&amp;M University will acquire a new
precision salinometer as a replacement for one that is beyond practical repair.
The device will will be added to a pool of oceanographic instrumentation that is
maintained for use on or in association with the R/V GYRE, a research vessel
that is operated by the University. A substantial part of the ship's operating
schedule has been in support of NSF-sponsored research projects. The
instrumentation will increase the capabilities of the ship and of the University
to support research and engineering activities.
