This study will combine in situ ion microprobe analysis of oxygen isotope ratios
and U-Pb ages on zircon crystals from high pressure metamorphic rocks of the
Franciscan Complex, California. The goals of this study include: establishing
the pressure-temperature-time-fluids (P-T-t-fluid) history of these rocks
before, during and after burial and exhumation; determining the protoliths of
the high pressure metamorphic rocks; improved reliability of geochronology; and
testing competing theories if exhumation for eclogites. Samples will be chosen
from well-known localities in the Franciscan, including Ward Creek, Jenner,
Panoche Pass, and Santa Catalina Island. Analysis will focus on zircons and
associated minerals. Special attention will be paid to intracrystalline isotope
zonation and mineral inclusions. The combination of d18O and age from single
spots in zircon will directly couple timing to fluid and thermal events. Our
preliminary studies have already described and analyzed zircons from eclogite,
blueschist, and amphibolite of the Franciscan, as well as young ocean floor
samples (gabbronorite, plagiogranite, serpentinite) that may represent
protoliths to high pressure rocks. Analysis of d18O will employ the new Cameca
1280 ion microprobe at the University of Wisconsin. Analysis of U-Pb age and
REEs will employ the Stanford/USGS SHRIMP-RG. Ion microprobe analysis will be
made using zircon crystals both in thin section and in grain mounts that have
been petrologically studied for inclusions and coexisting minerals; and imaged
by optics, BSE, CL, and X-rays. The broader impacts of this research include
post-graduate training and installation of the new Wisconsin ion microprobe lab,
which will also be employed in other studies related to societal problems such
as environmental remediation, paleoclimatology, CO2 sequestration, and
nutrition.
