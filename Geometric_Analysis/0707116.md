This project proposes to use the theory of geodesic currents to study links
between the theory of hyperbolic manifolds, rational dynamics and number theory.
The project consists of three themes. The first theme is to study metric
structures introduced by the PI and Taylor, on Teichmuller space and
quasifuchsian space. These structures generalize the classical Weil-Petersson
metric on Teichmuller space to quasifuchsian space. In recent related work,
McMullen has defined a Weil-Petterson type metric on the moduli of certain
dynamical systems, thereby adding another entry to the Sullivan dictionary
between hyperbolic geometry and the dynamics of rational maps. The second theme
is to study measures introduced by the PI and Dumas, arising from considering
the intersection of a ``random geodesic'' with a geodesic laminations on a
hyperbolic surface. The measures give the distribution of lengths of geodesic
arcs in the complement of the geodesic lamination and are explicitly given by
the image of the volume measure on the unit tangent bundle of the surface under
a certain measurable real map. These measures closely resemble the Sato-Tate
measures studied in number theory and the theory of L-functions which arise by
taking the image of Haar volume measure under a real representation. The third
theme is to study the torsion of a quasifuchsian manifold. This invariant is the
imaginary part of the complex length of the Patterson-Sullivan measure and is a
natural invariant to measure the average ``twistedness'' of a quasifuchsian
group and an be thought of as a Chern-Simons invariant for quasifuchsian
manifolds. In particular, the PI would like to describe how the torsion changes
under bending deformations.

This project lies at the intersection of hyperbolic geometry, dynamics and
number theory. In each of these areas, natural spaces arise, called Moduli
spaces, which describe the possible deformations of a given object. In the case
where the object is a hyperbolic surface, the space we consider is the space of
all hyperbolic geometries on the surface, called Teichmuller space. We propose
to study these Moduli spaces by considering geometric invariants arising from
geodesic currents on the objects. These geodesic currents are uniformly random
paths on the objects. In the case of the hyperbolic surface we consider the
Liouville geodesic current associated with a given surface. By measuring the
variation of the length of the Liouville geodesic current as we move around in
Teichmuller space, we obtain important geometric information about the surface.
By studying these invariants, we hope to elucidate our understanding of the
three areas and the connections between them.
