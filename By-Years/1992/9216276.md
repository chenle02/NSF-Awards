The Estuarine Research Federation, the nation's leading scientific society for
estuarine scientists, managers and educators, and the Estuarine and Coastal
Sciences Association (ECSA), the leading European estuarine society, will hold a
joint international estuarine meeting on Sept, 13-18, 1992, in Plymouth,
England. This meeting is significant in that it brings together for the first
time the two major estuarine societies in the world to discuss the most
significant problems facing estuaries and coastal areas from both the science
and management viewpoint. The theme of the conference is "changes in fluxes to
estuaries: Implications from science to management." This award will help to
augment participation by US scientists. This award is made to the Sea Grant
Program and will be combined with funds from that agency to support the meeting.
