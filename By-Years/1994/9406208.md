9406208 Davis The Colorado Plateau is a large area of relatively undeformed rock
that nevertheless was distal to a series of tectonic stress patterns during
Sevier, Laramide and Tertiary time. The plateau stratigraphy is rich in porous
sandstones in which deformation bands form with strains as small as 0.1%.
Because these are work- hardening features, successive deformations are likely
to form new sets of deformation bands rather than extensively reactivate old
ones. This project will map deformation bands in suitable lithologies and
related them to large features (faults) of known age. After spatial
correlations, the stress orientations implied by the deformation bands will be
inverted from band orientations and a set of paleostress patterns for the
Colorado Plateau produced. Results should provide a much better understanding of
the directions, magnitude and degree of localization of stress of these events
in the Colorado Plateau.
