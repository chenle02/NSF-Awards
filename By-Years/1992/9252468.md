The project is adapting the University of Connecticut computer integrated
calculus program to high school calculus courses under the University's High
School Cooperative Calculus Program. University of Connecticut faculty and
graduate students, and teachers from thirteen Connecticut high schools will work
together to rewrite materials, present these materials at summer workshops, and
coordinate pilot testing of the materials. Revisions based on the pilot testing
will be made, and full scale field testing implemented. Student performance in
high school as well as subsequent performance at the University will be
carefully tracked.
