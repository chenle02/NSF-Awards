This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project will transition an
innovative 1-5 kW energy generating system from the University of Michigan (UM)
Marine Renewable Energy Laboratory (MRELab) towards the commercial market place.
The system is based on a system of cylinders that are made to oscillate by water
currents at velocities as low as 1-2 knots (water turbines require 5-7 knots).
It is through this mechanism that the converter harvests the hydrokinetic
energy.

This project, if successful, will yield a new means of harvesting energy from
low velocity currents. Additionally, this system is believed to have fewer
impacts on aquatic wildlife than turbine based systems.
