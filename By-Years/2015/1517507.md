Title: Biological physics of DNA bending

DNA is one of the essential molecules of life, carrying the genetic information
of a cell. The mechanical properties of DNA are related to the ability of
different protein complexes to bind to DNA, and control gene expression and DNA
repair. Understanding DNA mechanics, especially at short length scales, ends up
being more complicated than the mechanics of more classic materials such as an
elastic rod, given the double-helical nature and inhomogeneous building blocks
of DNA. This research will produce physical insights that will advance our
understanding of the relationship between DNA mechanics and several important
DNA-related biological processes. In this project, the PI will investigate how
sharp DNA bending promotes tight packaging of the genome, local defects in the
double helix, and protein transport between DNA sites, all features that have
implications on gene expression and DNA repair. The PI will train undergraduates
in his lab and offer scientific demonstrations to K-12 students.

Despite the current atomistic-level knowledge of DNA structure, conformational
changes and fluctuations of DNA at short length scales are not trivial to
understand. Especially, spontaneous looping of DNA is highly sensitive to
sequence, intrinsic curvature, and length scale. In this project, the PI will
investigate how biophysics of spontaneous DNA looping impacts DNA-protein
interactions. In the first aim, the PI will measure stability of small DNA loops
as a function of nucleosome preference. This aim will address whether the
sequence rule of nucleosome formation can be better understood from DNA
mechanics in the strong bending regime. In the second aim, the PI will measure
stability of small DNA loops with and without highly meltable regions. This aim
will address whether strong DNA bending can enhance local melting of duplex DNA.
In the third aim, the PI will measure association and dissociation kinetics of
DNA binding proteins in various DNA constructs. This aim will address whether
DNA looping can facilitate protein transfer. The PI will use single-molecule
fluorescence techniques and coarse-grained DNA models to conduct this research.
