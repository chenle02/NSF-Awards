This project will support the visit of twelve young Russian polymer scientists
to meet their counterparts in the United States. During the period August 23-28,
1992, the Russians will attend the national meeting of the American Chemical
Society in Washington, DC. They will present posters and generally interact with
their American colleagues. From August 28-31, 1992, discussions will continue in
the form of a small workshop in which about twelve young American professors
with similar expertise will participate. This program will introduce the
Russians to American science and will enable Americans to develop ties to the
new generation of Russian scientists. This project in polymer chemistry fulfills
the program objectives of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling young
experts in the US and Russia to combine complementary efforts and capabilities
in areas of strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of equality,
reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.
