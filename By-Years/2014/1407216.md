The goals of this project are to modernize and integrate the undergraduate and
graduate curricula in the three Departments of Mathematics, Statistics, and
Computer Science so as to better prepare undergraduate students to study and
work effectively in the information age, and to foster research collaboration
among faculty and undergraduate students across disciplinary lines within and
beyond the quantitative sciences. The prospective new degree in Data Science
will be crowned by a capstone course that will contain research projects
involving scientifically important problems and use the latest Big Data
techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The holders of the new degree will be capable
to work on problems at the frontiers of science that require the integration of
large-scale simulation of partial differential equations and other mathematical
constructs, data capture and statistical analysis, and high performance
computing to provide accurate, reliable, and useful forecasts and descriptions.
