This program will study the mass distribution within 100 megapar- secs of our
galaxy - out to about 300 million light years dis- tance. This will be done by
mapping the velocities of galaxies and clusters of galaxies, and then trying to
understand the velocity field in terms of a model in which galaxies are acceler-
ated by the gravitation of all the other galaxies in this volume. This will, in
turn, help us to learn about the background density on which the visible galaxy
clusters and voids are superposed.
