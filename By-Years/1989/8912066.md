A workshop will be held to discuss current and future directions zooplankton
research. Approximately 40 participants will be chosen to maximize the diversity
of ideas, approaches, taxonomic expertise, and disciplines represented at the
workshop. The major goal of this meeting will be to create an interdisciplinary
framework for the diversity of current and future research in zooplankton
biology. Motivation for this workshop stems from a recognition that zooplankton
research is of major practical importance to our understanding and management of
lakes and oceans. In addition, this research is of significant value to general
questions (basic research) in organismal and population biology. This workshop
will be a first attempt to conceptually synthesize these goals, and hence broad
perspective for a field experiencing rapid specialization. Results from the
workshop will be published in two forms: a condensed version will be submitted
to the ESA bulletin, and a more complete version will appear as a book.
