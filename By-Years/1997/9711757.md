Duster and Shiao 9711757 This dissertation examines how philanthropic
foundations contributed to the development of racial and ethnic projects in the
nonprofit sector from 1960 through 1990. The research proposes that the
development of racial and ethnic concerns should be understood as a political
process regularly channeled by philanthropic interventions. The independent
contribution that foundations make to the nonprofit sector results from their
relative autonomy from government and thri cohesiveness as a field of
organizations. This research will first trace the history of foundation
involvement in support of work concerned with race and ethnicity, then will
examine the development of community foundation activities in two cities,
Cleveland and San Francisco. ***
