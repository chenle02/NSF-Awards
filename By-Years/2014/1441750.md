Ensuring a high level of security and reliability in the electronic computing
devices is a significant challenge. Central issues include secure and reliable
identification, authentication and integrity checking of underlying hardware.
Hardware-based security primitives such as physical unclonable functions (PUFs)
are still a work-in-progress in terms of the cost they require to guarantee
reliable operation and their resistance to physical attacks. This project
investigates security primitives suitable for high volume production where the
allowable costs for design, integration, and testing of hardware security
primitives are low. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The techniques developed in
this project utilize existing resources in the memory hierarchy to cover
multiple hardware security primitives all at once. This project also verifies
the effectiveness, cost, and attack vulnerabilities of the proposed primitives
and techniques through extensive experiments on multiple test platforms. The
benefits for society include more trustworthy, reliable, and secure verification
of electronics for healthcare and dependable computing platforms for
intelligence, financial transactions, energy, and military systems.
