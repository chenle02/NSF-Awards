We are to developing a number of new experiments for the senior-year
undergraduate Solid State Physics Laboratory course with the transmission
electron microscope (TEM) they have acquired with ILI grant funds. Such an
instrument did not previously exist in the Physics Department and this did not
permit the inclusion of microstructural studies in the teaching laboratory
curriculum. The provision of the TEM allows laboratory instructors to emphasize
the importance of the relationship between lattice structure and electronic
properties in the solid state of matter. The experiments demonstrate a number of
important phenomena in modern solid state physics including atomic lattice
imaging, quantum interference of electrons, charge density waves, and quasi-
crystal diffraction. The instrument is being used in both imaging and reciprocal
space modes and is available also for Modern Physics course demonstrations of
the wave nature of electrons and atomic structure. The equipment, in addition,
is available for undergraduate research projects in solid state physics. A
laboratory manual and resource book is being written to make the new experiments
accessible to other undergraduate programs.
