Research will be carried out in experimental nuclear physics. The central
activity is a series of experiments designed to determine the charge
distribution of the neutron. The experiments will be carried out at the
MIT/Bates laboratory and at CEBAF. The unique aspect of these experiments is
detection of polarized neutrons which are knocked out of a deuterium target by a
polarized electron beam. A specialized neutron detector will be used to measure
the neutron polarization by determining the asymmetry of neutrons scattered from
a carbon analyzer, a secondary scattering experiment. These measurements will
provide important constraints to largely unconstrained theories of the charge
and magnetic structure of the nucleon. The proposed measurements are among the
highest priority experiments within contemporary nuclear physics. Graduate
students are involved in all phases of the experiment.
