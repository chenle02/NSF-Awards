Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;There are currently no compact, short-pulse (&lt;
10 ps) mid-IR laser sources. The proposed research will investigate the
suppression of spatial hole burning as a means to achieve a self-starting,
short-pulse quantum cascade laser (QCL) source. The PI will analyze the
parameter range that would achieve stable operation, based on a conceptual gain
structure. This simulation will yield a deeper understanding of the physics of
coherence in such engineered structures. Preliminary concepts of the structure,
derived from earlier concepts that achieved pulsing, but that could not self-
start, were recently developed by the PI. The device would be based on the
concept of interleaved gain and quantum coherent absorbing periods, which can be
fabricated during controlled growth of the QCL laser structure. This
interleaving should achieve suppression of deleterious continuous waves and
favor stable pulsed operation. The quantum coherent absorption is expected to
provide robust mode-locking of the laser source as drive parameters are
varied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impact:&lt;br/&gt;This exploratory research will set the design space for a new
pulsed QCL structure, which is a needed tool for multiple medical and sensing
applications. Indeed many species of interest have strong spectral signatures in
the mid infrared. This timely research will also be a good platform for student
training. Additionally, this effort will leverage the NSF MIRTHE Center,
centered in Princeton University, which develops QCLs and explores their
applications; the MIRTHE center has the necessary equipment to experimentally
verify the theoretical results obtained under this proposal.
