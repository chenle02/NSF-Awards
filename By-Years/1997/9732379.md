Morse theory and catastrophe theory provide powerful models of the neighborhood
of a critical point of a real function. Under suitable conditions these models
are in fact capable of discerning the topological type of the domain of the
function. This project extends software that finds and tracks critical points to
guarantee the topological type of an implicit surface polygonization, and
applies it to other areas of computer graphics. These techniques can solve a
variety of currently open problems of computer graphics. The most immediate
application is a topologically-correct implicit curve parameterization. The
techniques can aid in the visualization of complicated manifold immersions by
providing the ability to switch between surface renderings and 2-D slices on and
between Morse critical values of a height function. The techniques can maintain
the topological type of a shape during transformation, such that for example the
intermediate shapes in the transformation of a donut into a coffee cup all
consist of a single component with one hole. Modeling the neighborhood of a
critical point should also aid in maintaining a consistent texture mapping
across a change of genus. Incorporating critical points in a data compression
algorithm yields a data compression that avoids errors that alter the
topological type of the reconstructed data. Similar techniques can insure that
the simplification of complex geometry for faster display does not sacrifice the
qualitative nature of its topological type. Finally, the application of
catastrophe theory to global illumination will yield a faster algorithm for
determining regions of caustic reflection.
