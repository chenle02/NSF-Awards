The goal of this research is to implement a new model for programming
scientific computations on distributed memory multiprocessors, called lattice
parallelism (LP). LP is intended for scientific methods that locally concentrate
computational effort non-uniformly and unpredictably, for example, adaptive mesh
methods. It provides high-level operations to hide the low-level details of
dynamically manipulating elaborate, dynamic data structures. The objectives of
the research are to gain a better understanding of lattice parallelism under
realistic conditions; to apply it to scientific applications, and to explore
run-time optimization techniques. The implementation and evaluation of LP will
be carried out on the Intel iPSC/860, running a variety of application codes at
our disposal. A novel feature of lattice parallelism is that it exploits the
tightly coupled local structure present in non-uniform calculations and so
avoids high communication overheads. This is significant in light of the
ultimate emergence of massively parallel distributed memory multiprocessors,
which are especially sensitive to the effects of communication overhead. This
research will result in the development of a software tool for reducing the
effort required to parallelize full scale numerical software by an order of
magnitude or better.//
