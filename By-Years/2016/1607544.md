The connection between the quantum world controlled by microscopic forces and
the macroscopic world that dominates our everyday lives is not well understood.
Macroscopic systems exhibit universal behavior that cannot depend sensitively on
microscopic details, but is believed to be subject to powerful and general
principles of organization. Universal behavior is seen in a variety of systems
of interest across many branches of physics including the quark-gluon plasma of
the early universe, high temperature superconductivity and ultracold Fermi gases
in the laboratory. In this project, the P.I. will investigate the emergence of
these powerful forces that give rise to the collective behavior of macroscopic
systems. The plan is to perform a systematic study of properties as a function
of system size, focusing on an intermediate regime called the mesoscopic region
where quantum mechanics and classical mechanics merge. Both undergraduate and
graduate students will participate fully in this research, including
communicating the results through papers and talks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
scientific goal of this study is to elucidate the driving forces behind this
emerging universal behavior and to propose new ways to observe and control this
behavior in the laboratory. In the last decade, the atomic physics community has
taken advantage of cooling and trapping techniques to create and control finite-
size systems of ultracold gases that exhibit universal properties. This work
will focus on Fermi gases and utilize a perturbation method that yields exact
first-order results for all system sizes simultaneously. By studying trends as a
function of system size for properties such as excitation frequencies and
thermodynamic quantities recently measured in the laboratory, the goal is to
uncover signatures of emerging collective behavior in order to understand the
dynamics of this fundamental transition.
