Nuptial food gifts are food items given by males to females at copulation and
are an integral feature of the mating systems of a wide variety of insects. A
recent hypothesis suggests that nuptial food gifts are not ?gifts? at all, but
devices by which males exploit their access to female physiology to manipulate
females in ways beneficial to males, but harmful to females. This hypothesis
predicts that the chemical composition of nuptial food gifts should be shaped by
the divergent interests of males and females. The hypothesis will be tested in a
cricket species in which males offer females a gelatinous mass forming part of
the male?s spermatophore and consumed by the female after mating. Using an
integrated series of biochemical analyses and behavioral assays, the substances
that influence the palatability of gifts and their influence on female mating
receptivity will be identified, and specially-constructed synthetic ?gels? will
be used to probe the effect of specific compounds on female behavior. These
studies may lead to the identification of male-derived accessory-gland
substances that inhibit female mating behavior, which ultimately could furnish a
safe, but effective means of biological control of insect pest
species.&lt;br/&gt; The PI and his graduate students participate in multiple
outreach programs, including programs involving high school students in
research, enhancement of elementary school teachers? training in science, and
efforts to enhance the science curriculum in middle and high schools (e.g., Bugs
for Kids). The proposed research will provide excellent opportunities to enhance
the research experiences and professional development of a number of
undergraduate and graduate students. The proposed research also facilitates a
6-week summer research student internship in the U.K. in each of the three years
of the project, working with one of the world?s foremost authorities on the
evolutionary genetics of insect reproductive behavior.
