&lt;br/&gt;Underwater acoustic communication presents severe challenges that are
significantly different from the challenges of terrestrial electromagnetic
communications. The low speed of sound and limited bandwidth and the ocean's
motion due to waves, currents, and tides lead to large delay spread, frequency-
dependent Doppler shift, and high time variability of the channel. The approach
used in this research is to directly perform data detection without first
equalizing the received signal. The research tasks are to: (i) design a
statistical detector, based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques, for
the underwater acoustic channel with goals of high performance and low
complexity; and (ii) develop signal processing algorithms for adaptive
identification and tracking of the underwater acoustic channel. Measured
experimental data provided by collaborators are used to validate and evaluate
the techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With respect to intellectual merit, the
research seeks to develop and evaluate novel low-complexity statistical
detection methods for underwater acoustic channels, with the goal of approaching
the performance of the optimal maximum-likelihood sequence estimation (MLSE). If
successful, the technique could significantly reduce inter-symbol interference
in underwater acoustic channels and would be more robust under highly variable
channel conditions in comparison to existing methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With
respect to broader impacts, the proposed research has the potential to transform
the design of next-generation acoustic modems. Such acoustic modems are used for
scientific applications, such as oceanography and environmental monitoring, and
security applications, such as port monitoring. The project also introduces
related research experiences in Signals and Systems, Digital Signal Processing,
Coding, Software Radio, and Digital Communication courses.
