9724492 Simpson This award provides partial funding (70%) for the acquisition of
a mass storage system to be installed and operated in the Data Management Center
(DMC) of the Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS). The IRIS
consortium is committed to providing the remaining funds necessary for the
acquisition of the mass storage system. IRIS is a consortium of 87 U.S. research
universities with major programs in seismology. The IRIS DMC is responsible for
the collection, quality control, and distribution of data collected by a
globally distributed network of permanently installed seismographs and by a pool
of portable seismographs deployed for shorter periods of time to solve specific
regional problems in geophysics. The DMC services a very substantial fraction of
the world-wide community in seismology in its need for access to reliable data
to be applied to research in earthquakes and the dynamics and structure of the
Earth's deep interior. In addition, the DMC also acts as a collection center for
data collected under the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) monitoring
activity. The data storage needs of the DMC are very large. Current storage is
approaching the 3 terabyte range, and there is an urgent need to replace the
current obsolete system with a new storage system. ***
