The PI proposes to make use of the facilities of the Radial Jet Reattachment
Laboratory to perform exploratory studies on non-steady submerged radial jet
impingement heat transfer. Prior studies by the PI on steady radial jet
impingement resulted in very high heat transfer rates. Studies of non- steady
non-radial jets by other investigators have demonstrated enhanced heat transfer
performance. There is thus a good possibility that a non-steady radial jet may
also offer enhanced heat transfer performance compared to conventional jets and
steady radial jets.
