This Cross-disciplinary Small Grant Exploratory Research program will
demonstrate prototypical 3-D tera-scale networks of semiconductor nanocrystals
that are interconnected by conducting chain-like biomolecules through efficient
self-assembly techniques. Electrical measurements of the conductivities of these
tera-scale networks will be made for different levels of molecular
interconnects. If successful, the results of these studies will potentially
establish the basis for new approaches to 3-D massive integration of nano-scale
semiconducting elements. Specifically, the success of this effort will lead to
demonstrations of bio-hybrid structures based on conducting biomolecular
interconnects, and radical concepts for directed/self-assembly of interconnected
3-D networks of &gt;&gt; 1012 nano-scale semiconducting elements. We plan to
demonstrate that chain-like biomolecules may be used as electrical interconnects
between 3-D nano-scale semiconductors in tera-scale 3-D networks. In addition,
biomolecules will be used to establish interconnects between these networks and
metallic contacts, and the conductivity of these interconnected networks ---
with ~1013 nano-scale semiconductor elements per mm3 --- will be measured. In
order to accomplish these goals, the investigators will apply their existing
models, characterization tools, and techniques for synthesizing suspensions of
semiconductor nanocrystals, and designing biomolecules that bind to
semiconductors and nanostructures. While there may been many reports of
chemically directed assembly, the approach here with the use of chain-like
biomolecules as electrically conducting interconnects between nano-scale
semiconductors and between nano-scale semiconductors and metallic structures
will be in both understanding the fundamental aspects of the electrical
properties of such structures as well as the possibilities and limitations of
scaling this to large 3D structures.
