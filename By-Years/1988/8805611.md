Adaptive control theory lacks a conceptual framework which is sufficiently
simple to help qualified nonspecialists to understand the current theory without
making an inordinately large time investment and which might also serve as the
basis for further development. PI proposes to continue his recently initiated
research program aimed at constructing such a framework. Existing adaptive
algorithms of 'practical' structure for which 'global' stability can be proved
without requiring sufficient excitation are only applicable to process models
satisfying assumptions which recent results suggest are unnecessarily
restrictive. The reason for this seems to be related to the reliance of these
algorithms on an augmented error for parameter tuning. He proposes to develop
algorithms which can adaptively stabilize processes under assumptions weaker
than those presently required. His approach will be to use indirect control
concepts, since error augmentation is not needed using this approach. He will
use computer simulation experiments to rule out unacceptable algorithms and to
guide him in the development of acceptable ones.
