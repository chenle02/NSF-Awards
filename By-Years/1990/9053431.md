Calculus students at many institutions are benefiting from integrated
supplements: labs exercises, projects, problems, and software packages. The lab
exercises are modelled after a typical chemistry or physics lab, projects
involve the student discovering and conjecturing results, and problems are
challenging and realistic. The software packages provide materials and
facilities and run on MS-DOS or Apple Macintosh machines.
