This project is the continuation of the maintenance and development of the RIDGE
Petrologic Database (PetDB), which currently contains and serves over the
internet the complete published geochemical dataset for sub-oceanic rocks and
minerals generated at mid-ocean ridges. Technical aspects of the database will
be transferred to a professional database environment, the database will be
updated with all newly published data, development will be continued, and the
database will be mined for second-order products that are of use to the broad
community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
