Mixed convection in porous channels has been numerically simulated to
investigate the inverse relation between Nusselt number and Rayleigh number when
the forced flow opposes the buoyancy. The viscous term has been found to
influence the results to a much greater degree than the inertial term. Support
is being provided to review mixed flow in porous flows in general, and these
results in particular, at the International Center for Heat and Mass Transfer in
Dubrovnik, Yugoslavia. The seminar to be presented is aimed at documenving
recent advances in the fundamentals of mixed convection in porous media and
their applications. The intent is to provide the heat transfer community with a
reference work that will complement the Proceedings of the 1990 NATO Advanced
Study Institute held in Izmir.
