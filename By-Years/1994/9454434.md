The theme of our program is particle simulation. In order to solve physical
problems, we will include: The computer science, applied math and physical
science necessary to perform state-of-the-art simulations on massively parallel
computers. The creation of tools to use parallel computers to drive
visualization engines. Integration of simulation with experimentation. For large
experimental projects, simulations are key to their planning and interpretation.
By concentrating on a single computational theme, we will build a cohesive
program spanning several departments. The training program will be jointly
administered by Astronomy, Chemistry and Computer Science. Our program has the
following key features: It is a cohesive multidisciplinary program with a formal
mechanism of joint supervision of students between departments. We will train
scientists and engineers in the use of high performance computers for
simulation, analysis and visualization. We have arranged summer internships at
government labs and in industry. We propose a specific program of action to
improve the number of women and minorities in our program until it reflects the
diversity of the US population.
