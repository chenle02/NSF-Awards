9413498 Beebe This Academic Research Infrastructure (Instrumentation) Program
award is for the partial support for acquiring a versatile Surface Analysis
System. Twenty-eight faculty, approximately 62 graduate students and numerous
post-doctoral students will utilize this equipment. Research in advanced
materials and processing, in the biotechnology of surfaces, in the environmental
issues of surfaces and in combinations of these areas will be conducted with
this facility. In addition to the research that this instrument will primarily
support, there are parallel uses in the research training of both graduate and
undergraduate students. ***
