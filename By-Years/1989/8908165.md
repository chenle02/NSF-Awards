Within the framework of the joint U.S.-Japan masonry research program, the
specific objective of the U.S. program is to develop an experimentally verified
design and analysis methodology that will ensure satisfactory performance of
reinforced masonry buildings under a wide range of seismic loadings. In
particular, under severe earthquake loadings such buildings must exhibit ductile
behavior. A key aspect of the philosophy adopted by the U.S. program is to
support the design and analysis development by an increasingly complex set of
experiments culminating with the study of a five-story full-scale masonry
building. This experiment is essential to achieve the objectives of the program
in that it will provide the final validation of the analytical and computational
models developed, and thus will form the basis for the design recommendations to
be made at the culmination of the overall project. This research project is a
full-scale building test conducted at the Charles Lee Powell Structural Systems
Laboratory at the San Diego campus of the University of California. The
experiment is performed using a reaction wall concept, in which the building is
subjected to generated displacement histories at the floor levels via hydraulic
actuators in a manner that simulates the displacements during an actual seismic
event.
