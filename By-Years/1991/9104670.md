This is a project to develop algorithms for nonlinear programming, particularly
problems with many variables, with an emphasis on algorithms suitable for
parallel computers. The focus is on Newton-like methods. The research is
motivated by earlier success in developing algorithms and software for parallel
unconstrained optimization. The research is primarily aimed at methods suitable
for coarse-grained parallel computers, where each processor is itself moderately
powerful. This includes existing machines such as the Intel iPSC hypercube and
the Sequent parallel computers. Large-scale nonlinear programming problems arise
frequently in industrial, economic, and military applications, however nonlinear
models can be difficult to solve. This research aims to produce easy-to-use,
general purpose algorithms (and software) that will make available the power of
parallel computers to the users of nonlinear models, extending the range of
nonlinear programming as a day-to-day modelling tool.//
