9321733 Davis This award is for support for a project to refine the glacial
chronology on southern Baffin Island by determining cosmogenic exposure ages of
polished and striated bedrock surfaces and morainal boulders. In order to
estimate the timing of deglaciation, the Beryllium-10 and Aluminum-26 in quartz
separates from: 1) polished and striated bedrock surfaces on valley bottoms and
along fjord sidewalls, and 2) boulders on nested sets of moraines will be
measured. Preliminary results suggest that deglaciation in the Pangnirtung area
of southern Baffin Island occurred around 7,500 years ago. This work will
provide information to help resolve a long-standing controversy in Quaternary
science involving the extent of ice sheets in the eastern Canadian Arctic during
the late Wisconsinan. ***
