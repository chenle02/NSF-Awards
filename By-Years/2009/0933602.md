Many species migrate, using habitats in different locations during different
parts of the year. Many bird species, for example, breed during the summer
months at higher latitudes and spend winters at lower latitudes. Modeling the
dynamics of migratory species is complicated by the fact that growth, survival,
and reproduction may be very different in each location, and existing population
models are not well suited for migratory species. This project will develop
models based on graph theory that are appropriate for migratory species, and
then use data for Tree Swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) to parameterize those
models. Stable isotopes of hydrogen and strontium, measured in feathers of birds
collected in their winter habitats, will be matched against maps of isotope
abundances across North America, providing information about where individual
birds lived during the summer breeding season. Broader impacts of this project
will include training of undergraduate and graduate students, and development of
models that may inform conservation planning efforts for migratory species.
