This research investigates financial incentives in publicly provided health care
in third projects. The first two projects study how to design health insurance
markets to provide insurance plans with incentives to raise quality and reduce
costs.Â Specifically, the investigator examines market distortions -- such as
adverse selection and market power -- and potential corrective policies in the
Medicare Advantage (MA) and Affordable Care Act (ACA) markets. The third project
studies how to design financial incentives for medical providers to efficiently
supply health care, focusing on the case of Medicare payments for Long Term Care
Hospitals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research uses rich micro-data and quasi-
experimental variation in contract terms. The first project on MA uses costs and
utilization data from State Inpatient Databases and mortality data from the
Medicare denominator file. The investigator further exploits difference-in-
differences variations in MA coverage generated by the Benefits Improvement and
Protection Act of 2000 and studies the utilization and mortality effects of MA
coverage. The second project on the ACA markets estimates the degree of
selection using claims-level data from the Health Care Cost Institute and
research designs that exploit (i) the variation in enrollment stemming from the
heterogeneous effect of the ACA across geographic areas and age groups, and (ii)
the variation in premiums caused by idiosyncrasies in the age-rating formula.
The third project on provider incentives exploits a large "jump" in payments to
Long Term Care Hospitals to estimate the effect of financial incentives on
patient treatment patterns, government costs, and patient health using Medicare
claims data. Using this variation, the investigator estimates a dynamic model of
provider behavior to quantify the importance of financial incentives and
estimate the consequences of counterfactual financial contracts.
