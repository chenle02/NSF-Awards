Knowledge Domain Visualizations (KDVs) are a special kind of Information
Visualizations (IVs) that exploit powerful human vision and spatial cognition to
help humans mentally organize and electronically access and manage large,
complex information spaces. Unlike scientific visualizations, KDVs are created
from data that have no spatial reference, such as publications, patents, or
grants.&lt;br/&gt;The research component of this project comprises the setup of
an advanced, open architecture, computing infrastructure for KDV education and
research as well as the development and comprehensive evaluation of algorithms
for incremental and scalable data analysis, dimensionality reduction, and
spatial layout. Cartographic principles are employed to facilitate the use of
skills traditionally associated with geographic maps for the exploration of
KDVs. &lt;br/&gt;The education plan includes the development of an Information
Visualization Data and Software Repository that together with associated
Learning Modules provides public access to and training for existing and newly
developed IV and KDV software. The value of KDVs for educational purposes, e.g.,
to equip students with a "big picture" or global view of teaching material, is
explored.&lt;br/&gt;The project will make KDVs available as a new information
access and management tool that has the potential to dramatically improve the
communication of scientific results for students, researchers, agencies, R&amp;D
managers, industry, data providers, and society; (2) create an advanced
computing infrastructure for IV/KDV researchers to contribute, run, and compare
new and existing algorithms on diverse data sets; and (3) improve IV/KDV
teaching, training and learning by means of an online IV/KDV repository,
associated learning modules, as well as a textbook. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Web
