Modern software applications need results to be computed quickly as a matter of
practicality, system safety or even security. Unfortunately, CPU speeds
themselves are no longer increasing as they used to and hardware companies,
instead, offer multicore CPUs. This poses a classical, but notoriously difficult
problem: how to divide software programs into multiple interoperating tasks,
that can execute concurrently, without stepping on each others' feet. It is
well-known that data structure "commutativity" is one route to concurrency.
Intuitively, two data-structure operations commute, provided that they can be
executed in either order. In this way, commutativity characterizes the
independence of program fragments. In recent years, researchers have shown that
this can enable concurrency in contexts such as transactional memory, optimistic
concurrency, runtime systems and parallelizing compilers. However, it remains an
open question as to how to safely extract commutativity information from source
code.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is developing techniques to
automatically verify and even synthesize commutativity from source code.
Further, this commutativity is employed (integrated with so-called
linearizability) in a new parallelizing compiler and transactional object
system. These new tools enable programmers to focus on writing correct
sequential programs, and yet automatically exploit multicore architectures. The
impacts of this work include advances in mathematical foundations, algorithms,
symbolic program analysis, compilers and runtime systems. The project also
involves engagement with students through multiple tiers of education - ranging
from pre-college math students to summer school modules - and outreach aimed at
broadening participation of underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
