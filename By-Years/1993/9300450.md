New models of lithosperic accretion at mid-ocean ridges views the process as
driven primarily by the nature of mantle flow beneath the ridge axis and the
variable thermal and mechanical properties of the lithosphere forming along the
ridge segment. These models make specific predictions about how crustal
thickness should vary along-axis and between segments with different gravity
signatures. The goal of this study is to test these predictions using a series
of seismic refraction experiments at three spreading segments characterized by
different amounts of magmatism and amagmatic extension.
