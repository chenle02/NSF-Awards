The investigator and his colleagues organize a workshop on algorithms and
parallel implementations for macromolecular dynamics, protein folding, and
structure refinement, including the modeling of quantum effects. The emphasis is
on numerical and algorithmic challenges to achieving dramatic gains in the
performance of software for protein and polymer simulations. This workshop
brings together mathematicians, computer scientists, chemists, and biologists
seeking dramatic gains in the performance of software for protein and polymer
simulations. Molecular dynamics has contributed to the understanding of many
physical, chemical, and biological phenomena, and is now a standard tool of the
pharmaceutical industry. With improvements in technology, larger and more
complex biological molecules have been analyzed, but there are substantial
barriers to the next phase of computer simulation: the analysis of proteins,
DNA, and other polymers on millisecond time scales. These challenges can only be
overcome with a strong interdisciplinary effort. The aim of this workshop is to
improve the flow of ideas between disciplines and to focus on the latest
breakthroughs.
