Fluids and fluid flow are important parameters in the deformation of
accretionary prisms and in the formation of melanges. Stratigraphically
controlled fluid pathways are destroyed early in the evolution of accretionary
prisms and therefore fault-zone melanges, with their associated fracture
permeability, must be important during the long-term fluid loss in accretionary
prisms. This study will utilize melange zones in the developing accretionary
complex of the Olympic Peninsula, Washington. These melanges are currently
leaking hydrocarbon rich fluids and include cements and veins that attest to
their role as paleo-fluid conduits. Results of various types of data will be
applied to the goal of defining the nature and variation of fluid flow and
composition, its interrelationship with the structural history, and the affects
of both on the thermal evolution of an accretionary complex.
