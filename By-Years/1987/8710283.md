A new function for sphingosine and other long-chain bases has recently been
discovered: in addition to serving as the backbones of sphingolipids, they also
serve as inhibitors of protein kinase C. The goal of this project is to test the
hypothesis that the cellular effects of long-chain bases depends on the precise
structural requirements of several steps in their utilization, including: (1)
the solution behavior of the molecules, including their association with
proteins in the culture media; (2) the rate of cellular uptake and movement
among cellular membranes; (3) the extent and course of metabolism within the
cell; and (4) the interaction of the sphingosines with protein kinase C. To
approach these issues, long-chain bases analogues will be synthesized. The
structural specificity of protein kinase C inhibition will be evaluated in vitro
using purified kinase C in a mixed micelle assay. The analogues will also be
tested for their usefulness as inhibitors of the kinase in intact cells. The
physical, chemical, and metabolic properties most likely to influence the
utilization of these long-chain bases by the cells will also be measured. This
work will provide valuable information about the basic biochemistry of
sphingosine. In addition, it is hoped that the work will lead to the
availability of useful kinase C inhibitors for studying the role of kinase C in
the life of the cell.
