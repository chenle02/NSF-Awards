Dr. Philip P. Power, Chemistry Department, University of California - Davis, is
supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program,
to study homo- and heteronuclear multiple bonding involving heavier group 13 and
14 elements and for the preparation of low valent group 2 complexes that contain
metal-metal bonds. The ortho-terphenyl and related ligands will be utilized to
stabilize group 13 and 14 elements in low coordinate environments which are
amenable to the formation of multiple bonds. The ability of the heavier members
of these two series to multiply bond with one another and with other heteroatoms
will be explored by a range of physical techniques including x-ray diffraction,
multinuclear and dynamic nmr, uv-visible, infrared, and epr spectroscopies. The
terphenyl ligands will be similarly employed with the group 2 metals to
construct species capable of forming the first metal-metal bonded complexes of
these elements. The question of the nature of an element's chemical bonds is one
of the most basic in chemistry. This project will probe the ability of aluminum,
gallium, indium, germanium, and tin to form double or triple bonds. In general
these elements prefer single bonds, but in some cases can be induced to
participate in multiple bonding. In addition, the first direct beryllium-
beryllium and related magnesium-magnesium species will be sought. The results of
the study will define the sorts of compounds these elements can form and will
contribute to the design of, e.g., catalysts or advanced materials that are
based on them. ¥©Á ┤Á¢╣À&gt; ?Â Á À │/¥/%`¢¥¢ ?╝ /┤└/&gt;│Á┤ _/¥Á╝╣/%¢ ¥©/¥ /╝Á
