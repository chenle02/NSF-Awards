A major emphasis of marine geosciences is to understand the role of
hydrogeological processes in the evolution of the oceanic lithosphere. The role
of fluids in the crust is now known to be important in modifying crustal
chemistry, in controlling the chemistry of seawater and in cooling the oceanic
lithosphere. Although ocean drilling provides a mechanism for examining the
results of these processes directly, performing long-term experiments and repeat
observations are required to understand the rate at which these processes occur.
Such experiments are best performed through reentry of drill holes at periodic
intervals or by deployment of long term instruments. The cost of drillship
operations has lead the international community to develop alternate ways of
deploying experiments in drill holes. This award will support US scientists to
participate with French colleagues using a submersible to place instruments in
drillholes in the North Atlantic. The US scientists will be responsible for
measurement of fluid flow and crustal strain. Because the project represents a
venture into an emerging research area and is a new approach to an old research
topic it is being funded as an SGER award.
