9353404 Williams This phase of Project LASE provides a series of four 5-day
workshops during the summer of 1994 and again in 1995. During the summer of 1994
the sites would be at universities on the West Coast. In 1995 the four-sites
would form a cluster in the southeastern, midwestern or northeastern United
States. At each site the first of two 5-day workshops will be led by the author
(LASE Project PI); the second, to give "local ownership", will be led by a local
Consultant. The workshops will cover laser surveying, beam scanning, refractive
index measurements, lenses, pattern recognition, photodetectors, modulating
beams, guiding lights with fibers, absorption and reflecting, polarization and
liquid crystals, interference, diffraction, and holography. Mathematics will be
integrated into all activities. At each workshop twelve secondary school
teachers will be trained to present these topics, to other teachers,and as lab
exercise in their classrooms with opportunities for their students to experiment
further and publish their "findings" in the project journal LASE LOG. The
Consultants will assist and observe at the first meeting, but be in charge at
the second. ***
