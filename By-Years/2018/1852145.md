This project establishes a new Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site
in Internet of Things (IoT) security at Dakota State University (DSU) in
Madison, South Dakota. The REU site will host 10 students on DSU's campus to
participate in a 10-week summer program each year of the project. The program
provides unique frontline cybersecurity research experiences in IoT,
professional development, close student interactions, and follow-up activities
in order to build participants' knowledge and confidence for work in the
cybersecurity field. The students will work closely with faculty mentors to
conduct IoT security research projects. The project will recruit a highly
skilled and diverse group of students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The selected REU
research projects focus on cloud-based IoT applications and aim to ensure end-
to-end trust and security. IoT presents many new challenges for security
including scalability, system constraints, and enlarged attack surfaces. This
project will create dynamic testing approaches to collect network
characteristics and application payload data from IoT devices. The collected
data will be further analyzed to assess the vulnerabilities of IoT devices and
security risks in IoT. Student researchers will develop new solutions to
mitigate security risks found in IoT. The outcomes of the research projects will
address the current and urgent needs to resolve security and privacy issues in
IoT.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
