HRD 9552986 Moulton The National Coalition of Girls Schools (NCGS) sponsored a
three-day international Girls and Technology conference for K-12 educators at
Wellesley College in June 1995. With NSF support, the organization is to design
and produce both print and multimedia information and dissemination products
stemming from that conference, particularly to showcase successful approaches to
the use of technology in elementary/secondary instruction. The video is to be
disseminated as a professional development tool for precollege teachers. To the
greatest extent possible, all print and multimedia materials are to be made
available, not only in hard copy, but electronically, through the Internet and
WWW. Extensive publicity and information dissemination are to be undertaken by
the NCGS.
