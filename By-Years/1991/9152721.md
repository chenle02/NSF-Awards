The main goal of this project is to improve the learning, retention, and
application of physics concepts and principles by students enrolled in physics
classes at Joliet Junior College (JJC). This is being accomplished by
introducing a series of new experiences using contemporary computer and video
technology in physics. A microcomputer is used in the areas of force, motion,
temperature, and radiation to perform data collection, analysis, and graphing;
and is used to construct, execute, and display physical simulations in
mechanics. Stop- action videotapes are used to collect data in projectile and
rotational motion. Microcomputers and video technology provide immediate
feedback that makes possible a larger number and variety of trials and motivates
students to probe in greater detail.The grant is providing software and hardware
for six, networked, color Macintosh II workstations equipped with a Universal
Lab Interface with appropriate sensors and probes. The grant also is providing a
shared LaserWriter II, modem, CD player, scanner, high resolution video camera,
and playback deck. This support revitalizes the physics courses at JJC and
provides current technology much more quickly than would otherwise be
possible.This project is encouraging students to continue study or to support
science by improving their experiences in physics, increasing science literacy,
helping to prepare JJC's physics courses for the next century, and stimulating
other community colleges to adapt this approach.NSF grant funds are being
matched with funds from non-federal sources.
