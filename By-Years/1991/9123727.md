This award supports the research of Professor L. Teirlinck to work in
combinatorics. He intends to work on the large sets of disjoint designs and
related structures. In particular, he intends to continue his research on
t-designs. The research crosses lines between the areas of combinatorics, and
coding theory. Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study how
discrete collections of objects can be organized. And, so it is extremely
important to modern communications, for example the design of large networks as
in telephone systems. The main object to be studied in the proposed research,
t-designs are a fundamental tool used in the foundations of authenticity theory
in cryptography.
