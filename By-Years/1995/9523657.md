9523657 Thomas This Americas Program award will support a research collaboration
between Dr. J. Kerry Thomas, University of Notre Dame and Dr. Andres Olea,
University of Chile, on a kinetic and thermodynamic study of anionic
polyelectrolytes. The polymer systems to be studied are poly and copolymers of
maleic anhydride and styrene. The P.I.'s intend to evaluate the effect of
hydrophobicity and charge density on the microdomains generated in aqueous
solutions of these polymers. The goals of the study are to identify the
structural parameters which determine the formation and size of the hydrophobic
aggregates; to evaluate the solubilization capacity of organic molecules by
these aggregates; and to investigate by stopped flow studies the dynamic nature
of both processes. This collaboration will benefit from the complementary
expertise of the two researchers as well as from the facilities in both
institutions. The University of Notre Dame has a variety of laser systems to
excite photosystems with short pulses of light, and the University of Chile has
a laboratory of polymer synthesis where both the synthesis and identification of
the copolymers will be made. ***
