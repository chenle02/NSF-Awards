Abstract: Pan Pan's investigation will be focused on various singular integral
and oscillatory integral operators which arise naturally in many problems in
harmonic analysis and related fields including complex analysis and the theory
of partial differential equations. With applications to a large number of
problems in mathematics, these integrals have received an increasing amount of
recognition for their importance. While research in this area has been intensive
and fruitful, much more remains to be understood. This project will cover many
topics of current interest, which when finished will make a big stride toward
the full understanding of these operators and related problems in mathematical
analysis. The objects under investigation form an important part of the
mathematical modeling of physical phenomena such as heat conducting and wave
motion. They also appear in engineering problems involving electric circuits and
signal processing. Thus, gaining understanding of such objects will not only
have theoretical values but also provide guidance in other areas of science and
engineering.
