Research will be conducted on microscopically realistic models of interfacial
patterns in non-eqilibrium condensed matter systems. These models should be
sufficiently accurate so as to allow for quantitative tests of current
theoretical concepts. These concepts include the "solvability" theory for
ordered structures, bifurcation theoretic analysis of secondary instabilities in
cellular patterns, mean field methods for "ensemble-averaged" Diffusion Limited
Aggregation and ideas regarding the emergence of braod-band spectra in non-
linear systems via self-organized criticality." These ideas must be combined
with specific and detailed models if they are to yield quantitative predictions
regarding pattern forming behavior. In the course of this work, studies will be
made of the solidification of monolayers, where the reduced dimensionality
enables one to perform exact shape calculations and compare to general schemes
for bifurcation of cellular states; a new mathematical model will be developed
for the recent stream instability experiment which exhibits a transition to
broad-band dynamics; solvability theory for free dendritic growth will be
extended to the realistic case of non- axisymmetric crystals with cubic surface
tension anisotropy so as to be able to directly compare with experiment; and,
mean field Diffusion Limited Aggregation calculations will be done on a variety
of geometries and dimensions so as to ascertain the generality and usefulness of
this new approach. %%% A variety of problems in the exciting new field of
nonlinear science which impact condensed matter physics and materials research
will be studied. The problems focus on models of the nonlinear dynamics of
interfacial patterns which are realistic and can, thus, be compared with
experimental results.
