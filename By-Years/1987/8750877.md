This project has provided matching funds to purchase a combined transmission and
scanning electron microscope (TEM/SEM) to provide enhanced opportunities for
students to study and experiment at the cellular level. Central to this
development is a course in The Theory and Techniques of Electron Microscopy,
designed to familiarize students with the principles of TEM and SEM design and
operation. Through intensive laboratory instruction, students gain "hands-on"
experience in TEM and SEM techniques and operation which then is applied to
selected research projects. The new TEM/SEM enriches laboratory exercises at all
levels of the biology program by focusing attention on the cellular aspects of
organismal structure, and provides new opportunities for student independent and
honors research in Biology.
