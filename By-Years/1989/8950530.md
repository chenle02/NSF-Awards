This award provides funds to the Department of Speech and Hearing Sciences at
the University of Arizona to acquire modern transducer systems and two MacIntosh
workstations to create virtual instruments to support three laboratory courses
in communication sciences. The courses are SP H 260 - Speech Science, SP H 280 -
Hearing Science, and SP H 461 Instrumentation in Speech Science. The transducer
systems include (a) pneumotachographs, (b) an electroglottograph, and (c)
magnetometers. An additional transducer system will support the generation of
high quality acoustical stimuli for laboratory exercises in auditory perception.
The core instrumentation, the computer workstations, will be configured with
appropriate analog to digital and digital to analog hardware to enable the
students to obtain spectral analyses, fundamental frequency contours, and sound
pressure level measurements of speech, and permanent written records of air
pressure/flow, electroglottograph and magnetometer outputs, and
electrophysiological signals. The Hearing Science laboratories will employ the
instrumentation in adaptive psychophysical protocols to enable the students to
investigate auditory perception using modern methods. The virtual instruments
and transducers will replace dedicated apparatus that is aging, unsupported, and
unadaptable to modern, computer-based data collection and analysis methods. The
grantee is matching this award with non-Federal sources.
