This research is aimed at a fresh and novel approach to the problem of
production costing in power systems. Central to current thinking relative to
production cost calculation is the concept of "cummulants" or probability
distribution first moment approximations. These convolution calculations can be
vexing since they are known to be very useful when accurate and severely
misleading in the decision process when inaccurate. A distribution of finite
range can always be characterized by all of its moments. Approximations require
a few moments but, how many is the question. The standard approximation to
cummulants is the Gram-Charlier series with its Hermite polynomials. There is
preliminary evidence that this series is the root of the problem and that
orthogonal series such as Laguerre polynomial expansions offer solution. The
work will be performed in Sydney, Australia at the University of New South Wales
because, at the suggestion of the PI, work has already begun there. I expect the
answer to be a result of this work with the expertise for future work to reside
at Ohio University.
