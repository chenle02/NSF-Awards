This research is to develop a new theoretical approach to the inversion of
seismic wave-form data for determination of spatial distributions of medium
properties. The new approach is based on the renormalized source-type integral
equation method recently proposed for inversion of electric field data to
determine the 1- D conductivity profile. This research will attempt to extend
the new approach to the acoustic wave data to determine the 2-D and 3- D
velocity and density structure, in which the back-ground medium is assumed to be
vertically (1-D) heterogeneous. The new approach is expected to be superior to
the usual linearization-iteration procedure based on the first Born
approximation.
