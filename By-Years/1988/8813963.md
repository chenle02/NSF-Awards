A new physico-chemical effect is investigated in this expedited award. This
effect is based on electroconducting phenomenon in nonaqueous solvents. The
effect permits the mobilization of nonpolar, uncharged molecules as well as
electrolytes and species with wide ranges of molecular weights. Transport rates
exceeding several centimeters per minute are commonly achieved. The objectives
of this project are: to study the conductive properties of organic compounds
based on thermodynamical electron donor strength, dielectric properties and
ionization energy; to develop the methodology for formulating the semiconductive
solvent media; and to investigate the transport phenomenon in terms of
chemoelectronic mobility of chemical species based on electron donor/acceptor
properties. This technique has the long- term potential of being applied to the
areas of electronic transducers, chemical separations, photo-cells and the
understanding of biological systems; hence, the success of this study could have
impact on the medical, chemical, electronics, and instrumentation industries.
