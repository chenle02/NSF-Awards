The Interactive VLSI IC Design Lab is devoted to serving both undergraduate and
graduate students within the College of Science and Engineering. The Interactive
VLSI IC Design Lab is primarily concerned with developing hands-on experience in
circuit and system design through the interactive use of workstations. The idea
is that instructors and students work concurrently; students learn tools and
techniques while the instructor concurrently advises and corrects their designs.
Such an idea is feasible through the application of the professional design
system from Mentor Graphics, where all design databases can be accessed in real
time by the instructor. Additionally, the new equipment can serve CSE students
in other classes. Moreover, the research activities using the workstations may
be expanded. The new equipment (eight SUN SPARCStations) meets the needs of this
department in terms of hardware/software compatibility with the existing
equipment. This program improves the quality, effectiveness, and accessibility
of engineering education. As a result, it attracts students by giving them
opportunities to achieve excellence in the area of hardware design for VLSI
circuits and systems.
