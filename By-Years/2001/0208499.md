For short wavelengths, which carry the most information for very small
earthquakes, the complexity of wave propagation in the Earth's crust makes it
difficult to discern effects due to the earthquake source. Multiple empirical
Green's function analysis, a method that uses extremely small earthquakes to
correct for complicated wave propagation effects for somewhat larger
earthquakes, when used for these very small events shows that unanticipated wave
propagation effects are present even in deep borehole recordings. This may have
led to incorrect conclusions about the energetics of very small (magnitude less
than 2.0) earthquakes in past studies. This technique is being applied to an
extensive data set in order to see if these conclusions generalize to
earthquakes in diverse environments: viz. the San Andreas fault system in
southern California and the deforming crust of Japan. This is a particularly
timely study because propagation effects in borehole recordings may affect
measurements obtained from ongoing and planned large-scale downhole experiments
in Japan and in California. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technique developed by
Satoshi Ide (University of Tokyo) is being used for large earthquakes, to
determine the spatial distribution of radiated seismic energy from strong motion
models of the earthquake. Studies of a set of three earthquakes, including the
1995 Kobe, Japan earthquake, shows that most of the seismic energy was radiated
near the hypocenter, suggesting that the rest of the faulting process was
largely dissipative. This method is being applied to a much larger available
catalog of extended-source models in an attempt to improve understanding how the
energy balance during faulting controls the size of an earthquake.
