The Analytical and Surface Chemistry (ASC) program supports the research program
of Prof. Steven Bernasek of the Department of Chemistry at Princeton University.
Prof. Bernasek and his students will address fundamental questions of structure
and reactivity in well characterized organic monolayers and thin films adsorbed
on solid surfaces. They will examine the formation of organic monolayer
structures, with particular emphasis on the formation of chiral monolayers,
peptide oligomer monolayers, and nanopatterned surfaces, primarily using
Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM). The project will provide fundamental
information about the structure and reactivity of organic monolayers and thin
films, which may help to answer questions about the development of chirality in
living systems. Information from this work may be also useful in the design of
chiral separations media and chirally active catalysts. The project will provide
excellent training opportunities to students in an important research field of
great interest to multiple industries.
