TECHNICAL: The area of bulk metallic glasses has witnessed a fast growth in
basic research and developments in the last ten years. Materials have been
developed for civil, military, biomedicine, mining, sports, and structure
applications. Besides, theoretical and computational efforts have been made that
hold promises to uncover the mysteries in the glass formation, deformation
mechanisms, and the basic phenomena in transport, phase transition, magnetic
properties, corrosion, dynamic response, and fracture mechanics. This project is
for sponsorship for Symposium Z on Bulk Metallic Glasses, which is part of the
2007 Annual Materials Research Society (MRS) Fall meeting. The research
presented and discussed at this Symposium will be of significant interest and
relevance to many scientific and technology goals in the area of Metals. This
Symposium is a significant event in a rapidly developing research and
application area, and more than 145 oral presentations and posters are expected.
The symposium will also host a half day tutorial on Materials Characterization
of Bulk Metallic Glasses. The MRS fall meeting is held in Boston on November
25-29, 2007. It is a large national and international event attended by
thousands of researchers. NON-TECHNICAL: The use of bulk metallic glasses has
been demonstrated in their revolutionary impacts on many key engineering and
military applications. The objective of this symposium is to provide a forum for
communicating fundamentally new insights in bulk metallic glass developments,
characterization, and novel approaches for fabrication of bulk metallic glasses
and devices. These developments can then lead to new and exciting applications.
This meeting is one of the series of meetings established and agreed upon by MRS
governing committee for bulk metallic glasses. We anticipate many exciting
reports on progresses and new insights.
