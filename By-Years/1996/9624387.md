Abstract Stanton DMS-9624387 Stanton will continue his investigation of
spectral invariants associated to elliptic differential operators in various
settings of homogeneous and locally symmetric spaces. In particular, he shall
examine a formula for the holomorphic torsion of a holomorphic vector bundle
over a locally symmetric space, obtained in earlier work, in order to isolate in
it the contribution from the R-class defined by Bismut and Gillet-Soule. He will
attempt to extend his earlier work on locally symmetric spaces, in which he
related torsion to special values of geometric zeta functions, to a class of
compact, Kaehler, homogeneous spaces. For the class of quaternionic-Kaehler
symmetric and locally symmetric spaces he will seek a new spectral invariant,
and he will attempt to develop an associated geometric zeta function to detect
this invariant. In a different direction of research, he will continue his
investigation of various topological properties of real flag manifolds using
geometric representation theory. Following upon the success of the index theorem
in the 60's to provide an analytic framework to compute topological invariants
of manifolds, beginning in the 1970's, spectral invariants were associated to
elliptic differential operators in an attempt to formulate more subtle
topological and geometric invariants of manifolds in the language of analysis,
i.e. differential equations, on the manifold. The importance of these newer
invariants is underscored in their appearance in the emerging theory of the
fundamental forces by theoretical physicists. While these invariants are
difficult to compute for general spaces, for those spaces arising from the
action of a group, such as locally symmetric spaces, the harmonic analysis
coming from the well-developed theory of the representations of the group
provides a powerful tool to investigate these invariants. The introduction of
geometric zeta functions serves to connect in a not-yet-understood way the
topology of the manifold, via the fundamental group, to these invariants through
the values of the zeta function at distinguished points. The goal to understand
topological properties through differential equations then begins on a formal
level to make contact with number theory.
