1236086&lt;br/&gt;PI: Dufresne&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Electrophoretic displays
based on charged colloidal pigments consume far less energy than conventional
back-lit liquid crystal displays. In fact, a well-designed electrophoretic
display with a static image consumes no energy. This energy savings arises from
two important factors. First, electrophoretic displays are bistable, so they
consume energy only when changing the displayed image. Second, electrophoretic
displays use ambient light, instead of internal light sources. Therefore,
electrophoretic displays are ideal for reading, signage and architectural
applications. However, the central limitation of these displays is that they
only produce black and white images. In principle, color images can be created
from electrophoretic displays through the use of colored filters, as in an LCD
display, but such devices would be too dark for most applications.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bright electrophoretic displays would require each pixel
to be able to display either red, green or blue. To achieve this, this project
will create electrophoretic inks with structural color. Inspired by color-
producing nanostructures in bird feathers, this work will control the color of
electrophoretic inks by tuning the spacing of charged colloidal particles. The
spacing will be determined by interparticle forces and external electric fields.
Thus, the color of the ink containing pixel will be switchable with an applied
voltage. To achieve this goal, this project will need to solve several
fundamental problems in colloid science. First, the research will identify
general principles and specific materials for creating charged suspensions in
non-polar solvents with sufficient short-range order to produce structural
colors. Second, the research will characterize the effect of external electric
fields on the structure of these suspensions.
