SUMMARY The Physics Division and the Division of Materials Research contribute
funds to this award. This award supports the participation of four early career
investigators to attend the IUPAP Conference on Computational Physics which will
be held in Moscow, Russia August 20-24, 2013. The early career investigators may
be graduate students in their final year before their expected dissertation
defense, or post-docs within a year from their PhD degree. Their research area
will be computational, but may be from any subfield of computational physics.

Computational physics has become a third method of investigation in physics. The
Conference on Computational Physics is the international meeting that focuses
exclusively on the computational investigations in physics.

The early career investigators working in computational physics will participate
in a focused international conference. Attending and presenting at international
focused meetings is a fundamental step in the career of young investigators.
These young investigators will both attend the conference and make an oral
presentation. Every effort will be made to include in the travel awards
individuals of underrepresented groups in computational physics.
