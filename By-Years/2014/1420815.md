Cloud computing poses significant risks to the security of client data. Virtual
Machine Monitors (VMMs) that underlie cloud systems typically have all-powerful
administrative domains that can be exploited or misused to snoop on client
virtual machines (VMs) and steal/modify their data. Moreover, although virtual
machine technology enables several novel security services that clients may wish
to use, such services are privileged and must be implemented within the
administrative domain. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops the Self-
service Cloud Computing (SSC) model to improve the security of client data. SSC
employs privilege separation to reduce the privileges granted to the system-wide
administrative domain, and expose new abstractions to clients that give them
greater control over their VMs. Thus, SSC mitigates the impact of attacks
directed on client VMs via the administrative domain, and allows clients to
deploy security services on their own VMs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SSC can have
broad impact by ameliorating the threats to client data on the cloud, thus
encouraging clients to move to the cloud. The concept of cloud app markets
developed in this project is also likely to be of independent interest. The
project also includes an educational component that will develop new cloud-
related material for inclusion in graduate and undergraduate curricula.
