This award will support a meeting of a steering committee to plan a workshop
which will survey research opportunities at the interface between mathematics
and biology, with emphasis on emerging areas of significance. The product of the
workshop would be a report to the National Science Foundation and a summary
would be published in the open literature. The report would highlight recent
accomplishments in mathematical biology, estimate the potential for growth and
number of investigators currently and potentially involved, indicate centers of
activity, make 5 to 10-year projections of research activities, estimate needed
resources, and recommend follow-up activities.
