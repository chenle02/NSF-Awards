This collaborative project will develop the infrastructure necessary to collect
a large scale data base detailing the behavior of state supreme courts across
states and over time. The data will combine state supreme court judge votes,
case outcomes, and case characteristics with judge attributes, institutional
attributes and selected contextual variables. By combining data from multiple
contexts, years, and levels of analysis, this survey of state high courts will
support research of theoretical importance across a range of analytic approaches
and substantive interests. These data will permit systematic evaluation of
theories that connect the law and judges with their institutional, political and
social contexts. This award funds the preliminary testing of the feasibility of
various data collection strategies, creates a national Board of Overseers, and
facilitates planning of the larger study including estimating the possibilities
for integration of this data collection with other comprehensive federal
court/case data sets supported by the Law and Social Sciences program. ***
