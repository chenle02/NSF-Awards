Mobile devices supporting a wide variety of multimedia applications under a
very stringent energy budget are a key driver of electronic systems in future.
The objective of the proposed research is to explore a generic, programmable,
reconfigurable, and energy-efficient architectural platform for future mobile
devices for real-time multimedia processing. The aim is to exploit the inherent
error tolerance in multimedia applications for run-time energy-accuracy trade-
off. The proposed research will analyze the interaction of ultra-low-power
computing and error characteristics of real-time multimedia processing. This
research will pursue a circuit-architecture-algorithm co-design approach to
model, analyze, and demonstrate a reconfigurable hardware platform for memories,
datapath, and buses to exploit the error characteristics of real-time multimedia
processing algorithms for ultra-low power.

This generic architecture for energy-efficient multimedia systems can lay the
foundation of future mobile supercomputers performing wide array of applications
with minimal energy. The PIs will disseminate the research results through
project website, conference and journal publications. The existing interactions
with leading microprocessor and mobile handset manufacturers will provide
opportunities for technology transfer. The educational goal is to create next
generation engineers who understand the effects of energy and accuracy on
computations. The PIs will engage in recruiting students from underrepresented
groups and mentor students under the Summer Undergraduate Research Experience
for minorities (SURE) program at Georgia Tech.
