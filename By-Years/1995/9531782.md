9531782 Accurate and speedy field testing to evaluate soil characteristics and
behavior is needed to support society's need for continued investment in
infrastructure development and rehabilitation. The piezocone penetrometer (PCP)
is the increasingly chosen investigation tool to meet this demand. The proposed
research aims to develop an anisotropic, rate- dependent constitutive model and
an Arbitrary-Lagrangean-Eularean (ALE) finite element code to predict for the
first time, cone resistance and excess pore water pressures at various rates of
cone penetration. The capability of the model will be verified and validated by
state-of-the-art calibration chamber tests that will focus on penetration rate,
lateral stress coefficient, overconsolidation ratio, and scale effects on cone
data. Interpretation of non-standard pore water pressure dissipation curves
arising from initial excess pore pressure drop due to normal stress reduction
and its initial variation with respect to redistribution and stress history
effects will be investigated. This research will formulate accurate simplified
methods and charts to evaluate engineering soil parameters, ground improvement
effectiveness, and performance of deep foundations (i.e. increase in pile
capacity with time) from PCP test data. ***
