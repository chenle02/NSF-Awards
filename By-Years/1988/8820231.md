Stars are generally characterized by a decrease in their temperature from the
interior (where the temperature is typically millions of degrees Kelvin) to the
surface (where the temperature is thousands or tens of thousands of degrees
Kelvin). In the sun and other stars with surface (i.e., photospheric)
temperatures of roughly 6000 K and less the temperature rises sharply in the
transparent, outermost layers due to energy deposited from magnetic surface
activities. In the sun, the region in which the temperature starts rising has
traditionally been known as the chromosphere. More recently, the processes
giving rise to this temperature inversion have been called the "molecular
cooling catastrophes" because radiative cooling by CO and other molecules
appears to be responsible for it. The Principal Investigator (PI) proposes to
study the regions of temperature inversion in the atmospheres of late-type stars
and compare them to those of the sun. The observational input data will be
spatially-unresolved spectra of these stars, which the PI and his collaborators
have accumulated over the past three years. This data will be processed by
computer codes capable of solving the molecular non-local thermodynamic
equilibrium (NLTE) problem.
