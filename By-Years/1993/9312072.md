9312072 Schlom This is a proposal submitted to the Small Grants for Exploratory
Research (SGER) Program. The PI proposed to use the molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)
techniques to grown stacked thin film layers of feeroelectric oxides with
buffers. The objective was to prepare thin film ferroelectrics with controlled
grain boundaries, and to study their effects on the problem of DC ferroelectric
degradation. %%% This is a SGER project. The project plans to grown stacked thin
film layers of ferrorelectric oxides with buffers. The goal is to prepare
expitaxial film with controlled grain boundaries. Through these grain
boundaries, the project intends to study the effects of these boundaries on the
problem of DC degradation. This problem plagues oxide ferroelectrics as
electronic device materials. If its cause can be ascertained, its solution can
make the oxide ferroelectrics important electronic materials of the future,
suitable as non-volatile memory materials. ***
