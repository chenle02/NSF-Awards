The oceans play an important role in regulating the Earth's climate, not only
through their well recognized role as a reservoir and transport medium for
moisture and heat, but also as a major dynamic reservoir for climatically
sensitive gases such as carbon dioxide. Interactions between physical,
biological and chemical processes are important to understand in order to
examine the exchange of physical and chemical quantities between the atmosphere
and the deep oceans. The goal of this project is to develop, test and modify an
integrated physical-biological- carbon dioxide ocean model in an effort to
simulate and evaluate interactions controlling the exchange of carbon dioxide
between the atmosphere and ocean in the Southern Ocean. The Southern Ocean is of
particular importance because it represents one of two regions in the world
where significant deep water comes in contact with the atmosphere, allowing
direct exchange of gases where substantial quantities of surface water downwell
to aphotic depths while still containing high concentrations of unutilized
nutrients at the Antarctic Polar Front. The potential utilization of excess
nutrients by phytoplankton may have a substantial impact on carbon dioxide flux.
The large seasonal variability within the physical, biological, and chemical
system leads to an extreme range in the rate and direction of exchange with
atmosphere and consequently, it is not clear whether this region is one of net
uptake or release of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. Results from this
modelling effort will prove important to advancing oceanographic research in the
Southern Ocean.
