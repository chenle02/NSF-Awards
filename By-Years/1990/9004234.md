A field study will be undertaken to investigate the biogenic emission-fate of
monoterpenes in a southern pine forest. The research plan includes measurement
of monoterpenes emission rates, characterization of atmospheric dispersion at
the forest site, and monitoring atmospheric oxidation products of the
monoterpenes. The field study will be conducted in conjunction with NOAA and
NCAR where these groups will provide support in terms of trace gas measurements.
