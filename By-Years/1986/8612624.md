The propagation of jet cores in the upper troposphere is one of the subjects
difficult for meteorology students to visualize in the classrooms. Using the
computer graphics technique of shading, Professor Tenenbaum will create video
tapes and film loops depicting the propagation of jet streams, the development
of upper level fronts in the vicinity, and the evolution of isentropic surfaces
associated with these phenomena. These products will aid teaching in
meteorology, particularly at the undergraduate level. This grant is made under
the NSF program, Research in Undergraduate Institutions.
