The Internet is a powerful resource. Interconnecting millions of individuals at
thousands of institutions worldwide, it offers potential for significant inter-
organizational sharing of resources, such as documents, software, data, network
services, and people. The principal investigator (PI) envisions a sophisticated
distributed collaboration paradigm where people accomplish tasks and share
resources among many interrelated individuals across administrative borders. The
research in this project will consider three questions: how can one design
resource discovery algorithms that scale for use in national or international
networks, provide algorithms to support searches without imposing artificial
constraints on the resource space organization, and build systems that require a
minimal level of global administration agreement on protocols, information
formats, and organizational structures. To answer these questions, the PI will
explore a highly decentralized architecture for supporting resource discovery.
The research emphasizes systems and networking issues, involving distribution
and replication for registering and maintaining distributed structures, called
"views"; security of view contents; ease of creating and updating views; and
ease of searching for resources.
