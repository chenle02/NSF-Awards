*** 9704008 Abramson This Small Business Innovation Research Phase 11 project
involves the design and construction of a packet radio network based upon a
broadband connection free protocol for integration of transaction, file and
digital voice in a common channel. Multiple access protocols are used to permit
independent transmitters to share a common communication channel. When the
number of transmitters is large and the network is required to support a variety
of different kinds of traffic a connection free multiple access protocol is
often required. Spread ALOHA Multiple Access (SAMA) is such a protocol,
combining the proven simplicity and operational flexibility of an ALOHA multiple
access channel with the high bandwidth and high throughput of a spread spectrum
channel. In this Phase 11 project we plan to modify an existing SAMA packet
radio network to implement a new efficient protocol for the seamless integration
of a wide variety of traffic types in a common channel This new wideband version
of SAMA will have commercial applications in PCS networks which must integrate
data into a voice oriented architecture and in VSAT networks which must
integrate voice into a data oriented architecture. ***
