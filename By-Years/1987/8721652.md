This grant supports the doctoral dissertation research of Ms. Diana Barkan. Her
dissertation topic is: "The History of Low Temperature Studies as Related to
Early Quantum Theory." Ms. Barkan's project is an historical investigation into
the development of experimental physics and physical chemistry in the early
decades of the 20th century. She will focus on low temperature studies,
particularly those in Berlin and Leiden. During the years 1910-1912, W. Nernst,
one of the most prominent of German scientists of the period, promoted the study
of specific heats because of their importance for quantum theory. He created a
powerful interdisciplinary school with practitioners from various subdisciplines
of physics and chemistry in order to carry out his research projects. Ms Barkan
will compare Nerst's approach with that of another team headed by H. Kammerlingh
Onnes in Leiden. Nerst's and Onnes' research showed that low temperature studies
were a critical experimental testing ground for the quantum hypothesis and their
results provided significant feedback for the development of quantum theory.
This research examines a too-little investigated area in the history of modern
science. We know too little about the history of physical chemistry in general
and of the specific role of experimentation in physics and physical chemistry in
the development of quantum theory. This project promises to open up new,
important areas for history and philosophy of science.
