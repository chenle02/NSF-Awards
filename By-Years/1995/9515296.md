One of the most valuable recent theoretical developments in economics has been
the focus on transactions costs as determinative of economic institutions. This
award to an economic anthropologist at Catholic University will support a study
of the 20th century development of groundwater irrigation systems in Northern
Spain. Using transactions cost concepts from the `new institutional economics`
as well as from schema theory in cognitive science, the project will try to
explain why farmers selected certain forms of property rights and irrigation
systems over others that were locally available. The methods include archival
data, ethnography and the compilation of a Geographic Information System for the
area. This research is important because it will provide a fundamental advance
in our knowledge of how economic institutions are selected in specific
situations. The combination of theory and concepts from diverse fields like
transactions costs economics and cognitive science will advance knowledge in
both areas. The knowledge that the project will create about property rights
arrangements will be of practical relevance to regional water use planners in
anticipating extraction rates of ground water. As a human dimensions of global
change research project the knowledge created will advance our understanding of
how people adapt their cultural and economic institutions to changes in ground-
water resources available to sustain agriculture.
