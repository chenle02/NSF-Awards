New Mexico State University will initiate a six-week, residential Young
Scholars project in Biology for 25 students entering grade 10. "Science
Challenge" will feature intensive, week-long research projects led by NMSU
professors and conducted in five-student teams. Classroom instruction in
biology, mathematics and computer skills will supplement research activity.
During scheduled events -- which include weekly field trips to research
facilities, a science symposium and a lecture by a visiting Native American
scientist -- students will meet professional minority scientists and minority
science students.
