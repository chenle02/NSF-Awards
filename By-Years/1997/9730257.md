9730257 Moran This team of scientists from the Univbersity of Rhode Island and
the University of Minnesota will test the hypothesis that horizontal advection
plays a significant role in the transport of the radioisotopes 230Th and 231Pa
in the water column of the North Atlantic. Studies will involve measurement of
230Th and 231Pa in North Atlantic Deep Water, the Labrador Sea, and other water
masses of the North Atlantic as well as downcore measurements of the excess
231Pa/ 230Th isotopic ratio in high sedimentation rate cores from the Labrador
Sea. Laboratory studies would be conducted to determine distribution
coefficients of these isotopes between seawater and particulate surfaces. Such
studies should prove important in interpreting the sedimentary record left by
these isotopes inasmuch as that record provides insight into the paleoceanogrphy
of the North Atlantic, especially the formation of North Atlantic Deep Water.
