All plasmas are subject to a variety of instabilities, irrespective of the type
of devices in which these are produced and their intended applications. These
include plasma sources for neutral, electron and ion beams, any type of arc
discharge, plasma etching devices for solid state processing, basic experimental
devices, geophysical and astrophysical plasma and fusion machines. The
deleterious consequences of the instabilities are many: non-uniformities in
plasma, increased transport and, if violent enough, a macroscopic break up.
These can lead minimally to degradation of the performance of the device or
system and sometimes to its break down. Therefore the elimination of these
instabilities is always desirable and sometimes imperative. This project
continues research into active feedback control of plasma instabilities.
Specifically, a new remote suppressor using a small ion beam will be used, which
will have minimal perturbation to the system. Robust controllers will also be
studied. Applications of these controllers to industrial plasma devices will be
explored. Two faculty members and one graduate student will carry out the
proposed research using the facilities of the Columbia University Plasma
Research Laboratory. The experimental work will utilize the redesigned Columbia
Linear Machine.
