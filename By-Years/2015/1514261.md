Cloud computing enables computationally limited parties to outsource the storage
of, and computation on, massive amounts of data. Such outsourced computations,
however, might be performed incorrectly, due to implementation errors or
malicious behavior. Protocols for verifiable computation allow an untrusted
server performing such computations to also provide succinct proofs that the
returned results are correct. Drawing on expertise from cryptography,
programming languages, databases, and systems, this project develops a novel
architecture (Apollo) for automatically producing scalable verifiable-
computation protocols. Apollo has the potential to speed up verifiable
computations by orders of magnitude while at the same time scaling to large
datasets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research focuses on cryptographic "gadgets"
suited for verifiable computation in different settings, as well as programming
languages and type systems for easily expressing verifiable computation in terms
of these lower-level gadgets. A major goal of the project is to develop a
working prototype of a verifiable SQL database. Results of this research will be
disseminated to a wide audience through publications and open-source
implementations, and will be integrated into a graduate course on cloud
computing security at the University of Maryland.
