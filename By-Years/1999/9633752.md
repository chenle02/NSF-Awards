ABSTRACT CTS-9633752 This is an extension of studies on reduction of nitrogen
oxides by methane. It has been established that certain rare-earth oxides, with
or without promotion by strontium, have high specific activities for this
reaction and activity is enhanced by excess oxygen. In this work, lanthana and
neodymia (excellent catalysts in the bulk form) both with and without strontium
promoter, are dispersed on high-surface-area supports such as alumina, silica,
or zirconia. Catalytic behavior and rate expressions over a range of oxygen
partial pressures are determined using a variety of reductants including
methane, methanol, hydrogen, and carbon monoxide. The supported rare-earth-oxide
catalysts are characterization by BET measurements, chemisorption of nitric
oxide and other gases, X-ray diffraction, diffuse reflectance Fourier-transform
infrared spectroscopy (DRIFTS), electron-spin resonance, thermal analysis, and
isotopic kinetic studies. This work is directly relevant to the current efforts
to control emissions of nitrogen oxides and reduce occurrence of acid rain. This
technology is suitable for emission control in both stationary boiler (power
plant) sources and lean-burn mobile (automotive) sources.
