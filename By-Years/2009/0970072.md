The principal investigator's past research has focused on interface problems
arising in a variety of physical phenomena such as phase separation, fluid
dynamics, materials science, and continuum limits of nonequilibrium particle
systems. The goal of the current project is to gain a better understanding of
general properties of free boundary problems using various notions of weak
solutions, with the help of maximum-principle-type arguments, harmonic analysis,
measure theory, and interacting particle systems. Specific questions under
investigation are (i) global-time existence and uniqueness; (ii) uniting notions
of weak solutions; (iii) regularity properties; (iv) long-time behavior of
solutions and (v) geometric properties of free boundaries. Another project is to
study homogenization of the free boundaries in periodic and random media, moving
with oscillating normal velocity caused by inhomogeneities in the media. An
example is the dynamics of water droplets spreading on an irregular surface. The
lower dimensional nature of free boundaries bring major challenges to the
homogenization, especially in nonvariational settings. The goal is to prove
existence, uniqueness, and stability of the effective free boundary problem in
periodic and random media.

Nonlinear interface motions arise naturally in physical applications, and they
have been extensively studied in the physics and applied mathematics literature.
A classical example is the melting of ice pieces or snow crystals, where the
central issue of interest is the evolution of the ice/water/air interface. The
highly nonlinear structure and the development, in general, of finite-time
singularities on the interface -- such as a stream of water pinching into
droplets -- give rise to rather challenging difficulties in the rigorous
analysis. It is important, both in theory and in practice, to understand what
type of singularities occur and under what circumstances the behavior of the
interfaces exhibits stability.
