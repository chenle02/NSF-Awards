Our goal is to expand the EPR capabilities at the University of Kansas to
include a modern state-of-the-art EPR machine with kinetic capabilities in the
millisecond time-range. To use this millisecond time-resolution, we require a
pulsed photolysis source such as the requested excimer laser that can deliver
high energies (i.e., greater than 20 mJ per pulse) in the ultraviolet region of
the spectrum to release caged ligands within the submillisecond time scale. This
latter capability will permit the resolution of time- dependent structural
changes associated with the activation or assembly of biological molecules.
Equally important is the availability of a machine with the magnetic field
stability necessary to reproducibly measure the positions of metal resonances in
order to permit a systematic identification of their structure. These new
capabilities will enhance research efforts ranging from the elucidation of
structural and assembly properties of macromolecules (e.g., biological
membranes, tubulin), and the mechanistic features associated with energy
transduction processes (e.g., ATP Synthase, Ca-ATPase, and Na+/Ca2+ Antiporter),
to the detailed relationship between the ligand complexation surrounding a given
metal atom and the physical properties of functionally significant metal
complexes that serve as model systems for understanding the activation dioxygen
(e.g., cyclidene cobalt complexes).
