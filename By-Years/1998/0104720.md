Oregon State University will expand its successful Master Science Educators
program and create a national model for the delivery of natural science
education to elementary and middle school youth. Master Science Educators are
volunteers who undergo a rigorous 30-hour training and commit to 50 hours of
service to a community site, such as a community center, housing project or
school. Volunteers work in teams of two so that each site receives 100 hours of
service devoted to the research and development of a natural science project.
Volunteers and on-site and off-site scientists who act as virtual volunteers,
guide youth ages K-8, in the design, development and evaluation of their
project. Wildlife habitat projects provide a means for participants to learn
inquiry and are tailored to address local science standards. A trainer's guide,
a volunteer handbook, a guide for community sites and promotional and training
videos will be produced, as well as a web-based science course. It is
anticipated that 240 volunteers will be trained to work with over 12,000 youth
during the course of the project. Dissemination will occur through the 4-H
Extension service, impacting both urban and rural populations.
