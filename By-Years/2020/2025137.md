The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development of diagnostic tools for the rapid characterization of disease
pathogens in honey bees. Honey bee colonies face large annual mortality, and
disease is a primary cause. Beekeepers may be able to make better management
decisions for maintaining the health of their colonies if they are able to
identify whether their bees are infected with a disease-causing pathogen. The
diagnostic tools would require no scientific or technical training to use,
beyond that necessary for honey bee handling, and no special technical tools for
processing samples. Key impacts with this project are that beekeepers will face
less stress to their businesses and crops will benefit from the improved yields
associated with honey bee pollination. Although this project is focused on the
health of honey bees and the needs of beekeepers, the tools developed may serve
as a platform for pathogen diagnosis in other insect species, including native
pollinators. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the
development of rapid disease detection and diagnosis tools enabling beekeepers
to diagnose their honey bee colonies in the field. The technology relies on an
understanding of beekeeping processes, honey bee disease science, and molecular
genetics to develop laminar flow cell technology that wicks sample proteins and
nucleic acids through a paper-like medium and onto detection and signaling
molecules (antibodies or capture and signaling proteins). This project will
explore optimization of a diagnostic system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
