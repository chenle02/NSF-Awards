The project awards approximately 95 scholarships to students enrolled full-time
in biology, chemistry, physics, geology, vacuum and thin film technology,
computer science, computer technology, engineering, and mathematics associate
degree programs at Normandale Community College. It builds on two successful
prior CSEMS and S-STEM projects in which the scholarship programs exceeded goals
of retention, transfer, scholar GPA, and minority participation. This project
provides an innovative model and evaluates its effectiveness for supporting STEM
success in a community college, especially for underrepresented minorities and
women. The new program, SciMath III, adapts and combines components from the
previous two programs which have a record of fostering student success and
develops new interventions to meet the challenges experienced in the past. The
project is assessing the success of the model in comparison with previous
projects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project contributes to STEM education by
creating a STEM scholarship model with a STEM specific student support program
that can be emulated by other institutions. The model provides not only an
opportunity for promoting STEM participation through scholarships but also
demonstration of the effectiveness of STEM specific support programs in student
success. The project benefits the local economy, especially the high-tech
industry by providing qualified STEM graduates.
