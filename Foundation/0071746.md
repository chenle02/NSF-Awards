ABSTRACT

Laskowski is continuing his research on three projects within the realm of
model theory. First, in collaboration with Hart and Hrushovski, the investigator
is seeking to determine the `fine structure' of models of classifiable theories.
This amounts to determining the amount of flexibility one has in choosing a
decomposition tree for a model of such a theory. Recently, Laskowski has
discovered that any shallow, strictly stable theory that does not have the
dimensional order property interprets an infinite group. In collaboration with
Shelah, Laskowski is seeking to understand the extent to which this group
determines the dependence relation of dividing. Finally, in collaboration with
Dolich, Laskowski is seeking to identify a class of theories that contains the
simple theories, yet also a satisfactory notion of independence.

Model theory is concerned with the interplay between theories (i.e., sets of
sentences in a very formal language) and the classes of algebraic structures
(models) that satisfy these sentences. Most of Laskowski's research to date
concerns broad classes of theories, as opposed to concentrating on a specific
theory or structure. Because of the breadth of the context, applications have
been found in other areas of mathematics and in computer science, specifically
in the analysis of structured data bases. These classes of theories are
described in terms of the embeddability or non-embeddability of certain
configurations of elements into models of the theory. Laskowski is continuing to
analyze three classes of theories. In all three cases, the combinatorial
assumptions on the class of theories imply that the models of such theories
contain some algebraic content. The investigator is studying the extent to which
this algebraic component determines the behavior of a model of the theory.
