This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to refine a
neural network method for the identification of functional RNA molecules,
specifically with extension to eukaryotes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial
application of this project will be in the area of antisense RNA
therapeutics.&lt;br/&gt;
