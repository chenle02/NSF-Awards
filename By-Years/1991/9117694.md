Geochemical and physiological processes mediated by magnetotactic bacteria are
not well understood despite the fact that these unusual procaryotes are
ubiquitous in and easily collected from aquatic habitats. Preliminary results
with several new isolates of magnetotactic bacteria strongly suggest that cells
of these strains are involved in the oxidation of reduced sulfur and perhaps
iron compounds. Moreover, these results show that these strains can grow with
reduced sulfur compounds as sole energy (electron) sources using carbon dioxide
as the sole carbon source. Thus, it is likely that these new strains can grow
chemolithoautotrophically and perhaps mixotrophically as well. Microbiological,
chemical, and biochemical strategies will determine the role of these new
strains of magnetotactic bacteria in sulfur and iron cycling and their
chemolithoautotrophic potential. The results obtained from this study will be
invaluable in understanding the overall physiology of magnetotactic bacteria, in
ascertaining the geochemical roles magnetotactic bacteria play in nature, in the
isolation of new strains, and ultimately in how they synthesize their magnetic
mineral component.
