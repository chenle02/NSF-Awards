Many asymptotic problems in econometrics can be formulated in terms of
empirical processes; and some long-standing problems have been successfully
attacked using such techniques. This research will explore the binary choice
model and its generalizations by drawing on both empirical process theory and
theory for convergence of experiments. Work on functional central limit theorems
for dependent variables should also extend the applicability of this approach to
a wider class of semiparametric models of great interest in econometrics. This
research will produce advances in each of the fields of probability, statistics
and econometrics.
