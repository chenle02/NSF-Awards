The impact of orography on winter storms has been recognized for several
decades. It has been established that terrain of significant relief impacts
local weather and current numerical models often do not accurately forecast
extreme weather phenomena that are influenced by the local terrain. Using data
collected from two already completed field programs (Genesis of Atlantic Lows
Experiment and the Stormscale, Operational and Research Meteorology-Fronts
Experiment, Systems Test), the Principal Investigators will conduct numerical
and observational studies of the structure and evolution of fronts and
associated mesoscale weather systems along the East Coast and the continental
United States. Particular attention will be paid to mesoscale rapid
frontogenesis and subsequent mesoscale cyclogenesis over the East Coast when
synoptic-scale flow is impeded by the Appalachian Mountains. Documentation of
scale interactions between the synoptic-scale flow patterns and resulting
mesoscale weather will be emphasized.
