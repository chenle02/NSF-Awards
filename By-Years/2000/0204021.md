AST-0204021&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI Herbig&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has
two goals: (1) To investigate at high resolution the spectra of the so-called
Herbig Ae/Be stars, believed to be intermediate-mass analogs of the young
stellar objects known as T Tauri stars, by concentrating on those of known age
and luminosity because the are members of five well-investigated young star
clusters; and (2) to extend the spectroscopy of several FU Orionis-like eruptive
variable stars in order to clarify a number of possibly critical conflicts with
the standard interpretation of the so-called Fuor phenomenon in this class of
star. The FU Orionis stars are pre-main sequence stars that have brightened
significantly sometimes on short time scales and are not well
understood.&lt;br/&gt;
