Abstract

Principal Investigator: Bradlow, Steven B Proposal Number: DMS - 0755229
Institution: University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign Title: Conference on
Vector Bundles

Mathematics researchers from US institutions will attend an international
Conference on Vector Bundles, to be held in Madrid, Spain, for the period June
16-20, 2008. The conference will serve as the 2008 annual meeting of the Vector
Bundles on Algebraic Curves (VBAC) group, an international network of
mathematicians working on research questions related to vector bundles and their
moduli spaces. The meeting will also honor the 70th birthday of Professor S.
Ramanan, a pioneer in the subject, and will form part of a Semester on Moduli
Spaces organized by a consortium of Spanish mathematics research centers.

Vector bundles and their associated moduli spaces stands at the crossroads of
several areas of mathematics, involving ideas from algebraic geometry, topology,
differential geometry and gauge theory. They have strong connections with
theoretical physics, where the interaction between geometry and string theory
has sparked major advances in both disciplines. After algebraic varieties
themselves, vector bundles are probably the next most studied objects in
algebraic geometry. The speakers and participants invited to the conference
described in this proposal include many of the pre-eminent experts in the field.
