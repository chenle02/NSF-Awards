0203585&lt;br/&gt;Cvetic&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This three-year award for US-Spain
collaboration on particle physics of implications of M-theory involves Mirjam
Cvetic and his students of the University of Pennsylvania and Luis Ibanez and
Angel Uranga at the Universidad Autonoma of Madrid, in Spain. The purpose of the
project is to investigate the fundamental aspects of strings and branes, as well
as the powerful applications of string theory to particle phenomenology,
astrophysics, and cosmology.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The US researchers and
Spanish researchers bring to this collaboration expertise in string model
building and string phenomenology. The Penn theory group has also begun to
broaden the scope of string phenomenology to astrophysical and cosmological
issues. The objectives of the joint project are to bring the state of the art of
model building in new regimes of M theory to the next level.&lt;br/&gt;
