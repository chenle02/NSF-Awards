The major purpose of this planning grant is to conduct an assessment of
Tohono&lt;br/&gt;O'odham Community College's STEM curriculum and infrastructure
in order to&lt;br/&gt;develop an institutional STEM action-plan that will be
used as the basis for a full&lt;br/&gt;TCUP grant to be submitted by May 2004.
Part of this major purpose will be to&lt;br/&gt;work with all of the college's
stakeholders in order to develop partnerships that&lt;br/&gt;will help the
college effectively serve all eleven of the Nation's districts. This
will&lt;br/&gt;result in an effective distance education and
Asynchronous/Synchronous&lt;br/&gt;Learning Environment strategy that allows the
college to serve all eleven of the&lt;br/&gt;Nation's districts with STEM
curriculum and the possibility to graduate using a&lt;br/&gt;place-based
education strategy. The final plan will also include the
development&lt;br/&gt;of assessment instruments designed to determine the
effectiveness of the&lt;br/&gt;college's STEM instructional programs and the
development of tracking&lt;br/&gt;methodologies designed to track college
graduates that transfer to 4-year&lt;br/&gt;colleges and
universities.&lt;br/&gt;
