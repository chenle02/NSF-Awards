This collaborative Rapid Response Research (RAPID) Grant provides funding to
collect field data about damage by Hurricane Isaac to transmission lines,
distribution lines and electrical substations. The power loss resulting from
this hurricane affected more than one million households and businesses, and the
restoration for over 250,000 customers took more than 72 hours. The specific
reasons for these power outages are not known, though it is reported that more
than 40 substations were damaged either by wind or flood. It is important to
collect the data about damages to transmission and distribution lines quickly,
and to determine whether the cause of the damage was by wind or by
flood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The data that will be collected under this award
will be archived on the web site of the American Association for Wind
Engineering enabling access to other researchers. These data will also be
archived by the National Institute of Standards and Technology.
