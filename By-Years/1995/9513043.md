This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in the
microstructure of solid materials between Jean Herve Prevost at Princeton
University and Benjamin Loret at the National Polytechnic Institute, Grenoble,
France. The investigators propose to study strain localization in solid
materials; more specifically, the microstructural effects and computational
aspects. Strain localization is the phenomenon by which deformation in solids
localizes into narrow bands of intense straining. It occurs in many materials of
industrial importance (polycrystals, polymers, geomaterials, for example). The
project takes advantage of the complementary expertise of the investigators and
their previous collaboration on this subject.
