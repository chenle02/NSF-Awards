0115947&lt;br/&gt;MacDonald&lt;br/&gt;This award supports theoretical research
and education directed mainly toward the&lt;br/&gt;electronic properties of
metals and semiconductors. The PI will continue a broad based research program
on (III, Mn)V semiconductors, quantum Hall systems, high temperature
superconductors, aromatic molecular crystals, carbon nanotube systems, and
properties of exotic solid state q-bits.&lt;br/&gt;Work on (III, Mn)V
semiconductors aims to develop a reliable theoretical description of transport
and magnetic properties. Work on quantum Hall systems involves developing
quantum field theory models for quantum Hall ferromagnets at integer fillings,
investigating possible explanations of the huge longitudinal resistance
discovered at Landau filling of 2/3, exploring a real-space picture of composite
fermion correlations, and exploring a theory of double superfluidity and its
possible extensions to the high temperature superconductors. &lt;br/&gt; This
award also contributes to broad and rounded educational experiences in condensed
matter theory at the undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral
levels.&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a broad-based research
program in theoretical condensed matter physics. The work attacks a wide range
of open problems in quantum Hall systems and ferromagnetic semiconductors with
possible repercussions on the fields of high temperatures superconductivity, and
the emerging field of quantum computing. This award directly contributes to the
emerging fields of "spintronics" and nanoelectronics that may form the basis of
future electronic device technologies. The PI is also committed to providing
broad educational experiences in condensed matter theory from the undergraduate
level on up. &lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
