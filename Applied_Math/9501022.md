DMS-9501022 Fehrlbach Molten carbonate fuel cells are promising as clean and
efficient sources of electricity---they have no moving parts, make no noise and
produce no fumes. But the models used to describe them are deficient in certain
aspects. The aim of this research is to develop and study improved mathematical
models for electrochemical fuel cells, particularly molten carbonate fuel cells.
The proposed work begins with the formulation of phenomenological models in
terms of electrochemical potentials derived thermodynamically from the various
reaction mechanisms on the microscale (the scale of the electrode pore
structure). These microscale potential models will be analyzed numerically and
analytically to determine what results can be achieved on this small scale. The
equations will also be used to derive consistent models in terms of species
concentration. Both types of models will be averaged to obtain macroscale models
which can be fit to experimental data. A variety of averaging techniques will be
considered in formulating three- phase homogenized models to obtain a broad
prospective on the relationship between the microscale and the macroscale. An
important part of the work will be addressing questions of interest to the fuel
cell research community and comparing the models to experimental results.
