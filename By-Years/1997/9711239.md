The goal of this research project is to create new algorithms for numerical
function approximation that are particularly suited to value function
approximation in reinforcement learning. These algorithms localize the
approximation error in the domain of the function, and respond by constructing
features that enable further error reduction. It is essential that these
algorithms be able to approximate well even when the function appears to be
changing as learning progresses. The results of this research will be algorithms
that reduce error in a repeatable manner, and that produce an approximation that
is inspectable and understandable. Application tasks for the research will
include instruction scheduling and autonomous agent policy learning. The
research aims to enable practioners who employ automatic learning methods to
achieve more accurate and more understandable results with less human
engineering.
