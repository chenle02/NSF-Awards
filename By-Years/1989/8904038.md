This is a grant under the Scientific Computing Research Equipment for the
Mathematical Sciences program of the Division of Mathematical Sciences of the
National Science Foundation. This program supports the purchase of special
purpose computing equipment dedicated to the conduct of research in the
mathematical sciences. This equipment is required for several research projects
and would be difficult to justify for one project alone. Support from the
National Science Foundation is coupled with discounts and contributions from
manufacturers and with substantial cost-sharing from the institutions submitting
the proposal. This program is an example of academic, corporate, and government
cooperation in the support of basic research in the mathematical sciences. This
equipment will be used to support several research projects in the Department of
Mathematics at the University of California, Los Angeles: Calculations in the
Jacobians of Hyperelliptic Curves, Distribution of Algebraic Numbers, Arithmetic
over Finite Fields, and Linear Recurrent Sequences, directed by David Cantor;
Determination of Cohomology Groups Arising from Conic Curves and Determination
of Witt Rings of Elliptic Curves over Finite Fields, directed by Richard Elman;
Isospectral Deformations of Partial Difference Operators, directed by David
Gieseker; Minimal Free Resolutions of Finitely Generated Modules over the
Symmetric Algebra of a Vector Space, directed by Mark Green; and Galois Groups
over Algebraic Number Fields, directed by Murray Schacher.
