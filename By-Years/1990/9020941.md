The principal investigator will study certain qualitative properties of
incompressible viscous fluids, compressible fluids and mixtures of fluids by
using techniques of modern functional analysis and numerical analysis. In
particular, she will study the long-time asymptotic behavior of solutions of the
Navier-Stokes equations in two and three space dimensions, the equations of
incompressible magnetohydrodynamics in three dimensions, and some integro-
differential equations that model compressible flows. She will also investigate
the global existence in time of solutions of a set of multiphase equations. Very
often one is interested in the behavior of a physical system only after a long
time. For example, once a process is started one might expect that a single type
of stable behavior is the dominant observable output. Deviations from this
stable behavior might be very much unwanted. The principal investigator will
devote most of her efforts to study how various real-world fluid systems behave
for a very long time by using modern techniques from applied mathematics and
numerical analysis.
