This award is aiding in the establishment, enhancement and operation of a
modern laboratory facility to support experimental work in two major areas, viz.
image processing and development of computing environments for mathematical
applications. The project in image processing includes work in image coding,
image restoration and enhancement, digital filtering, texture modeling and
discrimination, image interpretation, computer vision and applications of neural
networks to image understanding. The goal of the second project is the
development of a software environment in which natural scientists and engineers
can solve problems in an efficient and convenient manner. It involves bringing
together state-of-the-art computational tools including high- level graphical
programming environments, languages and compilers that automatically detect
vector and parallel structures, software for the automatic solution of
differential equations, parallel linear algebra packages, integrated computer
algebra systems, an environment for performing graph theoretic operations, and
programming laboratories and libraries of frequently-used procedures and
notions. The project is based on ongoing work at Rensselaer in each of the above
areas and will utilize a large-scale scientific computer, several high-
performance graphics workstations, some Lisp environment/symbolic computation
machines, AI workstations and necessary peripheral equipment.
