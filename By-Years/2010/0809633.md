With the support of the Organic Dynamics Program in the Chemistry Division,
Professor Richard P. Cheng of the Chemistry Department at the State University
of New York at Buffalo (SUNY-Buffalo) will perform research that will serve as a
first step towards understanding the effect of side chain length of charged
amino acids on protein electrostatic interactions, which are important for
stabilizing protein structures, and for protein-protein and protein-ligand
recognition. The proposed studies will provide insight into why nature
incorporates charged amino acids with varying side chain lengths, electrostatic
interactions with phosphoserine, and effects of the helix dipole on intrahelical
ion pairs. These studies will also lay the foundation for utilizing charged
functionalities with various linker lengths in designing peptides, molecules,
and materials for applications in biotechnology.

This research by Professor Cheng of SUNY at Buffalo on the effect of side chain
length on intrahelical electrostatic interactions will provide excellent
training for graduates and undergraduates. Research in Professor Cheng?s lab
will enable students to integrate multiple techniques including organic
synthesis, solid phase peptide synthesis, and statistical mechanical and
conformational analysis. The collaborations in the proposed research will
provide students the opportunity to interact with other scientists. The results
of the research will be presented at professional meetings and published in
peer-reviewed scientific journals. Professor Cheng also proposes to produce and
podcast interviews (by students) with scientists on recent publications in
protein and peptide research. The students will be exposed to the current
frontier of protein and peptide research by interviewing leading scientists and
formulating in depth questions. The podcasts will target the general public and
students with the goal of distributing recent scientific findings, educating the
general public, and recruiting future scientists.
