ABSTRACT Khavinson Using techniques of partial differential equations and
complex analysis, Khavinson plans to study several problems in nonlinear pde's,
approximation theory and potential theory. He will study the argument principle
for solutions of the complex p-Laplace equation and its relation to extremal
problems for analytic functions, qualitative properties of the best
approximations in the mean by analytic functions, the reflection principle and
the "antenna problem", and an inverse problem for double layer potentials. Most
of these problems although stemming from rather classical mathematics will
require the arsenal of the modern tools for their solution and, though quite
basic in their formulation, have been resilient to all attempts to solve them.
All of them have important ramifications in other branches of mathematics and
applications, e.g. the "antenna problem" deals with the search for a best
possible "receiving" antenna for cylindrical waves beyond an obstacle, research
on double layer potentials would allow one to characterize the class of plane
curves and data for which one can solve the most important boundary value
problem - the Dirichlet problem - by direct formulae involving the integrals of
the double layer vs. standard procedures. Khavinson will work in these projects
in collaboration with three graduate students which should have a strong
positive impact on the graduate program and human-resource development in
Arkansas.
