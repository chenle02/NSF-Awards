This award supports the acquisition of a variable pressure scanning electron
microscope and support equipment for an existing film-based transmission
electron microscope. The instrumentation will provide improvements to Florida
Tech University's central multidisciplinary microscopy and imaging facility,
which is the only advanced microscopy and imaging facility in east central
Florida. The improved facility will dramatically enhance ongoing research and
training programs in sensory neurobiology, palynology and climate change,
developmental biology of marine invertebrates, novel fire-retardant polymers,
hydrogen storage materials and molecularly imprinted polymers, novel photonic
nanosensors, and nanoscale semiconductors. Because Florida Tech is a hub of
interaction between NASA, the Kennedy Space Center, private industry, regional
marine laboratories, a local hospital, and state and local governmental
agencies, these instruments will help grow existing partnerships and develop
productive new ones. In addition to graduate training, novel undergraduate
research will also be actively promoted. Through use in primary research, new
training courses, and workshops and symposia, the new instruments will
significantly expand research and training opportunities in the Biological and
Marine Sciences, Nanotechnology, and Materials Sciences groups. These
instruments will also provide an important new forum for ongoing and developing
programs that promote scientific investigation to area high school students and
teachers.
