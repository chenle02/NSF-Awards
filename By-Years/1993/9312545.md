The objective of this program is to evaluate the potential of a Russian
instrument for determining the density of the sea water by measuring the index
of refraction. The former Soviet Union has invested in this research (the insitu
measurement of the index of refraction of the ocean and the use of this data)
for more than 35 years. One direct application is to determine the density of
the sea water as an alternative method to conductivity. Results in shallow
waters are very encouraging. A cooperative US/Russian effort will take place
during which the appropriate Russian scientists will visit the US to describe
and demonstrate their instrument and method. Laboratory facilities will be
provided at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute to prove their equipment and
test it jointly with US scientists. It is expected than an accurate evaluation
of the interferometer as well as the algorithm used, will be done. If
satisfactory, the techniques will be improved and further developed in the US.
