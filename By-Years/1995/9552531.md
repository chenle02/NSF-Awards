9552531 Fisk ABSTRACT: Georgia Public Television is producing and evaluating
one pilot program and accompanying ancillary material for a series of 30-minute
television quiz shows for 8 to 10 year olds. The series would be designed to
entertain a home audience while educating them about issues and facts relating
to nature and the environment. The primary goals of the project are to increase
knowledge about the world around us, to develop a concern for the conservation
of wildlife and wild places, and to encourage critical and creative thinking
skills in relation to the environment. The television programs and the formal
and informal ancillary materials and activities will engage viewers in use and
development of science process skills: observation, classification, measurement,
prediction, inference, identification and manipulation of variables,
interpretation of data, formulation of models, experimentation, construction of
hypotheses, and drawing conclusions. The project is being developed in
collaboration with the Zoo Atlanta, whose staff will have responsibility for
content development, and with educational advisors who will help assure that
age- and developmentally-appropriate skills are exercised and the topics have
the maximum relevance to elementary and middle school science. The senior
producers would be Carol Fisk, a producer with Georgia Public Television and
previously a news producer and correspondent in Great Britain and with the BBC
in Washington, and Nancy Lebens, a Georgia Public Television staff producer.
Cindy Horton, a zoo education program coordinator with Zoo Atlanta, will be the
host.
