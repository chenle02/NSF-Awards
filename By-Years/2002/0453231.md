This Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site's objective is to
actively involve 8 undergraduates in frontier physics research by matching them
up with experienced faculty for 10 weeks during the summer at Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute. The research projects include topics in astrophysics and
astrobiology, condensed matter and optical physics, terahertz science, particle
and nuclear physics. The program features are: hands-on projects carefully
designed by experienced faculty by using existing facilities, building simple
instruments and interfaces, programming for data acquisition, or using computer
modeling and performing data analysis. In addition to daily contact among
participants, faculty, postdocs, and graduate students, there are weekly group
activities such as seminars and field trips. Each research group will hold
weekly group meetings to discuss technical issues regarding experiments or
modeling. At the end of the first week, there are presentations of focused
goals. In the 6th week, each participant will deliver an oral progress
presentation and a written progress report. In the 10th week, each participant
will prepare a poster, make a presentation, and submit a written final report.
The projects and activities are designed to allow students to experience the
challenge, the excitement, and sometimes frustration involved in physics
research outside the classroom as well as nurturing them to become creative
thinkers, life-long learners and team players. The broader impact of the
proposed activities is to attract, encourage and prepare talented students
especially underrepresented groups for a career in the sciences. This project is
co-funded by the Divisions of Physics and Astronomy.
