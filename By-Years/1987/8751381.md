Mathematics learning consists of more than simply memorizing rules and
procedures. Unfortunately, much of the mathematics currently being learned is of
this type. A concensus is emerging, however, that a necessary condition for
students to understand important mathematical concepts is that they posess
multiple representational systems for those concepts and be able to translate
smoothly and efficiently among them. This project will study how we can teach
effectively for students' development of multiple representational systems and
how such instruction affects their development of concepts and skills. Two
computer programs will be designed for this project; one for decimal numeration
and one for algebra. Both programs will present simultaneous, "linked"
representational systems. Students will solve problems by acting directly upon
one representational system with their actions being automatically reflected in
the other. Operations on decimals numbers will be studied for five weeks with a
class of seventh graders. Concepts of expression, identity, linear equation, and
solving linear equations will be studied with pre-algebra eighth graders over a
school year. The basic research methodology will be that of the constructivist
teaching experiment. Through carefully planned individual and small group
interview protocols, a model (models) of student knowledge will be constructed
which describes the relationship beween the representations taught. Curriculum
materials to facilitate mathematical understanding will also be developed. The
proposed research is challenging and should lead to significant advances in
mathematics and science education. The Principal Investigator is highly regarded
in the mathematics education community and this is reflected in this well
conceived research project.
