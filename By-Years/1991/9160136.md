Reactive beam assisted coating (IBAD) of carbides at low temperatures is
difficult with conventional IBAD hardware because no convenient ion source of
carbon exists. Carbides are very useful coating materials with superior hardness
properties and in the case of SiC, exceptional oxidation resistance. Carbide
coating would be more widely used commercially if more deposition techniques
other than high temperature chemical deposition or sputtering were available. A
method is proposed to produce an intense low energy ion beam of carbon that is
particularly well suited for reactive IBAD coating of carbides. The general
technique will be demonstrated using a Silicon carbide coating.
