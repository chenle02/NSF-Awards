This award will support collaborative research between Dr. John Gainer,
University of Virginia and Dr. P.A. Arundel, ICI Pharmaceuticals, Macclesfield,
Cheshire, England. The objective of the proposed research is an investigation of
oxygen consumption in cells and tissues. The manufacture of products from living
cells, whether microbial or animal, depends strongly on a thorough knowledge of
the metabolism of such cells. Dr. Gainer's current research at the University of
Virginia is concerned primarily with factors affecting the production of
secondary metabolites from immobilized microbial cells. Work is also ongoing to
define the metabolic needs of free and immobilized animal cells, in particular
with respect to the oxygen consumption. It has been found that the oxygen
consumption rate per cell is quite similar for both animal and microbial cells,
and is dependent on the density of the cells--decreasing as the density
increases. The next step is to extend these results to very high cell densities.
This can be done, in the case of animal cells, by studying the oxygen
consumption of tissues. ICI, at their Pharmaceuticals Research Center near
Manchester , England, has an active, interdisciplinary group involved in basic
research concerning oxygen consumption and metabolic needs of tissues. During a
four month research stay in England, Dr. Gainer proposes to carry out joint
studies at the ICI Research Center, which will involve both a study of the
factors affecting oxygen consumption in tissues and a comparison of those
results to previous data for individual cells. Dr. Gainer has had considerable
experience in the mass transfer of oxygen to cells and living systems. The
Metabolic Dysfunction Team at ICI has excellent facilities, and has approached
the problem of oxygen consumption and metabolism from a more reaction-controlled
mechanism. The combination of the two viewpoints, along with the facilities
necessary for obtaining data, should complement each other well and allow for a
more complete description of the entire oxygen consumption process.
