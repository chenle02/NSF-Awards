The investigation of electromagnetic transmission through and around structures
has been a classical area of research recently invigorated by the availability
of computational resources combined with the pressures on designers to
incorporate this knowledge into structural transmission through a frequency
selective surface (FSS). The method being employed is the mode-matching
technique, standard, rigorous method for analyzing periodic structures. The
specific apertures of interest in the FSS are rectangle, circle, polygon, cross,
and Jerusalem-cross. Enhanced physical understanding should provide design
information for specific engineering problems, such as antenna radomes,
microwave reflectors, laser mirrors, solar filters, artificial dielectrics, and
advanced composite materials.
