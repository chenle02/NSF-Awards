On 22 October 1988, Hurricane Joan severely damaged 500,000 hectares of
tropical rainforest along the Nicaraguan Atlantic coast. Research in February
1989 indicated that 80% of the trees were uprooted or snapped and that the
canopy was dropped to the ground. Contrary to commonly-held assumptions about
forest succession after disturbance, no evidence was found of extensive invasion
by pioneer species. Rather, intensive surveys at two locations indicated
widespread sprouting from standing trunks, a recuperating palm understory, and a
tree seedling community similar to the original forest. To test a "direct
regeneration" hypothesis of rainforest recovery after catastrophic disturbance,
a three-year monitoring study will be conducted on early events of forest
regeneration. Each year, reseachers will identify, mark and measure all trees
and understory palms and sample tree seedlings in twenty 100 x 10 m permanent
plots at two different sites; similarly survey two undisturbed sites; and census
recolonizing bird and bat fauna twice yearly. There has never been a
quantitative assessment of large-scale wind damage to mainland, species-rich,
lowland rainforests, much less a detailed study of the recovery process. This
research would newly interpret the role of hurricane disturbance in structuring
Central American Atlantic coast rainforests.
