Abstract ATM-9402657 Overpeck, Jonathan T. Miller, Gifford H. University of
Colorado Title: A PALE Lake Sediment Calibration Network for the Eastern
Canadian Arctic This award supports a PALE/ARCSS effort to construct a high-
quality dataset for surficial lake sediment calibration in the eastern Canadian
Arctic. A detailed sampling and analysis program will allow the development of
new calibration data for fossil pollen, isotopic and palelimnological proxies.
Modern numerical analysis will be applied to existing lake-based fossil pollen
records to produce a new generation of quantitative paleoclimate estimates. This
work will result in a large public-domain database, and will make a collection
of surface lake sediments available to the paleoclimate community for additional
research.
