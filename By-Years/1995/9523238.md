CTS-9523238 Leal This experimental study is aimed at understanding the fluid
physics which control the microstructural features of suspensions containing
either solid particles or drops in a viscoelastic or non-Newtonian suspended
liquid. This class of particle-liquid suspensions is a major source of new
materials in the polymer processing industry. Different experimental techniques
will be used to study suspensions of non-colloidal solid particles in a
viscoelastic suspending fluid and emulsions of viqcous or viscoelastic drops.
Optical techniques and two complimentary flow devices will be used to explore
two critical features encountered in processing flows. The class of suspensions
under consideration have the tendency to develop strongly non-uniform particle
concentration distributions, and, in some cases the particles spontaneously
organize into long chains aligned in the flow direction. A computer- controlled
four-roll mill will be adapted to study deformation and breakup for Newtonian
and viscoelastic drops in emulsions.
