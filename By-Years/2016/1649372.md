Mobile devices generate an ever-increasing volume of traffic, are used for a
range of applications from communication to financial transactions, and have
access to personal information. Since mobile user behavior as well as third-
party activities eventually manifest themselves through using the network,
passive network monitoring offers a unique opportunity to detect both legitimate
and malicious activity patterns on the mobile device. This project proposes
AntMonitor - a new framework for real-time, on-device, passive network
monitoring and crowd-sourcing. The goal is to understand, learn and control
patterns in network activity, for applications related to privacy, security,
performance, and behavioral analysis. The research agenda promotes transparency
of mobile data, puts the user in control of how her data are shared or
monetized, and can inform policy makers. Given today's size and personal nature
of mobile data, changing the practices of how mobile devices handle and share
our information can have significant societal impact, primarily in terms of
privacy and security and secondarily in terms of the economics of personal data.
In addition, the project will train students and minorities, and will provide
software tools and data sets to the research community.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;This project will build and deploy AntMonitor - a system for
collection and analysis of fine-grained, large-scale, passive network
measurements from mobile devices. Design challenges that will be addressed
include high performance in terms of network throughput and battery consumption,
and modular design so as to support different applications including (i) privacy
leaks detection and prevention (ii) learning of user and app behavior and
anomaly detection and (iii) network performance monitoring. Each of these
application domains requires its own module in the AntMonitor framework and
faces its own challenges in terms of system design, algorithms and data
analysis. Overall, the project will advance the state-of-the-art in mobile
network monitoring and will improve our understanding of patterns in mobile
network activity. It will produce novel algorithms and data analysis methods
that enhance the performance, security and privacy of mobile devices. A unique
challenge lies in crowd-sourcing and deploying AntMonitor with real users in the
wild. To this end, the project will explore different ways to popularize the
technology, including user-facing apps, libraries, open-source software, and
data-sets available to the community.
