9423848 Goldman The goal of this project is to extend the University of Denver
atlas of high resolution (approx. 0.002 cm-1) infrared solar absorption
stratospheric spectra and the corresponding laboratory and theoretical studies
initiated under previous NSF grants. The currently published high resolution
stratospheric atlas covers several intervals between 800 and 1690 cm-1. For each
interval, accurate line positions with molecular and atomic identifications are
tabulated. Numerous new spectral features have been identified and analyzed. The
major objectives of this research are: 1) to extend the 0.002 cm-1 resolution
atlases over additional intervals in the 2.5-30um region, mostly with solar and
laboratory spectra already obtained, and new spectra anticipated to be obtained
in 1994-1997; 2) to extend the spectroscopic analysis of specific stratospheric
molecules, such as ozone, nitric acid, chlorine nitrate, carbonyl fluoride,
nitrogen dioxide, molecular oxygen, and others, from the laboratory and the
stratospheric spectra. The current atlas work and the supporting laboratory
studies have contributed significantly to our understanding of atmospheric
chemistry through atmospheric and solar spectroscopy, and further contributions
are expected.
