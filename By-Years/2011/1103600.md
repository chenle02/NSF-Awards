This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY
2011, Broadening Participation. The fellowship supports a research and training
plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden
participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this
fellowship to Juan Giraldo is "Carbon nanotubes as sensors for understanding
sugar transport and signaling in plants." The host institution for this research
is the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the sponsoring scientist is
Dr. Michael Strano.

Sugars are key signaling molecules that regulate growth and development in
plants. To date there are no techniques for directly determining the
concentration and location of sugars in living cells of plants. Carbon nanotubes
have been shown to detect sugars such as glucose and other key biological
molecules in animal cells. These nanosensors emit light in the near infrared, do
not photobleach, and enable single particle detection through living tissue.
This research develops this new technique for studying sugar transport and
signaling in plant cells, unveiling the poorly understood pathways of sugar
movement through the vascular system of plants, and testing their hypothesized
role as signals regulating the onset of flowering.

Training objectives include acquiring new techniques in nanofabrication and
imaging at nanoscales. Development of sugar nanosensors for plants promises a
new field of science at the interface of nanotechnology and plant biology. Plant
nanosensors are expected to be capable of monitoring key factors associated with
crop yield, such as plant sugar and nutrient status, under field conditions.
Additional broader impacts include mentoring students, public outreach through
lectures at the MIT Museum, and online videoconferences to K-12 school
communities in Colombia.
