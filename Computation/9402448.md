The investigator and his colleagues organize a workshop on the method of lines
for solving partial differential equations. Major themes are ordinary
differential equation theory and software as applied in method of lines (MOL)
algorithms for time-dependent partial differential equations, theoretical
aspectsof MOL algorithms including error estimation and stability
considerations, the design and development of MOL software, scientific and
engineering applications of MOL software, and the impact of modern computer
architectures, particularly distributed memory parallel processors, on the
structuring and implementation of MOL algorithms. The workshop brings together
both new and experienced researchers in the numerical analysis of ordinary and
partial differential equations to discuss the interaction of their MOL research.
In particular, it facilitates collaboration among theoreticians, designers of
MOL software packages, and researchers applying the MOL to large scale problems,
with the aim of improving parallel implementations, and identifying theoretical
and practical constraints impacting MOL algorithms. Many issues of considerable
current interest, such as global climate change or the behavior of contaminants
in the atmosphereor in groundwater, are influenced by a variety of physical and
chemical processes. These processes can be simulated by mathematical models
solved by techniques in this workshop. As tools in the study of these models,
researchers participating in the workshop are developing advanced computational
techniques for use on high performance computing systems involving parallel
processing. On a computer of this type, several tasks, sometimes as many as
several hundred, can be executed simultaneously. As a consequence, it becomes
feasible to solve more realistic, and usually more complex, models than those
previously considered. The computational speed afforded by techniques discussed
in this workshop permits comprehensive models that can lay a firmer scientific
foundation for policy decisions. With such models, the short-and long-term
effects of a change in policy, for example in emission standards, can be
effectively predicted before a proposed change is actually implemented.
