One way to study complicated objects in mathematics is to compute simpler
"invariants" of the object, which express some (but not complete) information
about the object. This project studies invariants arising from objects
associated to sets of polynomial equations, and how certain invariants are
distributed when considering large families of these objects. For example, if
the invariant is an integer, one may ask how likely the integer is, say, zero
for a "random" object. Such results then translate into a better understanding
of the initial equations and their behavior.

This project involves problems using explicit constructions of moduli spaces in
algebraic geometry, as well as applications of these parametrizations to obtain
statistical information about arithmetic invariants, using methods ranging from
classical algebraic geometry constructions to Lie theory and sieve techniques
from analytic number theory. The PI proposes to work on finding correspondences
between orbits of representations of algebraic groups and moduli spaces of
curves, abelian varieties, and other varieties. The PI also plans to use these
explicit descriptions of the moduli spaces, along with techniques from the
geometry of numbers and analytic number theory, to study the asymptotic growth
of arithmetic data related to the parametrizations. Such applications include
studying the distributions of the ideal class groups of number fields, bounding
the average rank of elliptic curves, and finding densities of curves with a
given number of points.
