This proposal consists of two main sections. The first section deals with
coarse geometry and geometric group theory. The PI (together with D. Fisher and
K. Whyte) has recently developed a new technique, "coarse differentiation",
which can be viewed as a sort of differentiability substitute for quasi-
isometries. Of course, conventional derivatives do not make sense for such maps,
since they are not even defined on small scales; instead we must go to larger
and larger scales. Using this technique, we were able to resolve three
longstanding open problems in the field, namely proving the quasi-isometric
rigidity of the three-dimensional solvable group Sol, exhibiting a transitive
graph which is not quasi-isometric to any Cayley graph, and showing that the two
state and the three state lamplighter groups are not quasi-isometric. We list
some other potential applications of the method, many of which are to problems
which seemed completely out of reach a year ago.

The second section concerns the interrelated analytic study of billiards in
rational polygons, moduli spaces of abelian and quadratic differentials, and the
dynamics of the SL(2,R) action on these moduli spaces. The PI also proposes to
study related questions about the geometry of these spaces, such as their
volumes and their SL(2,R) invariant submanifolds. In particular, the PI has
found by numerical experiment some polygons which seem to have competely
unexpected properties, and proposes to study them further.

Some of the coarse geometry in the the first part of the proposal has unexpected
connections to computer science, in particular the existence of efficient
algorithms for finding ways to disconnect a graph by cutting as few edges as
possible. In fact, one of our proposed problems is taken from this field.

The rational billiard, which is the main subject of study in the second part of
the proposal is important in particular for the following reason: Some natural
phenomena are "chaotic" (i.e. unpredictable). These are often studied by
statistical methods. Others are "integrable" (i.e. predictable and regular).
Other phenomena fit somewhere in between. The polygonal billiard is one of the
simplest known models of intermediate behavior. As such it has been studied
extensively in physics as well, in particular in connection to "quantum chaos".
