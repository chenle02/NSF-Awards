This is an innovative award. The objective is to determine the feasibility of
using H-shaped fiber glass reinforced plastic as the reinforcement for a
concrete beam. The potential benefit would be the elimination of corrosion which
takes place on the conventional steel, thus increasing the life span of concrete
structures.
