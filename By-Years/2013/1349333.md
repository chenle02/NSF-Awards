The National Collegiate Inventors and Innovators Alliance proposes to conduct
two "Lens of the Market workshops" (LOM) designed to provide science and
engineering faculty, post docs and students with an introductory yet
comprehensive core body of information, vocabulary and know-how needed for
successful research to innovation translation all focused on and aligned to the
research being conducted by the Center and its researchers. LOM eworkshops will
mphasize the research of the Center and utilize aligned technical examples for
addressing translation components known to be important for research translation
success relevant to the interests of the Center. The workshops will serve as the
basis for unique translation plans to be developed by each Center based on their
research. Lens of the Market Workshops have covered a wide range of
materials,chemistry and engineering critical research topics.
