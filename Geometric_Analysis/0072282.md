Abstract: Quantum cohomology can be thought of as an algebraic invariant
structure of geometric objects called symplectic manifolds. A birational
transformation can be thought of as a transformation of a symplectic manifold
that is an isomorphism outside of a tiny region where discontinuity can happen.
The motivation of this project is the following question: What is the canonical
transformation of quantum cohomology? Namely, what kind of transformation of
symplectic manifolds will preserve quantum cohomology? The principal
investigator's early results indicate that birational transformations may play
the role of canonical transformation. This project is devoted to the systematic
study of this phenomenon.
