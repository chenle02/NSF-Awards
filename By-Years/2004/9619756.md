9619756 The basic goal of the project is to develop an automatic theorem prover
that can reason about properties of programs in high- level, mathematical
programming languages. The theorem prover will supply the results of its
analysis to programmers by adding hyperlinks to annotations and drawing diagrams
to the program text. The annotations will describe sets of values; the diagrams
will explain the anticipated flow of these values. Both can be used to
understand the program's behavior before it runs. As a result, programmers will
be able to create programs that either do not fail at all or only fail at a
small, well-defined set of program points. While many of the basic properties of
such theorem provers are understood, it is an open question whether they can be
applied to programs of hundreds or thousands of modules with mutual
dependencies. Hence, the central goal of the project is to design a modular,
scalable proof system, to prove its correctness, to engineer a suitable
programming environment, and to apply the theorem prover to itself and its
programming environment. ***
