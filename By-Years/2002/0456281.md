This experimental research program is aimed at new efforts in Terahertz (THz)
Photonics and Surface Plasmons, which have evolved from the group's THz time-
domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) measurements of metal hole arrays and THz-TDS
characterizations of the TEM-mode of the parallel plate waveguide. Using
waveguide THz-TDS, the group has characterized with record sensitivity a 20 nm
layer of adsorbed water, thereby opening new opportunities. They plan the first
propagation measurements of THz surface plasmon waves, by using their multiple
reflections to generate a train of freely propagating THz pulses. Overall they
propose extremely sensitive waveguide THz-TDS measurements of adsorbed
molecules, surface layers, Langmuir Blodgett films, films of metals, alloys, and
conducting polymers. The broader impact of the program lies in the applications
and in science education.
