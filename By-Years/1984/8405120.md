Travel support will be provided for U.S. participants to the Eighth
International Enzyme Engineering Conference to be held in Elsinore, Denmark.
This conference will bring together chemical engineers, biochemists,
microbiologists, physical chemists, analytical chemists, and polymer chemists
from academic, industrial, and other backgrounds who are working on various
aspects of the production, purification, immobilization, and application of
soluble and immobilized enzymes and cells in industrial processing, analytical
chemistry, and medicine. Attendance at the meeting will give a number of U.S.
engineers an important opportunity to update and improve their knowledge of
European and worldwide activities in enzyme engineering.
