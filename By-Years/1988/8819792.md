The absorption lines observed in the spectra of quasars have been used to study
the interstellar gas and the clustering of galaxies at distances beyond where
they are observable directly, thus leading to important conclusions about the
evolution of galaxies and the evolution of the large-scale structure of the
Universe in cosmic time. These observations are to be extended in order to study
the composition of primordial gas clouds and the early evolution of the
compositions of galaxies. A search is to be completed for evidence of weak
quasar-like activity in the centers of 501 nearby galaxies. The ultimate aim is
to cast light on whether the majority of galaxies were luminous quasars in the
remote past and if they contain inactive black holes which are now starved of
fuel in the form of infalling stars or interstellar gas.
