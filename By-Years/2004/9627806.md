9627806 Barazangi The collision between Africa and Europe in the Western
Mediterranean region resulted in a complex plate boundary with a broad zone of
deformation. Mesozoic rift structures have been reactivated by the current
tectonism, which itself occupies the foreland position of the collisional zone
extending from Morocco to Tunisia. There are several examples of such intraplate
mountain ranges but this one is tectonically active, and thus offers an
opportunity to investigate active deformation mechanisms in this environment.
The work involves kinematic analysis of microtectonic data and earthquake focal
mechanisms. This project is a joint research effort with Moroccan institutions,
principally the Geological survey of Morocco. Results are expected to be
applicable to similar tectonics problems elsewhere.
