This research comprises Phase II of an SBIR project. In Phase I, primary and
secondary fluorescent X-ray intensities were simulated for ternary (Ni-Fe-Cr)
systems using an inverse Monte Carlo model in such a way that the weight
fractions of the three elements could be determined from the simulation given
the X-ray intensities for unknown samples. In Phase II, the research seeks to
extend the model to include higher-order fluorescence and source photon scatter
within the sample, to perform sensitivity analyses, to develop a means to
perform system design optimization, and to benchmark the model against
experimental data. the result of this work is expected to be a software package
that performs the quantitative analysis of input X-ray spectra for arbitrary
source- sample-detector configurations and multi-element homogeneous or
heterogeneous samples. If successful, the project could result in a commercial
application for sample chemical analysis that could be of significant value.
