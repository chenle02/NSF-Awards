9307497 Schonbek This project consists of two parts: a) a study of the large
time behavior of solutions to equations of magnetohydrodynamics and multiphase
flow, and an investigation of the influence of the nonlinear terms on the
behavior of the solutions in the far field. More precisely it will be shown that
the nonlinear terms in frequency space produce some mixing of the modes which
introduce long waves that will slow down the decay; b) a study of an analogue to
a fluid motion on the circle, its stability and long time behavior. The
expectation is that the methods used here can be extended to the three
dimensional sphere.%%% These projects analyze models of viscous fluid equations
which incorporate nonlinear effects. Interest is focused in understanding the
behavior of the fluids as time gets large and one goal is to demonstrate that
the motion of such fluids take longer in slowing down than the motion of fluids
which are purely dissipative. This study could lead to a better understanding of
turbulence and may find applications in weather prediction. ***
