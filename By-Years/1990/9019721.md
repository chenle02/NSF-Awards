An outstanding problem in tectonics is the nature and timing of extensional
collapse of previously thickened crust in orogenic belts. This proposal is to
date structural features attributed to the extensional collapse of the
Caledonian orogen in southwest Norway. Structural features to be dated include:
uplifted high- pressure eclogite rocks; retrograde, amphibolite facies meta-
morphism, and; major, km-thick mylonite zones, some of which are at greenschist
grade. High-precision data will be obtained using the 40Ar/39Ar dating method
and will allow comparison of uplift ages among different areas. Collaboration
with local geologists from the University of Olso will ensure that the data are
obtained with good structural control. The combination of well-known local
geology and excellent exposure in SW Norway, with high-precision ages and
testable tectonic models, will significantly improve the understanding of
orogenic collapse processes.
