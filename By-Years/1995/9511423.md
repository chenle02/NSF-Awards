IBN-9511423 Brinton, Roberta F. Learning and memory are complex functions that
are dependent upon many brain regions of which the cerebral cortex is one of the
principal players. Growth in the projections emanating from cortical neurons is
a structural feature shown to be associated with learning and memory. In fact, a
chemical messenger, vasopressin has been shown to enhance memory functions and
numerous recognition sites have been found for vasopressin in the cerebral
cortex. However, there is little functional information on the role of
vasopressin within the cortex. Dr. Brinton will determine whether activation of
vasopressin recognition sites leads to an increase in the growth of nerve cells
from the cerebral cortex. Additional studies will determine whether vasopressin
modulates the function of critical support cells in the brain, which markedly
influence the growth and survival of cortical nerve cells. These studies will
provide a functional basis for understanding how messenger molecules influence
learning and memory by altering cellular physiology in the cortex.
