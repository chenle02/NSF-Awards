The Department of Physics and Astronomy at Middle Tennessee State University
proposes a 4-year enhancement program for physics teachers. The pedagogical
basis for the program is the national project "Constructing Physics
Understanding (CPU) in a Computer Supported Learning Environment" developed at
San Diego State University with the support of the National Science Foundation.
Modules have been developed for Light and Color, Static Electricity and
Magnetism, Current Electricity, Motion and Forces, Waves and the the Small
Particle Model. A faculty team from Tennessee has attended the sessions in San
Diego delivered by Professor F. Goldberg, the PI on the CPU project. This team
will work with the 75 physics teachers.

During a 6-week period spanning two summers, with follow up meetings during the
academic year, teacher participants will complete 4 modules of the CPU program
and practice discovery laboratory activities that complement CPU.
