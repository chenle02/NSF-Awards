This project involves a computer laboratory in sociology consisting of high-
speed personal computers networked to the institution's mainframe computer. A
projection system and notebook computers are also used in the classroom. The
project has permitted the department to enhance its curriculum at both the
introductory and advanced levels by significantly extending the teaching of
social scientific reasoning and analysis, and by increasing opportunities for
undergraduate student involvement in sociological research.
