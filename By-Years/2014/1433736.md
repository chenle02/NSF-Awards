This project seeks to establish a new CyberCorpsÂ®: Scholarship for Service (SFS)
program at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) to prepare highly-
qualified Cybersecurity professionals for entry into the federal, state, local,
and tribal government workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rochester Institute of
Technology plans to provide CyberCorps scholarships to talented students
enrolled in undergraduate programs in Computing Security, Computer Science, and
Software Engineering. These students will receive an MS degree in Computing
Security in addition to a BS in their respective programs upon graduation. This
proposal aims to leverage the well-established Computing Security, Computer
Science, and Software Engineering programs to educate next generation
cybersecurity professionals and to create a unique cohort experience of students
from multiple disciplines. It will allow students to learn cybersecurity from
different perspectives while unifying them by shared experience: common
coursework, monthly seminars, work on research projects, and travel to security
conferences. CyberCorps scholarship requirement will build on RIT's well-
established undergraduate cooperative education (co-op) model. This proposal
leverages RIT?s infrastructure, diverse programs, faculty resources, and
industry/military relationships to support a pool of qualified candidates who
are interested in pursuing careers in cybersecurity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RIT's
SFS graduates will become part of the government cybersecurity workforce. Their
scholarly contributions will be disseminated at professional conferences related
to cybersecurity. The PIs will discuss lessons learned in running this
CyberCorps program at appropriate venues in educational and federal settings
such as CISSE Colloquium or NICE conferences. The PIs and the SFS scholars will
visit the City of Rochester schools with a large population of underrepresented
groups in computing. Student scholars will increase awareness of cybersecurity
threats and teach students basic skills how to stay safe online.
