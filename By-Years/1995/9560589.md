9560589 Halverson This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
will investigate a low-cost manufacturing process for miniature thin film
electroluminescent (TFEL) displays. A TFEL head mounted display (HMD) will be
based on passive matrix addressing and indium bump bonded drive electronics.
Passive matrix addressing is expected to simplify fabrication and improve HMD
manufacturing by decreasing the number of high voltage drive transistors
required for display operation. Additional improvements in producibility are
expected due to separate fabrication and test of the miniature TFEL panel and
drive chips. Ion implantation of multicolor activators through high resolution
masks will be used to introduce luminescent centers selectively and form color
pixels. Miniaturization of the TFEL panel would allow high refresh rates and,
therefore, a high-brightness display. Low cost, miniaturized TFEL displays will
be used in applications requiring hands-free transfer of information such as
equipment maintenance, telepresence surgery, and simulators for training. The
largest potential commercial use will be high-performance virtual reality
entertainment systems.
