The Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program supports the
work of Professor Richard E. Sykora of the University of South Alabama focusing
on the synthesis, structure, spectroscopy, and catalytic properties of new
classes of heterobimetallic lanthanide cyanometallate complexes. Ancillary
ligands will be used to direct the formation of low dimensional M-M and M-Ln
(M=Ag or Au, and Ln = lanthanide) interactions. This research builds upon
fundamental knowledge in the area of bimetallic catalysts and lays the framework
for future studies leading towards alternative energy sources (fuel cells).
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New teaching tools for high school teachers, regular
teaching workshops and school visits have been enabled through this CAREER
award. Undergraduate students at this primarily undergraduate institution
receive training on a new CCD-based x-ray diffractometer system and are involved
in collaborative research efforts at Oak Ridge National Laboratory over the
summer months. The results of their research on f-element chemistry is
incorporated into the chemistry curriculum at the University of South Alabama
and at other institutions nationally.
