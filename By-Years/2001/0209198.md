This research concerns the use of simultaneous multithreaded (SMT) processors
for soft real-time applications such as multimedia applications. SMT processors
have the potential to provide high throughput by running multiple threads at the
same time, and soft real-time applications are an increasingly important
workload. The use of SMT processors for real-time applications, however, has
largely been unexplored.

Most work on SMT has been driven by the goal of increasing throughput. Real-time
applications additionally require high schedulability (i.e., the ability to meet
deadlines) and predictability. Further, such applications often run in energy
and thermal power constrained environments. This work seeks to develop co-
schedule selection and resource sharing algorithms (and consequent admission
tests) for SMT processors that will (1) maximize instruction throughput, (2)
maximize schedulability, (3) maximize execution time predictability, (4)
minimize energy, and (5) minimize thermal power, for soft real-time applications
such as multimedia applications. This is the first work that considers the
issues of temporal schedulability and predictability, and integrates them with
energy and thermal considerations, for real-time applications and SMT. Without
this research, an increasingly important class of workloads would be unable to
exploit an architectural advance that has provided large benefits in other
domains.
