The objective of this project is to identify factors responsible for arrested
succession in old-fields in a tropical rainforest in Mexico. Four arrested old-
fields will be compared with four fields in late succession, defined by the
abundance of the indicator species of late succession, Cecropia obtusifolia. The
factors involved in its absence in arrested fields will be investigated from the
seed to the sapling stage. Soil seed bank and its viability will be compared
between arrested and non-arrested stages. Space availability as potential
colonization sites will equally be compared. Sown seeds, following two different
densities, will be followed to determine removal by predators and seed
viability. These will be compared between stages. Growth and survival of the
seedlings will be compared between arrested and non-arrested sites, until they
reach the sapling stage. Microclimatic and edaphic conditions will be monitored
for possible correlation with growth and survival of the seedlings. Factors
preventing C. obtusifolia from occurring in arrested sites may indicate forces
detaining succession, which are important to control fallow periods in
traditional agriculture.
