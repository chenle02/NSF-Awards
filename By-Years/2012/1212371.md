With this award, the Chemistry Division is supporting David Lynn of Emory
University, E. Virginia (Ginger) Armbrust of the University of Washington and
Cynthia Burrows of the University of Utah to conduct a workshop, co-funded by
NASA, and entitled, "Empirical Approaches to Alternative Chemistries of Life".
The workshop in to take place in Alexandria, VA over the period of April 1-4,
2012, with roughly 30-35 invited participants from the fields of chemistry,
virology, biology and geochemistry, many of whom will never have interacted with
one another before. The goal is to achieve cross-pollination toward the end of
asking bold questions about how and where one would look in search of new
molecules of life, new mechanisms for self-organization or new chemical bases of
life. The organizers propose to explore a number of themes that range from the
molecular level to the ecosystem/systems biology level. The workshop
participants will be chosen to represent both a diverse range of scientific
disciplines, and diverse demographics, including an international component. The
findings of this workshop will be disseminated in the form of a report for the
community. It is expected that the workshop and its report will stimulate new
types of experiments, including interdisciplinary ventures not previously
undertaken, in search of new chemistries relevant to the emergence and
sustenance of living systems.
