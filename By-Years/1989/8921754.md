This award supports a cultural anthropologist studying the history of the
abandonment of infants in nineteenth century Italy. At that time many
institutions were established in Europe to deal with this phenomenon. This
project will apply the methods of historical demography to trace the fate of
these infants through a combination of resources: archives of a foundling home
in Bologna, nineteenth-century documents and other literature describing the
foundling home system, archives of the community that the foundling home was
situated in, and recent Italian historical studies documenting this phenomenon.
Changes in the prevalence of abandonment will be analyzed with reference to
changes in Italian society. This research is important because infant
abandonment waxes and wanes with changes in the social, political and economic
situations of families. Increased understanding of the history of this
phenomenon will help us understand how to avoid it in the present time.
