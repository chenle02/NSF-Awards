This award supports the participation of 13 U.S. scientists in a U.S.-Japan
Seminar on Macromolecular Design for Advanced Materials, to be held in Napa
Valley, California November 6 to 12, 1993. The co-organizers are Professor
Virgil Percec of Case Western Reserve University and Professor Yukio Imanishi of
Kyoto University. The focus of the meeting will be on the most recent advances
in the elaboration of novel polymerization methods and their use in the design
of new and well-defined complex macromolecular architectures capable of
generating advanced materials with controlled optical, electronic, ionic,
biomedical, high-strength and other special properties. This meeting is the
sixth in a series of U.S.-Japan seminars in this field held over a period of 18
years. The seminar is timely because advanced materials underlie current and
projected developments in the electronics, communications, aerospace,
automotive, and health care industries. Important contributions are being made
in each of these areas in the United States and Japan, and increased exchange of
ideas and information should lead to further collaborative research between
scientists in the two countries.
