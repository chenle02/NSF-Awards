The purpose of this research is to develop several applications of the
Likelihood Principle for investigating macroeconometric problems that have been
difficult to address using classical methods. Further, methods will be devised
for evaluating the performance of these procedures in repeated samples, and for
illustrating the impact of a broad range of different assumptions on the
results. The first consideration is whether macroeconomic time-series-data are
best described as integrated or trend- stationary. The performance of Classical
integration and co- integration tests will be compared against trend-stationary
alternatives. In addition, a method will be devised for examining the
performance of macroeconomic models from a Bayesian perspective, and to seek the
appropriate interpretation of classically obtained results. Finally, the theory
of dynamic games will be extended to models in which the structure of the
relevant model is not known with certainty. This research is important because
it will provide better methods for analyzing time-series-data, which is the type
of data used in much of the empirical research in economics and the other social
sciences.
