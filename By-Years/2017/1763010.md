This award provides travel and lodging support for participants in a Workshop on
Schubert Calculus, to take place May 9-12, 2018, at the Ohio State University in
Columbus, Ohio. The topic of the conference has its origins in 19th century
enumerative geometry, when mathematicians computed numbers of geometric figures
satisfying various conditions. The subject grew into a testing ground for
Intersection Theory, which is now a cornerstone of modern mathematics. This
workshop will bring together researchers and students coming from different
backgrounds, to present various points of view on the subject of Schubert
Calculus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A large part of Schubert Calculus concerns the
cohomology rings of Grassmannians and flag manifolds, as well as their
generalizations. The subject has deep connections to combinatorics,
representation theory, and algebraic geometry, and the last 15 years have seen
remarkable developments in the techniques of Schubert Calculus. A guiding
problem is to find combinatorial formulas for the multiplication of Schubert
classes in flag varieties; several new cases of this problem were solved. New
research has extended our understanding of Schubert calculus to the infinite-
dimensional affine (and Kac-Moody) flag varieties, simultaneously deepening the
connection with representation theory. Major goals of this conference include
sharing new results and introducing a new generation of students to the
techniques, applications, and open problems in the field. More details about the
workshop are available at https://people.math.osu.edu/anderson.2804/schub2018.ht
