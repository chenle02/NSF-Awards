Mathematical Sciences (21): This project is preparing teams to bring together
research mathematicians and middle school teachers of mathematics through the
use of Teacher's Circles. These Circles are groups of mathematicians and school
mathematics teachers that meet regularly to do mathematics. Such Circles have
been shown to be mathematically stimulating for both the teachers and the
mathematicians and the students of both benefit from the relationship.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is forming new Teacher's Circles in many
different geographical locations across the U.S. To accomplish this goal, the
project first brings together a collection of teams to attend one of two five-
day workshops, one held in Palo Alto, California, and one held in Washington,
D.C., in the summer of 2008, to learn how to run a Teacher's Circle and to plan
the launch of each team's own Teacher's Circle in the summer of 2009. Each team
consists of at least one mathematician, at least two middle school teachers, and
at least one administrator/recruiter/fund-raiser, all from the same geographic
area. During the workshops, the morning activities will simulate actual
Teacher's Circles and the afternoon activities will be devoted to planning the
launch of the new Teacher's Circles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The
proposed workshops will lead to the formation of as many as 10 - 14 new
Teacher's Circles around the U.S. Each of those will lead to a program that will
enhance the knowledge base, the mathematical confidence, the ability to tackle
new problems, and the willingness to take risks in up to 25 middle school
teachers. These 300 teachers each meet with up to 100 middle school students per
day; the net impact of the new Teacher's Circles will be to enhance the
mathematical experiences of up to thirty thousand middle school students per
year.
