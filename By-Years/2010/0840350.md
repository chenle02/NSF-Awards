CBET-0755308&lt;br/&gt;Love&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this proposed
study is to address the bioavailability of effluent organic nitrogen (EON))
wastewater treatment facilities which provides biological nutrient removal. The
research is intended to provide basic information that can lead to reliable
bioassays to determine the effect of a wastewater plant discharge EON on the
receiving surface water and contribution to eutrophication. An excellent
background on known factors that affect the availability of organic nitrogen in
surface waters was presented and reflected the diverse backgrounds of this
collaborative research group; environmental engineer, biological oceanographer,
organic geochemists, and chemical oceanographer. Basic hypothesis for the
research is that the bioavailability of EON is related to salinity concentration
and light and that the biota in the surface water may be different at different
salinity locations and possibly have different EON conversion and uptake
characteristics. The research would investigate the effect of different seed
sources on the EON bioavailability. The proposal provides a plan to assess the
biological populations, the level of algae growth by. Chlorophyll รก measurement,
the availability of the EON based on molecular weight size, and application of
chemistry methods to assess the elemental composition of the EON and molecular
characterization. The ability to develop a bioassay for the bioavailability of
EON and to determine what amount from wastewater plant effluents is
biodegradable will have far reaching impacts. First it would provide water
quality managers and modelers scientific basis on whether to treat all effluent
nitrogen as bioavailable as they now do or to account for a possible
recalcitrant fraction that has not affect on eutrophication activity and thus
does not contribute to developing hypoxia conditions that are harmful to fish.
The bioassay tool can help guide wastewater plant designs as effluents from
different operations can be used to determine if different design or operating
conditions affect the EON bioavailability. Other important impacts are a summer
mini school that can use this project and water quality issues in the Chesapeake
Bay area as local and real scenario for study by the public. The work will be
showcase and model for interdisciplinary research on a large scale problem. This
type of training and education will have a long term impact on the graduate
students working on the project. The PIs have also had successful summer
research experiences for undergraduates as part of past NSF studies.
