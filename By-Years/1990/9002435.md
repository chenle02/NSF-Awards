This project is concerned with research on extremal forms. The principal
investigator will study sums of d-th powers of linear forms over the fields of
real and complex numbers as well as situations when positive semi-definite forms
need not be sums of squares of forms. This research concerns the study of real
positive semi- definite forms. It involves interplay among algebra, inequalities
and geometry.
