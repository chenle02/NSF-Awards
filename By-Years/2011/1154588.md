Through the "Building a Community of MESA/STEM Scholars Initiative" (MESA stands
for Mathematics, Engineering, Science Achievement), City College of San
Francisco (CCSF) is supporting a total of up to 250 scholarships for a diverse
group of academically talented, financially needy students across the STEM
disciplines. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each year, CCSF recruits a minimum of 40
students from the CCSF School of Science and Mathematics to apply for the S-STEM
scholarship program who are both financially needy and academically talented -
and who are representative of the great diversity of CCSF overall. Scholarship
participants receive one-on-one academic counseling and participate in cohort-
building activities that expose and link them to a wide range of career
opportunities and provide them with personal empowerment
strategies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project provides students access to
numerous innovative initiatives in the STEM fields currently in place at CCSF,
including cutting-edge programs in biotechnology (such as stem cell technology),
computer networking and information technology (including the convergence of
optical and network systems), and several others.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;As a
community college, CCSF provides one of the most affordable educational options
in the San Francisco Bay Area, and through this program it offers extraordinary
educational access to STEM students from a broad range of ethnic, economic,
cultural, and age backgrounds. Due to its affordability, even a small award
substantially relieves CCSF students of financial burdens that often inhibit
their academic success.
