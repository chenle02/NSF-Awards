The lungfishes represent an important group in the origin of terrestrial
vertebrates. Important new fossil materials in two fossil genera have been
collected. These specimens will be studied and described in detail. The newly
described specimens will permit the reconstruction of the evolutionary history
of the lungfishes including a dramatic transition that occurred approximately
350 million years ago at the end of the Devonian, resulting in the evolution of
the modern lungfishes. It has been theorized that this morphological transition
resulted from paedomorphosis, a process where juvenile characters come to be
expressed in adult animals. Paedomorphosis may be an important macroevolutionary
process.
