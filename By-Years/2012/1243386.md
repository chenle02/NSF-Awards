The NSF Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SATC) program provides an opportunity
for its principal investigators and the larger community of cyber security
researchers to discuss the latest advances in cyber security, demonstrate
technical accomplishments, and advise NSF on promising future research
directions. This proposal defines a technical program agenda that highlights the
contributions of the participating NSF directorates, and addresses the research
themes, established in the OSTP Strategy for the Federal Cybersecurity Research
and Development Program, especially including accelerating transition to
practice, developing scientific foundations, and strengthening education and
training in cyber security.
