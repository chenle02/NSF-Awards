This project will combine experimental and computational approaches to
demonstrate the role of weak selection in Drosophila genome evolution. Both
amino acid-altering and "silent" mutations in protein coding genes may affect
the rate and accuracy with which proteins are synthesized. Genome sequence and
expression data will be employed to identify amino acids that allow efficient
translation. DNA sequence comparisons among close relatives of Drosophila
melanogaster will determine whether selection for efficient synthesis acts as a
global force in protein evolution. &lt;br/&gt; Mutations with subtle effects on
cell physiology may play a major role in biological adaptation. However, because
the fitness effects of "nearly neutral" mutations lie well outside the range
that can be measured directly, comparative DNA sequence analyses may provide the
only means of identifying such forces in natural populations. Understanding the
forces that constrain protein evolution will inform the design of genes for
heterologous expression and DNA vaccination and will aid in identification of
homologous proteins in humans and model genetic organisms. This research will
also provide opportunities for educators and high school students to conduct
summer research projects in genome evolution. In addition, a database of
Drosophila DNA sequences will be made publically available.&lt;br/&gt;
