TC: Small: Taint-Based Information Tracking in Networked Systems&lt;br/&gt;PI:
Nick Feamster (Georgia Tech)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Network operators must control
and monitor the flow of information within and across their networks. Existing
mechanisms for controlling information flow are primarily host-based: operating
systems can "taint" portions of memory or applications based on the inputs to a
particular process or resource. Unfortunately, if a host is compromised or
otherwise breached, that information may propagate in unintended ways. Once
information has leaked, tracking the provenance of the leaked data is
challenging. This project is developing a mechanism for tracking and controlling
information flow across the network to cope with these problems. This mechanism
would allow operators to control how information propagates within and between
networks and to devise more complex policies; for example, it might be used to
control which application traffic was allowed on which part of the network. The
information carried in the network traffic might ultimately be attributed to a
specific user or process, thus allowing operators to express policies according
to the process and user that generated the traffic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We are
addressing several research challenges. First, we are exploring the appropriate
granularity for tainting that preserves semantics without imposing unacceptable
memory and performance overhead. Second, we are designing the system to minimize
performance overhead on applications. Third, we are exploring translation
mechanisms between host-based taints and network-based taints, so that taints
carried in network traffic convey meaningful semantics without imposing
prohibitive network overhead. The research will result in an information
tracking and control system that is deployed&lt;br/&gt;in experimental settings
(e.g., the Georgia Tech campus network) using the existing and forthcoming
programmable switch implementations, and integrated into undergraduate and
graduate networking and security courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
