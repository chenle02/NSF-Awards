The study of Lorentz manifolds may be motivated by physical considerations,
since the Einstein field equations determine Lorentz metrics on space-time.
Following F.~Klein's Erlanger program, one method of approaching a geometric
object is to study its group of isometries, and it has long been known that the
isometry group of a Lorentz manifold is a Lie group. Moreover, any Lie group
acts on itself (by left translation) preserving any left-invariant Lorentz
metric. However, as originally noticed by R.~Zimmer, M.~Gromov, and N.~Kowalsky,
if one requires even a small amount of complication to the dynamics, then the
list of Lie groups admitting a Lorentz action becomes quite restricted. My work
over the last few years has focused on quantifying exactly which connected Lie
groups admit a complicated action by isometries of a connected Lorentz manifold.
As the definition of ``complicated'' varies, the answer varies, and I intend to
look at a few more of these variations over the coming years. In particular, I
would like to determine the collection of connected, noncompact, simple Lie
groups admitting a locally faithful, nontame, isometric action on a connected
Lorentz manifold. I believe it should be true that any such group either has
infinite center or is locally isomorphic to the Lie group of 2 by 2 real
unimodular matrices.

A Lorentz manifold, or ``space-time'' is one of the basic object of general
relativity. Some of these objects have many symmetries, while most have none at
all. Fix a space-time having a large collection of symmetries. For any point in
this space-time, if we move it around by all the symmetries under consideration,
the collection of image points so obtained is called the ``orbit'' of the point.
A number of researchers have noticed that it is difficult to construct a space-
time with chaotic orbits, by which we mean, broadly speaking, that some orbits
repeatedly return (or nearly return) to the same place. There are, in fact, many
ways to define precisely the word chaotic, and this means that a number of
different theorems have been obtained. I intend to continue developing results
along these lines.
