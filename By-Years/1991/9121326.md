For Einstein, principles of covariance were the essence of his special and
general theories of relativity (1905 and 1915). They embodied the advances made
by the theories. The transition from an aether theory with an absolute state of
rest to special relativity was effected through the requirement that the laws of
special relativity must be covariant under Lorentz transformation. Since the
Lorentz covariance of special relativity mapped inertial frames of reference
onto inertial frames of reference, the Lorentz covariance of special relativity,
as presented in Einstein's celebrated 1905 paper, was sufficient to guarantee
that the theory satisfied the principle of relativity of inertial motion. Dr.
Norton is examining the history and development of principles of covariance in
relativity theory and their connection with relativity principles, Mach's
principle and the principle of equivalence. He is considering how the ideas in
this whole area have developed since Einstein's time and is tracing how the now
standard modern view has come to disagree almost completely with Einstein's own
view--the view universally celebrated 70 years ago. This study promises to
present historians, philosophers and physicists with a synoptic view of the
tangled and confusing developments of one of the most important problems in
foundations space and time theory.
