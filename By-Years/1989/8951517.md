Computer-aided design and manufacture are essential components of the
educational experience of engineering undergraduates. A CAD/CAM laboratory is
created for use by all mechanical and aerospace students in conjunction with a
required machine shop junior course and as part of the junior and senior
independent work of many student. By locating this laboratory in the central
student shop facility, the equipment will also be available to students in other
departments, and be under the supervision of a professional machinist charged
with undergraduate instruction. This laboratory will build on CAD/CAM experience
gained in the sophomore year involving real-time control, actuators and sensors,
and robotics. This initial step will establish a laboratory with a three-
dimensional CAD/CAM capability, network data transfer between work-stations and
the machine controller, and a numerically controlled three-axis milling machine
capable of fabricating full-scale components. Other equipment will be acquired
as experience is gained.
