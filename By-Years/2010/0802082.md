Stein's method is a powerful technique for proving approximation and limit
theorems in probability. The investigator hopes to develop versions of it which
can be used to solve problems of interest to researchers in mathematical
physics, spectral theory, and Markov chain theory. After completing works in
progress related to Stein's method, the investigator will focus on four specific
goals. The first goal is to use Stein's method to study determinantal point
processes, which appear in random matrix theory, tiling problems, percolation,
queuing theory, and elsewhere. The second goal is to continue the investigator's
work on Stein's method and the spectrum of random walks, focusing on non-normal
distributions, concentration inequalities, and convergence rates. The third goal
is to use Stein's method to study error terms in Markov chain theory: central
limit theorems and large deviations for Markov chains, hitting times, and the
cutoff phenomenon. A fourth goal is to extend the scope of Stein's method to
non-reversible settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In making decisions of
public policy, it is important that one draws correct conclusions from the data
available. A drawback to many of the statistical methods applied today is that
the accuracy of the conclusions is unclear. As one example, in determining
whether there is gender bias in the promotion of employees, it is common to use
a statistical test called the chi-squared test. As a second example, work on DNA
sequences of interest to biotechnology and health uses Poisson approximations
from probability theory. As a third example, in physics and chemistry one uses
Markov chain methods to test theoretical models. These methods are routinely
applied so it is important to quantify their validity. A remarkable technique,
introduced by Charles Stein at Stanford, offers hope of better quantifying the
accuracy of such procedures. Stein's method has proven successful in
applications to DNA sequencing, but the technique is largely unexplored. The
investigator plans to extend the scope and applicability of this method. As a
final goal, the investigator will study the use of Stein's method in Markov
chain theory, which as mentioned above, is crucial to drawing reliable
conclusions from computer simulations. &lt;br/&gt;
