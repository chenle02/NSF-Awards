This Career Advancement Award will enable Dr. Mary Jane Shultz to shift her
research empahsis from electronic-vibrational state specific reactivity to the
less well defined area of reactions on liquid interfaces. The project will
develop spectroscopic and molecular probes capable of examining liquid
interfaces. Ionic species will be studied at the interface by second harmonic
generation and by FTIR. Structural and dynamic parameters will be measured and
interpreted in terms of how ions interact with liquid interfaces. %%% This
proposal develops a program which can provide new information on the
interactions of gases with liquids. The work is important because many
environmental problems are related to such interactions. The work can lead to a
better understanding of environmental chemistry and to ways that such problems
as air pollution can be minimized.
