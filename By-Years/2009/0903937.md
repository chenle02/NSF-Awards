This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coherent electromagnetic radiation in
the form of laser light holds enormous promise for future information technology
but only if suitable materials capable of capturing and efficiently maintaining
the coherence can be found or developed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our idea is to
investigate strong coupling between the optical field and the quantum system
that may be achieved in the limit of purely radiative decay of the excited
states. This project will perform experiments to study the formation and
dissipation of the coherence in a special class of crystalline materials
containing resonantly absorbing rare earth ions having promising nearly
radiative-limited decoherence properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to
find a solid material that would allow a large number of operations (instead of
currently feasible few operations) before the system loses track of its coherent
or entanglement state. If successful, such systems will provide the key
components of future quantum super-computers as well as eavesdropping-proof data
communication systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the work will
include the training of students in these fields and collaborations with local
technological industry.
