In this project funded by the Organic Dynamics Program in the Chemistry
Division, Professor C. David Gutsche of the Chemistry Department at Texas
Christion University will investigate the "Mechanism, Scope, Limitations, and
Applications of Phenol-Formaldehyde Reactions". One of the goals of this
project, is to determine the mechanism by which cyclic oligomers and other
products are formed in these reactions. These studies are also of importance in
enhancing an understanding of the demulsifiers used in the oil industry. This
project will study the mechanism of formation of cyclic oligmers from the
reactions of p-alkylphenols with methanal and the interconversion of cyclic
octamers to cyclic tetramers. Polymeric calixarenes and calixarenes imbedded in
polymeric systems containing both hydrophobic and hydrophilic moieties will be
investigated.
