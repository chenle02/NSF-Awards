The broader impact/commercial impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer
(STTR) Phase I project is to enable simultaneous use of farmland for farming and
solar energy production. This project will advance a technology to appropriately
direct sunlight into solar cells and farm use. This provides additional revenue
to farmers and creates a controlled growth environment that requires less water,
provides protection from hail and the elements, and extends the growing season.
The technology enhances feedback because growing crops below the solar modules
cools the region of the solar cells and improves their efficiency.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This STTR Phase I project advances translation of new
photovoltaic structures and physical mechanisms though the development of a new
approach to semiconductor device, integrating advances on high efficiency with
the robustness of silicon cells. This project will design an agrivoltaic module
that optimizes the trade-offs between light to the photovoltaic module through
optical concentration and light to the crops below. The R&amp;D plan comprises
four parts: (1) development of a simulation model that includes regional solar
and economic data; (2) determination of the design parameters of the optical
film (e.g., optical concentration, wavelength range, etc); (3) design of the
solar cell integrated with the optical film; and (4) construction and field
testing of the new solar module to show its beneficial impact on crops and the
farming ecosystem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
