Low temperature is one of the most common environmental factors influencing the
growth, development and survival of plants. Understanding plant responses to low
temperature not only helps illuminate fundamental mechanisms of biological low
temperature sensing, but also is of critical importance for agriculture because
chilling and freezing stresses greatly limit crop production. The long-term goal
of this research is to understand the mechanisms of cold sensing and signal
transduction in plants. This project focuses on how cold temperatures switch on
the expression of genes that are important for plant cold tolerance. Previous
work has shown that cold-induction of plant genes is controlled by a
transcriptional cascade where cold first triggers the transcription of genes
encoding the CBF family of transcriptional factors that in turn activate the
expression of a large number of downstream cold-responsive genes. How the CBF
genes are induced by cold is currently poorly understood. Preliminary work has
identified several Arabidopsis mutants that are impaired in the cold induction
of CBF genes. The project will characterize and clone one of the genetic loci
defined by these mutants. Gene expression profiling using whole genome
microarrays will be carried out on this mutant. The project will lead to the
isolation of a critical regulatory gene for low temperature
responses.&lt;br/&gt; The work will significantly advance our understanding of
biological sensing of low temperature cues and enhance our ability to develop
rational strategies for engineering chilling and freezing tolerant crops. To
broaden the impacts of the research, the project will participate in a summer
intern program to train high school science teachers, and will be involved in
several other outreach programs by providing plant mutants and luminescence
imaging expertise to molecular genetic lab exercises for students; and it will
actively recruit and involve undergraduate students in the discovery
process.&lt;br/&gt;
