Goals: This Research Infrastructure Improvement (RII) award seeks to build upon
prior RII-supported efforts to expand the core facilities of the University?s
Center of Excellence in Marine and Environmental Studies. At this center,
scientists investigate the connections between ocean and coastal waters; the
biological and geophysical linkages of the land-sea interface; and their
potential impact on coral reef ecosystems. Specifically, this project will
investigate the factors that enhance or reduce coral reefs? tolerance to
environmental stress to better understand ecological resilience. The people of
the Virgin Islands rely heavily on Caribbean coastal resources for subsistence,
and are alarmed by findings that indicate that nearly 70% of the coral reefs are
threatened by costal development, pollution, sedimentation, and over-fishing.
Rising sea temperatures, ocean acidification and ineffective management add
further threats to Caribbean coral reefs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project Major
Foci: Because of the US Virgin Islands? reliance on the surrounding coastal
waters and coral reef ecosystems for tourism (economic engine), transportation,
food and recreation, the research focus is Biocomplexity in Caribbean Coral
Reefs. Three research projects have been developed into the Integrated Caribbean
Coastal Ecosystem Research Plan: 1) Evolutionary and Ecological Patterns and
Processes team will investigate the numerous processes that threaten coral reef
ecosystems; 2) Ocean and Coastal Processes team will provide the physical
foundation for interpreting biological processes based upon field data and ocean
modeling; and 3) Environmental Analysis and Management team will address the gap
between physical and human interactions in coastal ecosystems and the underlying
importance of socio-economics on successful natural resource
management.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The project will
investigate factors that enhance or reduce a coral reef?s tolerance to
environmental stress and the coral reef?s resistance to transitions to alternate
ecological states. Anticipated project outcomes include a better understanding
of how ecological patterns and processes are influenced by natural and
anthropogenic disturbances. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The
research outcomes will inform decision-makers on natural resource management and
spatial planning and will enhance human and ocean health. There is an urgent
need for this information given the trends on coral reef mortality in the region
and the potential negative impact to the region?s economy. Research results may
be applicable to regions outside the Caribbean.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
