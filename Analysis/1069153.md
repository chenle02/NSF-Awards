This project lies at the intersection of dynamics, geometry, number theory,
probability theory, and the theory of Lie groups. It centers on the dynamics of
group actions on parameter spaces of geometric objects. The particular focuses
of the study are the space of lattices in Euclidean space and flat structures on
higher-genus surfaces. These projects are inspired by comparing and contrasting
these two types of dynamics and geometry. This has been a fruitful approach for
the PI and many other researchers, who have found that results in one setting
can be translated to the other, and that this process yields insights to both
sets of problems. Another common thread is the use of probabilistic language and
machinery; in particular using random walks to model and study various flows on
these spaces, and also attempting to understand the properties of a `random
object' in a parameter space.

It is hoped that these projects will instigate interdisciplinary collaborations
and uncover deeper connections between seemingly disparate areas of mathematics.
Several of the problems can be stated in very simple, accessible form, and offer
a gateway to several important areas of modern mathematics, including dynamical
systems, geometry, and number theory. As such, these problems provide mentoring
opportunities at several levels, from postdoctoral fellows, to PhD students, to
undergraduates, to high school students and teachers. The study of flat surfaces
has significant concrete applications to the dynamics of interacting particles,
and other important physical systems. The study of lattices and their
deformations is important to understanding the structure of crystals, packing
problems, and in materials sciences.
