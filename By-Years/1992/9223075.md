This study addresses questions concerning the comparative use of just-in-time
(JIT) production philosophy in the United States and Mexico. Earlier research
identified obstacles to the application of JIT in varying social and economic
cultures. The goal of this project is twofold: (1). How do potential obstacles
affect a company's ability to use and achieve the benefits of JIT, and (2). Does
JIT lead to improved performance in non-US settings. In order to address these
questions, a model of JIT and hypotheses concerning potential obstacles was
developed. Case studies of plants in the United States and Mexico that are
moving towards adoptions of JIT will be used to test the hypotheses. Data will
be collected through interviews, observations, and surveys administered to
workers and managers in each plant. Results should enhance understanding of how
the operating environment affects operations in general and should lead to a
better understanding of JIT because of the unique perspectives that can be
achieved by studying it in diverse environments. The research should benefit
firms doing business in different cultures and environments. The project is
funded as a Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant.
