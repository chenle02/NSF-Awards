Shaw/Abstract The purpose of this research is the intercomparison of three and
possibly four new inst4ruments designed to measure Cloud Condensation Nuclei
(CCN). Since each device employs a different means to obtain the same result, it
is essential to evaluate their relative merit experimentally. The tests will be
performed at the Geophysical Institute, Fairbanks within the next few months.
