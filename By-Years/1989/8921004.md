This is an award to support research on modeling of the movement of groundwater
pollutants. The specific objective of this project is to devise a methodology
for prediction of the movement of a specific, principal contaminant regardless
of its stochastic properties, concentration or location in the mathematical
model. Additionally, the investigator is considering sources of uncertainty
relative to contaminant migration beyond those attributable to aquifer
conductivity. He is exploring new foundations in functional-analytic theory
(stochastic evolution equations, semigroups of operators, stochastic
differential equations in Hilbert space) blended with some results on the
classical heat flow equation in order to obtain new solutions of the advective
dispersive transport equation in porous media subject to a general stochastic
disturbance. The project is expected to produce a new systematic and general
modeling procedure by which the stochastic properties of the concentration
process can be predicted based on the stochastic properties of the disturbing
stochastic process(es) at the boundary conditions, the source terms and/or the
parameters. Additionally, it is expected that the variances of the processes
will not be restricted to small magnitudes as it is the case with conventional
perturbation techniques.
