This program addresses a need in chemical engineering curicula to address
polymer materials, and is designed to complement the existing fundamental
polymer science course. Practical laboratory experiments including thermal
analysis and surface science form the nucleus of state-of-the-art physical
characterization techniques for undergraduate experimentation on classic
homopolymers, elastomers, and fiber-reinforced composites. Underlying
fundamental concepts developed in lecture are linked with practical laboratory
measurements. The curricula is intended for students in chemistry, chemical
engineering, mechanical engineering, and materials science.
