Phase I Noyce Scholarships are being used to attract academically successful
community college transfers, senior mathematics and science majors and STEM
professionals to become highly effective teachers in urban school districts. The
Noyce Scholarships recruit and support four different types of students
including: 1) students in their third and fourth year of the CSUEB Bachelors
Plus Early Pathway integrated credential and math or science degree; 2) students
transferring from community colleges, especially those who have served as
successful Teaching Assistants in local high schools through the CSUEB MSTI
(Math and Science Teacher Initiative); 3) current math and science majors; and,
4) past-baccalaureate STEM professionals who are ready for the credential
program, particularly paraprofessionals in the Alameda County Office of
Education program. Particular effort is being given to recruit diverse students
utilizing current community partnerships such as the Oakland African American
Chamber of Commerce and the annual Latino Education Summit. The program is
supporting cohorts of seven undergraduates and five STEM professionals per year
with three cohorts of undergraduates and four cohorts of STEM professionals for
a total of 41 students at the end of the program. The undergraduates are
supported for two years and the STEM professionals for only their credential
year. The College of Science and the College of Education and Allied Studies at
California State University East Bay jointly offer these programs to enhance
science and math education in K-12 schools in Alameda and Contra Costa Counties
and to increase the number of science and math students who obtain a teaching
credential.
