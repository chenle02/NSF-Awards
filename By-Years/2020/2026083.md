The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide a new way for developers of
wireless systems to test their prototypes. The estimated market size is $300 M
and supports the development of many new sectors, such as next-generation
cellular systems, self-driving cars, robotics, augmented/virtual reality, and
unmanned aerial vehicles (drones). This project will advance a new technology,
affordable and technically advanced software-defined radios (SDRs), for testing.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase II project will advance the translation of
SDRs. The millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies from 30-300 GHz can be used to
meet increased demand, but getting systems to work in the real-world in these
frequencies remains challenging. This SBIR Phase II effort will advance an SDR
to prototype systems across all layers of the protocol
stack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
