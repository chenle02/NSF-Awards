The project goal is to improve optics laboratory instruction at several levels
ranging from a sophomore-level holography laboratory course to senior research
projects. This is being accomplished by the addition of a versatile rapid
holographic camera and by introducing lasers of a second color. At present only
red helium-neon gas lasers are available. The affected courses are Holography
Laboratory and Lasers, taken by students interested in applied physics, science
education and industrial technology; Optics with Laboratory, taken principally
by physics majors with a special interest in modern optics and by science
education and physics education graduate students; and Undergraduate Research in
Physics. The major equipment item purchased as a result of the grant is a
thermoplastic recorder, which can he thought of as an instant holographic
camera. This instrument is being used to monitor microscopic distortions of
objects in real time, by observing a pattern of light and dark fringes these are
seen through a hologram when the object is moved. This instrument can be used
for demonstrations, for semi-quantitative measurements of microscopic
displacements at the intermediate level, and for advanced undergraduate research
projects. In particular a novel holographically-based method of measuring
surface roughness is being explored. This method of measuring surface roughness,
developed by the project director working with previous undergraduate physics
majors is based on monitoring laser light scattered from the rough surface. The
second major item is a blue argon-ion laser. This laser permits the wavelength
dependence of scattered and diffracted light to be studied at the intermediate
and advanced level. Also, two-color display holography, of wide interest to
students, is also possible.
