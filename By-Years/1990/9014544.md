In this proposal additional research equipment is requested to expand the
capabilities of the advanced laser fluorescence apparatus recently constructed
by the PI. This improved apparatus will permit the PI to develop methodologies
to perform - for the first time - fluorescence microscopy (FM) experiments on
thin (monomolecular) films at liquid/liquid interfaces, thereby enabling him to
investigate in-situ the structure and dynamics of this class of very important
naturally occurring and technologically significant interfacial systems.
Applications include food and emulsion technology, biological and liquid
membranes, and hydrometallurgical solvent extraction as well as fundamental
studies of two-dimensional mass transfer at liquid/liquid interfaces.
