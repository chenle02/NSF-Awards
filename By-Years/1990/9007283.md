In this project within the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organo- metallic
Chemistry Program, J.H. Espenson and A. Bakac of Iowa State University will
continue their investigations of the reactivity of transition metal moieties
bonded to oxygen. The study of the activation of dioxygen and its reactivity has
practical relevance in many areas such as the transport and storage of oxygen in
biological systems as well as the catalytic oxidations in organic synthesis.
Complexes of cobalt(II) and chromium(II) with the ancillary ligand "cyclam" (a
macrocyclic compound with four nitrogen donor atoms) will be employed in kinetic
studies, using laser flash photolysis, of the uptake of dioxygen. The kinetics
of the reactivity, via both electron transfer and oxygen atom transfer, of the
dioxygen derivatives of these complexes will be investigated. In addition the
reaction kinetics of peroxo complexes of cobalt(II), chromium(II) and several
other metals will be examined.
