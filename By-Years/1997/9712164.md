A near-bottom geological and geophysical survey of the eastern Atlantis ridge-
transform-intersection will provide key observations necessary to assess whether
oceanic massifs are anaoloous to continental core complexes. The stdy will
include DSL-120 side-scan sonar to produce a detailed morphologic base map of
the entire massif. Specifid sites will be targete for mapping and sampling with
Jason/Medea and Alvin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
