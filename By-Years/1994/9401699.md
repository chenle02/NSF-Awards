The objective is to develop a new computational model of the large- scale
dynamics of the Earth's magnetosphere by merging two existing models: (i) the
global 3d MHD code that was orginially developed at the Naval Research
Laboratory, and (ii) the Rice Convection Model (RCM). The merged code will
retain the self-consistency and comprehensiveness of the MHD code and will
include the bow shock, magnetosheath, solar-wind/magnetosphere interactions, as
well as the distant tail. But the merged code will also utilize the Rice
Convection Model's finely gridded, many-fluid representation of the inner
magnetosphere and near-Earth plasma sheet. In addition, the RCM's representation
of the magnetospheric interior will be substanitally improved through the use of
the self-consistent time- dependent magnetic field supplied by the MHD model.
Merger of the two codes will be accomplished in three phases, with careful
testing and analysis at each step. In each phase, the code will be used to
simulate specific, well-observed magnetospheric events, and simulation results
will be tested against observations obtained in GEM campaigns.
