This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP) award from the
Research Facilities Office provides funds to San Diego State University for the
renovation and repair of the Industrial Arts Building so that it will
accommodate the currently scattered geological and geophysical research and
research training activities of the Department of Geological Sciences. This
building was constructed prior to 1960 and has not been renovated since that
time. The ARFMP grant of $300,000 and $489,583 provided by the grantee as cost
sharing will be used to modernize these research and research training
facilities. This project will address the need to improve the current research
infrastructure by installing adequate utilities, lighting, ventilation, work
spaces, and storage areas. The centralized location that will be established
will preclude the current necessity of transporting contaminant- sensitive
materials between facilities for analysis. This award contributes to the
infrastructure of science by providing an improved environment for the conduct
of research and for the training of quality undergraduates and master's degree
students, and, notably, in the absence of a doctoral program, of postdoctoral
students.
