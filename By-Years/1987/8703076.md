Professor James C. Weisshaar is supported by a grant from The Physical Chemistry
Program to study the structures and dynamics of polyatomic gas phase ions and
radicals. The aim of this research project is a better understanding of how the
electronic structures of transition metal species affects their reactivity. This
area of research has important implications in the development of new chemical
catalysts. Weisshaar will study the gas phase chemistry of transition metal ions
and neutrals containing Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, etc., and their reactions with
small organic molecules in a fast flow reactor. The transition metal ions will
be prepared in selected electronic states using tunable dye laser ionization.
This research extends the use of powerful gas phase chemical physics tools
including dye lasers, molecular beams, and time-of-flight techniques into the
regime of molecular systems of considerable complexity and genuine chemical
interest.
