Milllikin University will undertake a cooperative venture among the three major
science departments: chemistry, biology and physics. Under the umbrella of
integrated laboratories, three fundamental questions will be addressed8 1. Can
the first course for majors and non majors be unified around the theme of
problem solving? If so, what are the fundamental problems that these students
should address? 2. Is it possible to develop modular, multi- purpose (physics,
chemistry, biology) laboratory experiences that permit students to work
independently of a scheduled lab course? 3. What elements must be present in lab
experiences that will create active learning communities? The product will be a
manual of lab experiences developed initially from our own expertise with lab
courses for majors that addresses concretely the answers to these questions. A
team of students and faculty from all three science departments will study these
questions for two summers. The results of this project will be evaluated in the
intervening school year and during a summer conference.
