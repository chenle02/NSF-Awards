This award will support travel for young US scientists to the "Mathematical
Relativity: Past, Present, Future" workshop at the Erwin Schrödinger
International Institute (ESI), December 4-7, 2023, in Vienna, Austria. The goal
of the workshop is to bring together advanced doctoral students, promising young
researchers, and leading experts in the field to discuss the recent developments
in the area, to share and discuss techniques that have proven particularly
successful, to assess new areas of contact, and to support existing and promote
new collaborations. This event will allow the participants to create a
professional network, and this professional network promotes information
sharing, collaboration, and career development while incubating meaningful
contributions to the field. One third of the speakers at the conference are
women. The committee which will choose the US participates is committed to
choosing a diverse community of outstanding researchers in the field.

The workshop will focus on several major recent breakthroughs in mathematical
general relativity, including the long-awaited proof of the stability of the
Kerr solution for small angular momenta, new initial data gluing methods and
proofs of the positive energy theorem, as well as insights to canonical
structures of initial data for Einstein’s equations (with or without coupling to
matter fields). The workshop will gather young researchers along with leaders in
the field of mathematical relativity. The workshop honors the 100th birthday of
Yvonne Choquet-Bruhat, one of the outstanding pioneers of the field of
mathematical relativity.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
