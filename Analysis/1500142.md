Functions of complex variables play an essential role throughout much of
mathematics and in many parts of physics and engineering. This project will
develop a number of interrelated topics in complex variables theory which may
serve to open up new directions within that theory and to build bridges from
that theory to other mathematical areas. It is expected that the project will
help to build human infrastructure by involving students and younger
investigators.

The specific problems to be addressed by the principal investigator include
geometric and variational problems connected to Fefferman measure and Webster
curvature; the study of partial differential equations serving as boundary
compatibility conditions for various overdetermined boundary value problems
arising in several complex variables; the study of competing partial complex
structures on boundaries of certain complex euclidean domains arising from
considerations of projective duality; the study of constants for of Poincare-
type inequalities on Hardy spaces; and the study of boundary norms for solutions
of holomorphic constant-coefficient partial differential equations.
