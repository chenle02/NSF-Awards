This is an attempt to develop a "solvated electron" electrode for secondary
batteries. Although this system has been studied as a scientific curiosity for
thirty years. There has been no previous attempt to apply it to batteries. If
successful, it would theoretically avcoid many of the problems inherent in solid
lithium electrodes and offer improved efficiency and cyclability.
