This award is funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry
Program in the Division of Chemistry. Professor Guangbin Dong of the University
of Chicago is supported to develop new approaches for the synthesis of single
carbon atom thick graphene nanoribbons arranged in precise armchair pattern.
Each ribbon is a tiny fraction of a human hair in width. These materials have
potential applications as semiconductors in light-weight and flexible electronic
devices. This project addresses the challenges of preparing ribbons with various
chemical functional groups and band structures to be incorporated in a new
generation of molecular devices. While conducting the project, the Dong group is
actively participating in the Leadership Alliance Summer Research Early
Identification Program. The intention is to integrate the project with education
and outreach and to encourage diverse undergraduate students to explore careers
in science and engineering. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project aims to offer an
efficient approach to prepare armchair graphene nanoribbons (aGNRs) with
controlled electron band structures and high charge mobility. The project
advance three main objectives: to enable a unified approach to prepare aGNRs
with various widths; to synthesize aGNRs with precisely installed functional
edges; and to develop a chain-growth-polymerization approach to access aGNRs
with controlled lengths and prepare aGNR-based P/N junctions. The project makes
available a wide range of aGNRs, designed to test and validate hypotheses and
theoretical models proposed previously by physicists and physical chemists. The
results are expected to accelerate the physical and theoretical studies of these
intriguing materials and to advance the understanding of these graphene-like
one-dimensional polymers, which in turn would further inspire and stimulate the
development of other new conjugated organic semiconducting materials.
