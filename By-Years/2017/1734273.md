This proposal requests for funding to support three students' travel to attend a
workshop called "In Whose Best Interest? Exploring the Real, Potential, and
Imagined Ethical Concerns in Privacy-Focused Agenda", co-located with the 20th
ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing (CSCW
2017) to be held in Portland, OR from Feb 25-Mar 1, 2017. CSCW is a top-tier
social computing conference, and this workshop is part of an ongoing series of
CSCW workshops broadly on the topic of "networked privacy", i.e., that privacy
is not just an individual concept but one that can be thought about at the
levels of dyads, families, groups, organizations, and communities. Students from
a variety of disciplines will participate in the workshop and the conference,
giving them an opportunity to interact with senior researchers in their
intellectual communities and expose them to a wide range of work in the field.
As such, it fits closely with the goals of NSF's Secure and Trustworthy
Cyberspace (SaTC) program, both its intellectual merit goals around analyzing
privacy as a collective as well as an individual property, and its broader
impact goals around growing the privacy and security research community.
