Michigan State University will initiate a seven-week, multidisciplinary,
residential High School Honors Science Program (HSHSP) for 28 high-ability/high-
potential students entering grades 11,12 across the nation. During the seven-
week period students will engage in independent research in the laboratory of a
Michigan State University faculty member. Additional activities will include
seminars, discussions and debates about issues of importance to their particular
area of research and to the broader scientific enterprise. They will be afforded
opportunities to investigate careers in the sciences both through organized
discussions with professionals on campus and at field trip sites.
