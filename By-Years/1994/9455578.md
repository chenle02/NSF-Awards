9455578 Palettas A novel laboratory approach is being developed for the
instruction of introductory statistics for engineers, with emphasis on problem
solving, conceptual understanding, and the use of writing and calculation-and-
plotting as acts of cognition. Through interdisciplinary cooperation, a closer
link between statistics and engineering courses is being made for a great
benefit to both. Finally, taking advantage of the capacities made available by
state-of-the-art computing and multimedia technology, curricular resources are
being developed that will increase students' interest, motivation, and
excitement.
