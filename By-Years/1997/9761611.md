*** 9761611 Smithey This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is
directed toward development of new optical materials that are robust, reusable,
and inexpensive and have optical properties superior to those of current
materials. The required properties for a competitive, economically viable
material are good light Sensitivity, large change in a material property (e.g.,
absorbance or refractive index) upon exposure to light, read-without-erase
capability, long recording lifetime, fatigue resistance, and erasability.
Current materials - e.g., photopolymers and phase-change materials not satisfy
all of these requirements. The approach will be to alter a novel biological
material, bacteriorhodopsin (BR), to meet the sensitivity requirements for
optical-recording materials. In previous work, Bend Research and others have
demonstrated the potential of BR for optical recording and have shown it meets
all of the other necessary material requirements. Improvements in the
sensitivity of BR materials is the key advance remaining to be achieved in the
development of a practical BR-based optical-recording material for a wide range
of applications. Development of a BR material with improved sensitivity would
enable product development for many large markets, including optical
correlation, pattern recognition, optical-data storage, fingerprint
identification, neural networks, and multimedia storage. ***
