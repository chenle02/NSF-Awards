This project will introduce upper level students to the power and limitations of
computational chemistry. The project will integrate computational chemistry and
computer modeling into six existing courses rather than adding a new course. The
exercises make comparisons between predictions of simple chemical models,
sophisticated theoretical calculations and experimental data. Recently
developed, inexpensive, three- dimensional color graphic workstations with user-
friendly commercial software make this work possible for a small department.
Funding will purchase two IRIS Indigo three- dimensional color workstations, an
upgrade of an existing workstation, two PCs attached as graphic terminals to the
Indigos, networking, printing, and group video resources combined with two major
computational chemistry software packages. One package is for molecular
mechanics and large molecule modeling, the other is for performing quantum
chemistry calculations and sophisticated color rendering of the resulting
electron distributions and molecular shapes.
