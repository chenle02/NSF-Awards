*** 9507665 Voight This proposal requests funds to host a regional workshop on
the hazard management of Decade Volcano Merapi proposed by Drs. Barry Voight and
Kirby Young, the Pennsylvania State University and Dr. Wimpy Tjetjep,
Volcanological Survey of Indonesia. The workshop will be held in Yogyakarta,
Indonesia, on October 6-9, 1995. Volcano Merapi has been identified by the
United Nations-sanctioned International Decade of Natural Disaster Reduction
(IDNDR) as one of a few selected volcanoes that pose extraordinary hazards to
people. Ten scientists from the U.S. and five scientists from the developing
countries in Southeast Asia will be attending this workshop. The participants
are experts in this area. The meeting can provide an excellent opportunity for
discussing the issues important to volcanoes monitoring and development of basic
ideas on how volcanoes work. This meeting addresses important issues on natural
disaster reduction. The result can be useful to research communities in planning
future cooperative research activities on volcanology in Indonesia. ***
