9702603 Torrents This is an award to provide support for research, the primary
objective of which is to obtain a better understanding than now exists of how
immobilized enzymes can be utilized most efficiently in detoxifying wastes that
contain organic phosphates of pollutional significance. The investigator plans
on screening a series of protein immobilization supports with differing degrees
of surface activation characteristics to identify those with a large capacity
for adsorption of the enzymes and then altering the enzyme to obtain maximum
linkage between it and its support. A secondary objective of this project is to
identify the conditions under which the enzymes can maintain their potential for
activity when exposed to adverse environmental conditions. Results of this
project are expected to provide insights into the engineering design of
processes to detoxify substance of pollutional significance by use of
immobilized enzymes. The proposal leading to this award was submitted in
response to NSF 96-115, "Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program." As
such, this award also provides support for the continuation of this
investigator's early development as an educator. Her education plan includes
development of new courses that emphasize the multidisciplinary perspectives
that are inherent to the practice of environmental engineering. Her innovative
approach also is targeted toward leading students to, in effect, assist in
teaching themselves. ***
