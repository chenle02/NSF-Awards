9412691 Shetty Toughened ceramics, including transformation-toughened zirconia
based ceramics and whisker-and fiber-reinforced ceramic composites, are
susceptible to true cyclic fatigue phenomena. The associated high subcritical
crack-growth rates in cyclic loading can arise from either extrinsic
(degradation of crack shielding) or intrinsic (crack-tip damage) mechanisms. The
research proposed will investigate the origins of cyclic fatigue in ceria
partially stabilized zirconia/alumina and self-reinforced silicon nitride by
separating the contributions of the extrinsic and the intrinsic mechanisms via
direct measurements of crack shielding using Roman microprobe spectroscopy.
Critical comparison of the measured shielding with the theories of crack
shielding and direct examination of the transformation or bridging zones via
Transmission and scanning electron microscopes techniques are also the important
elements of the proposed research. %%% The proposed research will investigate
the origin of cyclic fatigue in ceria-partially stabilized zirconia/alumina and
self reinforced silicon nitride by means of Roman spectroscopy and electron
microscope. ***
