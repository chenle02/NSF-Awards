1552107 (Diwekar). The Trans-Atlantic Research and Development Interchange on
Sustainability (TARDIS) workshops are a series of meetings on scientific topics
related to environmental sustainability held every other year alternating
between Austria and the United States. The first workshop was held on the
subject of modeling for environmental sustainability at Schloss Seggau in
Leibnitz, Austria in October 2004. Subsequent workshops were held in September
of 2006 at the YMCA of the Rockies on the topic of underlying scientific
principles of environmental sustainability, and in October 2008 again at Schloss
Seggau on energy and environmental sustainability. The TARDIS 2012 workshop was
held in April 2012 at Schloss Seggau in Leibnitz, Austria on the topic of time
and time-frames for environmental sustainability. The most recent TARDIS
workshop was held in June of 2014 at the YMCA of the Rockies in Colorado on the
topic of social, economic, policy, and regulatory incentives to promote
environmental sustainability in society. The next TARDIS workshop will be again
held at Schloss Seggau in Leibnitz, Austria October 19 - 21, 2016 to explore the
compatibility of economic growth and environmental sustainability.

The body of participants will be balanced to include adequate representation
with respect to discipline (engineering, physics, chemistry, economics, policy,
etc.), institutions (academic, government, private sector) and regional and
national representation, and minorities and women will be encouraged to
participate. Two reports will be produced: (1) a final report summarizing the
results and conclusions and the presentations given, and (2) a briefer summary
focused on policy. A WIKI site has been established and is currently being
populated with the relevant information on all of the TARDIS workshops.
