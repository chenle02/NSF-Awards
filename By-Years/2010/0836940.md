Computer Science (31)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project expands preliminary work
on the AlgoViz Wiki, http://algoviz.cs.vt.edu, to make it into a true community
resource. As an outcome of this project, the AlgoViz Wiki becomes a focus point
for locating algorithm visualizations (AVs), releasing new AVs, reading reviews
from users, and sharing experiences about classroom use. This project helps AV
developers and users connect and interact with each other, provides social
support for reviewing, rating, and commenting on available AVs, and shares
activities and plans for how best to use AVs. Resources for developers include
information about development tools and AV toolkits, information about licensing
and intellectual property policies, guidance on what works and what does not in
AV design, and guidance on what topics are in greatest need of new
visualizations. A SourceForge site is developed where developers can share
exemplar source code for AVs, allowing new developers to see how others have
solved fundamental design and development
problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This effort improves the
computing education community's understanding of how AVs can be made
pedagogically effective. It leverages the collective knowledge of the community
to drive better development practices and better deployment. The community can
collectively identify quality instructional materials and effective modes of
deployment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: Improving on the general
availability and quality of AVs can affect the educational outcomes for tens of
thousands of students every year in computer science and related disciplines.
Providing a community resource on best practices improves the development of
future AVs around the world. A clearing house of available AVs and documenting
best practices for their use provides quality educational materials to
instructors.&lt;br/&gt;
