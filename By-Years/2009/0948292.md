Intellectual Merit The study proposed is for a MARGINS postdoctoral researcher.
The postdoctoral researcher will integrate downhole log data and the rock
samples obtained from an Integrated Ocean Drilling Program drill hole. The long
term aim of the work is to be able to identify sediment types using the log data
when no core samples are available. This information will be used to assess how
sediments change as they are subducted, especially in the region where
earthquakes occur. Development of a method to use log data fully is important to
the broad geosciences community. Broader Impacts The broader impacts include the
career advancement and training of an early career female scientist
