9803288 Sageev The investigator will study the splitting theory of groups.
Recent results, beginning with the work of Rips and Sela, have shown that the
toral decomposition of 3-manifolds due to Jaco-Shalen and Johannson can be
generalized to the much broader setting of finitely presented groups (this is
called the JSJ decomposition). This generalization points towards a hierarchy
for groups that terminates with indecomposable groups. For example, one would
begin with a finitely presented group, split it as an amalgam over a trivial or
infinite cyclic group, and then proceed iteratively on the vertex groups. One
would then want to know if such a process terminates with groups that are
indecomposable as amalgams over a trivial or cyclic group. One also wants to
know if a quasi-isometry between groups preserves the JSJ-decomposition. This
quasi-isometric invariance holds in the hyperbolic setting by deep work of
Bowditch, but it remains a mystery in general. A 3-manifold is a space that
looks locally like the space in which we live; for instance, one can take a cube
and glue opposite faces together in pairs. There is a very rich and beautiful
decomposition theory for 3-manifolds that tells us that a 3-manifold can be cut
up into simpler pieces. Recently, some very surprising work has shown that a
good part of this decomposition theory generalizes to a far broader setting,
namely to groups, groups being the mathematically precise way to describe
symmetry. However, the picture of group decompositions is far from complete. The
aim of this project is to investigate the extent to which groups can be
decomposed into simpler pieces. ***
