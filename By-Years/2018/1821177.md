This award supports participation in the Graduate Workshop in Algebraic Geometry
for Women and Mathematicians of Minority Genders which will take place at MIT
and Harvard University over the weekend of February 17-18, 2018. The workshop
will promote the professional community of women and researchers of minority
genders in algebraic geometry and adjacent fields, focusing on the needs of
young graduate students. Participants will be exposed to the research of leading
women algebraic geometers and will have the opportunity to interact with faculty
and postdoc mentors and with each other. Attending this conference will boost
participants' feelings of 'knowing people' at other, non-gender-specific
conferences, and therefore it will have lasting effects on the community beyond
this workshop. More information can be found at the workshop website,
https://sites.google.com/view/gwag.

Participants will gain insight into rapidly advancing topics in algebraic
geometry through minicourses by invited speakers on Coleman integration on
curves, conformal blocks vector bundles, moduli spaces of tropical and algebraic
curves, and irrationality of higher-dimensional varieties. Afternoon working
groups will delve deeper into these topics by working through explicit examples
and open-ended problems under the guidance of a mentor.
