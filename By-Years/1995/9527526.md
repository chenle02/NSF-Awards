Abstract EEC-9527526, Colorado State University, Dr. Bryan Willson This award
provides funding to Colorado State University for support of a Combined
Research-Curriculum Development Program entitled, "THE ENGINE in ENGINEering
CRCD". The CRCD program emphasizes the need to incorporate exciting research
advances in important technology areas into the upper level undergraduate and
graduate engineering curricula and stimulates faculty researchers to place
renewed, equal value on quality education and curriculum development. This three
year program will develop a curricular program centered at the upper level
undergraduate and introductory graduate levels, but applicable throughout the
undergraduate curriculum. A series of multimedia modules will be developed which
demonstrate how state of the art research is being used to improve the design,
manufacture and operation of engines. In addition, a "virtual hands-on" engine
test cell laboratory will be developed, which will allow students from any U.S.
university to conduct actual engine experiments on-line. *** ??
