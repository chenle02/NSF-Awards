Most large-scale software applications will be built by integrating individual
software systems into a coherent whole. For these applications to become
economically viable and widely used, it must be possible to easily and
affordably: incorporate legacy software systems into the application; reuse new
software systems created for one application in related applications;
automatically determine (learn and implement) appropriate communication and
control strategies, given the software systems being integrated; automatically
manage the differences that inevitably arise because of differences in
representation, assumptions, and knowledge present in the independently
developed systems. Blackboard Technology Group, Inc. proposes to develop and
demonstrate a prototype agent-based framework for economically integrating
legacy and reusable software systems to form large-scale applications. This
framework will simplify agent-based encapsulation of existing software systems,
facilitate the development of reusable component systems, and automatically
determine appropriate interaction strategies for a given set of components used
in an application.
