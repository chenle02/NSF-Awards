As electric power utilities are faced with the prospect of operating under
conditions of ever increasing complexity, the need for accurate system modeling
is becoming paramount. Utilities must be able to accurately predict the response
of their system due to the installation of new devices or the operation of their
existing system closer to constraint boundaries. It is essential that power
system simulation models reflect the characteristics of the actual system as
accurately as possible. This research would use an innovative approach to lay
the foundation for an analysis package that would accurately determine the
modeling parameters of synchronous generators using standstill and on-line
measurement techniques. The proposed research would establish the feasibility of
using a Prony- based algorithm to extract data from various synchronous machine
test procedures that have recently been developed for frequency domain parameter
identification. It is thought that this new approach, if found to be feasible,
will reduce the risk of damage to the synchronous machines under test, provide
for faster determination of the required parameters, provide for better noise
rejection in evaluating the retrieved waveforms, and be more cost effective to
utilities and regulatory agencies.
