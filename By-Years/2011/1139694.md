Funds are provided for a special issue of Frontiers in Ecology and the
Environment to cover the topic of Citizen Science: New Pathways to Public
Involvement in Research. There is an increasing interest in citizens
participating in research in a broad variety of scientific disciplines where
they classify galaxies, identify supernovas, measure water quality, track
invasive species, or observe phenological events in plants and animals. The
special issue will review the history of citizen science projects and focus on
the innovative and exciting ways in which citizen scientists are being involved
and empowered today. Volunteer networks of citizen scientists greatly add to the
ability to collect and analyze data, thereby helping to expand scientific
understanding of ecology and environmental change. Papers in the issue will
provide a look forward to new and evolving roles of citizens' contributions to
basic research and discuss how this confluence of science and education may
develop in the future to inform scientific research and to support more diverse
networks of participants. By its very nature, citizen science provides an
important bridge between science and education at many levels. Wide
dissemination will be enhanced by having the entire issue accessible on the web.
