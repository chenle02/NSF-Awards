The project will enable the Department of Chemistry to obtain graphics
workstations to enhance an extant PC-facility that has become outdated and
inadequate for the teaching of up-to-date computational techniques. The new
facility will make it possible to include independent projects and assignments
requiring student access to powerful graphics computers in present courses as
well as allowing the establishment of a new course entitled "Computations in
Chemistry." The Department houses several active and well-equipped theoretical
chemistry research groups, covering a broad range of computational chemistry,
that will provide software and expertise for the teaching program. %%% With this
award the Division of Chemistry will support a course and curriculum development
project spearheaded by Dr. Hanness Jonsson and including a group of four other
research active chemists in the Department of Chemistry at the University of
Washington. The group will establish a computational facility, consisting of
several graphics workstations, to be used for upper division undergraduate and
graduate student teaching.
