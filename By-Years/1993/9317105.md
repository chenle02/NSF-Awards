9317105 Ayers This research will involve experiments that identify the factors
which determine HFSE mobility in the mantle beneath island arcs, specifically
during metasomatism of the source region of island arc basalts by slab-derived
fluids. The mobility of HFSE in hydrothermal systems depends on the stability of
HFSE host minerals and their solubility in the aqueous fluid phase. Hydrothermal
phase equilibria experiments at 1.5-2.5 GPa and 800-1100oC at known oxygen
fugacities will allow identification of stable HFSE hosts in a peridotite
(mantle wedge) and a basalt (subducted slab) composition doped with Ti and Zr.
Single-crystal aqueous solubility experiments of HFSE host minerals made as a
function of P, T, and fluid composition will identify conditions that promote
HFSE mobility.
