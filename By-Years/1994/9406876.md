9406876 Smith In the fields of nanofabrication, microfabrication, electron and
ion lithographies, x-ray lithography, particle beam optics, and forefront
applications of nanofabrication, the International Symposium on Electron, Ion
and Photon Beams is the premier conference. At this conference the latest
research results from groups around the world are usually reported first. the
proceedings of the Symposium are published in the Nov/Dec issue of the Journal
of Vacuum Science and Technology (an American Institute of Physics archival
journal) provided they pass peer review. The NSF support of the conference will
be used to enable graduate student participation in this event. ***
