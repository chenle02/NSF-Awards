Project Abstract&lt;br/&gt;CRI-CI-ADDO-EN:&lt;br/&gt;National File System Trace
Repository&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; One of the most effective ways to
study computer file systems is through the use of traces, which are records of
the actual operations that a computer performed on a hard disk or a set of
files. For example, a trace might show that a user launched a word processor on
a document, saved it three times over a period of 20 minutes, used a Web browser
to retrieve an image from the Internet, inserted that image into the document,
and saved it a fourth time. By analyzing traces of this sort, researchers can
determine how to design file systems to provide users with optimal performance
and reliability. In addition, researchers can replay a trace to reproduce the
activity generated by a live user, allowing them to test new designs without the
expense and difficulty of experimenting with real
subjects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; However, collecting traces is itself a
challenging activity, so once a researcher has acquired a trace, it is desirable
to share it with others. Trace sharing also allows diverse researchers to test
their systems under consistent, reproducible conditions, so that different ideas
can be compared and evaluated fairly. Unfortunately, there has never been a
reliable source of traces, so that researchers have often been forced to use ad
hoc methods to test their systems, or to use outdated traces that aren't
representative of modern computer systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; To alleviate
these difficulties, we are building a national repository of file system traces.
The repository is designed so that it can eventually hold every trace that has
ever been collected, both historical and modern, and so that it will be easy for
researchers to upload, download, share, analyze, and replay any trace in the
collection. A standardized format will make traces easy to manipulate, and
software tools for that purpose will be made available to
researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In the current project, NSF has provided seed
funding to allow Harvey Mudd College and its collaborators to create a prototype
of the repository, demonstrate its feasibility, and show that researchers will
find it useful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
