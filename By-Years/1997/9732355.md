Numerous applications in sciences, engineering and mathematics give rise to
problems involving structured matrices such as Toeplitz, Hankel, Vandermonde,
controllability, observability, Cauchy, Bezoutians, along with many other
patterns of structure. In many of these applications the use of standard
mathematical software tools (such as MATLAB, Mathematica, Maple, LAPACK, etc.)
is not appropriate, because their ignoring of structure requires unnecessary
storage as well as an extremely large amount of CPU time. Secondly, many
structured matrices, e.g., Hankel, Pick, Hilbert, Vandermonde, are extremely
ill- conditioned, so that all available standard methods often fail to produce
even one correct digit in the computed solution. The objective of this project
is the study of theoretical and computational problems related to structured
matrices which arise in several applied areas, including signal and image
processing, system theory, and control theory. New accurate fast and superfast
algorithms will be developed for several new classes of structured matrices,
arising in rational matrix interpolation and approximation problems with norm
constraints, in Gaussian quadrature as well as in signal and image processing.
Along with these direct methods, the approach will be used to design new classes
of preconditioners based on discrete real transforms to speed- up the
convergence of the conjugate gradient method for block Toeplitz-plus-Hankel
matrices.
