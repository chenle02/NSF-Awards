This dissertation investigates how Danes mobilized in 1943 to rescue Danish
Jews from Nazi deportation. Unlike rescue efforts in other parts of occupied
Europe, the Danish case was a nationwide collective movement. The research
should clarify the conditions facilitating high risk activism. The Danish case
will be compared with two other cases: the Netherlands (a similar culture
without a collective response) and Le Chambon, France (a similar although
smaller collective response, but a different culture). The research will use
archival data and interviews with participants to analyze the sources of the
Danish movement. Close attention will be paid to the role of social networks and
the development of inclusive collective identities. Pre-existing social networks
connected by strong ties between separate clusters of people may be especially
important for enabling this kind of high risk mobilization. These networks are
relatively uncommon since strong ties usually characterize overlapping but
separate groups. The usual use of weak ties to bridge those groups is not
effective in high risk situations for which high trust is necessary to initiate
mobilization attempts. &lt;br/&gt;
