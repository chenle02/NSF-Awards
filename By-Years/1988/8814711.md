White dwarfs constitute the most common end stage in stellar evolution. The
Principal Investigator proposes to investigate the chemical abundance and the
structure of white dwarfs (in particular those with hydrogen-dominated
atmospheres), to determine their masses, rotation rates, and magnetic fields,
and to search for white dwarfs in young galactic clusters in order to place
constraints on the kinds of young stars that give rise to white dwarfs. The
ultimate goal of the proposed work is to obtain information about the physical
processes that operate during the course of stellar evolution that leads up to
white dwarfs.
