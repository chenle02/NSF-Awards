A broad program of research in nuclear physics using an in-house accelerator at
the University of Pennsylvania and other national facilities is supported by
this grant. Gamma ray spectroscopy of nuclei far from stability, heavy ion
resonant systems, and resonances and other high energy nuclear excitations will
be studied. Development of accelerator and ion source systems for use in
accelerator mass spectrometry is also supported.
