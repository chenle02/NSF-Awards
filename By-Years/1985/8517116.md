Individual travel support is provided to allow the principal investigator to
deliver a plenary lecture at the 9th European "Chemistry at Interfaces"
Conference to be held in May in Poland. The topic of the plenary lecture is "The
Development of Ideas in Surface and Colloid Science." Two of the three major
thrusts of the conference are dynamics of interfaces, and transport phenomena in
dispersed systems. In connection with this conference, the principal
investigator will visit a number of European laboratories involved in colloid
and surface chemistry, and will prepare a report on European activities in the
liquid colloid and surface field.
