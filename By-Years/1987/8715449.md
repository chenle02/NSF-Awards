The focus of this research is on the factors that control the population
dynamics, specifically the recruitment of new individuals, of fish and shrimp
populations in coastal estuaries of the southeastern United States. The work
will use observational and experimental approaches to examine the relative
importance of density-dependence, interspecies interactions (i.e., competition
and predation and physical environmental factors (i.e., storms, tidal cycles and
microhabitat availability) to the introduction of young fishes and shrimp. The
research will provide insights into the effectiveness of the reproductive
periodicity in ensuring recruitment success and will test some commonly-held
assumptions about the factors that limit estuarine animal populations.
