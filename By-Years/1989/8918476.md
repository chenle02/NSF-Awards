To fully understand the atmosphere of the earth and its variation due to
various solar inputs requires not only data on the global variability, but also
theoretical explanations and modeling in three dimensions. This program is a
continuation of the development of detailed coupled models of the ionosphere and
thermosphere to more deeply delve into the physical processes operating within
the global system. The model is a three dimensional model of the coupled
ionosphere and thermosphere that calculates the wind, temperature, geopotential
and ion and neutral compositional fields between 97 and 500 km altitude on a
global grid. It can be used for detailed case studies through comparisons with
ground-based and space-borne experimental observations. Planned model
developments include a self- consistent treatment of global electrodynamics, the
coupling to the magnetosphere and a downward extension to incorporate the
mesosphere.
