9451327 Dinan This project will upgrade the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
capabilities of the Canisius College Chemistry Department. A multinuclear FT
instrument was selected in order to expand the NMR experience to other than
traditional organic applications. The instrument will affect instruction in five
different courses including traditional laboratories in organic chemistry and
spectroscopic analysis, as well as laboratories in inorganic, physical and
polymer chemistry. This instrument will also significantly enhance the interest
level generated by undergraduate research projects, which are an integral part
of the teaching process at Canisius. The instrument selected is well suited to
function as both a teaching and research instrument. The student experience will
provide the laboratory background needed to clarify the abstract theoretical
concepts which underlie modern NMR spectroscopy. Nontraditional application of
NMR will prepare students for future creative work with NMR inqtrumentation.
