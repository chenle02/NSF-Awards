This project provides support for the acquisition of oceanographic
instrumentation that is to be placed in a pool of shared use equipment and made
available to investigators at the University of Southern California. A modern
benchtop automated mass spectro- meter will be acquired to replace a 20-year old
model that is no longer practical to maintain and operate. The concentrations of
nutrients and other chemical constituents of seawater are key elements in
numerous biological and chemical oceanographic studies. The precise and rapid
analysis of various nutrients is a complex procedure, but recent advances in
analytical instrumenta- tion have enabled scientists to make many chemical
determinations at sea and with increasingly smaller sample sizes. The new auto-
analyzer will be operated as a laboratory and seagoing facility. Several ongoing
and planned research projects including Global Ocean Flux Study will benefit
from the increased sensitivity and sample throughput provided by the new
instrument.
