The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award
is to innovate a kilo-Hertz to mega-Hertz three-dimensional sensing technique
with camera-pixel (Âµm-level) spatial resolution for rapidly occurring mechanical
and biological events such as explosions or live beating hearts. The approach
involves bridging superfast sinusoidal phase-shifting techniques with digital-
light-processing (DLP) projectors using an optical defocusing technique.
Specifically, this research will examine the image-generation mechanism of
unmodified, inexpensive DLP technology to capture required patterns precisely
and rapidly and will theoretically and experimentally explore the defocusing
technique to overcome the limitations of the existing high-speed, three-
dimensional sensing techniques. The educational goals are to encourage the
participation of diverse groups, including underrepresented students, and to
integrate the outcomes of this research into educational activities. The
approach is to reach out to K-12 students and the general public during Iowa
State public events, to develop a repository of three-dimensional videos and
data for education, and to provide students with summer internship
opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Knowledge obtained from this research will
have many benefits to society. The addition of a three-dimensional sensing kit
and videos to K-12 curricula along with the enrichment of both undergraduate and
graduate engineering curricula will enhance optics, biology, and sensing
education. Partnering with Virtual Reality Education Pathfinders will allow this
research to inspire at-risk students to explore their options in Science,
Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics fields. Furthermore, the superfast
three-dimensional sensing technology will lead to major breakthroughs in fields
important to public health and safety. Three-dimensional sensing of organs in
medicine will offer more accurate diagnoses and provide surgeons with more
intuitive situational awareness during robotic surgeries. Three-dimensional data
for structural tests will aid the earthquake-resistant structures community in
designing safer buildings for people to work and live in.
