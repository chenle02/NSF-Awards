The main part of the proposal deals with the systematic development of higher
Grothendieck-Witt groups, alias hermitian K-theory, of exact categories and
schemes, from the point of view of derived categories, and of certain Waldhausen
categories with duality. In particular, the PI will investigate how to remove
the ubiquitous assumption of "2 being invertible". In a second part, the wealth
of known results on the structure of derived categories will be applied to yield
new calculations in algebraic K-theory, higher Grothendieck-Witt theory,
stabilized Witt-theory and cyclic homology. In a third part, the relation
between hermitian K-theory and A^1 homotopy theory will be investigated.

Algebraic K-theory, higher Grothendieck-Witt theory, stabilized Witt-theory and
cyclic homology are "(co-) homology theories" used to study solutions of systems
of polynomial equations. Cohomology theories have first been developed by
algebraic topologists in order to study properties of geometric objects which
don't change under small deformations. Later, in order to study systems of
polynomial equations (whose properties can drastically change under small
deformations), algebraic geometers/topologists developed analogous cohomology
theories in an algebraic context. They allow us to use our intuition from 3
dimensional space and our experience with working with real numbers, to
understand polynomial equations in higher dimensions, and in other number
systems, (used e.g in cryptography) where 1+1 could be equal to 0. In order to
study these cohomology theories one needs to break up their values into simpler
building blocks, which, in general, is a very difficult problem. Frequently,
however, one can observe this "breaking up into simpler building blocks" on the
level of derived categories, which are algebro-categorical objects attached with
systems of polynomial equations. This project investigates the relationship
between derived categories and the cohomology theories mentioned above.
