This is a research program to study magnetic fields in ultraluminous infrared
galaxies (ULIRGs) using polarization and Very Long Baseline Interferometry
observations of OH lines. The methods include a survey of Zeeman splitting in OH
megamasers using Arecibo Observatory, Very Long Baseline Interferometry maps of
masers in several ULIRGs, and measurement of magnetic fields outside megamaser
regions using OH absorption lines. The main goal is to determine magnetic fields
in the astrophysical plasmas residing in infrared galaxies, and to study their
evolution with redshift.
