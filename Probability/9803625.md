This research focuses on dependence structures of random variables and
associated large sample distributions. Results are expected to include
univariate and multivariate normal approximations, Central Limit Theorems and
series expansions of distributions for dependent summands. Such results will
extend the classical theory, which assumes independence, and allow many new
applications in statistics, combinatorics and computer science, where one deals
with sums and counts of dependent variables. Stein's methods play an important
role in the proposal, but other methods are featured as well. A careful study of
convergence rates is proposed. Applications to game theory, large sample theory,
particle systems in statistical mechanics and others, are described in the
proposal.

The probabilistic behavior of large systems of particles, large statistical
surveys, large computational systems, etc., is often studied by considering
limits as the size of the system grows, and assuming independence of the
particles, or opinions surveyed etc. However, for many systems or sampling
schemes, the dependence between the random outcomes cannot be ignored. This
research concentrates on methods of studying large systems or samples in the
presence of dependence, and under various dependence structures. The rate at
which finite systems approach their limiting behavior is studied, thus allowing
applications of the results to systems of a given finite size.
