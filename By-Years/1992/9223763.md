Under the guidance of Drs. Geoffrey Conrad and Emilio Moran, Mr. Eduardo Neves
will collect data for his doctoral dissertation. Through remote sensing
techniques as well as on the ground survey and excavation Mr. Neves will conduct
an archaeological study in the Uaupes river basin area of Amazonia. While in the
Brazilian rainforest considerable archaeological research has been conducted in
floodplain regions, very little is known about more upland areas which are not
regularly inundated. The Uaupes basin was selected because it represents such an
area. Extant groups have been the subject of ethnographic research and Mr. Neves
work will help to set them into a deeper chronological framework. The research
itself consists of three stages. The initial phase includes an analysis of
digitalized Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper satellite images. The objective is to
identify potential loci of archaeological sites according to criteria derived
from ethnographic and ethnohistoric sources. Secondly, a systematic
archaeological survey will be carried out in selected study units. The goal is
to asses the predictive power of the spectral reflectance analysis and to obtain
data on the culture history of the region. Finally, further work will be
performed to correlate the data obtained in the field with the image analysis of
the spectral data. This work is important for several reasons. First it will
provide data of great interest to many archaeologists and social
anthropologists. Secondly, it will help to develop an analytic technique which
may prove useful in many heavily vegetated parts of the world. Finally it will
assist in the training of an extremely promising young scientist.
