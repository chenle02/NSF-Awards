This proposal is to study when two C*-algebras are isomorphic by comparing their
K-theoretic data. In particular, it attempts to use the K-theoretic data to
determine whether two unital separable simple amenable C*-algebras which are
approximately divisible (or Z-stable) and satisfies the Universal Coefficient
Theorem are isomorphic. It also proposes to study a closely related problem
whether K-theoretic data of a minimal dynamic system could determine the
structure of the minimal dynamic system by studying the associated
transformation C*-algebra together with other K-theoretic data of the system.
Viewing C*-algebras as non-commutative topological spaces, it also proposes to
study (approximate) homotopy theory in C*-algebras.

In the micro-scopical physical world, an observable may be modeled by a self-
adjoint operator on a Hilbert space, according to Dirac and von Neumann. A
system of such operators forms a C*-algebra. Such a system has the structure of
addition and multiplication like the system of complex numbers. However, in a
C*-algebra, multiplication may not be commutative which corresponds to the
Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Let X be a compact metric space and F be a
transformation from X to X which is assumed to be invertible and both F and its
inverse are continuous. The pair (X, F) forms the associated transformation
C*-algebra. To study the dynamical structure of (X, F), one may start with the
associated C*-algebra. The study of the structure of the associated C*-algebra
provides the information of the original dynamical system. One of such examples
is the special case that X is the unit circle and F is an irrational rotation on
the circle. The associated C*-algebra is a unital separable simple amenable
C*-algebra. This C*-algebra can also be formed by a typical non-commutative
relation of two unitary operators. It is also known as non-commutative torus.
There are many C*-algebras come from different fields of sciences and the study
of C*-algebras has variety of applications. For example, C*-algebras may be
formed by operators on some Hilbert spaces, by classical dynamic systems, by
non-commutative geometry, by group representations, or, by many other studies
such as quantization. To classify a class of C*-algebras is to use a few
computable data to completely determine C*-algebras in the class and their
structure, in the process, one may also understand the related operators on
Hilbert spaces, dynamical systems, non-commutative geometry, group
representations, and, in turn, these may further provide applications to other
parts of the scientific world.
