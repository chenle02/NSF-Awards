Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Tartakoff&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Initiated in 1977, the Midwest
Partial Differential Equations Seminar is a semiannual meeting on recent
developments in partial differential equations. The seminar rotates among
midwestern universities, NSF funds partially support expenses for speakers,
graduate students and postdoctoral fellows.The seminars provide rapid
communication of problems, methods, and results. The Midwest PDE Seminar
encourages collaboration among research mathematicians from several
institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
