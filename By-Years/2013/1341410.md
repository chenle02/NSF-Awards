This proposal seeks funding for travel support for students to participate in
the ACM BCB (Bioinformatics and Computational Biology) Conference in September
2013 in Washington D.C. The ACM-BCB is expected to be a premier forum in
Bioinformatics and Computational Biology. The conference will host three keynote
sessions, research sessions, session-specific invited speakers, workshops,
tutorials, panel discussion, and poster sessions. Special activities such as a
doctoral consortium and student poster session will be specifically targeted for
the students. The ACM-BCB conference has been successful in building a
bioinformatics and computational biology community through the newly established
ACM Special Interest Group in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology
(SIGBioinformatics). The proposed grant will broaden the participation graduate
students and help develop the next generation of researchers and educators in
the computer science, biological science, biomedical science and other related
areas.
