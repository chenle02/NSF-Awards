This award supports the principal investigator's research on the investigation
of the use and applications of the powerful technique known as the probabilistic
method, pioneered by Paul Erdos more than sixty years ago. In the last few
decades the method has experienced tremendous development, propelled by
applications in many areas of science, and in particular in theoretical computer
science. The project includes foundational problems in combinatorics where
randomization plays a crucial role. Further development of the existing tools as
well as invention of new tools and techniques will be used to solve those
problems, and to investigate both practical and theoretic applications. Plans to
disseminate the new discoveries at major international conferences of experts
are included as part of the project.

The probabilistic method has become a cornerstone of research in modern
combinatorics. This project studies the main open problems and applications,
including the Kahn-Kallai conjecture and related problems regarding the
threshold behavior of graph properties in random graphs. The aim is to find
threshold functions for the appearance of large graphs in a random graph, to
prove universality-type results, and to develop general tools for embedding
general graphs into arbitrary graphs and digraphs satisfying some given desired
pseudorandom properties. Another salient part of the project is the broad topic
of packing problems, which concerns partitioning combinatorial objects into
members from a specified family of objects. The study of the classical tree-
packing conjecture and related problems has led to the development of new
embedding techniques which can be useful in different areas and form a central
part of the project. The project also considers the broad topic of random sums,
which is known as the Littlewood-Offord problem. Motivated by a central problem
in the theory of random matrices, resilience-type versions of these question and
also working with sums of dependent random variables are considered, with
potential impact on error-correcting codes and cryptography.
