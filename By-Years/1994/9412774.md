With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program Professor Turacek of the
University of Washington will study by the use of a tandem mass spectrometer the
behavior of hypervalent radicals. Organic heteroatom molecules containing
oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur will be used to generate hypervalent
radicals formed by femtosecond electron transfer in the gas phase. Four aspects
of the hypervalent radicals will be studied. They are: (1) photochemistry; (2)
probing protonation sites by radical dissociations; (3) intramolecular electron
transfer; and (4) hydrogen atom transfer. Novel carbon containing molecules that
may also contain sulfur, nitrogen, phosphorus, or oxygen will be subjected to
high energy electromagnetic radiation to prepare species with very short
lifetimes and unusual electron arrangements. The behavior of these species in
the gas phase will be measured by a mass spectrometer of unique design.
Theoretical computations will be used to simulate the data acquired from the
experiments. These results will help define what variables must be modified for
computational experiments using high performance computers.
