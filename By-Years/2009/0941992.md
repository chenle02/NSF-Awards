Student interest in computing as a discipline and a career has been on the
decline for several years. The use of digital media to introduce fundamental
computer science concepts shows promise to rejuvenate the interest of millennial
students. This project builds on previous success to introduce the creation and
sharing of artistic works into Computer Science II. It centers on the activity
of converting raw data (text) into useful information (art). This requires
students to think at multiple levels of abstraction. The project combines
active, problem-based and service learning activities. One example of service
learning is that college students volunteer as mentors at a local elementary
after-school program. Elementary school students are introduced to simple and
engaging computer programs to create art. Curricular materials are designed to
be reused and easily adapted by other instructors. The approach draws upon the
literature for recruiting and retaining underrepresented groups through its
emphases on the creation of artistic works, collaboration, social context and
reflection.
