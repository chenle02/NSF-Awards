Mobile robots play a central role in the research and educational goals of this
project. Research activities focus on the locomotion of walking, running, and
swimming machines. A design approach is advocated in which desired dynamic
behaviors are built into a robot, through such means as spring-mass and pendulum
components. Control will be accomplished by coupling actuators to nonlinear
oscillators, in a manner analogous to pattern generators in animals. Locomotion
in unstructured environments will also be considered, and robots will be
fabricated to test theoretical predictions. Bright high school students will be
recruited for educational and research activities. A mechatronics course will be
developed, which will feature a competition among student-constructed mobile
robots and a focus on industry approaches to problem solving. Undergraduate
students will be sought for participation in a national mobile robot
competition. Use of the Internet for educational purposes will be explored in
the development of hyperlearning modules for courses the PI teaches and in the
use of videoconferencing technology to broadcast lectures. Graduate students
interested in careers in academia will be encouraged to teach, write proposals,
and supervise the research of undergraduates and high school students.
