This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
prepreg material that, while maintaining the advantages of a powder towpreg
system, will eliminate the use of high price, finely ground powders. By
generating fine particles in situ using aerosol formation from molten polymers
two steps will be eliminated from the manufacturing process -- powder grinding
and powder sintering, resulting in greatly reduced cost and complexity of the
operation.

Commercially, composite materials have an ever growing importance in the
development of new technologies due to their inherent advantages over
conventional materials. These include better strength-to-weight ratios than most
metals, extreme corrosion resistance, and novel processing techniques, which
will allow a variety of shapes not achievable by conventional means. However in
many cases, the costs for fiber-reinforced composites is five to ten times
higher than that of base metals like steel or aluminum. This project will make
the composite material considerably more cost competitive.
