Robotics as a new technology has revolutionized many industries: robots build
cars, assemble watches andcomputers, and cooperate in large-scale construction
work. Soon, cars may actually be robots. This industrial revolution has
reawakened interest in many old philosophical issues about the nature of the
mental and its relation to the world -- as well as some new ones about what kind
of mental states of a robot, if any, can be said to constitute knowledge of its
world, and the extent to which such knowledge must be legitimized by reference
to the robot's interactions with human knowers. This workshop will bring
together a number of people from Several disciplines (e.g., philosophy,
psychology, computer science, cognitive science) to address these issues in the
light of recent work on constructivist approaches to AI, multi-agent artifacts
and human-machine interaction.
