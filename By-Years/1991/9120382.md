The 14th Polar Libraries Colloquy (14 PLC) will be held May 3-7, 1992 and hosted
by the Byrd Polar Research Center of The Ohio State University in Columbus,
Ohio. The theme of the Colloquy is "International Sharing of Polar Information
Resources." This theme reflects some of the objectives of the Arctic Research
and Policy Act of 1984 (ARPA) and also supports the U.S. Arctic Research Plan.
The 14 PLC will be a forum for sharing information on current international
initiatives which aid in the bibliographic control of polar literature, and will
also provide an opportunity to share knowledge of specific polar collections.
The 14 PLC program will emphasize the current status of the accessibility of
polar information and ways in which the participants of the Colloquy can
cooperate, either as individuals or as a group, to further the goal of
increasing access to this information. The proceedings will be published and
widely distributed internationally.
