The purpose of this project is to analyze the consequences of presuming firms
choose their plant size so that they can service their seasonal fluctuations in
demand before they know whether overall annual demand will be high or low. At
issue, is whether capacity precommitment results in firms seeking smoother
seasonal fluctuations in production during a boom. In order to examine this
question, a model is developed and tested with seasonally unadjusted data in
contrast to the usual approach of utilizing adjusted data. The findings will
have a number of important implications. Among other things, the fact that
seasonal and cyclical fluctuations interact implies that standard seasonal
adjustment procedures typically used in most studies provide misleading results.
This implies, in turn, that attempts to date business cycles using standard
seasonally adjusted data are likely to understate the length of expansions.
Furthermore, the findings may have important implications for the nature of
industry-level cycles. This project will also analyze how well small firms fared
during historical episodes of financial unrest.
