Downdrafts from mature convective storms have been shown to be important to a
wide range of meteorological phenomena. For example, at smaller spatial scales,
intense downdrafts have been shown to be a hazard to aviation ("microbursts")
and to be very important in determining the nature and timing of new convective
activity. Over larger areas, it has been shown that incorrect parameterization
of stormscale downdrafts in numerical models often leads to substantial errors
in quantitative precipitation predictions. The Principal Investigator will study
the characteristics and formation mechanism of local downdrafts in convective
storms. One area of investigation will be to test the hypothesis that downdrafts
are initiated and controlled mainly thought melting and evaporation processes
near the earth's surface. He proposes that in response to low altitude
downdrafts, entrainment aloft can be induced. This explanation differs from
earlier studies which suggest that entrainment into convective storms at mid
levels might be responsible for downdraft formation. The Principal Investigator
will use numerical modelling and previously collected observational data to
accomplish his research goals.
