The Chicago group is concerned with a broad range of research in gravitational
physics. Some mathematical issues related to the theory of relativistic
dissipative fluids will be investigated in detail; in particular, the "Navier-
Stokes limit" of dissipative fluid equations will be studied and they will
investigate the issue of how "close" solutions to different fluid equations
having the same Navier-Stokes limit are to each other. The possibility of
formulating a satisfactory and interpretable quantum gravity theory for
homogeneous cosmologies in analogy with the theory of a relativistic particle
will be studied, and properties of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation for inhomogeneous
cosmological models will be investigated. They will examine the issue of unitary
equivalence of quantum field constructions associated with Hadamard vacuum
states in globally hyperbolic spacetimes with a compact Cauchy surface. Numerous
additional topics in classical general relativity, quantum field theory in
curved spacetime, and quantum gravity will be investigated. The basic goal of
all of this research is to obtain a deeper understanding of mathematical and
physical issues in classical general relativity, and to make progress toward
formulating a quantum theory of gravitation.
