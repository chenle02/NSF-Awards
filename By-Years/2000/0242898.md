The focus of this research is new methodology for the synthesis of
enantiomerically pure organic phosphorous compounds. The reactivity of
hypophosphorous derivatives [ROP(OH)H] with several classes of organic
electrophiles, with and without transition metal catalysts will be explored.
Phosphorous-carbon bond forming methods will be extended to other
phosphinylidene-containing compounds (H-phosphonates and H-phosphinates).
Desymmetrization of organophosphorous compounds will be explored to provide
enantiomerically pure P-chiral compounds. Dr. Montchamp's educational focus is
on the training of graduate and undergraduate
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this renewal award, the Organic and
Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research and educational
efforts of Dr. Jean-Luc Montchamp in the Department of Chemistry at Texas
Christian University in Fort Worth, TX. Professor Montchamp will focus his work
on the development of chemical processes that can produce phosphorus-containing
molecules that are either right- or left-handed. The resulting "enantiomerically
pure compounds" are expected to be of use in catalysis by chemical and
pharmaceutical companies. The educational activities of the award will enhance
opportunities for training undergraduate and graduate chemistry students.
