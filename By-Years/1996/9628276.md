The Federated Computing Research Conference (FCRC) is an ensemble of 16 small
computer science research conferences, symposia and workshops, sponsored by four
different professional societies and colocated in Philadelphia, PA from May 20
through 28, 1996. Many of the constituent meetings are held on an annual basis.
The purpose of the Federated Conference is to stimulate interaction among
scientists in sub-disciplinary areas who might otherwise not communicate with
one another. Registrants at FCRC are allowed and encouraged to attend any and
all sessions of the constituent meetings. The first FCRC was held in 1993 in San
Diego, CA and proved to be successful. The content of FCRC will be enriched by
five plenary sessions featuring internationally distinguished, invited speakers.
