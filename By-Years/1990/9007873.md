The work proposed will complete the dissertation research of Miguel Goni on
geochemical applications of the 75-100 reaction products (in addition to simple
phenols) that are obtained from the CuO method sued to characterize lignins in
environmental samples. To date, the P.I.'s have found CuO reaction product
mixtures from soils and sediments to include compounds derived from specific
amino acids, lipids, cutins, and kelps, along with an extensive suite of lignin-
derived phenolic dimers. Three papers describing the cutin work are now
submitted and a manuscript on the geochemistries of the amino acid reaction
products is in preparation. The P.I.'s propose to wrap up this project by
investigating the suites of CuO reaction products: (a) compounds that appear to
be unique to kelps and (b) the lignin dimers, which potentially carry novel
geochemical information.
