The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program
award is to use quantum mechanical simulations to engineer thin film materials
via strain. The Division of Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation and
the Division of Materials Research contribute funds to this award that has a
specific focus on few-layer systems, which are materials that range in thickness
from the nanoscale to a single atomic layer. Few-layer systems often exhibit
exotic properties due to their low dimensionality and high surface-to-volume
ratios, including both mechanical and electronic behavior. A successful
execution of this program could allow for the discovery of novel mechanical,
electrical, and electromechanical devices. Density functional theory (DFT) will
be used to characterize the intrinsic mechanical behavior, including the ideal
failure mechanisms, ultimate strength, elastic moduli, and phonon spectrum of
the experimentally known few-layer systems. The electronic properties, including
the energy bands, transport properties, and optical properties will be computed
as a function of complex strain states. Additionally, more sophisticated
electronic structure techniques such as the dynamical mean-field theory will be
employed when DFT calculations are insufficient. Finally, the effect of chemical
surface perturbations on the mechanical behavior and electronic response will be
explored.

A broad outreach program has been planned to make our research accessible to
groups across the age, gender, educational, and ethnic spectrum. Graduate and
undergraduate students will be trained with a broad skill set ranging from
programming to quantum mechanics to engineering. Introductory talks on this
research have been planned for both high school audiences in addition to various
undergraduate student societies. Finally, middle school students from low-
income, underrepresented groups will be brought onto campus to convey the
importance of going to college and to expose them to science in a hands-on
manner.
