Professor Batterman aims to provide an in-depth philosophical discussion of the
status of semiclassical mechanics. This is an area of research that is located
somewhere between classical and quantum mechanics, and which can most profitably
be viewed as a modern formulation of the old (pre-1925) quantum theory. A large
part of the concern with this question comes from the fact that many researchers
in semiclassical mechanics appear to take the results as explanatory, and even
to provide genuine understanding of various quantum phenomena in terms almost
entirely classical. The nature of this understanding is being investigated by
considering in detail some examples of how apparent failures of the old quantum
theory have, subsequently, succumbed to semiclassical treatment. It is Professor
Batterman's major contention that for semiclassical mechanics to provide genuine
explanations and understanding, it must be considered a theory in its own right.
It is not simply an approximation to the quantum theory; that is, not merely a
procedure for computing approximations to quantal solutions. It is the aim of
this project to consider the implications of this claim.
