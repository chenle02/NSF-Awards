This grant, jointly funded by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in
the Chemistry Division and by the Instrumentation and Instrument Development
Division in Biological and Behavioral Sciences, will further the development of
ion trap mass spectrometry for sequencing biopolymers. Instrumentation for
determination of polypeptide molecular weight and fragment molecular weight will
be enhanced to that point that proteins up to MW 100,000 can be sequenced, even
when only a few femtomoles are available. Novel operating modes of the ion trap
to allow selective viewing of a reduced mass range at enhanced resolution will
be developed. %%% This grant renews support of research in instrumentation for
sequencing of such biopolymers as DNA and proteins. Novel ion trap mass
spectrometer configurations will be employed for sequencing species with
molecular weights up to 100,000. Potential applications include structural
elucidation of enzymes, identification of mutations, and sequencing of
glycoproteins (proteins bound to carbohydrate chains).
