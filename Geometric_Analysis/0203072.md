ABSTRACT

This project has two components. One concerns complex analysis on infinite
dimensional manifolds, and the proposed problems are mostly cohomological in
nature. They center around the computation of Dolbeault and sheaf cohomology
groups. Two types of manifolds will be investigated: loop spaces of finite
dimensional compact complex manifolds and Stein manifolds. One (longer term)
goal will be to prove a Hirzebruch--Riemann--Roch type index theorem on loop
spaces, another to discover an appropriate class of sheaves for which cohomology
can be proved to vanish on infinite dimensional Stein manifolds (generalization
of the notion of coherent sheaves). I will also work on solving the
inhomogeneous Cauchy--Riemann equations in pseudoconvex domains in Hilbert
spaces. The finite dimensional component is about extending the concept of
holomorphic motion from the complex plane to motions of higher dimensional
complex manifolds and their subsets. This will hopefully provide a useful tool
for higher dimensional complex dynamics.

Mathematics in general elucidates the formal structures that underlie the
exploration of our world. An example of such a structure is a function, which
formalizes the notion of "dependence" among variable quantities. For instance
temperature at some location on Earth depends on the latitude and the longitude
of the location, but also on the altitude, and the time of the measurement: we
have a function of four variables. In another context, the temperature of say a
mole of a gas depends on the velocity of each molecule of the gas, thus on
trillions and trillions of variables. Functions of such a huge number of
variables are best understood by idealizing to infinitely many variables. These
are the main objects of the proposed research: functions of infinitely many
variables. The variables are complex rather than real numbers. Introducing
complex variables typically streamlines problems, and having solved the
complexified problem one can often go back and obtain, by restriction, a
solution to the original real problem. The problems to be considered are partly
motivated by various mathematical disciplines, and also by theoretical physics.
