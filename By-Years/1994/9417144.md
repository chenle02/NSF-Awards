9417144 Boudreau This research involves a study of compaction in igneous
cumulates utilizing a quantitative approach. the proposed study would include
development of numerical models of compaction that can be used to determine the
importance of several parameters including: variation in cumulate density with
height, the rate of heat loss and generation within the cumulus pile, and the
rate of accumulation of crystals. The theoretical model will aid in
understanding correlations between lamination, bulk major and trace element
composition, mineral compositions, and the liquid-fluid compositions as
indicated by accessory phases. Initial models will be designed to be broadly
applicable to all types of rocks formed by accumulation of crystals.
