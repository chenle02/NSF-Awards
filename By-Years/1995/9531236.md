This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
Program, uses electrospray and matrix assisted laser desorption ionization
(MALDI) source Fourier Transform Mass Spectrometry (FTMS) to investigate the
structure of gas phase macromolecular complexes. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange,
coupled with deprotonation reactions, provides structural information about
large peptide and protein complexes. Lysozyme-oligosaccharide complexes will be
examined, and general methods for the structural elucidation of complex
biological molecules using mass spectrometry will be developed. Systematic,
quantitative studies of non- covalent bonding in these gas phase complexes will
be carried out. The structural characterization of large biological molecules,
including drug-protein complexes and macromolecular species of interest to
biology, is essential for the understanding of life processes. Mass
spectrometric approaches to the solution of these structural problems is the
focus of this research project. The use of isotopic exchange and deprotonation
reactions provides a non- destructive structural probe in this effort. The
results of this research project will have immediate application in the
structural analysis of many important biological systems.
