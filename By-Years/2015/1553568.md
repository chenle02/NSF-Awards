Humans are both producers and consumers of Big Data. Modeling the role of humans
in the process of mining Big Data is thus critical for unleashing the vast
potential of mined knowledge in various important domains such as health,
education, security, and scientific discovery. The objective of this research is
to build a human-centric learning framework, which harnesses the power of human-
generated Big Data with computational models. This research project also focuses
on incorporating conducted research activities into teaching materials for
student training and education in the areas of information retrieval and data
mining. In addition, specialized training in data analytics methods and
applications is provided to enhance the education of Big Data related techniques
for non-STEM and community college students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
comprises four synergistic research thrusts. First, joint text and behavior
analysis. To exploit as many types of human-generated data as possible and
capture the dependencies among them, this project develops a set of novel
probabilistic generative models to perform integrative analysis of text and
behavior data. Second, task-based online decision optimization. Traditional
static, ad-hoc and passive machine-human interactions are inadequate to optimize
humans' dynamic decision making processes. To address this limitation, users'
longitudinal information seeking activities are organized into tasks, where new
online learning algorithms are applied to proactively infer users' intents and
adapt the systems for long-term utility optimization. Third, explainable
personalization. Existing personalized systems are black boxes to their users.
Users typically have little control over how their information is used to
personalize systems. To help ordinary users be aware of how the system's
behavior is customized and increase their trust in such systems, statistical
learning algorithms are built to generate both system-oriented and user-oriented
explanations. Fourth, system implementation and prototyping. User studies are
conducted in a prototype system integrated with all the algorithms developed in
this project to evaluate the deployed algorithms. Evaluation and feedback from
real users are circulated back to refine the assumptions and design of the
developed algorithms. Expected results of the project include: 1) open source
tools and web services that will provide joint analysis of human-generated text
data and behavior data in various applications, such as search logs, forum
discussions, and opinionated reviews; and 2) annotated corpora and new
evaluation metrics that will enable researchers to conduct follow-up research in
related domains.
