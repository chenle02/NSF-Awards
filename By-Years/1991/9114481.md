This grant provides infrastructure support for the development of the research
and educational activities of the Center for Minorities in Information
Processing Systems at the City College of CUNY. The support includes computing
and VLSI laboratory equipment and software, undergraduate and graduate student
assistantships, faculty release time, and student tutoring. The principal
investigators will conduct research in (1) image analysis, (2) simultaneous
projection algorithms for set-theoretic signal recovery, (3) automata, group
representations, and Fourier transforms, (4) parallel algorithms for computer
vision and Monte Carlo methods, (5) VLSI implementations, (6) a transformation
kernel for parallel programming, and (7) image warping. Educational activities
include the restructuring of special sections of the first course in computer
science as "collaborative learning communities" as part of an innovative
approach to problem solving and software design.//
