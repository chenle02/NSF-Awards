Mathematical and numerical models play a very important role in our
understanding of biophysical processes in the nervous system. With the advent of
high-speed graphics workstations and new mathematical and numerical methods for
describing complex dynamical systems, many difficult problems in neuroscience
can now be addressed. Coupled with the explosion in experimental neurobiological
data, these new developments have lead to the emergence of the rapidly growing
field of computational neuroscience which represents a remarkable coalition of
interrelated disciplines: neurobiology, computer science, biochemistry,
artificial intelligence, molecular biology, mathematics, psychology, physics,
and philosophy. The project lays the foundation for a Laboratory for
Computational Neuroscience at Wesleyan University. Because of the new computer
technologies and new theoretical and numerical methods for describing complex
systems, this exciting interdisciplinary field should be both accessible and
appealing to undergraduate students. The proposed facility will provide the
foundation for both undergraduate courses and research opportunities in the
modelling of neurobiological processes from the electrophysiological behavior of
single neurons to the spatio-temporal patterns of activity in neural networks.
In addition, these facilities will also be available for the further development
of courses and research projects in other interdisciplinary areas of
computational science.
