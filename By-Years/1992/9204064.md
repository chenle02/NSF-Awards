This project will provide a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM)
and computer interfaced microanalysis system for fundamental characterizations
of advanced materials, including steels, structural and electronic ceramics,
welding materials, and surface-modified alloy systems. The STEM will have a LaB6
filament, 200 kV maximum accelerating voltage, 0.14 nm lattice resolution, a
scanning system with backscattered and secondary electron detectors, and a high
resolution Si(Li) x-ray detector. This instrumentation will make possible high
resolution definition of fine structure in materials, fine-scale micro-
diffraction of phases, and microchemical analysis of the distribution of
elements in the various phases of the complex material systems to be examined.
This information is essential to optimize the properties and performance of
existing structural and electronic material, and to design new materials and
processes. The instrumentation will be housed adjacent to the scanning electron
microscope and transmission electron microscope already in place, and will be
schedule and maintained by the electron microscope laboratory coordinator now on
campus.
