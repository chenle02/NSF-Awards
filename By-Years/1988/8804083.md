Picosecond lasers afford the chemist a technique to probe ultrafast processes in
molecules. A number of interesting phenomena occur with such intrinsically fast
rates that picosecond lasers give the only viable means to directly study the
kinetics and spectroscopy of these events. The Department of Chemistry of the
University of Wisconsin will use this award from the Chemistry Shared
Instrumentation Program to help acquire a picosecond laser system. The system
will enhance chemical research in the following areas: 1) Picosecond studies of
highly vibrationally excited molecules: unimolecular decomposition and
photodissociation 2) Application of time-correlated single photon counting to
local polymer dynamics 3) Optical second harmonic generation studies of
organized dye monolayers at electrode surfaces.
