This research will support continued education/outreach programs dealing with
earthquakes in the Cape Mendocino, California, region. The Mendocino triple
junction near Cape Mendocino in northern California is the dynamic region where
the Gorda, Pacific and North American plates meet. Historically, the Cape
Mendocino region and adjacent offshore areas have been one of the most
seismically active areas of the western United States. During the past three
years, six earthquakes of magnitude greater than 5.2 have occurred in the
vicinity of the triple junction, causing damage in neighboring communities. This
research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
