Professor Jonathan Rosenberg will study problems in classical and noncommutative
topology, as well as various applications, especially to differential geometry
and mathematical physics. One main focus of the proposal will be the application
of noncommutative geometry to mathematical physics, especially string theory.
Noncommutative sigma-models will be analyzed and compared with their classical
counterparts. This will require development of some aspects of a new theory of
noncommutative nonlinear elliptic partial differential equations. Other topics
will include the classification of metrics of positive scalar curvature on
manifolds, the purely algebraic K-theory of operator algebras, and the use of
invariants coming from C*-algebras (especially Kasparov?s KK-theory) to study
the geometry and topology of manifolds. For example, the K-homology classes
coming from the classical elliptic operators, such as the signature operator and
the Dolbeault operator, will be computed, and their invariance and rigidity
properties will be determined. As a result, we expect to understand better the
links between topological and analytic approaches to geometry of manifolds and
singular spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many physical theories, such as general
relativity, are formulated in terms of geometry and partial differential
equations. However, the principles of quantum mechanics require studying space-
time ``geometries''&lt;br/&gt;in which the coordinate functions do not commute
with one another. One main focus of this project will be the reformulation of
some of the partial differential equations of mathematical physics in the
setting of such noncommutative geometries. We will develop tools for studying
these noncommutative equations and will compare the noncommutative geometries
with their classical counterparts. This should advance the language for
formulating quantum theories of gravity.&lt;br/&gt;Professor Rosenberg will also
train graduate students and advanced undergraduate students in algebra,
analysis, geometry, topology, and mathematical physics, and will also work
toward integration of mathematical software into the undergraduate mathematics
curriculum.&lt;br/&gt;
