9322477 Greene This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project
will explore adaptive optical fiber vibration mode sensors for monitoring
structural vibration. Phase I research found a feasible technique in use of a
tapered two-mode optical fiber and a tunable wavelength optical source to
fashion a sensor whose strain sensitivity varies with optical wavelength. Phase
II will test alternative approaches to various functioning elements of the
sensor and test a full system laboratory prototype. The proposed fiber optic
vibration sensor is capable of replacing tens of single-point, single-measurand
electrical-based sensors. Benefits of multiplexed, distributed fiber optic
sensors include significant reduction in size and number of physical connections
for instrumented structural vibration testing. In addition, cost savings in
installation and much less complex signal processing can be expected. Other
advantages of optical fiber sensors over electrical-based sensors are immunity
to electromagnetic interference (EMI), high-cycle fatigue capability, low
weight, corrosion resistance, and absence of long-term drift.
