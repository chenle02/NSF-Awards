This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is aimed at producing
high-value metal/metal oxide composite powders (Ag, Pd, Au, Pt) by spray
pyrolysis. These powders are used extensively in the electronics industry for
manufacture of circuit boards and capacitors. Current methods of powder
synthesis cannot adequately control the size distribution of the powders, nor
give controlled phase and elemental composition and in the case of Palladium
give useful oxidation resistance. Nanochem Inc. proposes to develop novel
chemical routes to form composite particles containing the metal and an
inexpensive filler materials such as metal oxide. The proposed research will
result in a process for the generation of metal powders with high purity, narrow
size distribution, smaller particle size, and controlled elemental and phase
composition at a cost less than is possible with the current manufacturing
process. The Phase I effort will prove the feasibility of this approach by using
currently available aerosol techniques to produce Ag, Pd, Au and Pt particles
with vastly improved properties relative to existing materials. In addition,
there will be a significant cost reduction associated with the manufacture of
these composite powders due to the replacement of the metal with the inexpensive
filler material.
