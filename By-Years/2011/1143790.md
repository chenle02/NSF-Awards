Based on a successful multidisciplinary and international (Fr-US) CONCORDIASI
campaign, an evaluation of high resolution weather simulations using AMPS
(Antarctic Mesoscale Prediction System) code will be made by comparing modeled
and observed data. The extensive CONCORDIASI observation set will allow
unprecedented comparison of the regional performance of the model outputs over
Antarctica and the Southern Ocean. Approximately 640 dropsondes were deployed
from some 13 balloon flights during a 7 week period in 2010. The dropsondes
yield in-situ profiles of wind, temperature, pressure and humidity through the
Antarctic atmosphere. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In turn the performance of the model
may serve as diagnostic for a number of key meteorological phenomena in the
Antarctic, including atmospheric circulation and dynamics, and the ability to
determine momentum balance, moisture and radiation over the continent during
austral summertime. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Educational goals include
graduate student training and involvement, and potentially enhanced operational
skill of forecast models such as AMPS, used operationally in the USAP program
