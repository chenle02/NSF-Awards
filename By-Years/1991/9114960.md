Most zooplankton undergo diel vertical migration (DVM) at some stage of
development. The common pattern involves an ascent near sunset and descent near
sunrise. The most pervasive functional explanations are the animals rise to feed
at night and descend to avoid visually-oriented predators during the day. Recent
studies indicate the presence and absence of planktivores can alter DVM through
rapid behavioral changes. Since light is the most important cue for DVM,
alterations in migration by cues from predators should involve changes in
photoresponses. The research objectives in Dr. Forward's investigation are (1)
to determine whether photoresponses involved in DVM are altered by the presence
or absence of visually- and nonvisually-directed predators, and (2) to determine
whether chemical, visual and/or mechanical cues from predators induce
alterations in zooplankton photoresponses. These studies will make a significant
contribution to our basic understanding of zooplankton sensory biology and
interactions with predators.
