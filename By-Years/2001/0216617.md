With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, Lawrence
Margerum and colleagues at the University of San Francisco will acquire
electrochemical instrumentation to enhance research training and teaching. The
equipment includes a very sensitive potentiostat/galvanostat, a frequence
response detector for AC impedance measurements and modern software to be used
with microelectrodes. Research projects that will exploit this instrumentation
include a) voltammetric studies of small molecule binding to potential
macromolecular catalysts (dendrimers); b) characterization of the redox
properties of potential bioinorganic catalysts; c) measurements of heterogeneous
electron transfer rates via rapid scanning techniques; and d) characterization
of the biological gels found in the electrosensory organs of sharks.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This equipment will be used in advanced undergraduate
courses in the Chemistry and Environmental Science departments at the
university, and in an outreach program for a community-based sampling program in
collaboration with teachers and students at local high schools. These studies
will have an impact in a number of areas including development of more efficient
catalysts for the manufacturing industry and polymer chemistry.
