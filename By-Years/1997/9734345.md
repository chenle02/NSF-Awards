This CAREER project develops a general framework for the design of a new
generation of high performance robust control algorithms, their integration in
actual sensor and controllers, and application of the integrated design to
control electro-hydraulic servo-systems and linear motor driven high-speed/high-
accuracy positioning systems. The controllers combine the positive features of
both adaptive control and robust control, and their implementation leads to high
performance and energy-saving in hydraulic machines such as those developed by
Caterpillar, Inc. an industry with which the PI has developed a collaborative
research relationship. The education plan includes the integration of proposed
research in existing control courses; involvement of undergraduate and graduate
students in research; developing continuing education and short courses for
practicing engineers to facilitate technology transfer; and development of two
new courses--one at the undergraduate and the other at graduate level. The
project is aimed towards developing a solid foundation for designing high
performance robust controllers to meet the industrial needs for high
productivity and high quality products, and introduce to the engineering
students and practicing engineers a strong analytical background in this area.
