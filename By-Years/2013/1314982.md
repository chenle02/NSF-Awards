By combining single-photon technology with semiconductor electro-optical devices
we investigate a scheme for a quantum CNOT gate. Such a gate is a fundamental
building block of quantum computers and quantum communication systems.
Nanofabrication and material-growth concepts will be implemented to create
optical micro cavity structures with embedded artificial atoms in the form of a
nanoscale semiconductor structure, called a quantum dots. A quantum dot, if
positioned at the center of the cavity and at the cavity resonant frequency,
will interact with an incoming photon in such a way that the photon polarization
will become entangled with the electronic state of the quantum dot. This
interaction establishes the quantum CNOT gate; the quantum state of the photon
is changed depending on the quantum state of the
electron.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research topic directly relates to the micro
optoelectronics industry as well as to fundamental studies of confined electron
properties in semiconductors. Potential applications in classical and quantum
information storage and processing are expected to follow from this project.
Since the interactions are at the single photon level, the devices will in
principle be very energy efficient. It should however be mentioned that this
study does require low-temperature operation conditions. Alternative
implementations based on different cavity designs and different optical emitters
that remain active a room temperature will also be considered.
