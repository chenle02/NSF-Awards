A Universal Testing Machine (UTM), recently acquired by New England College, is
being used in laboratory portions of the engineering curriculum to measure such
fundamental material properties as stress- strain behavior, Poisson's rates and
modules of elasticity. Engineering students are thus being given the opportunity
to study material properties more thoroughly and with a greater degree of
accuracy, efficiency and sophistication. In addition, senior level students can
now take advantage of individualized studies and projects utilizing the UTM.
Through these activities, significant improvements in undergraduate engineering
education are being implemented.
