ABSTRACT Kibblewhite, Edward AST-9421406 Astronomical observations with
adaptive optics systems require a detailed understanding of the optical systems
and the calibration systematic errors. The Point Spread Function (PSF) affects
the signal-to noise ratio and the ability to work in crowded fields. To obtain
reasonable (5%) photometric accuracy, either the size of the aperture must be
chosen to encircle all the energy within the PSF, negating the effect of the AO
system, or a model of the PSF must be used. In addition, the success of
deconvolution and the other image enhancing techniques depends greatly on
knowledge of the PSF, The program will compare observations of five star fields
using the adaptive optics system with a natural reference source with different
orders of correction and with a Rayleigh backscattering laser beacon. The five
fields of choice are multiple-star systems with separations varying from less
than one arcsecond to roughly one arcminute. The PSF will be obtained from the
star images in each of the observations. In addition, observations in several
bands will illustrate the wavelength dependence of the PSF. Photometric
calibration will be made with observations o photometric standard stars. * * *
