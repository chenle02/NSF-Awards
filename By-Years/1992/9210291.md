Issues surrounding the social security system in the U.S. have generated a large
volume of academic research as well as wide public discussion. When the system
was first started, the main public policy objective was to provide funds for
consumption during old age. Since then, economists and policy makers have raised
concerns over the adverse effect of social security on private saving, its
negative impact on the labor supply, the incentive it creates for early
retirement, and the overall impact on the lifetime welfare of individuals. The
purpose of this research is to develop and calibrate a dynamic, stochastic
general equilibrium model to address issues like these concerning the social
security system. The focus will be to estimate the quantitative impact of the
social security system on lifetime welfare and on the capital stock under
lifetime uncertainty, liquidity constraints, and individual income risk.
Numerical methods will be used to solve a finite horizon, dynamic programming
problem and to computed competitive equilibria of the model. This research will
result in useful new insights about designing an optimal social security system.
