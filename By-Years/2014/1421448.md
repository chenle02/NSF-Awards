Modern data-center networks use software-defined networking to control the flow
of traffic among their systems. Current abstractions for software-defined
networking assume that traffic traverses the network without being modified en
route. In practice, however, many network operators utilize "middleboxes" to
perform complex traffic processing operations, such as deep packet inspection,
load balancing, WAN optimization, and caching. The goal of this project is to
achieve a transformational shift in software-defined networks from today's
limited "data transmission" view to a "data transmission and processing" view
that more accurately reflects the reality of current and future networks in
order to improve control and operational efficiently of the network
infrastructure.

The project aims to design and prototype novel mechanisms to describe,
implement, and control advanced network services in networks with centralized
and hybrid management. Specific objectives are to develop a novel control plane
for network services, design novel control plane algorithms, explore dynamics in
network traffic that affect the workload on middleboxes, and demonstrate the
capabilities of our proposed control plane for network services in a realistic
setting based on GENI. The results from this work will provide a novel approach
to controlling network services within software-defined networks.

The broader impacts of this project aim at improving network infrastructure,
which makes up the Internet and is of critical importance to society. While
software-defined networking simplifies and enhances the control that is exerted
on networks, it falls short of considering middleboxes and network services,
which are an integral part of today's network infrastructure. This project
addresses this shortcoming and provides solutions that can make software-defined
networks more useful in the future. This project will provide training to
student in state-of-the-art networking technology, and results will be
disseminated in the form of open-source toolsets and publications.
