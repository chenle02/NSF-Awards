The focus of this research is three fold. First, azo and perester containing bi-
and tri-functional free-radical initiators will be synthesized and examined as
precursors to star polymers, and block copolymers containing functional groups
at the block interfaces. Second, the radical chemistry of molecules containing
an azoxy group will be examined with a specific emphasis on determining,
depending on the position of azoxy group, the mechanisms of intramolecular
cyclization and ethylene evolution. Lastly, the mechanism by which halogens form
complexes with azoalkanes and 1,2-dialkylhydrazines will be elucidated and the
radical chemistry of the resulting adduct examined. Graduate and postdoctoral
students will be introduced to the free radical chemistry of the aforementioned
organic molecules, and free radical polymerization. With this award, the Organic
and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports the research and educational
activities of Dr. Paul Engel of the Department of Chemistry at Rice University.
Dr. Engel will focus his research on the synthesis and characterization of
organic molecules containing two or more azo or perester groups. Activating
these groups with either heat or light leads to highly reactive sites referred
to as free radicals. By positioning the azo or perester groups within the
molecule, and thereby defining the sites at which the free radicals are
generated, Dr. Engel will examine the mechanism by which two sites within the
same molecule couple to form a cyclic molecule, and the mechanisms by which
sites on one molecule react with another molecule to propagate the formation of
the radical, and the subsequent growth of polymers with new molecular shapes and
composition. Dr. Engel's educational activities involve training graduate and
postdoctoral students in the synthesis of molecules containing azo and perester
groups, their activation to form free radicals, and the characterization of the
subsequent chemistry of these reactive intermediates.
