This RCN project supports a research consortium studying effects of removing two
dams on the Elwha River on Washington's Olympic Peninsula. The Elwha Restoration
Act (1992) authorized the largest dam removal and river restoration project ever
attempted. Scheduled for 2008, removal of the dams will allow 10 populations of
anadromous fishes to return to 70 river miles blocked for 90 years. The project
offers ideal conditions for research into the fundamental ecology of river
systems. Because water above the dams is in Olympic National Park, the river is
free from impacts of human development.

This grant supports coordination of a growing consortium of scientists to
examine the return of salmon species; the fate of large woody debris; hydrology,
sediments and water quality; the role of marine derived nutrients in forest food
webs; control of invasive species; and other potential topics. The consortium
will establish by-laws, coordinate work of teams in the field, and establish the
experimental designs for the inter-connecting studies. The Elwha is a model
system for dam removal demonstrating ecological processes under ideal
conditions. Results from the Elwha will inform the world on the potentials and
pitfalls of dam removal for river restoration.
