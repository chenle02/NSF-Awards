One of the research projects at the Center for Engineering Tribology at
Northwestern University involves a mechanistic study of wear particle generation
in lubricated systems. In identifying the wear modes, it is necessary to
separate the wear particles from the lubricating oil for sebsequent analysis by
optical and electron microscopy. Funds will be used towards the purchase of a
ferograph system, which has been designed for the specific purpose of separating
wear particles from lubricants.
