This project will explore the prevalence of Silicon Valley-type clustering in
industrial R&amp;D activity in the U.S. By assembling a comprehensive and
detailed dataset on U.S. R&amp;D-performing establishments whose activities
aggregated to the regional level, it will generate the first systematic,
geographical mapping of U.S. industrial R&amp;D. In addition to documenting the
relative importance of Silicon Valley-style R&amp;D agglomeration, the project
will evaluate the determinants of the spatial distribution of R&amp;D activity.
Specifically, the project will empirically estimate what factors raise or lower
the likelihood that a firm locates its R&amp;D facilities in a particular
region. The factors examined will include the presence of other establishments
and firms performing R&amp;D, the presence of the firm's manufacturing
establishments, proximity to research universities, access to highly-educated
and highly-specialized labor markets, and a region's intellectual property and
tax policies. A specific focus of the project will be the relationship between
R&amp;D and manufacturing. Some types of R&amp;D are not easily disassociated
from the manufacturing process and this has led in these instances to the co-
location of R&amp;D and manufacturing. Because this project will document the
evolution of the spatial distribution of R&amp;D activities over the last three
decades, it will shed light on how the off-shoring of the U.S. manufacturing
industry has affected U.S. comparative advantage in R&amp;D.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: This project will generate the first,
systematic geographical mapping of U.S. industrial R&amp;D using the Census-NSF
Survey of Industrial R&amp;D (SIRD) and in its successor survey the Business
R&amp;D and Innovation Survey (BRDIS). This project will increase our
understanding of how R&amp;D in the U.S. is organized, and in particular the
importance of agglomeration in R&amp;D, of co-location of R&amp;D and
manufacturing, of geographically-mediated spillovers among R&amp;D
establishments and between research universities and industrial R&amp;D, and of
intellectual property considerations. In addition, the results of this project
will contribute to a wide range of policy discussions, including discussions of
regional and national growth policy, industrial policy, intellectual property
law, university research and its public funding, and the impact of higher
education on the economy.
