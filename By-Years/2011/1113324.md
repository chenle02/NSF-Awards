This grant will partially fund a workshop titled: Workshop on Communicating STEM
through STEM Education in Hawaii. The funds provided in this award will be used
exclusively to pay for the participation of undergraduate and graduate students
in this workshop. The primary goals of the workshop are
to:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Improve the communication skills of students and
early-career scientists and engineers&lt;br/&gt;* Improve the understanding of
how improvements to high school and college science curricula can help advance
diverse students into STEM careers&lt;br/&gt;* Make connections between students
and the technology industry on Maui&lt;br/&gt;* Enhance the participation of
local students into the Akamai Workforce Initiative.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
student participants will attend two seminars on effective communication and
then present a poster using the methods of communication they learned in the
seminars. The posters will be presented at the Maui Science and Technology
Education Exchange meeting. After the workshop and poster presentations the
students will write-up their projects and those project summaries will be
included on a web page and in a published booklet. This workshop will
concentrate on the theme of 'workforce development', especially as related to
the astronomy research that is conducted on Maui and the island of Hawaii.
