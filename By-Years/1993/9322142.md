9322142 Sharifnia This Research Experiences for Undergraduates project will
involve undergraduates with the application of the dynamic systems, control
theory, and operations research to important manufacturing engineering problems.
Specific research areas include design and operation of manufacturing systems,
robotics, and manufacturing processes. The research projects will address
modeling, analysis, control, and performance evaluation aspects of these systems
or processes. ***
