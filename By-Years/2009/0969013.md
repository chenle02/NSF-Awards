Power consumption, which has increased dramatically with IC technology
advancement and system complexity, has become a critical issue in design of more
complicated, versatile, and reliable systems. The International Roadmap for
Semiconductors (ITRS) report estimates that a 20-times dynamic power consumption
gap and as much as 800-times standby power consumption gap for portable devices
need to be closed by the year 2016. Left unchecked, power consumption will
curtail the feasibility of future advanced real-time embedded systems. This NSF
CAREER research project is leveraging current operating system functionality to
support real-time and power-aware computation that can meet the increasingly
stringent timing and power/energy constraints for advanced real-time and
embedded applications. In particular, this research is developing innovative
scheduling techniques and decision functions that can exploit hardware
capabilities and make proper tradeoffs. These techniques are based on knowledge
of hardware infrastructure features and the intentions of applications, as
communicated through the operating system layer. The expected impact of this
research lies in its promise to alleviate the inadequacy and inefficiency of
power and energy conservation in todays real-time embedded applications. Such
applications are of great economic importance. They already prevalent and are
becoming increasingly pervasive. Through experimental, application-based
research, this project seeks to validate and provide sound studies of its
theoretical system-level power reduction techniques under practical scenarios
such as automotive electronics. Integration of research and education is carried
out under this CAREER project via the course development, graduate/undergraduate
student mentoring, out-reach, and dissemination of results. The project offers
hands-on learning opportunities for pre-college, undergraduate, and graduate
students.
