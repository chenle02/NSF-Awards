9457735 Jin The overall objective of this research project is to develop
accurate and efficient computational methods for analysis of electromagnetic
problems in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and high power microwaves. The
focus will be on the development of hybrid finite element methods capable of
simulating large and complex objects. To be more specific, a finite element
method will be developed to characterize the interactions between the radio-
frequency (RF) field, generated by an MRI antenna, and the human body in an MRI
environment. A better understanding of such interactions can provide guidelines
for designing MRI antennas that have a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and good
RF magnetic field (B1 field) homogeneity in the region of interest. The method
to be developed will be able to model the MRI antennas, the environment of the
MRI system, and the anatomical and inhomogeneous dissimilar tissues. Based on
this method, we then plan to develop an inverse method for a systematic
optimization of the design of MRI antennas. In addition, a hybrid finite element
methods will be developed to characterize the interactions between high power
microwaves and complex cavity situated in a large object such as an airplane. A
clear understanding of such interactions is instrumental in developing new
electronic system capable of functioning normally in any high-intensity ambient
(i) complex internal structures, (ii) external environments, and (iii) coupling
of energy form external environments to internal systems. ***
