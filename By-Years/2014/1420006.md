Reading proficiency is fundamental to school and subsequent career success, yet
national statistics show that only about one-third of US fourth graders are
proficient readers. Very little is known about how learning to read is reflected
in brain changes. The goal of this project is to investigate how a reading
intervention results in changes in brain activity associated with recognizing
words, recognizing sound-letter correspondences, and memory for auditory
information. This will provide important insights into how reading skills are
acquired and what types of interventions might be most effective for those who
are having difficulty learning to read.

The project uses a pre-post design to investigate plasticity of neural systems
involved in lexical processing, phonological processing, and working memory
components of reading. The study uses both behavioral and event-related
potential (ERP) measures to investigate how an established reading intervention
changes specific neural systems in 8- and 9-year-old children who are struggling
readers. Brain waves will be recorded before and after the intervention to
explore the plasticity of (1) the lexical processing system, addressing whether
the intervention sharpens the neural response to words (e.g., bed) as compared
to non-words (e.g., dbe); (2) the phonological processing system, addressing
whether the intervention changes the neural response to rhyming information; and
(3) the working memory system, addressing whether the intervention alters the
timing or amount of resources used to remember sounds. Scores on a battery of
standardized tests of reading and reading-related skills will document
behavioral changes that occur with intervention. Overall, this project will
advance understanding of the specific neural changes resulting from the
intervention and improved reading abilities. A key impact of this project is the
opportunity to increase the chance of educational success for struggling
readers.
