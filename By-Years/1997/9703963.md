*** 9703963 Halpern This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II
project will enhance the capabilities of the "electron jet", or "e-jet," thin
film deposition source. E-jet is a versatile source for the Jet Vapor Deposition
(JVD) process. JVD uses supersonic "jets in low vacuum" to deposit metals,
semiconductors, oxides, nitrides, in alloy, multicomponent, multilayer, and
doped structures. JVD is a low cost, environmentally clean process with economic
promise in semiconductor integrated circuits (IC), metal strip coating,
protective layers, and optics. The e-jet can vaporize any metal and deposit
films at high rate, and its high plasma ion density enables low energy, high
flux ion bombardment. Deposition rate and ion bombardment are critical to
various applications. This project will optimize e-jet metal throughput and ion
density in order to maximize deposition rate, extend source life, and control
film properties. Phase II will conduct mass spectrometer studies of metal atom
clustering (a rate limiter), investigate hydrogen atom chemical energy
deposition, develop a high rate powder feed e-jet, and investigate e-jet
deposition of silicon nitride for gate dielectrics and copper for trench fill.
Commercial applications are expected in metal strip coating of electrical
interconnects, silicon nitride deposition for semiconductor IC circuit gate
dielectrics, and protective thermal barrier coatings, such as in turbine blades.
