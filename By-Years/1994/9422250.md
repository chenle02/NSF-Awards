9422250 Coyle This award is to establish a testbed for `oth experimentation with
and modeling and analysis of traffic on high-speed, heterogeneous, local area
networks. The equipment purchased for the testbed includes three ATM switches,
one of which provides access to other types of networks, and a high-performance
workstation with extensive video capability. The following equipment will be
connected to the testbed: 17 high-performance workstations located in various
laboratories and research groups; two servers of, and the Ethernet backbone for
the Engineering Computer Network (ECN), which supports over 12,000 users; and,
at least two T1 lines provided by GTE for access to local hospitals and high
schools. The testbed will have access to the Internet through the ECN. These
connections will allow network traffic from many different applications to be
brought into the testbed for study. The research this testbed will support
includes: Modeling and analysis of network traffic statistics and network
control algorithms; Communication network design and analysis; Discrete event
system simulations driven by empirical data; Video and image compression
algorithms for ATM networks; Distributed simulation and visualization for
manufacturing and the teleoperation of robots. ***
