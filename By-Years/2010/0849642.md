Radford University is proposing an interdisciplinary S-STEM effort between the
Departments of Biology, Chemistry, Physics and Geology, Information Technology
and Mathematics in the College of Science and Technology (CSAT). The program
builds upon lessons learned in a prior CSEMS award. The project is planning to
use a variety of innovative strategies to support students. For example an
online management system is combined with advising Action Plans to allow for
careful student monitoring. Scholarship recipients are also to be provided with
leadership knowledge and experiences and graduate with a leadership certificate.
Recipients are to complete a career development seminar and be supported to
obtain internships. The project is to award 20 new scholarships annually for a
total of 80 students over four years.
