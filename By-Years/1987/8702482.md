Seaver Engineering Associates proposes to develop an expendable optical sensing
system to measure oceanic depth and temperature (an optical bathythermograph,
BT). The commercial development of the expendable bathythermograph (XBT) in the
1960s began a revolution in the process of making oceanographic measurements.
The XBT alleviated the need for a ship to stop at a location and laboriously
lower and raise an instrument while recording, on deck, the measurements as they
were transmitted up the electrical winch wire. The XBT is merely thrown
overboard while a ship is underway and its data is tramsmitted up a thin
expendable wire. The ship never stops and, as a consequence, becomes far more
efficient, dramatically reducing the time per measurement and increasing the
quantity of data. Literally hundreds of thousands of XBT measurements are now
taken every year. The proposal by Seaver is to develop an optical expendable BT.
Optics have a number of advantages over standard electromechanical measurement
devices intended for ocean use including high data rates, low attenuation, light
weight, non- corrosible, and unaffected by electrical grounding. Further, with
costs for optical fiber continually dropping, it is quite likely that an optical
system will become cheaper than present systems. Seaver demonstrated the
feasibility of an optical pressure and temperature sensor in Phase I of Small
Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program. This proposal, for Phase II SBIR
funding, is to develop a prototype instrument and to calibrate and test it.
