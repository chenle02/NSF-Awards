This mathematics research project aims to apply insights from physics to
questions in number theory. A central theme in theoretical physics is electric-
magnetic duality, the symmetry between electricity and magnetism in Maxwell's
equations and its generalization to idealized (supersymmetric) variants of the
equations that govern the weak and strong nuclear forces. One of the central
themes in number theory is the Langlands program, a profound link between
arithmetic and geometry that counts among its successes the proof of Fermat's
Last Theorem. A surprisingly close analogy between these two themes has been
developed in the last decade. This project employs structures that are natural
in physics to provide crucial insights missing in the number theory --
specifically, the behavior of boundaries or edges in physics suggests a new
understanding of the use of integral calculus in arithmetic. This project
provides research training opportunities for graduate
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to develop new
connections between physics and number theory. Electric-magnetic duality, the
symmetry between electricity and magnetism (a variant of the Fourier transform),
and its generalization (S-duality) to supersymmetric variants of the nonabelian
gauge theories that describe fundamental interactions, can be considered
analogous to the Langlands program, a profound nonabelian analog of the Fourier
transform linking arithmetic questions to the algebra and analysis of symmetry
groups. This project will take insights from physics (the understanding of
electric-magnetic duality for boundary conditions) and apply them to fundamental
problems in number theory (the connection between period integrals and the
arithmetic of L-functions). The investigator will work to disseminate physics
ideas to number theorists and vice versa, bridging two intellectually distant
communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
