The goals of PRE-STAT are to enable college faculty to enhance the statistical
education of preservice teachers on their home campuses and to encourage active
learning through problem-solving in order to improve statistical education in
the middle and secondary schools. The PRE-STAT project is developing a model
faculty development workshop which prepares participating mathematics educators
to implement an effective statistical education curriculum. A network of teacher
educators is being established to share statistical education ideas. PRE-STAT is
also supporting the participants during the development of incorporation of
statistical education components into the curriculum at their home institutions
for preservice and inservice teachers. Curriculum ideas are being organized into
"Guidelines" for differing curriculum settings. The PRE-STAT project is
disseminating ideas including (1) curriculum guidelines developed by
participants and (2) instructional activities appropriate for these curricula. A
World Wide Web site is being implemented and maintained to share ideas. PRE-STAT
is a two-year project which begins with faculty development workshops in the
summer of 1998 at Appalachian State and Montana State Universities. A follow-up
phase during 1998-99 is providing support for participants. PRE-STAT builds on
ideas developed in previous projects.
