The research project concerns one of the basic questions in mathematics: solving
algebraic equations. Information about solutions is encoded in various
mathematical objects, including arithmetic varieties and automorphic
L-functions. This research aims to deepen the understanding of these
mathematical objects, especially in higher dimension, which requires developing
new tools and interactions in diverse areas and appealing to new perspectives
that may shed new light on longstanding open questions. The project also aims to
advance the techniques for understanding the arithmetic of elliptic curves,
particularly the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, one of the seven
Millennium Prize Problems of the Clay Mathematics
Institute.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research consists of several projects
relating arithmetic geometry with automorphic L-functions, centered on the
common theme of the generalization and applications of the Gross–Zagier formula.
The PI will investigate the Kudla–Rapoport conjecture for ramified unitary
groups and orthogonal groups. The PI plans to extend the arithmetic inner
product formula and apply it to the Beilinson–Bloch and Bloch–Kato conjectures
of symmetric power motives of elliptic curves. The PI will also investigate a
new arithmetic relative trace formula approach towards a Gross–Zagier type
formula for orthogonal Shimura varieties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
