Maintenance and repair are by far the greatest problems in the effective
utilization of modern scientific instrumentation. This is particularly critical
at community colleges and smaller colleges and universities where the requisite
expertise and adequate funds for repair and maintenance may not be available. To
provide assistance in dealing with these problems, Iowa State University is
offering a repair and maintenance service for scientific instrumentation to
colleges and universities within Iowa and adjacent states--a total of nearly
fifty institutions. The service is provided by trained electronics personnel
working from a mobile van outfitted as an electronics shop. The project is
patterned after, and was developed following consultation with, a similar
project at Georgia Tech that has received Foundation support in the past and has
been notably successful. Significant university support is also dedicated to
support of the project which, after the term of this award, is expected to
become self-supporting.
