Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American recovery
and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
objective of this program is to investigate tandem two-photon absorption (2PA)
stimulated emission depletion (STED) processes for high density, nanoscopic
write-once read-many (WORM) 3D optical data storage
(ODS).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit is developing a fundamental
understanding of the application and limitations of two-photon STED for 3D
spatially-localized photoacid production and sub-80 nm voxel formation (data
encoding), understanding the application and limitations of two-photon STED for
sub-80 nm voxel 3D readout of a protonated 2PA fluorophore, and developing an
integrated double STED-based two-photon 3D ODS
prototype.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the proposed research are
far reaching, affecting nearly all aspects of US society. The interdisciplinary
nature of optical data storage (ODS), coupled with its omnipresence, presents a
unique opportunity to educate and train undergraduate, graduate, middle, and
high school students, along with their teachers, and the general public, in the
science that underlies current and future ODS technologies. Undergraduate and
graduate students involved in this project will gain an integrated understanding
of advanced photonics, photophysics, and materials chemistry. Students that are
traditionally underrepresented in science and engineering will be engaged in
this interdisciplinary research, facilitating the preparation of a highly
skilled and diverse workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is
transformative and expected to lead to a break though in 3D optical data
storage, affording unprecedented 3D optical data storage densities (up to 1
terabyte per cubic mm). Knowledge gained in this research will provide the
tenets for future photonic materials and systems design.&lt;br/&gt;
