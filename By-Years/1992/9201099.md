An illustrated vascular flora of the Intermountain Region of western United
State is being prepared with descriptions, full synonymy, and commentary as
necessary. The Intermountain Flora is a six-volume series treating the natural
floristic region consisting of Utah, nearly all of Nevada, Southern Idaho,
Southeastern Oregon, and small parts of Wyoming, California, and Arizona. Five
volumes have been completed. The final volume has been begun and will be
completed in the proposed three years. Preparation of the Flora entails
extensive study of the plants in the field as well as in the herbarium, and also
requires a thorough bibliographic inquiry. Aside from its intrinsic scientific
interest, Intermountain Flora is of fundamental importance in the preparation of
environmental impact statements in connection with possible mining or other
industrial development in the region, and is a source of information on
threatened and endangered species. Land managers working for the Forest Service,
Bureau of Land Management, Fish and Wildlife Service, and National Park Service
also find Intermountain Flora indispensable.
