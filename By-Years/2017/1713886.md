The basic mathematical models that describe the behavior of fluid flows date
back to the eighteenth century, and yet many phenomena observed in experiments
are far from being well understood from a theoretical viewpoint. For instance,
especially challenging is the study of fundamental stability mechanisms when
weak dissipative forces (generated, for example, by molecular friction) interact
with advection processes, such as mixing and stirring. The goal of this project
is to develop new mathematical tools that may be used to make progress towards
outstanding open problems in fluid dynamics and hydrodynamic stability, such as
the stability of vortices and laminar flows, the appearance of coherent
structures in turbulence and atmosphere/ocean dynamics, and the statistical
description of turbulent flows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project
revolves around the concepts of mixing and enhanced dissipation effects induced
by a fluid, a mechanism that has been proven to be strongly connected to
fundamental dissipation mechanisms in kinetic theory (Landau damping) and in
fluid mechanics (inviscid damping). The investigator and collaborators aim to
expand this emerging field of nonlinear partial differential equations, by
building new analytical tools to study the complicated interaction between
purely mathematical questions (regularity issues, perturbations of stochastic
type, dynamical systems in infinite-dimensions) and concepts widely related to
physical phenomena (mixing and nonlinear resonances). The goal is to develop
robust nonlinear methods, with ideas borrowed from hypoellipticity in the sense
of HÃ¶rmander, harmonic analysis and singular integral theory, and probability
and stochastic processes.
