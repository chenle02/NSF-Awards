9723890 Sponsel Originating from a population of ABA-insensitive mutant,
mutagenesis has produced stem-length dwarf mutants that are unresponsive to
gibberellins. The work will characterize a group of mutants which are either
rescued by external GA, or are unresponsive to external GA. This work includes
mutant complementation, gene cloning and characterization, and biochemical
characterization of enzymes in the GA biosynthesis pathway which are indicated
as potentially defective by the phenotypic behavior of the mutant plants.
