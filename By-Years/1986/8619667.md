An experimental investigation is proposed of the feasibility of extending the
principle of water (low viscosity) lubricated pipeline transport of thick crude
oils (high viscosity) to the case where the viscous fluid is a dispersion of
coal in oil. The investigator proposes to explore the possibility that his
observation of a high degree of stability for the retention of coal in the oil,
under limited conditions, may permit coal to be retained under realistic flow
conditions. This would permit large reductions in pumping power through the use
of a low viscosity lubricating fluid which could be easily separated from the
slurry/dispersion being pumped. Applications to complex slurry/dispersions in
the food and paper industries could also be favorably impacted by this research.
Funding is highly recommended.
