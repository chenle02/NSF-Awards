Computer simulations are used in virtually every branch of science and
engineering, because some problems are simply beyond closed form mathematical
solution, and because computers have become extremely fast. Against that trend,
there is the constant feeling, and mathematical support, for the idea that
strategically sampled values can give even better results than random ones do.
Computer generated imaging is one of the largest users of simulations.
Simulations of the behavior of light underly images from the economically
significant motion picture and computer game industries, to problems of
architectural rendering and scientific visualization. Many of the same ideas
that go into choosing input points for simulations are also used to computerize
difficult statistical decisions and to design
industrial&lt;br/&gt;products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quasi-Monte Carlo sampling
is a method of producing inputs that are more evenly distributed than random
points are. They are said to have low discrepancy. Most of the existing low
discrepancy solutions are about placing points inside the unit cube. Some
applications in computer rendering require samples from the triangle, simplex or
other such spaces. Plain Monte Carlo sampling of those spaces is straightforward
but low discrepancy sampling is quite different. The transformations that work
for Monte Carlo may destroy the low discrepancy properties of the resulting
points in the triangle. This project will develop low discrepancy sampling
methods for the triangle and for tensor products of triangles. Factor analysis
is about hundred years old, yet it remains problematic to even choose the number
of factors to use in it. This project will develop cross-validatory methods to
select the number of factors.
