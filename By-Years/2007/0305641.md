Grids are evolving towards supporting a dynamic, collaborative,
multidisciplenary problem-solving environment coined the virtual organization
(VO). To date, adaptivity has been treated in an ad-hoc fashion leading to
application-specific solutions that cannot be reused. In this proposal, a
framework for exposing, exploiting, and coping with adaptivity in Grids is
proposed. The key elements of this framework are the definition of OGSA-
compliant adaptive Grid service classes for high-end services common to
parallel/distributed scientific computing as well as adaptive resource provider
services. To ease the implementation of adaptive Grid services, reusable
middleware will be designed as part of this project. This next-generation
middleware addresses four fundamental issues required to construct adaptive
services: &lt;br/&gt;(1) adaptive service interfaces,&lt;br/&gt;(2) dynamic
performance prediction,&lt;br/&gt;(3) adaptive resource management, and
&lt;br/&gt;(4) adaptive run-time infrastructure for MPI. Several novel
approaches are proposed including algorithms for dynamically selecting
performance estimators as well as selecting resource management strategies.
