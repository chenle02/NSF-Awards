Design and fabrication of tooling for net shape forming processes is a lengthy,
complex and expensive undertaking. Research addresses feasibility of producing
an expert system for use by product and process designers in evaluating and
selecting production processes. These processes require detailed understanding
and control of several interacting phenomena: metal flow, heat transfer, and
friction, within a three dimensional structure--the tooling. Because of the
complexity of these phenomena the design of the tooling is based in part on
rules in the minds of experts, and impact on analytical models. The approach in
this project is to embed both types of knowledge in a microcomputer, in a form
usable by small manufacturing firms.
