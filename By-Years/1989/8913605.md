This work attempts to understand conduction, aging, degradation, and breakdown
mechanisms in high field stressed gaseous, liquid, and solid dielectrics using
new modern optical, electronic, and computer instrumentation to see charge
transport effects inside materials that could not be seen before. Insulating
dielectrics used in power apparatus, such as transformers and cables, and in
pulse power technology, such as Marx generators and pulse forming lines, have
their performance affected by injected space charge. The space charge distorts
the electric field distribution and introduces the charge migration time between
electrodes as an additional time constant over the usual dielectric relaxation
and fluid transport times. Charge injection from high voltage stressed
electrodes is measured by Kerr electro-optic field and charge mapping
measurements. Such optical measurements have been performed for highly purified
water, water/ethylene glycol mixtures, transformer oil, silicon oil, liquid and
gaseous SF6, liquid nitrogen, and high voltage stressed and electron beam
irradiated polymethylmethacrylate. In highly purified water, Kerr electro-optic
measurements, voltage-current terminal measurements, and electrical breakdown
tests have shown that the magnitude and polarity of injected charge and the
electrical breakdown strength depend strongly on electrode material combinations
and voltage polarity. Particular tasks are: (1) Kerr effect measurements
including low-voltage prestressing of dielectrics; (2) electron beam irradiation
of solids; (3) fractal mathematical modeling of electrical breakdown trees; and
(4) electrokinetic pumping using traveling wave high voltages.
