The acquisition of a 200 MHz Fourier transform Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
spectrometer with multinuclear and variable temperature capabilities will
improve the quality of the chemistry program. The instrument will be used by all
of the chemistry majors, many allied science majors including physics and
biology majors, area secondary school chemistry teachers, and selected minority
high school students. Hands-on undergraduate student use of FT-NMR will occur in
the organic chemistry, organic instrumental analysis, chemical synthesis,
physical chemistry, analytical chemistry, and biochemistry courses, as well as
in student research projects. A positive long range effect will result from the
exposure of secondary school chemistry teachers and high school minority
students to this important new technology. The grantee will match the NSF award
from non-Federal sources.
