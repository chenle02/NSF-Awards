Gas Chromatography/mass spectroscopy is being integrated into the undergraduate
laboratory experience. Current literature in analytical chemistry reveal a
growing dependence upon GC/MS techniques, especially in the areas of
Environmental Protection Agency priority pollutant analysis and in the rapidly
expanding field of drug analysis. Exposure to such a system at the undergraduate
level would be an advantageous introduction to advanced methods of chemical
analysis. In particular, the Ion Trap System available from Finnigan MAT is
being employed. This recently introduced instrument has several potential
advantages for use at the undergraduate level including increased durability and
lower maintenance than corresponding quadrupole or magnetic sector mass
spectrometers and simplified operation through complete computer control. These
factors are of primary importance for the undergraduate laboratory where the
system is subjected to users with varying degrees of competence. The department
has recently converted the organic laboratory to microscale which results in an
inherent dependence upon advanced instrumentation for analysis. The high
selectivity and sensitivity of the GC/MS system is ideally suited for microscale
analysis and the Ion Trap System is being incorporated into the sophomore year
organic chemistry for analysis of student prepared compounds. Additionally, the
instrument is being employed in junior year analytical chemistry for the
separation and analysis of multicomponent mixtures and for an introduction to
computer controlled instrumentation through programming in FORTH language. The
instrument is also becoming an integral part of the strong research program,
allowing more efficient utilization of the instrument with year-round use. The
