This award supports the study of a series of Arctic lake-sediment cores in a
program to ascertain the best methods of obtaining reliable 14C dates on such
material. The paleoclimate record in lake sediments gives a very complete record
of climatic change, and as such these samples represent ideal material for the
study of environmental changes which have occurred over the last millennium, and
tens of millennia. Earlier studies have demonstrated that radiocarbon dating of
lake sediments can be problematic, due to the incorporation of fossil and
reworked carbon, and uptake of dissolved carbonate by aquatic plants and
organisms. This project is a coordinated effort combining the expertise of the
INSTAAR group at the University of Colorado with that of the AMS radiocarbon
dating laboratory at University of Arizona. Research will focus on extracting
14C information from a variety of physical and chemical separates of sediment as
a function of depth in a series of lake cores showing both "reliable" and
"problematic" dates. This program will develop of procedures to produce more
reliable dates for the expected increase in the study of Arctic lake sediment.
