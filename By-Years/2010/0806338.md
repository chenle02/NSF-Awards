This proposal requests support for the continued operation of, and analysis of
data from, a closely-spaced array of four search coil magnetometers (induction
antennas) the installation of which began in September 2006 on Svalbard, Norway,
for studies of ULF waves and associated phenomena in Earth?s space environment.
In addition to induction coil magnetometers, instruments on Svalbard include
numerous auroral imagers and photometers, multiple radars including EISCAT,
SPEAR, and SuperDARN, and the northernmost stations in the IMAGE array of
fluxgate magnetometers. Such a complete suite of instruments enables the
association of various features in the observations with specific magnetospheric
regions, such as the plasma sheet, low latitude boundary layer, cusp proper, or
plasma mantle, with more confidence and reliability than in earlier studies at
other locations. The role of induction coil magnetometers is to detect magnetic
fluctuations in the frequency range 0.02 - 5 Hz. This project is part of an
international effort by the space science community to better understand the
dynamics of Earth?s magnetosphere and of its interaction with the solar wind and
IMF.
