This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project will optimize a newly
developed ceramic-metallic (cermet) resistive heating material and prove its
feasibility for use in diesel particulate filters. Objectives include
optimization of the cermet composition and laminates, characterization of
physical properties, and development of multi-layer ceramic tape manufacturing
methods for producing multichannel filter monoliths with integral cermet heating
elements. The research will optimize the cermet composition based on analysis of
life and temperature cycling, heat transfer capabilities, and thermal gradient
control. The anticipated result of the project will be a small-scale particulate
filter with an integral cermet heating element that provides continuous thermal
oxidation of particulates.

The new cermet heating material has immediate commercial potential as a heating
element that can be integrated into diesel particulate filter structures for the
continuous thermal oxidation of particulates (at approximately 600 C). With new
emissions controls scheduled to take effect in 2007, there is presently a
compelling need for a compact, simple-to-maintain, durable, and effective diesel
particulate filter for both new and existing diesel-powered vehicles.
