The Biological Research Station of the Edmund Niles Huyck Preserve on the
Helderberg Plateau in Rensselaerville, N.Y., has been in existence since 1938.
Since then some 155 researchers have conducted over 225 projects and published
170 papers. An historical data base has been developed on the geology,
hydrology, climate, and biota. Current research programs focus on the biology of
forest floor biota and the decomposer food web, forest succession, and
behavioral ecology and evolution. Research has now moved beyond the simple
cataloguing of species and equipment (e.g. microscopes, drying oven, autoclave,
balance) is needed by most researchers that use the Preserve to answer the in-
depth questions being posed today. Much of the research asks questions about
factors that affect the occurrence of organisms and data must be available on
weather which can affect biotic distributions. This project provides funds to
help upgrade the facilities of the Research Station through the addition of
needed research equipment and weather stations, and the winterization of the
main researcher living quarters.
