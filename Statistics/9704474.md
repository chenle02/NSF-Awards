Modeling and Statistical Analysis of Mental Test Data William Stout University
of Illinois Abstract This research involves the probabilistic modeling and
statistical analysis of multiple question(item) mental test data. The
investigator has in the past used the nonparametric item response theory(IRT)
paradigm to study test fairness, the statistical assessment of complex latent
IRT structures, and the cognitive process/psychometric modeling and cognitive
diagnosis of test taking examinees using the investigator co-developed Unified
Cognitive Model. Now, it is proposed to develop a nonparametric item level
geometric description of the item structure analogous to the classical subtest
score level factor analytic approach. It is planned to develop a practical
operational cognitive testing procedures based on the Unified model. It is
proposed to further develop the test bias procedure, SIBTEST, in various much
needed ways. A practical need cutting across all three areas is forour
nonparametric procedures to be modified to match on liklihood based latent
ability estimates as well as on their currently used number correct scores. The
research involves developing mathematical models and statistical procedures to
improve standardized and classroom tests and to improve the measurement of
examinee performance on such tests. There is a special emphasis on providing an
educationally useful concept mastery profile for each examinee based upon
his/her individual test question responses, on providing fairer tests, and on
assessing the substantive complexity of skills required for performing well on a
test. In particular, it is desired to (i) provide for each item a description of
what it measures best, (ii) to produce fairer tests -- in particular by
informing the construction specifications of future tests about biased item
types that should be excluded, and (iii) to provide for educators detail ed
feedback of concept mastery and nonmastery for each individual examinee to be
used to guide further instruction and remedial efforts. Because standardized
tests are ever more ubiquitous in American society and noting their gatekeeper
role, the above work, if successful, should have a major impact on how effective
standardized tests in America are and indeed could improve the educational
process in the classroom.
