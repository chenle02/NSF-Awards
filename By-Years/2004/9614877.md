9614877 Shen and Jackson The PIs propose to investigate tectonic deformation in
China by analyzing geodetic data from a many-station Global Positioning System
(GPS) array spanning a 500,000 sq. km. region in China. The array was
established by the State Seismological Bureau (SSB) in Tianjin, China, and
surveys have been conducted since 1992. The PIs propose to collaborate with
Chinese colleagues to analyze and interpret these GPS data to provide an
understanding of large scale deformation across eastern China, and to provide a
set of accurate fiducial station positions and improved satellite orbit
parameters to support dense regional surveys. The work would include technology
transfer and training in the use of GAMIT and GLOBK software for the Chinese
collaborators. This proposal is linked to INT award 9602179, "GPS Studies in
Northern China". ***
