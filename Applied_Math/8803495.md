This project concerns mathematical questions deriving from classical results on
the arithmetic-geometric mean inequalities which have many connections with
diverse parts of mathematics. One can view the arithmetic and geometric mean of
two numbers as an ordered pair and then iterate this pairing. In doing so, one
always arrives at a limit of equal numbers. This principle will be studied in
the context of functional analysis in which the objects of the iteration are
noncommuting linear operators and the process, instead of computing means, is a
more general one of mappings of the interior of a cone into itself. The
objective will be to find unique fixed rays (eigenvectors). Applications are
expected to be made to questions arising in population biology. Other,
continuing, work will be done on delay- differential equations in the context of
a singular perturbations. The objectives here are to determine whether or not
nonconstant periodic solutions can be predicted - especially of period four, a
problem which occurs in the study of boundary layer phenomena.
