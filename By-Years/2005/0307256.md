Dr. Roger Chevalier at the University of Virginia and Dr. John Blondin at North
Carolina State University are awarded funds to model the young remnants of
massive star supernovae. During their lifetimes, massive stars undergo mass loss
during various evolutionary phases. When they finally end their lives as
supernovae, the interaction depends on both the mass loss processes leading up
to the explosion and the structure of the exploding star. Multi-wavelength
observations of this interaction will be modeled for various types of massive
star supernovae. Realistic stellar models will be used in hydrodynamic models of
the interaction, including the effects of inhomogeneous structure in the
circumstellar material. The physical processes to be investigated include the
production of X-ray emission, electron heating in fast shock waves, the
production and evolution of relativistic electrons and their emission, possible
dust formation in a dense interaction shell, infrared emission from
collisionally heated dust, and spectral properties expected for various
interaction components. The mass loss properties of various kinds of massive
star supernovae will be determined and related to expectations from evolutionary
models.

This work has broad implications for astrophysics in that it is relevant to the
late evolution of massive stars, the return of heavy elements to the
interstellar medium, and physical processes at high energy densities. The
research will build ties between the University of Virginia, North Carolina
State University, and Stockholm Observatory. This work will also result in the
training of a graduate student in computer simulation techniques. A module
describing the results of three-dimensional simulations will be added to a
public web site that already offers the existing code. Finally, the research
results will be integrated into undergraduate courses and public lectures.
