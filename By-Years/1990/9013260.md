The Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences, located on Maine's Boothbay Harbor,
has been a center for marine research since 1974. The Lab is best known for
research on marine phytoplankton. In addition to hosting both resident and
visiting researchers, the Lab is the site of the Provasoli-Guillard Center for
Culture of Marine Phytoplankton, the MacIsaac Flow Cytometry and Cell Sorting
Facility, and a remote sensing laboratory. Dr. Robert Andersen, a staff research
scientist at Bigelow Lab, proposes acquisition of a transmission electron
microscope (TEM) for the Lab. Acquisition of the proposed TEM would have a
substantial impact on both the quality and quantity of research accomplished at
Bigelow Lab. The closest electron microscope is currently in Orono, Maine, a two
hour drive from the Lab. This distance discourages many visiting scientists from
initiating research at the Lab, and hinders those researchers working there. The
Culture Collection at the Lab is an important international systematic resource,
and the presence of a TEM would facilitate an immediate high level of research
activity. Bigelow Lab has an excellent reputation for supporting visiting
scientists with facilities and instrumentation. The proposed acquisition of a
multi-user TEM would benefit a wide range of marine biologists, oceanographers,
microbiologists and evolutionary systematists.
