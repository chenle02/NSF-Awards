This proposal provides partial funding to create an Institute for Rock
Magnetism at the University of Minnesota. The Institute will provide technical
support and advanced equipment needed for the magnetic characterization of rocks
and their constituent minerals for in-house and visiting rock-magnetism and
paleomagnetism researchers. New methods based on magneto-optics and electron-
optics for mapping magnetization fluctuations at a scale of 10 nm in single, in-
situ, grains, and new techniques for synthesis of ultrafine magnetic minerals of
controlled grainsize and internal strain have created the conditions for a
renaissance in rock magnetism. The new thrust made possible is aimed at better
understanding of the ways in which rocks acquire and retain their magnetization
through geologic time. The benefits of such new understanding ranges from
explaining how the earth's magnetic field reverses its polarity to an improved
ability to decipher the magnetization of rocks in terms of ancient geomagnetic
fields and the resulting reconstructions of past global changes in continental
land masses.
