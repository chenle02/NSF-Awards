This project is investigating MOS data acquisition circuits. The research is
directed toward establishing the fundamental factors which limit the performance
of MOS analog-digital interface circuits, and toward synthesizing architectures
which closely approach those fundamental limits. Specific topics for
investigation include self- calibrated pipelined A/D circuits, video CODEC's,
investigation of fundamental performance limits in sample and hold circuits,
concurrent analog processing in A/D converters, and mixed-level simulation for
A/D interface applications.
