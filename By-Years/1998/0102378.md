The University of Hawai'i at Hilo, on behalf of the state of Hawai'i, has
requested NSF&lt;br/&gt;support for a planning grant designed to help Hawai'i
set priorities for the improvement&lt;br/&gt;of the state's basic science and
engineering research infrastructure. The project's&lt;br/&gt;objective is to
design a statewide science and technology (S &amp;T) plan that will
stimulate&lt;br/&gt;economic opportunities and wealth building capacity. The
planning process will examine&lt;br/&gt;activities that have the potential to:
(1) affect greater participation in academic research&lt;br/&gt;and development
(R&amp;D) and (2) significantly improve the status of science
and&lt;br/&gt;technology (S&amp;T) education and workforce development. The
planning process will&lt;br/&gt;analyze the state's current S&amp;T
infrastructure and inventory current research personnel&lt;br/&gt;and
facilities. This analysis includes identifying: S&amp;T areas of current
research&lt;br/&gt;excellence as well as areas with the potential for future
national R&amp;D competitiveness.&lt;br/&gt;The planning process will result in
a coordinated state-wide effort to improve academic&lt;br/&gt;R&amp;D
capabilities in targeted disciplines, enhance training and education for
students in&lt;br/&gt;science and engineering, and increase efforts to promote
transfer of technology from the&lt;br/&gt;state's universities to Hawai'i's
private and public sectors.&lt;br/&gt;
