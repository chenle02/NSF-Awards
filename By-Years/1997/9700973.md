9700973 Trumper Many industrial operations center on the processing of an
elongated element moving axially through successive functional stations. In
these processes it may be advantageous to be able to handle the product without
directly touching it. The classes of materials which can be acted on with
magnetic or electric forces without contact are addressed. This research is
aimed to develop a general theory for electric and magnetic suspensions
applicable to noncontact processing and experimentally verify the developed
theory. The associated control theory, dynamic analyses, sensors and actuators
which are needed to implement this new technology will also be developed.
Noncontact processing provides many advantages for handling of materials that
involve axial movements. The development of noncontact processing of materials
via magnetic or electric suspension holds promise for future material handling
and processing. Theoretical development of this new technology and its
experimental verification are essential to advancing the existing state-of-the-
art for this kind of equipment.
