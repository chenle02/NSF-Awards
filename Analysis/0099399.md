We want to investigate several projects in Dynamical Systems and in Partial
Differential equations. We will also consider multi-particle systems that share
properties with both/ One unifying thread is that we would like to understand
the relation between variational approaches and more geometric ones. In
particular, we would like to produce proofs of diffusion that use geometric and
variational methods and to extend results in dynamics obtained by variational
methods to partial differential equations. An important tool for geometric
methods is the theory of normally hyperbolic manifolds and we would like to
extend it to Partial differential equations and infinite particle systems.

Sometimes, small short range causes may have large long term effects. For
example, small periodic forces may build up large changes in energy. Some small
changes in the local properties of a material may lead to the emergence of
patterns that cover large distances. In other situations, however, local effects
just average out. We would like to device a broad based array of methods
(including numerical studies and geometric techniques) that can be used to
decide whether build up or averaging occurs. We would also like to pay special
attention to some concrete models appearing in technological applications.
