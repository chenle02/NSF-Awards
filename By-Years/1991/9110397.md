An one-day workshop on "Atomization and Sprays" is proposed to be organized on
July 19, 1991, with leading scientists in the field from U.S., Europe and Japan.
Fundamental aspects and potential industrial applications will be discussed in a
variety of topics, including nozzle engineering, spray structure, computational
fluid and particle mechanics, laser diagnostics techniques, paint spraying,
manufacturing with liquid metal sprays and agricultural spraying. About twelve
experts will present summaries of the state of the art and identify unsolved
problems and future research trends. These presentations will be reviewed by all
participants, and a report will be written. The meeting will be held at NIST,
and will be chaired by Dr. N. Chigier. About 50 participants are expected to
attend. Recent advances in understanding the spray physics have open new
opportunities for research and industrial applications. The proposed symposium
will bring together several of the best researchers in the field from US and
abroad, and it is expected to provide a set of recommendations for future
research.
