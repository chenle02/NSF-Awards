The conference will explore the connections between Representation Theory,
Quantum Field Theory, Category Theory, Mathematical Physics, and Quantum
Information Theory. These fields are interrelated and have motivated each
others' development. The conference will bring together experts in these areas
to enhance research interactions.

Cross-disciplinary interactions are widely recognized for their value in
stimulating new ideas and advances. The conference will not only increase the
knowledge of the participants, but could result in the invention of new
theorems, interesting conjectures, and fascinating generalizations as well as
practical applications. In particular, this conference will help further the
advancement of Quantum information Theory, which is of importance in the
development of quantum computers. More information about the conference can be
