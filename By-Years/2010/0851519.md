Proposal: 0851519&lt;br/&gt;PI Name: Narasimhan,
Balaji&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This three year renewal REU site program at Iowa
State University (ISU) will provide an opportunity for undergraduate students to
do hands-on research focused on two research themes: 1) Biological Materials and
Biological Processes. The students will be active members of interdisciplinary
groups and will interact with faculty, post-docs, graduate students, and
industry. Some of the students will also participate in an international
research experience at the Instituto Tecnologico y de Estudios Superiores de
Monterrey (ITESM), Mexico, which will build on an existing partnership with ISU,
and provide students with valuable skills in a global
environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the research experience, a
variety of enrichment activities have been incorporated. These include: short
courses, joint seminars/meetings, workshops, tours of research facilities, and
field trips. At the end of the program, the students will participate in a joint
poster symposium together with students from other ISU undergraduate programs.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A talented and diverse group of students will be
recruited, with special efforts made to attract women and minorities. The
experience some students will get working in a global environment will evolve
from dependent to independent status and will enable them to walk away with
life-long skills that will impact their contributions to science and engineering
and to society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
