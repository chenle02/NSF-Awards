This proposal is to conduct a comprehensive program to investigate the effect
of machining parameters on the surface and subsurface quality of a difficult-to-
machine high temperature alloy (Inconel-718 Nickel-Based Superalloy) which is
used in aircraft engines. The experimental work involves the use of a wide
variety of diagnostic tools to determine quantitatively surface region
characteristics. The specific goals are: the identification of the various forms
of surface and subsurface structural damage produced; the determination of the
causes and origins of various forms of structural damage produced; the
determination of the effect of various machining parameters on the structural
damage produced; and the development of an analytical model to predict surface
damage. This research should yield a better understanding of the fundamental
aspects of machining and could possibly lead to improved methods for machining
this alloy. If successful, it could be the basis in the future for an adaptive
control system to produce surfaces of high quality.
