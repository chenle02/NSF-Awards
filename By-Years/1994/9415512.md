9415512 Samelson This project is a theoretical and numerical investigation into
the coupled dynamics of the large- and meso-scale circulation. The theoretical
and conceptual work will be based on two sets of coupled equations, the
planetary- geostrophic (PG) and quasi-geostrophic (QG) equations. The first part
of the study focuses on the analysis of the subpolar gyre circulation in
numerical solutions of the PG equations without any effects of mesocale eddies
(uncoupled from the QG component). Double-gyre wind- and buoyancy- forced
solutions of the PG model will be considered, analyzed in detail, and compared
to existing theories of the gyre regimes. The second and third parts of the
study will continue with the analysis of the coupled PG-QG model and will focus
on the interaction between the mesoscale and large-scale flows.
