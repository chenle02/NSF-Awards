This project will use four-dimensional data assimilation to dynamically specify
the condition of the Earth's electron radiation belts from very near the Earth's
surface out to a distance of 10 Earth radii. It will utilize data from the Los
Alamos geostationary satellites, the NOAA GOES satellites and the GPS
satellites. Additional data will come from the SAMPEX and Polar satellites. Two
empirical prediction techniques will be used. The first is an Auto-Regressive
Moving Average model based on linear system identification theory. The second is
a model based on the concept of historical analogs. The two techniques will be
compared with one another in order to determine under what conditions each
technique is most appropriate.
