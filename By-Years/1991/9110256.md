The high temperature oxidation stability of silicon carbide ceramics which have
been implanted with oxide-forming ions, such as aluminum and chromium, will be
studied in this Research Initiation Award. Implantation will be performed at
elevated temperature and the microstructural and compositional changes will be
monitored. The interfacial reactions and the mass transport during subsequent
oxidation exposures will be determined from these changes and also modeled from
thermodynamic considerations.
