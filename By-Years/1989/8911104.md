Long-term Research: Long-baseline Interferometry Using Multiple-Mode Fiber
Optics This award recommendation is made under the Program for Long and Medium-
Term Research at Foreign Centers of Excellence. The program is designed to
enable young U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct long-term research abroad
at research institutions of proven excellence. Awards provide opportunities for
the conduct of joint research and the utilization of unique or complementary
facilities, expertise and experimental conditions in foreign countries. The
award will support Dr. Stuart Shaklan, National Optical Astronomy Observatories,
for a 15-month research visit with Dr. Claude Froehly, Director, Institute de
Recherche en Communication Optiques et Microondes, Limoges, France. The award
recommendation provides funds to cover, as appropriate, international travel,
local travel abroad, stipend, dependents allowance, if applicable, and a flat
administrative allowance of $250.00 for the U.S. home institution.
