The Midwest Graph Theory Conference (abbreviated as Mighty) is a biannual
meeting of active researchers and students that begun in 1978 at University of
Michigan. This regional meeting has been held at different universities
throughout the Kentucky, Michigan, and Ohio. Many participant of the past MIGHTY
conferences were from outside the region, including researchers from Hungary,
Poland, Canada. Also, a large portion of the participants have been graduate
students and fresh Ph.Ds.

The MIGHTY conference has now becoming a platform for active researchers in
Combinatorics, Graph Theory and other branches of Discrete Mathematics. It
brings together researchers in graph theory and combinatorics, college faculty
members and students, industrial mathematicians, and computer scientists, in an
environment conductive to the exchange ideas, leading to successful
collaborative researches. The topics of the meeting reflect many facets of graph
theory and combinatorics, including such subjects as combinatorial optimization,
extremal problems in graph and hypergraph theory, topological graph theory,
colorings, probabilistic combinatorics, matroid theory, the design and
complexity of algorithms, applications of finite set systems to design,
computational geometry, network flows, computer science, and communication
networks.
