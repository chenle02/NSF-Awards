This project supports US student researchers to travel to the Doctoral
Consortium and the premier international conference on autonomous agents and
multiagent systems. The International Joint Conference on Autonomous Agents and
Multiagent Systems (AAMAS 2009) will be held in Budapest, Hungary between May 10
and May 15, 2009. The conference provides these students with a platform to
present their research results and allows them to participate in valuable
discussions that will likely shape the future of this critically important
field. The technical program is complemented with an array of workshops,
tutorials and other events, as it has in previous years. The wide variety and
significance of the topics typically presented at AAMAS, in both the technical
program and the workshop program, provides opportunities for students to share,
exchange and learn from each other. A Doctoral Mentoring Program is available
for Ph.D. students in advanced stages of their research. This program will
provide an opportunity for students to interact closely with established
researchers, to receive feedback on their work and to get advice on managing
their careers.
