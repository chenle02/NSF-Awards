9306906 Nath Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will be
concerned with the role that supersymmetry plays in high energy physics. This
symmetry relates fields describing matter, such as those for the electrons and
protons, and those describing the interactions among them. It can be used to
furnish information on quantities which are measurable at presently available
energies, and will be important in furthering our understanding of the forces
which exist among the elementary particles. ***
