An international collaboration including scientists from Heidelberg, Oxford,
Southampton, Strathclyde, and Yale Universities, and the Rutherford Appleton
Laboratory in England is undertaking an accurate measurement of the 1S-2S
transition frequency in muonium, absolutely and relative to the 1S-2S transition
in atomic hydrogen. This grant supports the participation of Boshier and Hughes
from Yale University. A significant test of QED is anticipated, largely because
of a recently discovered method for producing muonium atoms in vacuum with
thermal energies, which is expected to provide a usable muonium flux two orders
of magnitude greater than previously available.
