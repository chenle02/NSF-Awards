9500882 Effros Effros will continue to investigate the mysterious mathematical
world of quantum group analysis, in collaboration with his former Ph. D student
Z.-J. Ruan. This work is based on his new approach to quantizing functional
analysis - the theory of operator spaces. Popa plans to broaden his wide-ranging
studies in the rapidly evolving field of subfactors, using both analytic and
algebraic points of view. Popa is one of very few researchers who has been
working on theanalytical aspects of subfactor theory. It may be argued that this
technically difficult area has thus far constituted the deepest aspect of the
subject. Takesaki, together with several coworkers, has very recently completed
one of the central classification programs for discrete amenable group actions
on operator algebras. He would like to build on this success by returning to the
largely unexplored area of continuous group actions. He also plans to work once
again on his earlier theory of duality, which is currently playing a major role
in quantum group theory. Quantized analysis was introduced in the 1930's by John
von Neumann in order to provide a mathematical framework for quantum mechanics.
This development has had a profound effect on the field of mathematics itself,
since it has enabled researchers to formulate non-commutative or "quantized"
versions of many quite distinct mathematical disciplines. We now have quantized
versions of ergodic theory, the non-commutative geometry of Alain Connes, the
non-commutative probability theory of Dan Voiculescu, and the remarkable
interactions of operator algebras, knot theory, low dimensional topology, and
conformal quantum field theory in large part pioneered by Vaughan Jones. Effros,
Popa and Takesaki have been actively involved in working on the frontier of some
of these exciting new areas of mathematics. ***
