&lt;br/&gt;0329636&lt;br/&gt;Gustafsson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This U.S.-Chile
award will support Drs. Torgny Gustafsson and Robert A. Bartynski, Rutgers
University, in organizing a workshop on surface science and nanophysics with Dr.
Patricio Haberle, Universidad Technico Federico Santa Maria (UTFSM), Valparaiso,
Chile. The workshop will be held in conjunction with XI Congreso Latin Americano
de Ciencias de Superficies y sus Applicaciones (CLACSA) in Pucon, Chile in
December 2003.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CLACSA has been a focal point for scientists
in Latin America who work in surface science and nanophysics related fields and
has been held since the early 1980's every second or third year. It offers a
forum for these researchers to present results and to interact, providing a
meaningful venue for collaboration between the nano- and surface science
communities. Because this meeting is so large (as many as 400 attendees), this
focused and smaller workshop, structured as a satellite to the larger
conference, will provide a more effective and efficient means to foster
collaboration between Latin American scientists and those from the U.S.
