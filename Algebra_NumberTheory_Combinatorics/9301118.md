The investigations of this proposal will be made on number- theoretical
problems dealing with zeta functions and automorphic forms. The Fourier
coefficients of automorphic forms, Eisenstein series, and the special values of
certain zeta functions are the main objects of study. This is research in the
field of number theory. Number theory starts with the whole numbers and
questions such as the divisibility of one whole number by another. It is among
the oldest fields of mathematics and it was originally pursued for purely
aesthetic reasons. However, within the last half century, it has become an
essential tool in developing new algorithms for computer science and new error
correcting codes for electronics.
