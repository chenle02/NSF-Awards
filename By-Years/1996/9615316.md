9615316 Grotjahn Dr. Grotjahn will conduct a study aimed at better understanding
the dynamics of midlatitude extratropical cyclones. Specifically, he will look
at the development processes that occur within a cyclone's life cycle using
several different numerical models, each of which uses a set of equations which
approximates actual atmospheric dynamics based on its own set of simplifying
assumptions. Dr. Grotjahn will compare the evolution of cyclone in each of these
models, including how various terms of the equations evolve with time, and
assess the model's effectiveness in representing the behavior of the real
atmosphere. The focus of this effort will be a comparison of nonmodal growth
processes and traditional baroclinic instability processes. Model results also
will be compared with analyses of observations. The research will be done in
collaboration with Dr. Joseph Tribbia of the National Center Atmospheric
Research. ***
