An interdisciplinary, undergraduate, computer-integrated manufacturing (CIM)
laboratory will be set up. The laboratory will include an Intelledex six-axis
robotic arm with an integrated vision system and a Brodhead-Garrett computer
numerical control lathe and mill. The equipment will be interfaced to an IBM
PC/AT and a Data General MV10000 mainframe for CIM experiments and system
development. The laboratory will support an optional minor in computer
integrated manufacturing for mechanical and electrical engineers in this growing
area of need and interest.
