The ASME's Bioprocess Engineering Program is presenting three advanced courses
in Fall 1990 and up to five in 1992 concerning the manufacture of
biopharmaceuticals: Bioreactor Kinetics Process Equipment Technology Process
Equipment Design at the University of Virginia during the weeks of 15 October
1990 and March 1992. The audience is process- development, manufacturing-
facility and equipment engineers. Fifty students are expected for each 3 day
course. Most of the US biotechnology industry is employing labor intensive and
costly manufacturing methods. The objective of the ASME's bioprocessing program
is to help the industry develop continuous, instrumented and automated
production methods which can make its therapeutic and veterinary proteins
competitive in world markets. There now is a severe shortage of properly trained
engineers for commercial-production scale-up. These courses will help relieve
that shortage, but the universities must perform most of the education task.
These scholarships for ME faculty are requested so that they may attend the ASME
courses for indoctrination in bioprocessing equipment technology and design.
Then they will be better prepared to initiate curricula at their institutions to
produce qualified equipment engineers for the US biotechnology industry.
