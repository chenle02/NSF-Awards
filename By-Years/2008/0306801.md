This grant will study the impact of structured on-line information and processes
to increase the opportunity for citizens to participate in the development of
government policies, as opposed to input from experts (elites). Under what
conditions can non-experts be most effectively engaged? How can their engagement
be sustained over time? How can they contribute most effectively to public
decision-making? The domain of interest for this experiment will be health care
policy. It is expected that the US Agency for Health Care Policy will be a
partner in this work.
