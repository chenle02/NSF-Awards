Attributing function to genes, their regulatory elements and other functional
DNA sequences will be the next step in genomics. This functional phase involves
researchers from a variety of disciplines, including computer science and
engineering. To facilitate the use of genomic informatin in function studies,
pathways will be used to present the information. Pathways require detailed
integration of diverse sources of information. Researchers will need transparent
access that will be provided through this project. The project will integrate
the data from a pathways rather than a sequence perspective, enabling scientists
who do not do the sequencing to add functional information. New tools will
enable users to visualize pathways data at mutiple levels of detail and
abstraction. The use of XML will permit dissemination of query outputs for
control of the data. Metabolic pathways, transcriptional regulation and protein
synthesis pathways and signal transduction pathways will be the first
incorporated in this web-based system. The research provides both for student
support in both biology and computer science and a resource for the functional
genomics community.
