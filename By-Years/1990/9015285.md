This proposal is to take measurements of the upper ocean velocity field using
an acoustic doppler current profiler (ADCP) mounted in the hull of the research
vessel. The work will be done as a contribution to the World Ocean Circulation
Experiment (WOCE) on the hydrographic cruises in the southeastern Pacific. In
addition the PI will test a lowered ADCP system which should be of great utility
in measuring currents a depth, particularly in the low latitudes.
