0947220&lt;br/&gt;Brandon&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides $179,107 in
NSF funding over 24 months to support partial acquisition of a Thermal
Ionization Mass Spectrometer (TIMS). The instrument will be installed in
recently-renovated space along with a multicollector inductively coupled plasma
mass spectrometer. The TIMS will be used for high-precision Neodymium isotope
measurements in chondrites, early Earth, and planetary materials. These studies
will be used to better understand Earth's early fractionation and bulk Sm/Nd in
the silicate Earth. High precision Osmium isotope measurements will be made in
mantle and igneous rocks to better understand early Earth Reniun/Osmium and
Platinum/Osmium ratios in the Earth's interior. Re-Os isotope systematics will
be used as a precise chronometer to elucidate sediment formation and hydrocarbon
migration and will be applied to mantle and igneous rocks to determine the
timing of Earth's interior geochemical processes. Additionally, Sm-Nd isotope
chronology will be assessed in metamorphic rocks. The TIMS will also be applied
to U-Pb isotope chronology. The new instrument will support students through
faculty mentoring, coursework and internship programs. Additionally, the
research efforts will provide hands-on use for graduate students and post-docs.
The instrument will interface with the Houston Alliance for Minority
Participation Project funded by NSF. Collaborations within UH and with Rice and
NASA will also be supported. UH will provide a new renovated laboratory with
clean lab capabilities for this effort. UH will also support half of a
laboratory technician salary. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***
