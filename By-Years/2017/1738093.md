Wireless communications are affecting deeply the daily lives of the overwhelming
majority of people on this planet. The insatiable demand for network capacity
has motivated an entirely different approach on spectrum utilization. The work
in this project will enable new collaborative spectrum sharing approaches that
will impact the lives of anybody relying directly or indirectly on wireless
communications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main objective of this project is to
research, develop, and implement technical solution concepts for collaborative
spectrum sharing and to test their performance in head-to-head scrimmages with
other competing approaches. The key research areas focus on agile,
reconfigurable radios, RF environmental understanding, network wide
contextualization, reasoning and collaboration with other collaborating, and yet
competing, radio networks. The project will address key building blocks to
create a collaborative intelligent radio using simple but robust techniques
building on machine learning principles.
