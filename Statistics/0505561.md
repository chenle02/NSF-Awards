The investigator plans to conduct research on identifying structure in
multivariate data without imposing rigid structural assumptions and on the
development of structural adaptation techniques for dimensionality reduction in
nonparametric regression and density estimation. Building on recent advances in
nonparametric and semiparametric estimation, it is proposed to develop iterative
algorithms which alternate between identification of the lower dimensional
structure, using estimates of average derivative functionals, and model
estimation improved by using the current structural information. Identification
and estimation of linear and nonlinear components in partially linear regression
models and of independent component analysis model with unspecified component
densities will be considered.

With the dramatic increase in large, complex data bases and in computer power,
it has become increasingly more desirable and possible to develop nonparametric
models, concepts, and procedures that can be used to study relationships between
variables and to construct models without relying on rigid parametric
assumptions on the structure of mean responses and error distributions.
Algorithms developed in this research will provide new statistical learning
tools for reducing dimensionality of multivariate data in order to identify and
visualize its structure. After the algorithms are investigated on simulated data
and their parameters are fine-tuned, they will be applied to statistical
learning problems from bioinformatics, risk management, and other areas.
