This proposal is for funds to support a group at the University of Cincinnati to
participate in BooNE, the new booster neutrino experiment at the Fermi National
Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab). BooNE will look for neutrino oscillations. A
recent result from the LSND experiment suggested that muon-neutrinos could
oscillate into electron-neutrinos. BooNE will use the same technique to look for
this effect. BooNE will use the 8 GeV beam from the Fermilab booster to produce
the neutrinos. The difference in a factor of ten in primary beam energy compared
to the LSND beam energy will mean a tenfold increase in the energy of the
detected signal from the electron-neutrino if the LSND signal is real. If the
LSND result is due to an unknown background, it should occur at the same energy
in BooNE as it did at Los Alamos. If the LSND result is correct, BooNE can
expect about 1000 oscillation events, a truly revolutionary result. If the LSND
result is false, BooNE will rule it out at the 10 standard deviation level,
another truly significant result. In addition to the oscillation results, the
experiment will be in a very good position to measure a number of neutrino
scattering cross sections. The BooNE detector and beam line are complete and the
experiment recorded their first neutrino event in August 2002. During the next
three years, in addition to running the experiment, they will be developing the
software tools to analyze the data and measuring the inelastic cross sections.

This experiment, in addition to specifically looking for muon-neutrino to
electron-neutrino oscillations, has a much broader impact in the community.
Since BooNE is a small experiment, there are many opportunities for
undergraduates, professors from undergraduate institutions, and high school
teachers to participate in the research in a meaningful way. All of the above
groups have already made impacts on the experiment and they can be expected to
continue to do so in the future.
