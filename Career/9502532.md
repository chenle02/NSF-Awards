Abstract McNeal McNeal will investigate the ways that the boundary of a smooth
domain in C^n determines the size of holomorphic objects on the domain.
Particular aspects to be discussed are: Holder estimates on the solution to the
d-bar equations in convex domains, estimating the Bergman kernel, on and off
diagonal, for a general pseudoconvex domain, computing the asymptotic volume of
sets defined by and ideal of holomorphic functions, and estimating solutions to
second order subelliptic operators by scaling methods. McNeal will also
implement several education initiatives. These include: teaching a multivariable
calculus course with computer assignments as an integral component, conducting a
junior seminar on topics in several complex variables, developing a uniform core
curriculum for the first two years of the math major, and reforming the initial
advising policy for entering graduate students in his capacity as Director of
Graduate Studies.
