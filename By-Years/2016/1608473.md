The conference on "Geometric Methods in Group Theory" will take place at
Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, over the weekend of April 22-24, 2016. The
conference is one of the Shanks Workshops that are held at Vanderbilt
Univeristy, with several taking place each year on a wide array of subjects
spanning all areas of mathematics. The talks at this workshop will focus on
recent advances in the area of geometric group theory, with speakers including
Mladen Bestvina (University of Utah), Kate Juschenko (Northwestern), Ilya
Kapovich (UIUC), Olga Kharlampovich (CUNY) and Piotr Przytycki (McGill).
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geometric group theory is a rapidly progressing area of
research, providing a modern approach to group theory as well as the many
associated topics. The geometric and topological properties of spaces on which
groups act have led to many new and powerful results, such as Gromov's theorem
that polynomial growth of balls in a finitely generated group is equivalent to
the group containing a finite index nilpotent subgroup, or Yu's result that the
existence of a uniform embedding of a group into a Hilbert space implies the
group satisfies the Novikov and coarse Baum-Connes conjectures. The conference
will have talks about recent advances in the area.
