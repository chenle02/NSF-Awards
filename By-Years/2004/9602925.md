9602925 Glass This Americas Program award will fund a collaborative research
project between Drs. Richard Glass, University of Arizona, Tucson, and Eusebio
Juaristi, I.P.N., Mexico. The research aims to develop new methods for synthesis
of glycosides by generating sugar oxocarbenium ions under mild and neutral
oxidizing conditions. The use of this reaction for the formation of glycosides,
nucleosides, and C- glycosides will be investigated to ascertain the
conformational behavior of the glycosides and related compounds. Model compounds
will be used in a systematic study of the feasibility of the method, and on the
tolerance to neighboring substituents. This is an area of considerable current
research interest and, if successful, the study may generate useful methods for
saccharide and nucleoside chemistry of potential application to the development
of new therapeutic agents. For this project, the synthesis of the iron complexes
and their redox chemistry will be done in Arizona, and their conformational
analysis and synthesis of selected precursors of the Fp sugars will be carried
out in Mexico. ***
