computer manager in the Department of Geology and Geophysics and the
Seismographic Station at the University of California-Berkeley. The computer
manager will be responsible for maintaining a network of workstations in the
Department and at the Seismographic Station. He will be responsible for the
integration of the different elements of the network, installation of new

Department are engaged in a number of research and earthquake monitoring
projects which require intensive use of the computer system. ***
