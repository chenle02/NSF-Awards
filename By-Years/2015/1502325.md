This award provides support for a conference on Privacy in the Infosphere:
Developing Ethical Guidelines for Managing Big Data in Research. The two-day
conference will be held at Georgetown University early in 2015. The conference
will develop guidelines for prospective NSF investigators for Data Management
Plans involving Big Data, with a focus on managing privacy in the collection,
analysis, and archiving of Big Data. Possible dissemination mechanisms include a
chapter in a monograph and a book on ethics in Big
Data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will bring together investigators
currently supported by NSF projects dealing with Big Data, as well as
stakeholders from a variety of community and governmental organizations. The
conference will seek to identify salient issues with respect to privacy in Big
Data from multiple sources. The overall goal of the conference will be to
develop approaches with examples for preparing effective Data Management Plans
for NSF proposals in Big Data.
