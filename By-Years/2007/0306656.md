Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0306656&lt;br/&gt;Principal
Investigator: James A. Isenberg&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is proposed that the
National Science Foundation provide&lt;br/&gt;funding for the meetings of the
Pacific Northwest Geometry&lt;br/&gt;Seminar (PNGS) to be held during the three-
year period from July&lt;br/&gt;1, 2003 to June 30, 2006 at University of
British Columbia,&lt;br/&gt;Oregon State University, University of Oregon,
University of&lt;br/&gt;Utah, University of Washington, Portland State
University, and&lt;br/&gt;Stanford University. PNGS meetings generally feature 4
or 5&lt;br/&gt;invited research talks by leading experts in
differential&lt;br/&gt;geometry and algebraic geometry. The meetings also
include&lt;br/&gt;discussion sessions in which the speakers and participants
assess&lt;br/&gt;the state of various areas in geometry, and highlight
open&lt;br/&gt;problems in these areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are a number
of very active researchers in geometry&lt;br/&gt;scattered throughout the
various universities which are involved&lt;br/&gt;in the Pacific Northwest
Geometry Seminar. These periodic&lt;br/&gt;meetings bring these researchers
together for consultation,&lt;br/&gt;collaboration, and stimulation of new
ideas. A number of research&lt;br/&gt;programs have been initiated as a result
of interactions at these&lt;br/&gt;meetings. The PNGS is especially valuable for
graduate students&lt;br/&gt;in geometry at the various participating
universities which have&lt;br/&gt;small geometry groups. The PNGS meetings give
these students an&lt;br/&gt;excellent opportunity to see the broader picture of
research in&lt;br/&gt;geometry.
