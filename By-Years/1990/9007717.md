The objective of this research project is to develop a number of statistical
procedures for satellite data analysis. Such astronomical data have a number of
singular aspects that necessitate the development of new statistical methods.
Specific problems that will be addressed involve nonparametric regression when
both the independent and dependent variables are subject to left censoring and
nonparametric regression between ratios obtained from left-censored data.
Optimal designs for astronomical surveys with nondetections will be developed.
Bootstrap methods for regression with measurement errors will also be developed
and regression problems will be analyzed where the variables are subject to
measurement error whose variance is known but varies across the observations.
