Long-Term Ecological Research on north temperate lakes is a comprehensive study
of seven lakes and the surrounding landscape in northern Wisconsin. The study is
designed to answer research questions spanning longer time and broader space
scales than typical of ecological research. Thus, it is especially relevant to
analyzing global change and regionalizing site specific knowledge. There are
five interrelated research areas: 1) perception of long-term trends, 2)
interactions among physical, chemical, and biological processes, 3) temporal
responses to disturbance and stress, 4) relation between spatial heterogeneity
and temporal variability, and 5) generalization of results to a landscape scale.
A comprehensive data collection and management system is in place to address
these areas and make data available to the broader scientific community.
Climatic, hydrologic, and terrestrial forcing on lakes is analyzed along with
internal processes determining the dynamics of biogeochemical cycling,
production, and species abundances. Disturbances/stresses being evaluated
include species invasions, climate warming, and acidic precipitation. Spatial
heterogeneity and scale are studied as influences on temporal variation in, and
perceptions of, lake systems. Spatially explicit models of regional hydrology
and water quality are being implemented. Dynamics of lakes are compared with
other ecosystems types, inside and outside the LTER network.
