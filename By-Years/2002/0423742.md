This project provides for international technology assessments and related
planning workshop support. WTEC and its predecessors have conducted over 55 such
technology assessments since 1989. The objectives include seeking technologies
to transfer to the U.S. evaluating the position of U.S. science and technology
with respect to leading competitors, and seeking opportunities for international
technology assessments over a three-year period of performance.

The project provides for nine or more additional international study tours and
reporting of the results, plus three or more workshops in areas related to
international technology assessments over a three-year period of performance.

Results will be disseminated at workshops including copies of visual aids
distributed in hardcopy and posted on the Web, final reports from each study
tour of academic quality in hardcopy, CD, and Web media plus at least one
synthesis report cross-cutting findings. A monthly e-letter on assessment of
international S&T will be published to report progress.
