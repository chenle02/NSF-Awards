Dr. Teirlinck plans to continue his already very successful research in the
field of combinatorial mathematics: block designs, as well as the embeddability
of planar spaces into projective spaces. This research falls in the broad
category of Combinatorics, which is one of the most active fields in
mathematics. Although its roots go back several centuries, Combinatorics has had
an explosive development in the past few decades because of its importance in
communications and information technology.
