The Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program at the University of
Texas Marine Science Institute (UTMSI) is located at the UT campus in Port
Aransas, Texas. The common theme of student research projects is the interplay
between natural variability and anthropogenic drivers of change in coastal
ecosystems. Specific REU projects to date have focused on pressing research
questions that have global implications, including impacts of land use and
freshwater demand on coastal nutrient dynamics, effects of oil spills and
hydrocarbons on organismal functioning, harmful algal blooms, hypoxia,
spatiotemporal community interactions, and population dynamics of mobile
macrofauna. South Texas experiences extremes of environmental conditions, making
it an excellent natural laboratory for studying coastal dynamics in a changing
environment. UTMSI faculty research spans the biological, chemical and physical
processes that occur in coastal habitats, and the laboratories and research
fleet are well equipped for such studies. The program is designed to raise
student awareness of the conduct of science and the importance of coastal change
issues, thereby preparing students to make informed decisions about their
subsequent career paths. Specific activities provide exposure to the breadth of
marine science, increase knowledge of ethical conduct of research, and develop
crucial scientific communication skills for targeting both specialist and
generalist audiences. This program will support research experiences and career
training for a total of forty undergraduates over five years. Co-funding for
this program will be provided by the Directorate of Biological Sciences.
