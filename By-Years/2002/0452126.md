&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt; The Generic Mapping Tools
(GMT) have served scientists since the first official release in 1991. The
package has grown tremendously in capability and usage since then and is now the
de facto standard for map making in marine geology and geophysics, with more
than 10,000 users worldwide. This 5-year program will retrofit GMT with a high-
level interface. Installation scripts will be simplified, documentation revised,
a web page for user-contributed applications will be introduced, and a robust
web-based Common Gateway Interface map-making site.&lt;br/&gt;
