In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Professor Philip R. Brooks of Rice University will study
electron transfer reactions and how they depend on the geometry and molecular
structure of the acceptor molecule. Crossed beam experiments of atoms and
oriented molecules will produce ion pairs through collision-induced electron
transfer. The purpose is to obtain insight into the electron transfer process by
exploring the effect of various substituent groups for some simple molecules, so
as to determine if these groups function to hide the unoccupied molecular
orbital or if they provide a cage for the attacking atom. The results of this
research will have bearing on energy production from sunlight in processes
mimicking photosynthesis, on molecular electronics, and other technological
processes, all of which depend on the flow of electric current and thus on
electron transfer processes at the fundamental level. Graduate and undergraduate
students will participate in this research. They will thereby acquire knowledge
and skills that prepare them for advanced studies or employment in academia,
industry, or national laboratories.
