Mississippi State University (MSU) proposes to build cyber security education
capacity with Mississippi Valley State University (MVSU). MVSU is an HBCU in the
heart of the Mississippi Delta. In this effort, MSU will conduct faculty
development summer workshops on the MSU campus for MVSU faculty. Together, MSU
and MVSU will develop curricula that support Security+ certification of MVSU
students. MSU will also work with MVSU to enhance MVSU's high school computer
science summer camp program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MSU's Center for Cyber
Innovation proposes to work with MVSU's Mathematics, Computer and Information
Sciences Department and MVSU's Center for Cyber Security. This partnership will
provide commercial cyber certification opportunities for MVSU faculty and staff.
MSU will facilitate this goal by developing and delivering a review course for
the certification exam. By making the certification review material publicly
available, MSU and MVSU seek to promote cyber security education capacity and
economic development in the Mississippi Delta and beyond. A key early outcome of
this effort is to establish a pipeline for MVSU students to be awarded
scholarships through the CyberCorps: Scholarship for Service (SFS) program at
MSU to pursue graduate studies. Longer term, MSU will assist MVSU in becoming
certified through the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Department of
Homeland Security's (DHS) jointly sponsored National Centers of Academic
Excellence in Cyber Defense (CAE-CD) program. The strategic goals are to
position MVSU as an CAE-CD and ultimately establish an SFS program at MVSU to
serve the Mississippi Delta region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
