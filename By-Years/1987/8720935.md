What controls earthquake size and occurrence? Scientists and non-scientists
alike have pondered this question for a longtime. Earthquakes are a complex and
wonderous natural phenomenon that unfortunately can also cause great human
catastrophes; the hazards range from near-source ground shaking to tsunamis that
can strike from across the Pacific Ocean. Plate tectonics provides the framework
to explain plate boundary earthquakes as a direct consequence of the plate
boundaries, what controls exactly wherean earthquake will occur; how large it
will be; and when it will happen? To answer these questions, seismologists must
look closer at the plate interface zone. In fact, it is necessary to "look
inside" the earthquake rupture areas. Heuristic arguments (plus some direct
observations) clearly indicate that the processes and properties of plate
interface zones cannot be spatially homogeneous - spatial heterogeneity is
required to explain seismicity. A first-order categorization of fault zone
heterogeneity is the simple binary classification of strong/weak.The strong
regions are "stuck" and accumulate the tectonic strain, to be finally released
by rupture in large earthquakes. We call these strong regions asperities. One of
the excitingrecent developments in earthquake seismology is that we are now
moving from the mere acceptance of spatial heterogeneity to actually mapping the
first-order representation of this heterogeneity along plate boundary segments.
