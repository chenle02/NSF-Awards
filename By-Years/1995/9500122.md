9500122 Olson This research program is directed toward a unified view of first-
order phase transformations based on quantitative principles established in the
prototypical case of martensitic reactions. The research addresses two broad
areas (a) the dynamical evolution of hierarchical structure in heterogeneous
displacive systems, and (b) competing transformation mechanisms in nonlinear
nonlocal solids. Stereological measurements are aimed at identifying a universal
form of autocatalytic nucleation site potency distribution for both
thermoelastic and non-thermoelastic martensitic systems. Numerical models
address the dynamics of growth in a plastic matrix and autocatalytic
interactions of multivariant structures, with extension to bainitic reactions as
coupled displacive/diffusional transformations. Competing mechanisms of
structural transformation are examined by combined theory and experiment
employing the weakly first-order cubic-tetragonal transformation in iron-
palladium as a model system describable by nonlinear nonlocal continuum models.
Small particle experiments address homogeneous nucleation and weak-defect
heterogeneous nucleation behavior, while continuum calculations address coherent
homogeneous nucleation in three dimensions and heterogeneous nucleation in two
dimensions. Theoretical modeling also explores fluctuation-assisted continuous
modulation as an alternative to nucleation and growth and contrasts precursor
effects of the competing mechanisms. %%% Phase transformations under study here
are critical to the properties of iron-base alloys used in structural
applications. ***
