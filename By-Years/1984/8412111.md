Recently, composite building systems in which a concrete frame handles lateral
loads and steelframing handles gravity loads have gained popularity. The
connections between the steel floor beams and the concrete columns are generally
designed as a simple shear connection. A properly detailed steel beam-concrete
column (or wall) moment connection in mixed structural system or subsystem could
result in substantial economy, especially where lateral load resistance is
required. The purpose of this project is to develop information regarding the
behavior of moment connections between steel structural members to concrete
columns or walls. Analytical models will be developed which describe the
strength and stiffness of the connections. The analytical work will be guided by
a test program involving relatively simple models to represent the fundamental
shear transfer mechanisms. To develop design guidelines, a series of beam-column
connections will be tested.
