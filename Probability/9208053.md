The principal investigator will work on several projects. The first focusses on
extremal problems involving (generalized) moment inequalities for sums of
independent, symmetric random variables with an eye toward obtaining best
constants. The research builds on the classic inequalities of Khintchine and
Rosenthal. The from of the final inequalities should give some insight into the
nature of cancellation phenomena and may suggest extensions to more general
dependence relations. This work is ongoing and is joint work with T. Figiel, P.
Hitczenko and W. B. Johnson. The second project concerns structural problems for
U- statistics and U-processes. Gine and the principal investigator have found
very little information concerning necessity in the context of U-statistics.
Together with J. Cuzik, they have made some progress on a very special case, but
there is much more work required to understand the general question of
cancellation in this context. Two other projects deal with trying to find usable
necessary and sufficient conditions for a class of functions to be uniform
Donsker (with E. Gine) and studying questions concerning convergence rates in
the context of bootstrapping empirical measures (with F. Gotze). The principal
investigator is working on several projects whose primary focus is a better
understanding of cancellation phenomena for sums of independent random
variables. These types of problems often arise in statistics.
