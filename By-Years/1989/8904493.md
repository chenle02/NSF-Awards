The plant hormone, indoleacetic acid, appears to play key roles in regulating
or inducing growth and developmental processes such as cell division,
elongation, and differentiation. Exogenous application of this hormone or its
synthetic analogs results in rapid changes in gene expression in seedlings or
organs that are induced to undergo cell division or elongation. Dr. Guilfoyle
has described a variety of auxin-induced mRNAs, and some of these, the SAUR of
Small Auxin Up-regulated RNAs, are most abundant and most inducible in
elongating regions of soybean hypocotyls. "Tissue printing" and in situ
hybridization have been used to show that the SAUR genes are expressed primarily
in epidermal and cortical cells of the elongating hypocotyl region, and
furthermore, the mRNAs rapidly redistribute within the upper and lower portions
of a gravistimulated soybean hypocotyl. The abundance of these small RNAs
increases within 2.5 minutes after auxin application to elongating soybean
hypocotyl sections, and half maximal steady state levels of these mRNAs are
reached within 10 minutes after auxin administration. Dr. Guilfoyle has shown
that the increase in RNA abundance after auxin addition results, at least in
part, from increased transcription rates on the SAUR genes. On the other hand,
an increase in RNA abundance after cycloheximide administration does not involve
transcriptional activation, suggesting that post transcriptional events such as
RNA stabilization may be involved. Recent results indicate that the SAUR genes
are clustered within the soybean nuclear genome, and that the soybean genes are
induced by auxin addition when the entire gene cluster is transferred via
Agrobacterium T-DNA to petunia plats. Dr. Guilfoyle now proposes to 1) identify
the cis-acting elements that confer auxin inducibility to the SAUR genes, 2)
isolate, purify, and characterize trans acting factors that interact with the
cis acting elements, 3) identify the cis acting elements that regulate the rapid
turnover of the SAUR RNAs, 4) determine the patterns of auxin and gravity
induced gene expression at the tissue, cellular, and subcellular levels using
hybridization and immunological approaches, and 5) examine dwarf and gravitropic
mutants for possible altered expression patterns of the SAUR genes and the
phenotypes of transgenic plants which overproduce or underproduce the auxin
induced RNAs. %%% The long range objectives of the proposed research are aimed
at providing insight into how auxin activates specific genes in specific
tissues, what proteins mediate the auxin induced gene activation, and what roles
the auxin-induced gene products play in plant growth and development.
