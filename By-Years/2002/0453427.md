The Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS) will provide 10
undergraduate students with research experiences as part of its 9-11 week
internship program. The students will have the opportunity to work with leaders
in seismological research, to travel to exotic sites for fieldwork, and to
produce research products worthy of presentation at large professional
conferences. Intellectual Merit The approach will be to blend mature
telecommunications technology and recent research on distance learning with the
spirit of a traditional REU site. The resulting blended REU model will create
novel opportunities for interns to more fully develop and express their
understanding of the process of research. They will receive consistent
professional development throughout the internship, and connect both in person
and via technology to create and maintain a cohort experience while benefiting
from the resources of the IRIS Consortium. This REU model has the opportunity to
contribute to the growing body of knowledge regarding the application of
telecommunications for distance learning, community building and the
implementation of the skills associated with metacognition. The success,
documentation and dissemination of this model will enable other organizations to
apply geographically distributed resources to the development of their human
capital.
