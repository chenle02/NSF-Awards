The proposed work involves developing an innovative human-technology interface
(HTI) system, which allows users to operate and interact with electronic devices
solely with expressions and thoughts. The proposed HTI system, with a mobile app
as the user interface, will utilize self-learning algorithms along with low-cost
commercially-off-the-shelf (COTS) brain-computer interface (BCI) technology.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There has always been a need for a more natural and faster
human-technology interaction (HTI) experience that goes beyond the traditional
button and the latest touch-technology. Outcomes of the proposed research will
revolutionize HTI and will provide an effective paradigm that can be applied to
a broad range of areas such as mobile devices, home automation systems, audio
video systems, video game consoles and auto electronics. Outcomes will be
strongly leveraged to foster collaborative networks with multidisciplinary teams
of investigators in academia and industry to establish a strong extramurally
funded research program to explore other innovative HTI concepts.
