9727651 Shonnard The PI's propose to create an open internet-based workshop
devoted to pollution prevention (P2) research and education in academia. The
goal of the open workshop and the associated face- to face meetings of a group
of core participants is to focus a diversity of technical backgrounds and
practical experience on P2 issues in higher education. These core participants
will be chosen based on a brief position paper from a list of national P2
experts which will be compiled as part of the project goals. The objective is to
formulate a set of recommendations and guidelines for the conduct of P2 research
in academia which will help to establish the foundation for research scholarship
and encourage technology transfer to industry. An additional goal is the
establishment of pedagogical approaches designed to ground students in various
technical disciplines on basic environmental literacy and the fundamentals of P2
and it's implementation in industry. Results of the open workshop and meetings
will be summarized within a section of the proposed web site, will be published
in peer-reviewed literature, and will be presented at professional meetings.
Additional P2 information and links will form an integral part of the web site.
Abstracts from the environmental technology program and results from NSF funded
research in the area of P2 will also be highlighted. ***
