Hagerstown Community College, in partnership with secondary schools, post-
secondary institutions, and bioscience employers, is establishing a
biotechnology and biomanufacturing pathway using the College and Career
Transitions Initiative (CCTI) model. The partnerships are collaborating to
address the need in the high growth biotechnology and biomanufacturing
industries for technicians and scientists with problem-solving, mathematics, and
critical thinking abilities, specific technical skills, and experience using
state-of-the-art equipment. The core of the project is an articulated 9-14
curriculum that is all-inclusive, with multiple entry points. At the high-school
level, resources are being targeted to first-generation college-bound, minority,
and low income students from four Washington County high schools. At the college
level, certificate and AAS degree programs in Biotechnology are providing
academic and technical skills to students matriculating at varying levels of
preparation and motivation, including high school students taking college
courses before graduation. Development of articulation agreements with post-
secondary partners (Frostburg State University, Hood College, Mount St. Mary's
University, and the University of Maryland School of Medicine) is preparing for
seamless transfers of biotechnology students to enter baccalaureate-level
programs. The project incorporates assessment and remediation of math skills at
the high school and college levels, increased development of math skills by
providing real-life examples of the applications of mathematics in
biotechnology, alignment and integration of these mathematics applications in
all biotechnology coursework, and state-of-the-art bioscience instrumentation
and materials for new laboratory facilities. The project also incorporates
secondary teacher professional development and an orientation program for
guidance counselors, and provides on-campus employer internship sites in
addition to external internship opportunities for students.
