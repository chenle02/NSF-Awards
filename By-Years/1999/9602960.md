9602960 Gubbins This Americas Program award will support a collaborative
research project between Dr. Keith E. Gubbins, Cornell University and Dr. Erich
Mueller, Universidad Simon Bolivar, Caracas, Venezuela. They will study the
equilibrium and dynamic behavior of water and aqueous solutions when confined
within the narrow pores of activated carbons. The objectives of the work are to
determine the effects of confinement on the adsorption behavior of pure water,
water/hydrocarbon and water/carboxilyc acid mixtures, and investigate the
dynamic behavior and diffusion rates in the pores. Methods to be used will
include Grand Canonical Monte Carlo and equilibrium and nonequilibrium Molecular
Dynamics simulation. Comparisons of results from both methods will clarify the
poorly understood confinement effects in these systems. A general aim of this
research is to suggest new and optimal designs for adsorbents and adsorption
processes for use in the oil and petrochemical industry, and for the removal of
pollutants from air and water streams. ***
