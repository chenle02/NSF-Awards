Professor Frontier will develop Lewis acid-catalyzed Nazarov reactions -
electrocyclization of divinyl ketones, affording cyclopentenones via
stereospecific conrotatory bond formation. During the project period, Professor
Frontier will improve the efficiency of the catalytic Nazarov reaction and
achieve asymmetric induction using chiral ligands for the Lewis acid catalyst,
identify trends correlating substrate structure with reactivity, define the
scope and utility of the reaction, and establish the methodology as a versatile
synthetic tool by applying it to the synthesis of representative complex target
molecules. Professor Frontier will develop and maintain a Web site designed to
serve as a resource and discussion forum for students involved in the laboratory
practice of organic chemistry at all levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this
CAREER award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the
teaching and research activities of Professor Alison J. Frontier, of the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Rochester. Professor Frontier is
developing novel reaction chemistry which allows the facile construction of
complex molecular structures from structurally simple precursors. Her studies
are providing new tools for selective transformations utlizing only small
(catalytic) quantities of reagents and offering promise for general
applicability in the synthesis of biologically or chemically active organic
molecules. Through the design and maintenance of a Web site serving as a
resource and discussion forum for students involved in the laboratory practice
of organic chemistry, Professor Frontier is demystifying the successful practice
of synthetic organic chemistry and facilitating the widespread sharing of
technical expertise and scientific wisdom.
