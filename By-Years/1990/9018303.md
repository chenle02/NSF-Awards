This work will develop a generalized three-dimensional model for the interaction
of normal and strike-slip faults during continental extension. The relationship
between transverse structures (strike-slip faults) and detachment (normal)
faults in southern Nevada will be examined in detail, and a temporal and
structural history will be established. To accomplish this, an integrated study
will be conducted that involves geologic mapping, geochronology, and seismic
reflection profiling across both detachment and strike-slip faults. This
collaborative proposal with 9017629 which will address the geologic mapping and
geochronology. Three classes of models will be tested: strike-slip faults ar
crust-penetrating, fundamental first order structures and normal faults are
secondary; detachment faults are first-order structures and strike-slip faults
are secondary transfer faults in the shallow crust; and, strike-slip and normal
faults are synchronous and allow extension to occur by the horizontal
translation of crustal blocks. The results of this study will provide
fundamental three-dimensional information on the mechanisms by which continental
crust may extend, and as such have wide-reaching tectonic importance.
