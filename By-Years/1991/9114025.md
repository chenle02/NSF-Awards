A workshop devoted to current research and new directions for compiler code
generation was held at the new International Conference and Research Center for
Computer Science, Schloss Dagstuhl, Germany (near Saarbruecken) from May 20 to
24, 1991. The participants were 30-40 researchers who are actively working in
this field, and included graduate students embarking on research on this topic.
One third to one half the participants come from North America, and most of the
others from Europe. Both University faculty and industrial researchers
participated. The purpose of the workshop was to exchange research results, to
assess where the outstanding research problems lie, and to have in-depth
discussions of the research topics. This award supplied part of the
transportation expenses and registration fees of those U.S. participants unable
to obtain funding from other sources.
