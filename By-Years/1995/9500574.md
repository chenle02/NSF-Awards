DMS-9500574 Dafermos A number of projects are proposed, in the general area of
hyperbolic systems of conservation laws. They include the study of the geometric
structure of the admissible weak solutions and the investigation of the large
time behavior in the presence of dissipation induced by fading memory or
friction, in one space dimension; also the development of the theory of
hyperbolic systems of two conservation laws with commuting Jacobians, in several
space dimensions. The proposed research is interdisciplinary, lying on the
interface between continuum physics and the theory of partial differential
equations. The hope is that the analysis will shed some light on the physics
and, in return, the underlying physical structure will direct and drive the
analysis. Continuum physics is the branch of classical physics which models
materials, solid or fluid, as continuous media governed by conservation laws and
constitutive assumptions. The partial differential equations involved are first
order quasilinear hyperbolic systems resulting from the conservation laws and
constitutive assumptions of materials with elastic response.
