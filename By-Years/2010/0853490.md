0853490&lt;br/&gt;Papoutsakis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit - This
project aims to develop novel approaches for generating industrially important
strains for the production of chemicals and other metabolites, including
biofuels. The concept is termed Differentiation Engineering, which is defined
here based on its goals: to probe and understand the underlying signal-
transduction of differentiation thus enabling genetic or other alterations of
cellular differentiation in order to achieve desirable cellular phenotypes.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts - The Differentiation
Engineering approaches described in the proposal can be applied to other
clostridia and other differentiating organisms. In addition, the knowledge
generated from this project will make a significant contribution to basic
biology, differentiation and genomics of all clostridia and of other
sporulating, but not well-understood, organisms. Finally, this project provides
unique opportunities for student education and training in an interdisciplinary
environment on genetic engineering for strain development, prokaryotic flow
cytometry, experimental and computational genomics, and bioreaction engineering.
