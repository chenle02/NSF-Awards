South Florida Community College (SFCC) is collaborating with Vercipia Biofuels
and other biofuel/biomass companies in Florida's agricultural heartland to
address the technician workforce needs of the advanced biofuels industry. The
goals of the project are to educate technicians to work in the advanced biofuels
production industry and agriculture biomass production; develop instructional
materials about advanced biofuels production; and establish a biofuels education
pathway from area high schools to South Florida Community College to Florida
universities.

To achieve its goals, the Bioenergy Education project is creating (1) Associate
of Science degree programs in Biofuels Technology and in Biomass Cultivation,
(2) industry-recognized certificate education programs in biofuels technology
and biomass production, (3) transfer agreements with Florida universities, (4)
continuing education workshops and seminars for biofuel industry professionals,
and (5) dual-enrollment biofuels education courses for area high school students
interested in biofuels. The evaluation plan is collecting quantitative data on
participant enrollment, retention, graduation, transfer, and employment, and
qualitative data on participant and employer satisfaction.
