9505425 Kane This grant provides support for a theoretical research program to
investigate electronic transport in mesoscopic systems. The research will
explore the interplay between quantum confinement, electron-electron
interactions and transport in ultra-small electronic systems. A deeper
understanding of these issues will lead to a better appreciation of the
limitations and opportunities available in microstructure electronic devices. In
addition to addressing fundamental issues of physics, the research is important
technologically, as the miniaturization of electronic devices approaches the
nanoscale level and continues, perhaps, down to the molecular level. The
specific objectives of the research will be (1) to investigate the role of the
Coulomb blockade for tunneling through metal and semiconductor quantum dots in
the regime of strong coupling to leads; (2) to understand the effects of
disorder on interacting one-dimensional systems and edge states in the quantum
Hall effect; and (3) to study the nature of electronic transport through
molecules, which is an issue of crucial importance to the emerging field of
molecular electronics as well as to the imaging of molecules on surfaces using
the scanning tunneling microscope. %%% Theoretical research will be conducted on
the electronic properties of very small systems in which the system size is
comparable to the scale of the electronic effects. Besides being of fundamental
importance in physics, these studies are crucial to understanding the limits and
opportunities in reducing the size of microelectronic devices. ***
