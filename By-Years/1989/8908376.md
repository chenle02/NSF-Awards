A new adaptively deforming mixed variable finite element method will be used for
a two-dimensional stability analysis of transient phase change processes in
porous media with natural convection. Criteria developed from the computational
work will be verified by experimental studies of formation and thawing of
permafrost. Criteria developed from the study will be applicable to several
types of moving front problems such as melting/freezing Stefon problems, growth
of semiconductor crystals, welding of critical components, and transport of
toxic contaminants in ground water.
