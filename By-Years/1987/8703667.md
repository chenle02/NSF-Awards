The purpose of the SBIR Phase I research was to demonstrate and validate time-
domain numerical solutions of Maxwell's equations for problems involving optical
(laser) scattering and diffraction from submicron objects and features on
silicon substrates. The intended applications of this computational optics
capability is to contaminant monitoring, process monitoring, microlithography,
and imaging problems, as encountered in the integrated circuit (ILC)
manufacturing process. These results indicate that there is no inherent
limitation to simulating rigorously, many, of the optical problems associated
with IC fabrication, inspection, and design. This is particularly true with the
availability of supercomputers and modern numerical algorithms applied to
Maxwell's equations. Certain limitations do exist, however, associated with size
of the computational grid, very short or long wavelengths, and fully three-
dimensional problems. These limitations will be addressed in Phase II in the
context of enhanced radiation conditions and semi-analytic algorithms. The PI
has achieved a high level of success in the Phase I effort, and there is every
expection for further success in Phase II. The Phase III letters of commitment
are impressive.
