GER-9553611 Kukuk The University of Montana (UM), in collaboration with a
diverse network of private and government organizations, proposes to implement
an alternative model for training PhD graduate students in Conservation and
Environmental Biology. The goal of the "Training Within Environmental Biology
Program (Training-WEB)" is to train PhD students to carry out cutting- edge,
creative research and bridge the gap between academia and organizations
responsible for making decisions that impact the natural environment. The
student- centered Training-WEB will enroll participants in the Graduate Program
of Organismal Biology and Ecology (OBE), a program housed within the Division of
biological Sciences at UM. Graduate students in the Training-WEB will benefit
from a collaborative training process featuring coursework and research training
in conservation and environmental biology, along with a substantial internship
in a government agency, private organization or business with interests related
to the environment or conservation. At the end of this training process,
graduates will have developed skills appropriate for a variety of nontraditional
and traditional careers in environmental and conservation biology. Embedded in
the Training-WEB approach are carefully considered retention and evaluation
processes, and attention to recruitment, career development and expanded
opportunities for greater involvement of groups traditionally underrepresented
in science. This approach will be a powerful new model for providing the highest
quality training for all future graduate students in OBE and the Division of
Biological Sciences at The University of Montana.
