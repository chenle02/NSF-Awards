This award will support collaborative research between Dr. Bruce Barrett of the
University of Arizona and Dr. Iain Morrison of the University of Melbourne. This
proposal is to investigate and compare nuclear structure models. In particular,
the objective of the research is to extend a model, the Interacting Boson Model,
which has proven successful in describing the structure and properties of
higher-weight nuclei, to lighter-mass nuclei, with appropriate additions and/or
changes in the model. The project represents excellent collaboration between the
Australian group who have been leaders in the use of expansion techniques for
performing calculations with the Interacting Boson Model and Barrett's critical
assessment of several nuclear structure models. This is important fundamental
work with the potential to develop a unified picture of light to medium-to-heavy
mass nuclei.
