9711872 Smyth This project will study the effects of wave saturation in
governing the form and evolution of the Equatorial Undercurrent. Specifically,
it will 1) apply linear stability analyses to identify the factors that govern
the wave radiation; 2) use the linear results to define length scales for use in
the LES; 3) improve the resolution and test of LES; and 4) use the LES model to
evaluate the wave-mean flow interactions in maintaining the EUC.
