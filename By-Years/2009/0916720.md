The goal of the AquaSWARM project is to design and develop small, energy-
efficient, autonomous underwater robots as sensor-rich platforms for dynamic,
long-duration monitoring of aquatic environments. A novel concept of gliding
robotic fish is investigated, which merges the energy-efficient design of
underwater glider with the high maneuverability of robotic fish. Gliding motion,
enabled by pitch and buoyancy control, is exploited to realize dive/ascent and
large-distance horizontal travel. Soft actuation materials-based flexible tail
fins are used to achieve maneuvers with high hydrodynamic efficiency. The
research is focused on understanding gliding design for small robotic fish, and
addressing the energy efficiency issue from a systems perspective. Schools of
such autonomous robots are deployed in lakes at the Michigan State University
Kellogg Biological Station to detect harmful algal blooms (HABs) and validate
models for HAB dynamics.

The project is expected to result in cost-effective, underwater robots that can
perform uninterrupted, long-duration (several months), long-travel (hundreds of
miles) operation in aquatic environments. This will provide a novel, viable,
versatile, cyber-physical infrastructure for aquatic environmental monitoring,
with applications ranging from understanding the impact of global warming, to
environmental protection, drinking water reservoir safety, and seaport security.
The project also offers an interdisciplinary training environment for graduate
and undergraduate students, and provides outreach opportunities to inspire pre-
college students and train highly qualified teachers. Robotic fish-based HAB
detection will also be used as a tool to engage communities at local lakes and
stimulate their interest in novel technology and environmental issues.
