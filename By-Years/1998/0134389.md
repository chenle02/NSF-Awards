ABSTRACT CTS-0134389 M. Pasquali, Rice University

It is proposed to study experimentally and by simulation the behavior of
polymers in complex flow. The experiment consists of fluorescently labeled DNA
molecules flowing in a 4 to 1 contraction with its motion observed by video-
microscopy. Simulations of the flow will be carried out using both Brownian
dynamics model and by the course-grained continuum model. The latter method will
lend itself to for design studies of processing equipment. The education plan
involves introducing new courses in rheology and advanced computational methods
and to include undergraduate students in the research. In terms of outreach, The
PI plans to work with one high school teacher per year to help transfer the
research experience to the high school students.
