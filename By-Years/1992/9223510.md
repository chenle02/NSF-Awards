Small-scale citizen action movements have become more common in the political
arena in the last 20 years and most research on them has been done at a very
broad level. This project uses an ethnographic approach to observe first-hand
the organization, level of citizen participation, and the history of one such
group in Britain: women tenants of public sector housing developments (council
estates). Through the use of consensus modeling and other sophisticated research
methods, the researcher will determine what new knowledge activists learn about
the social order through their participation in local-level political campaigns
and the degree to which participants' values and attitudes are transformed. This
work will result in one of the few thorough studies of citizen action in Western
Europe, and will contribute to the growing corpus of anthropological literature
on contemporary social movements and on women's forms of political action.
