The PI proposes to apply general categorical methods to concrete problems in
algebraic geometry. In particular the PI suggests a categorical notion of
resolution of singularities. This homological approach is a way to unite the
usual commutative algebraic geometry with the noncommutative one. The PI also
proposes to investigate the basic problem in the theory of triangulated
categories: the existence and uniqueness of enhancements.

The PI suggests to apply powerful abstract methods to study concrete problems in
modern geometry and mathematical physics. In particular an abstract notion of a
resolution of singularities ("smoothing" of the space) is proposed.
