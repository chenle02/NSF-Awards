AST-0302049 Rosenberg, Jessica

Dr. Rosenberg is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral
Fellowship to carry out a program of research and education at the University of
Colorado. Her research will explore the nature of intervening absorption between
distant Quasi-Stellar Objects (QSO's) and ourselves. This absorption of
ultraviolet Lyman-alpha radiation by neutral hydrogen atoms is seen at all
redshifts, and can be used to map out the intervening material. Dr. Rosenberg
will combine ground-based optical and radio observations with space-based
ultraviolet spectroscopy to study the nature of these absorbers locally, i.e. at
low redshifts. She will use deep galaxy surveys to look for correlations between
low redshift absorbers and galaxies. Ultraviolet space-based observations will
also allow her to use these absorbers as probes of a statistically significant
sample of galaxy halos. Using these two techniques she will study the sizes and
structure of the galaxy halos, as well as the spread of heavy elements through
those halos due to feedback processes.

In addition to her research, Dr. Rosenberg will conduct a two-pronged effort in
teaching and outreach at the K-12 and undergraduate levels. She will work with
the Science Explorers program at the University of Colorado, a program that
provides professional development for K-12 teachers through day-long, activity-
based workshops with the teachers and five of their students. Dr. Rosenberg will
work on curriculum development in astronomy and also assist with some of the
workshops. After a year of working with this program, she will work with
astronomy professors in developing material using innovative methods for the
large undergraduate survey course in astronomy. ***
