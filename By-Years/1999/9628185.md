This is an investigation of the adaptive and robust design of transmit signals
for wireless transmission paths. The objective is to determine fundamental
design methods that will allow reliable transmission at data rates several times
faster than are presently achievable by adaptively contouring the transmit
signals to match channel conditions. Time-varying and/or broadcast wireless
transmission paths create special challenges for such adaptive transmission
design that at present have not been solved. The project first studies
transmission on fixed broadcast channels where feedback to the transmitter is
not allowed and principles of robust signal design need to be derived to improve
reliably transmitted data rates. Study then encompasses time-variation through
both well known and new models for both broadcast and interactive time-varying
(mobile) channels. The focus then shifts to generalization to multiuser
coordinated transmission technologies. Extension and generalization of multi-
tone waveforms which are very successful on wireline channels will be treated in
these new and more challenging contexts.
