AST-0352992 -- Richards, Caltech&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Planar-antenna-coupled
superconducting bolometer systems for observations at submillimeter and
millimeter wavelengths will be developed. Antenna-coupled arrays have the
potential to greatly increase the efficiency of observations, opening the door
to new science objectives. The objectives are to fully characterize the
prototype antenna-coupled bolometer design; design and test wide-band dual-
polarization antennas; develop an RF "channelizer" that splits the signal from a
single antenna into multiple bands; and develop RF switches using Micro-Electro-
Mechanical Systems techniques for polarization, phase, and load switches. The
bolometer development may have impact in x-ray calorimeters, UV-IR
spectrometers, and THz concealed weapons detection systems.
