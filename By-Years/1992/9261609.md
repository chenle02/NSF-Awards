The use of fiber-optic sensors in conjunction with florescence spectroscopy has
found many uses in biochemistry, immunoassays, closed-aquaculture systems and
other applications. However, the use of in situ fluorescence measurement during
filed tests has been hampered by the physical limitations of spectrometers
related to their size, weight and stability. To fulfill the need of a compact
and portable spectrometer compatible with fiber- optic sensors in
detection/analysis of fluorescence spectrum, American Research Corporation of
Virginia proposes a novel fiber- optic Fourier-transform spectrometer (FOFTS)
having no moving parts. Optical-path difference is achieved by the use of
electrically addressed phase modulators in one of the Mach- Zehnder
interferometric beam paths. This design provides rapid scanning, light weight
and cost-effectiveness without compromising the performance of the spectrometer.
The technical objectives of the Phase I program include selection of optical
components for a fiber-optic interferometer, evaluation of methods to achieve
optical-phase modulation, calibration of optical-phase modulators using laser
and broadband light sources and acquisition of families of fluorescence data.
