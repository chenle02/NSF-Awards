The project will provide to an undergraduate geology program capabilities for
chemical analysis of earth materials by use of X-ray fluorescence. The equipment
will also be utilized in courses in the Chemistry and Environmental Sciences
Departments of the College. Key laboratories in mineralogy, crystallography, and
petrology courses required of majors depend on X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray
fluorescence (XRF) spectrometers. The XRF spectrometer will permit students to
do key laboratories and have expanded choice in senior research. It will
enlighten student understanding of many otherwise "theoretical" concepts and
facilitate education in important research skills and concepts. The university
will match the award with an equal amount of funds.
