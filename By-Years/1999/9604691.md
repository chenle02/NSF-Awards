INT 9604691 Weiss This U.S.-Slovak research project between Dr. Richard Weiss of
Georgetown University and Dr. Pavol Hrdlovic of the Slovak Academy of Sciences'
Polymer Institute will feature development of methodologies for studying light-
induced dynamic processes within polymeric systems. Specifically, the
researchers intend to: 1) synthesis cross-linked interpenetrating network (IPN)
polymers with luminescing reporter groups covalently attached at selected sites;
2) form copolymers containing groups capable of enhancing or inhibiting direct
and molecular oxygen-mediated photodegradation; and 3) measure diffusion rates
of small guest molecules within these polymers. This cooperative effort builds
upon the expertise of Dr. Weiss in photochemistry and the Slovak institute's
capacity for polymer synthesis and is expected to yield new information on
polymer photodegradation with potential application in industrial materials.
This joint project fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific
knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to
combine complementary talents and pool resources in areas of strong mutual
interest and competence. ??
