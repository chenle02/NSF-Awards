This project involves the purchase of a nuclear-magnetic-resonance (NMR)
spectrometer (Varian Unity INOVA 300 NB) and a software package designed for the
analysis of data obtained from the spectrometer. This equipment enables a large
number of undergraduate students to obtain spectra for their own individual
samples. The students can then analyze the data on the computer, interpret the
spectra, and, when necessary, return to the computer to refine some feature of
the spectra. In the organic chemistry laboratory, five experiments involve this
instrument being used to answer structural questions. In addition, alternating
organic laboratory sections are using the spectrometer on a weekly basis to
characterize the other compounds that are synthesized. This continuing use
strongly reinforces the learning process. The spectrometer is being similarly
used in the inorganic chemistry laboratory to answer structural questions and to
characterize products that are synthesized. In the higher level laboratories,
the spectrometer is being employed in experiments that illustrate more advanced
techniques. The biochemistry laboratory is using the instrumentation to study
protein dynamics. The advanced laboratory is using the machine's variable
temperature capabilities to measure equilibrium constants. INOVA 300 NB is
capable of performing all the modern NMR experiments at a reasonably high field
of 300 MHz, which is sufficient for undergraduate experiments. This project is
part of a larger program to introduce computers and instruments into lectures
and laboratories to further the development of the students' skills in device-
computer interfacing, handling and manipulating information, and communicating
the results of their experiments. *
