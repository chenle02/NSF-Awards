The goal of this research is to develop a three-dimensional dynamic mathematical
model of the human knee joint. Previous three-dimensional models either have
been static or quasi-static and, therefore, the models cannot predict the
effects of dynamic inertial loads which occur in many locomotor activities. Only
two-dimensional dynamic models have been investigated to date. The model that
will be developed will consist of two body segments, a femur and a tibia,
constrained by ligamentous forces. Changes that occur with time in joint
position, joint reaction forces, contact point locations between femur and
tibia, and ligament forces will be calculated. This research is important since
it will lead to a more complete knowledge of how knee injuries occur. Most
damage to the knee takes place in dynamic situations, which is the focus of this
project. The approach that will be develop also could be used in modeling other
articulating joints.
