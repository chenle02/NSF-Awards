For various reasons, the dynamic nature of living organisms and processes is not
well understood by undergraduate college students in biology. That change and
movement are the normal, vital character of living things is not easily taught
using static images in books, slides, preserved specimens, and photographs. The
development of computers that can capture and digitize images presents an
opportunity to teach the dynamic aspects of biology in a fundamentally new way.
Through this project, the university creates 10 microscope/Macintosh computer-
based image analysis workstations that make it possible for students to capture
and analyze images of biological dynamics in courses in the Department of
Biology. The workstations are becoming important central tools in the laboratory
work of courses in plant development, animal development, experimental
protozoology, and general microbiology. These instruments enable students
independently to investigate problems of plant and animal development as well as
movement of micro-organisms in response to various stimuli. Students are able to
visualize and comprehend biological phenomena in new ways. The image analysis
equipment allows them to ask significant biological questions based on
observations and to learn how to use quantitative approaches to answer questions
and problems. The impact of this new capability is expected to extend beyond
these courses to other realms of the curriculum as videos and computer files
conveying dynamic, three-dimensional and developmental representations of living
processes are created and used in teaching.
