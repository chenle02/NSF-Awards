Title: Political Representation in State Courts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Political representation is a critical issue in American
politics, and this includes the judicial branch of government. This project will
study political representation in America?s state courts by examining the lives,
identities, and behaviors of U.S. state trial court judges. In doing so, this
project will analyze who judges are, the influences on their legal decision
making, and the consequence and importance of political representation in state
trial courts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will employ a mixed-methods
approach that includes surveys and interviews of sitting state trial court
judges from across the country, in order to understand the backgrounds, group
identities, role orientations, and behavior of state trial court judges. Some
social science theories provide that judges' backgrounds and identities are not
important to explaining judicial behavior, while others hold that judicial
behavior is influenced by judges' ideology, age, parental status, race, and
gender. The project will test theories about the importance and effects of
judicial representation. The project will assess whether background
characteristics influence judges' behavior by evaluating whether race, gender,
generational cohort, and state judicial selection methods influence judges'
consciousness, role orientation, and decision making on the bench. Findings from
this research will provide an understanding of political representation in state
courts, and how that representation influences judges and their
behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
