Stochastic approximation techniques will be applied to develop computational
algorithms for the statistical analysis of spatial processes and for the control
of laboratory instruments. Both the practical implementation and theoretical
properties of the algorithms will be investigated. New methods for locating
variable-stabilizing transformations will be studied. These methods will be
based on a nonparametric estimate of the variance function. These new techniques
are promising for multivariate transformation families such as the shifted-power
transformations and nonparametric spline transformations. Transformations will
also be investigated in the context of density estimation. The method to be
investigated consists of transforming the data to a density that can be
accurately estimated by a kernel estimator, applying a kernel estimator, and
transforming this estimate back to the original space to estimate the density of
the original data. Source appointment is a methodology for attributing pollution
to its sources by chemical mass balance. Source apportionment when the
composition of one source is unknown will be investigated. Nonlinear regression
will be studied when there are measurement errors in the independent variables
and no replication.
