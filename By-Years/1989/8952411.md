The undergraduate engineering curriculum is being enhanced through the addition
of materials science laboratory experiments utilizing a Universal Testing
Machine and accompanying equipment. The equipment also facilitates laboratory
experiments in a new associate degree program in Materials Technology as well as
preparing students who transfer bachelor degree programs. This project is being
matched by an amount equal to the award.
