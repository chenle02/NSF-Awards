9224841 Yarger The equipment requested in this proposal will enable students in
the large-lecture survey course to move from spectators to active participants
in using UNIDATA projects to "explore" and "evaluate" atmospheric behaviors.
Many of the students in this course are education majors, so hands-on computer
experience will help reduce computer phobia and demonstrate the intimate
relationship between science, computers and their use in K-12 education. This
grant will help to obtain 10 workstations for an interactive weather laboratory
to support this course ***
