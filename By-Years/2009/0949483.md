The introduction of non-native species poses a growing threat to global
biodiversity. Native species can respond to environmental change at previously
unimagined rates. It is critical that we incorporate evolutionary perspectives
if we are to understand fundamental processes affecting community structure as
well as assess the resilience of native populations to global change. Invasive
fire ants and native lizards provide an excellent model for such research.
Following fire ant invasion, the lizards develop novel defensive behavior that
permits them to survive attack by these globally invasive ants. Ecological and
evolutionary approaches will be employed in the field and laboratory to quantify
the relative contributions of additive genetic variation and phenotypic
plasticity to the development of this adaptive defensive behavior, and shed
light on the role of evolutionary processes in the assembly and dynamics of
natural communities.

This research investigates how native communities respond to rapid environmental
change, and provides critical information on the long-term impact of fire ants,
an invasive species of global concern. The study will provide training
opportunities for graduate and minority undergraduate students, and will
directly involve K-12 students from minority-serving institutions. The local
community will be engaged through displays and presentations of the results of
this research.
