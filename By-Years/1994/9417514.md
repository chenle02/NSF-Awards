9417514 Smalley This award provides one-half the funding for the acquisition of
two new Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers and the upgrading of two older
generation receivers to modern specifications. The Principal Investigator and
research colleagues at Memphis University's Center for Earthquake Research and
Information participate in research projects which require the accurate geodetic
positioning capabilities of state-of-the-art GPS receivers capable of baseline
measurements with accuracy of better than a centimeter. Much of their research
is aimed at understanding the accumulation of strain in the Earth's crust and
the subsequent strain energy release by earthquakes. ***
