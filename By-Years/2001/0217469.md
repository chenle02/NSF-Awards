The proposed research project presents a new method for measuring the thickness
of thin films. A non-destructive, non-contacting infrared imaging system is
synchronized to an AC heat source located within or below the film layer of
interest. An AC approach is chosen to exploit differencing schemes that enable
high-resolution thickness measurements. The proposed method provides a new tool
for measuring the thickness of film coatings with implications in both research
and technology. Preliminary experiments have shown that the proposed method is
perfectly suitable for measuring film thickness in the range of several microns
to millimeters. This proposal aims to extend the method to nanometer thick films
by utilizing a radiative heat transfer scheme. The proposed experimental method
can be implemented into a production environment for closed-loop feedback
control during film deposition. The method is also amenable to quality control
in high throughput production environments. As such, the proposed experimental
method will significantly improve coating processes and dramatically decrease
the time and expense required to improve coating performance and reliability.

Using the infrared sensing technology developed in this program, film thickness,
integrity and stress can be quantified at any stage of the coating process, both
during deposition and/or after manufacture. The ability to monitor film
thickness in-situ is a critical need for many applications, as current
techniques are based largely on empirical processing studies and post-priori
destructive evaluation. Add to that the ability to quantify stress and the
method emerges as a significant contribution to the technology of thin film
processing and characterization. The proposed method can be used in an enormous
range of industrial applications, including (but not limited to):
microelectronic fabrication and assembly, MEMS fabrication and performance,
thermal barrier coatings used in the energy conversion industry, metallic
coatings on glass, and paint or protective coatings in everything from airplanes
to cell phones.
