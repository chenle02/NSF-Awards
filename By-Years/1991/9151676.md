An undergraduate lab unit in composite materials, part of a mechanical and
aeronautical engineering laboratory course, is being established. The
fundamental ideas demonstrated include the facts that composites are engineered
materials, built from constituent building blocks, that their microstructure is
widely tailorable and has a dramatic influence on properties, that the
properties are strongly anisotropic, and that composite materials are part of an
engineering loop which involves constituent properties, processing, and
microstructure. To vividly illustrate these ideas students make composite
specimens, measure their microstructural features, test their mechanical
properties, and look at the inextricable interactions between all three. A
unique feature of this lab is the use of computer-aided image processing as a
technique to quantify the complex microstructures of composites. As a result of
this lab students have a greatly improved sense of how composite materials truly
are engineered materials, and are better prepared to incorporate composite
materials into their future engineering.
