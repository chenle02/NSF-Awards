This Capacity Building project is laying the foundation for the creation of four
specialized dual licensure programs to help meet the needs of rural and high-
needs school districts for qualified secondary school teachers with one of four
pairs of high demand specialties: mathematics and physics, life sciences and
chemistry, mathematics and teaching of English as a Second Language (TESL), and
life sciences and TESL. The PIs are coordinating a team of five content and
education faculty, science and mathematics representatives from community
college partners, and colleagues from high-needs school districts, to work
together to design the new licensure programs, prepare institutional and state
approval applications, and establish articulation agreements. Primary expected
outcomes include: 1) the establishment of strong partnerships between the PI's
institution, three two-year institutions, a regional service cooperative, and a
number of local high need school districts; 2) the development and piloting of a
targeted recruitment plan to engage STEM majors in considering a career in
teaching, and 3) the design of mentoring, administration, and evaluation plans
to support full-fledged implementation.
