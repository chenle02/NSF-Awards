Researchers have developed a hand-held device that produces non-woven nanofiber
(NF) mats in the absence of electrical forces. This device can do melt and
solution spinning and since it does not require electric fields, it broadens the
variety of materials that can be spun into NFs. The technology was recently
introduced as a method that through centrifugal forces drives the material
through a set of designed orifices within a spinneret. It may provide an
opportunity to produce bioactive NF mats from different biomaterial solutions
for wound dressings and hemorrhage control. The device has the ability to
produce NFs from organic and inorganic solutions and melt for applications such
as filtration, textiles, aerospace and aeronautics industries and additional
applications as well. This project will look into further establishing a proof
of concept for the technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of a
portable device which can produce a high yield in seconds and does not need
dielectric solutions or any applied electrostatic field in situations where
soldier/civilian safety is crucial and has the potential to open new doors for
hemostatic materials and systems. Materials produced by this device can be used
for the healing of wounds and for the treatment of active deep wounds as well as
active large surface and shallow wounds provides potential benefits to soldier
and civilian trauma/surgery procedures.
