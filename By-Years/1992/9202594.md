A joint program to synthesize and characterize novel ternary rare earth-
transition metal-nitride materials will be implemented. Nitrides are the least
studied normal valence solids, and their synthesis is complicated by their
relatively low free energy of formation, the refractory nature of many and the
low decomposition temperatures of others. Molecular precursors will be used to
synthesize ternary nitrides at low temperatures, thereby circumventing diffusion
problems without the use of high temperatures and avoiding decomposition of
phases with low free energies of formation. The two PIs bring complementary
skills to the problem: DiSalvo is a solid state chemist and Wolczanski is an
inorganic chemist. Neither PI could carry out the project alone, but together
they have all the experimental apparatus and methodological background to
exploit this opportunity under an MS&amp;P grant jointly funded by the Chemistry
Division and the Division of Materials Research.
