0116844 Coale This award to San Jose State University will provide support for
acquisition of a high resolution inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer
for research in biological, chemical and geological oceanography and related
fields at the Moss Landing Marine Laboratories. It will serve a broad and
diverse population of researchers, faculty and students from the California
State University system and other researchers in the Monterey, California
vicinity. San Jose State University, a non-Ph.D.-granting university, will
contribute about 23% of the cost of this project from non-federal funds. ***
