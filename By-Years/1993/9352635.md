The goal of this project is to enhance and facilitate student understanding of
data communications and computer networks through hands-on experiments. The
project consists of a set of practical exercises on computer networking to
supplement discussions in a computer communication networks course. New major
equipment to be purchased consists of I) four SPARCstation ELC nodes, and a
SPARCstation as file server running SunOs/unix, II) A network analyzer for
Ethernet, and III) Upgrade PC-windows license of COMNET II.5 and LANNET II.5 to
department-wide license. New Unix hosts and the existing Novell local area
network (LAN) laboratory of 9 IBM-compatible PCs permit students to experiment
with 1) A multivendor LAN, 2) Examine different network configurations, 3)
TCP/IP internetworking and interconnectivity issues and 4) Writing and testing
network programs to handle a variety of data communication scenarios. The
network analyzer will be used to monitor network traffic, decode protocols, and
gain troubleshooting experience. The software upgrade allows students to be able
to simulate simultaneously performance of a network on any PC node of the lab.
The networking experience gained through this practical approach opens up new
doors to our under-represented minority students in the current networking-
oriented workplace.
