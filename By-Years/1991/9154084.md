This planning grant, submitted in conjunction with the Minority Research
Initiation program of the NSF, will provide for support to develop a research
proposal in the area of hot electron versus phonon-assisted tunneling currents
as they pertain to double barrier resonant tunneling structures (DBRTS).
Experimental results along these lines could significantly impact physical
device issues of peak-to-valley currents, thereby resulting in a substantial
increase in quantum mechanical tunneling with, in turn, enhanced electrical
current.
