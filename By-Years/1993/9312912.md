Funding is provided to co-sponsor an initial meeting of the newly organized IGBP
Core Project, Land-Ocean Interactions in the Coastal Zone (LOICZ). The purpose
of the meeting is to recommend priorities and strategies for implementing the
Project's Science Plan. Because of the complex nature and interrelatedness of
the world's coastal zone, representation and participation by all nations having
significant coastal zones is considered highly important to the project's
objectives of scientific description, global integration and predictive resource
assessments for every coastal zone.
