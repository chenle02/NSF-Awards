9400808 Ojima The focus of this research is the investigation of the Rh and Rh-
Co complex promoted silylcarbocyclization (SiCAC) reactions of enynes, alkynals
and diynes. The SiCAC process will be examined for scope and limitation,
synthetic application and mechanism. Mechanistic studies will be carried out
using labeling experiments. %%% With this renewal award, the Synthetic Organic
Program is supporting the research of Dr. Iwao Ojima of the Department of
Chemistry at SUNY, Stony Brook. Professor Ojima will focus his work on
developing new and efficient homogeneous catalytic reactions that will provide
useful synthetic methods for the preparation of organosilicon compounds. ***
