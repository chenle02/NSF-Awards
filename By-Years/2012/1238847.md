PI: Crispin Taylor [American Association of Plant Biologists
(ASPB)]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CoPIs: Leon V. Kochian (USDA-ARS/Cornell
University), Jurandir Magalhaes (Embrapa Maize and Sorghum, Brasilia, Brazil),
and George N. Ude (Bowie State University)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A workshop to
broaden participation and strengthen linkages between African and US scientists
will be held at the ASPB 2012 Annual Meeting July 20-24, 2012 in Austin, TX.
Funding provided by NSF will support activities that involve participation of
eight crop scientists from East and West Africa who attended "New Tools for
Molecular Breeding", an ASPB workshop held November 15-18, 2011, on at the
BioSciences of East and Central Africa (BECA) hub in Nairobi, Kenya. Sponsored
by the ASPB International Committee, with assistance from the CGIAR Generation
Challenge Program (GCP), and in collaboration with the African Crop Science
Society and the International Society of African Bioscientists and
Biotechnologists, the "New Tools for Molecular Breeding" workshop provided
training to African crop scientists on the use of molecular markers and new
genotyping strategies for plant breeding and genetic diversity assessment. The
activities planned for the workshop at ASPB 2012 that include plenary talks from
Africa- and US-based scientists, brief scientific presentations from
participants, and round table discussions will build upon the activities of the
BecA workshop and provide excellent new opportunities for networking and setting
up meaningful collaborations between the African participants and interested US
plant biologists.
