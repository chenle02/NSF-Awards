Work will continue on four systems currently under study. Initially, Detailed
structure function analysis of adult bullfrog hemoglobin in which two different
components associate upon deoxygenation to form a trimmer of tetrameres of very
low oxygen affinity will be carried out, then extended to other selected
amphibians and birds. This association appears physiologically significant for
oxygen binding. Secondly, the structural organization of the globin genes of the
bullfrog will be determined at various stages of development. As the tadpole,
then frog, develop the sites of hemoglobin synthesis shifts posing an
interesting problem. Thirdly, the earthworms, lumbricus terrestris, has a giant
extracellular hemoglobin having four major chains whose sequences are known.
Soon the crystal structure will be available. Attempts will be made to determine
the specific functional roles of individual subunits and their role in assembly.
The essential role of calcium in the assembly will be determined. Finally,
closely related deep sea fishes exhibit large Bohr affects, and the nature of
the molecular groups involved will be investigated. This investigator has been
enterprising in extending comparative respiratory physiology to a great variety
of invertebrate species, some quite rare, and has helped one to understand how
creatures can live in very unfavorable surroundings.
