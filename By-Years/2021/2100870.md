In this project, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics &amp; Mechanisms B
Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Ming Xian of the Department of
Chemistry at Washington State University plans to explore the chemical
reactivity and properties of three important reactive sulfur species (hydrogen
polysulfides, S-nitroso hydrogen sulfide, and selenopersulfides). These species
play regulatory roles in biological systems; However, their mechanisms of action
are not clear. Through the studies of their reactivities and reaction mechanisms
with other biologically relevant molecules, the investigators seek to determine
how these sulfur species regulate biological systems. The research will be
carried out by graduate and undergraduate students, as part of their
professional training for careers in STEM. Efforts will be made to recruit
students from underrepresented groups to participate in this
project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sulfur-based reactive species have been known as
critical redox regulators in biological systems. However, the functions of some
species such as hydrogen polysulfides, S-nitroso hydrogen sulfide, and
selenopersulfides are not well understood. Studies of these molecules are
challenging because of their highly reactive nature under physiological
conditions. In this project, ways to produce these molecules cleanly will be
developed. Studies of their reactivities and reaction mechanisms with other
biologically relevant molecules will then become feasible and will be performed.
These studies will advance our knowledge of these reactive species and further
our understanding of their roles in biological
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
