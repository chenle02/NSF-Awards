Enhancing Learning Using Computers To Improve Data Analysis In The Biology
Laboratory Wayne County Community College (WCCC) is a large, urban,
predominantly minority, open door institution located in the most populated
county in Michigan, Wayne County. Several goals of our core curriculum aim at
educating WCCC students to become computer literate, to develop critical
thinking and problem solving skills and to learn to work as a team. Through the
National Science Foundation (NSF~ grant, computer, printers, software, and other
multimedia material can be purchased to equip each Biology lab on each of the 4
academic campuses. Thus, our students will be able to enhance their abilities
and become competent and confident with using a computer and other
instrumentation. In addition, the software will allow the students and
instructor to simulate real life problems i.e., B/P readings, temperature, heart
rate and plot graphs as well as many other lab simulations.
