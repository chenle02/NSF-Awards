This work is a renewal of support for NSf-sponsored research on the Lower
Cambrian of the southwestern Great Basin. Previous research examined the
taxonomy and paleoecology of faunas in the "pre-trilobite" and Fallotaspis and
Nevadella Zones in the White- Inyo region of eastern California and western
Nevada. The focus of future research is upon the expansion of this work to
include the final portion of the Lower Cambrian, the Bonnia-Olenellus Zone. The
research will involve detailed taxonomic, biostratigraphic and
paleoenvironmental analyses of newly- discovered and previously known fossils
from this stratigraphic interval. In conjunction with our previous studies, this
research will provide: 1)new information about the temporal pattern of
diversification during the Cambrian radiation event 2) improved and refined
regional and interregional biostratigraphic correlations 3) data to aid in
reconstruction of the phylogenetic relationships of the early metazoan taxa; and
4) documentation of the influence of changing paleoecologies on the actual
nature of the radiation event as well as its apparent record. All of this
information is critical to constraining the many hypotheses detailing the
processes that might have controlled the diversification of Metazoa.
