The time-dependent behavior of granular geomaterials is among the least
understood of their characteristics, and arching in granular materials is an
elusive phenomenon without the definitive mathematical framework needed for
engineering analyses. This research addresses time-dependent evolution of
contacts between silica sand grains, with its consequences on strength,
stiffness, and arching formation in sand. This study seeks to discover
microscopic processes which govern the behavior of soils. A link between
evolution of inter-grain contacts and arching in granular geomaterials is
sought, with a goal of a more informed use of arching in engineering analyses.
The twofold purpose of the study is in promoting progress in science, and in
benefits to society stemming from application of the research results in the
development of national infrastructure. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Behavior of soils
is typically described by phenomenological models that predict their response to
loads and load duration on the engineering scale. These models, however, do not
explain the physical cause of the behavior they describe. In order to exercise
any influence over the material behavior, the origin of the behavior needs to be
discovered. This research addresses the fundamental question of why silica sand
contacts exhibit time-dependent behavior that leads to time-dependent evolution
of contact shear resistance and stiffness. A new generation of grain-scale
testing apparatus will be constructed to test grain contacts subjected to
complex loads. Testing of contacts will give rise to a mathematical description
of contact behavior, which, subsequently, will be upscaled to the networks of
grain contacts, and to the engineering scale behavior. The influence of the
evolution process of material properties that originates at inter-grain contacts
on formation of internal arches in soil masses will be studied. Both the
distinct element approach and finite element analysis will be carried out to
gain insight into the elusive phenomenon of arching in granular materials. The
outcomes of the research will be illustrated with engineering
applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
