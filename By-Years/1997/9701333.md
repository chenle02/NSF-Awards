Fast networks have made it possible to aggregate distributed CPU, memory,
storage, and data to provide the potential for application performance superior
to that attainable on any single system. However, achieving performance on these
metacomputing systems has proven difficult. Currently, application developers
use customized application schedules to achieve performance on a metacomputer.
Such schedules are based on a prediction of how the application will execute,
given its resource requirements, the performance capabilities of the system
resources, and the time-varying contention effects caused by competing
applications executing on the metacomputer. This project's goal is to use the
application-centric scheduling paradigm that is emerging from the practices of
metacomputing applications developers as the basis for scheduling software which
promotes application performance on metacomputing systems. To do this, the PIs
will design and implement application-centric scheduling agents - called AppLeS
(Application Level Scheduler) agents - for individual metacomputing
applications. AppLeS agents will schedule the components of an individual
parallel application on a non-dedicated system according to the dynamically
changing performance each resource can deliver.
