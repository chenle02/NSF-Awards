A particle image velocimeter is to be acquired and utilized in an ongoing
broadly based research program dealing with unsteady flow- structure
interactions and flow-driven structural oscillations and instabilities.
Experimental data from the additional equipment will be used to evaluate current
theoretical models and in the development of improved predictive capabilities
for flow-structure interactions.
