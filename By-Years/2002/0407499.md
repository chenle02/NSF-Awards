A central problem in biodiversity studies is determining the geographic and
environmental context in which novel forms arise. Butterflies provide
exceptional model systems for such studies because of the enormous diversity of
wing color patterns. This project focuses on reconstructing the historical
relationships and past distributions of two subspecies of butterflies that occur
in eastern North America. In the southeastern United States, one subspecies has
wing patterns that mimic those of an unrelated and distasteful butterfly that
occurs in the same region. The other subspecies occurs in the northeast (where
the distasteful model does not occur) and retains the ancestral wing pattern for
this group. The two subspecies overlap and hybridize in a broad region, but away
from this region the wing pattern differences are maintained. DNA sequence data
from multiple genes will be used to infer the recent history of these subspecies
and the origin of the current wing pattern diversity.

The proposed research examines the origin and maintenance of distinct forms and
species, problems that are of fundamental importance in studies of biodiversity.
It will provide information about how past climate change and current
environments impact extant populations and will allow predictions about the
potential effects of ongoing environmental change on future diversity. Finally,
the study of natural hybrid zones is a prerequisite for determining the
ramifications of hybridization for conservation policy and the protection of
endangered species.
