This project funds participant support for the 11th and 12th annual Boston
University/Keio University/Tsinghua University Workshops, with the 11th Workshop
to be held June 27-July 1, 2022, at Boston University, focusing on Geometry and
Mathematical Physics. The 2023 workshop will focus on Probability and
Statistics. The funding is dedicated to travel and local expenses for advanced
graduate students and recent PhDs based at US institutions outside the Boston
area. The workshops will provide participants with the opportunity to hear
advanced talks in their research fields, to present their own work in a
professional setting, and to network with each other and with senior experts.
Through their own sources of funding, Keio University and Tsinghua University
faculty will bring similar participants to these workshops from Japan and China.
As a result, these workshops strengthen research ties between the US, Japanese,
and Chinese mathematics and statistics communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
workshops follow a format in which senior faculty lecture on recent research
directions in the morning, and recent PhD recipients and graduate students
present their own work in the afternoon. Poster sessions accommodate additional
presentations, and each workshop includes a discussion section on open problems
in the field and other issues of particular interest for early-career
participants, such as career placement. The workshops provide websites with
lecture notes and slides from the research presentations, which serve to
disseminate these cutting-edge research results to the broad communities. More
information can be found at the workshop website

statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
