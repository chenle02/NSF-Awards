The University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) will enhance
undergraduate education in satellite meteorology by means of a project centered
on a comprehensive, two-week faculty course for university faculty, to be held
1-12 June 1998 at the Cooperative Program for Operational Meteorology, Education
and Training (COMET~) classroom facilities in Boulder, Colorado. This will help
fulfill the need to upgrade satellite meteorology education, which at present
receives very limited treatment in undergraduate programs, despite recent
advances in meteorological satellite capabilities. As a result of the program,
participants will be able to exploit new technologies to improve their knowledge
of satellite meteorology through enhanced understanding of remote sensing
principles and applications to weather forecasting and research. Participants
will engage in a follow-up project to develop on-line instructional materials
which, along with the faculty course materials, will be made widely available
via the World-Wide Web.
