This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project builds on a research
program investigating the design of process-based software development tools and
methodologies. The project will develop a next generation of this software that
supports the creation, refinement, and adaptation of software development
methodologies in a principled manner while preserving the need for rapid
innovation. The BORE (Building an Organizational Repository of Experiences)
software development approach uniquely provides two levels of process adaptation
based on project experiences. The system allows individual development efforts
to create an instance of a defined process and tailor it to meet project needs.
This is accomplished through a rule-based system that formally captures project
decisions in a manner that can easily be used to assess project experiences for
potential process improvements. These experiences are used in a feedback-based
framework that refines the defined process to meet the emerging needs of the
organization. The objectives of this Phase I research project are to refine the
concepts and implement them in a stable version of the BORE system that can be
used in evaluative studies. These studies will be used to assess the feasibility
of the overall approach for potential commercialization. The innovative approach
investigated in this project has the right mix of flexibility and discipline not
found in current methodologies or tools, which have had minimal impact on the
industry thus far. Success of this project also has the potential for impact
beyond software development organizations. It has already been used in
educational settings and is general enough to be applied to a number of
industries that face dynamic production and design processes in today's fast-
based, customer driven, business milieu
