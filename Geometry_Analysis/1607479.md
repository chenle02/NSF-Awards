This project concerns investigations on several aspects of the Einstein
equations. These equations arose from Einstein's fundamental breakthroughs in
understanding space, time, and gravity in his theory of general relativity. In
physics, the equations govern the large scale structure of the universe, but are
also crucial in understanding fine scale structures. For example, the GPS system
would be unworkable without a full understanding of the Einstein equations. They
also play an important role in the main efforts to quantize gravity, namely
string theory. Mathematically, the Einstein equations are the most interesting
equations relating geometry and analysis on curved spaces.

The investigations to be undertaken involve a cross-fertilization of ideas and
methods from several areas. A main focus will be global issues (existence and
uniqueness) for boundary value problems for Einstein metrics, including
applications to classical differential geometry such as the isometric embedding
problem. Research in general relativity will include studies of quasi-local mass
and the initial boundary value problem for the Einstein equations. Studies in
the anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence from string
theory and the existence and structure of conformally compact Einstein metrics
will also be undertaken.
