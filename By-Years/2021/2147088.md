This project will document the use of DNA by law enforcement to study the
complex landscape of DNA surveillance. The project will identify the actors,
cultural logics, impacts, and mechanisms involved in DNA surveillance. Findings
from this project will provide insights and recommendations for policy makers
interested in addressing the increased use of science and technology in the law.
In addition, lawyers, criminal justice advocates, law enforcement, scientists,
and citizens are all potential audiences for this research.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;This project uses a mixed method design, including ethnographic
observations, archival data analysis, in-depth interviews, and statistical
analysis of DNA databases. Archival research and ethnographic observations at
DNA forensic related webinars, conferences and trainings will help understand
the overall expanded use of DNA forensics, including the key players, logics,
and mechanisms involved. Archival and ethnographic data will be supplemented by
interviews with key stakeholders on investments, motivations, justifications,
tensions, and contradictions surrounding the expanded use of DNA. The project
will also include a quantitative analysis of publicly available DNA database
information to understand the impact of law enforcementâ€™s expanded DNA use and
how the consequences are distributed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
