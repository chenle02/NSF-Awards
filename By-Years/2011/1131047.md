The research objective of this project is to develop a novel framework for
simulation selection procedures using the theory of stochastic processes. The
first part is to develop statistical procedures for selection-of-the-best which
eliminate inferior systems based on multidimensional drifting Brownian motions
hitting ellipsoids. Within this new framework, the conservativeness of
statistical procedures due to the Bonferroni inequality can be lessened or
completely eliminated. Also to be considered are adjustments in selection
procedures to avoid the use of a conservative mean assumption, called slippage
configuration, which deteriorates efficiency of many selection procedures when
the number of competing alternatives is large. The second part of this research
develops feasibility check procedures using a similar approach based on
multidimensional drifting Brownian motions. Combining the resulting selection-
of-the-best procedures with the new feasibility check procedures will allow
solution of constrained selection-of-the-best problems, where the goal is to
find the best system under a primary performance measure while also satisfying
stochastic constraints on secondary performance measures. The proposed research
introduces a new paradigm for designing statistical selection procedures, in
which comparisons of systems whose performance must be estimated by experimental
sampling or simulation, can be carried out using groups of 3 or more systems at
a time rather than using pairwise comparisons. If successful, this research has
the potential for dramatically increasing the efficiency of these statistical
selection procedures by enabling the rapid screening of inferior systems, which
in turn makes them practical for use in large-scale applications such as
manufacturing, environmental systems, and health care, examples of settings
where simulation is employed due to the complexity of the systems being
analyzed.
