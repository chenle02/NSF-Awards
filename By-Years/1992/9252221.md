The Department of Geography is purchasing satellite receiving and data display
equipment to incorporate real-time weather maps into the meteorology courses for
both science and non- science majors. Students are making use of weather maps as
part of their laboratory experiences as well as in observing the daily weather
variations that occur. The significance of this project is that it: 1)
incorporates current atmospheric conditions into the learning experience for the
students, thereby allowing the students to become directly involved with the
subject matter of the course, 2) documents the relevance of the science to the
non-science student, 3) stimulates the curiosity of the students surrounding
atmospheric behavior, and 4) provides non-science students with the opportunity
to collect and analyze data in an introductory meteorology course.
