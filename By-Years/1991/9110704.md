This project will develop a new method to map DNA-protein interactions using 15N
NMR in combination with specific labeling. The Cro protein-operator system of
bacteriophage Lambda will be used to establish the method. Cro is the smallest
repressor molecule of known structure. The affinity of Cro for a specific
operator nucleotide sequence has been documented by chemical and nuclease
protection experiments. Double stranded oligomers of DNA will be prepared from
15N labeled nucleotides. NMR resonances of 15N are very sensitive to hydrogen
bonding. Thus, when the protein binds to the DNA with formation of H-bonds
between the Nitrogen atoms of the bases and the amino acid side chains, the
resonance from individual nitrogen atoms will undergo shifts. In this way, the
specific atoms of the bases in the DNA which are interacting with the protein
will be mapped. After mapping the H-bonds of the Cro-operator complex, the
method will be applied to the Lambda Mnt- protein which has significant sequence
homology to the Cro protein Once the method has been established and tested on
Cro and Mnt it will be ready to be used to investigate eukaryotic regulation
systems and to develop a database correlating 15N NMR shifts with various types
of DNA-protein interactions.
