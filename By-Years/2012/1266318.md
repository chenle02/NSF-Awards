A new site is to be planned at Purdue University for the Net-Centric Software
and Systems Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC). The
planned Purdue Site intends to focus on research supporting the design,
implementation and deployment of highly reliable and secure software and systems
in net-centric and cloud environments. The planned site intends to advance real-
time mobile-cloud centric computing, improve performance of real-time analysis
of big data and data-centric computing, enhance privacy and security in net-
centric computing and realize information flow tracking and auditing in net-
centric environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The planned center site has the
potential to help meet an industry need for research and development to
restructure software design and execution and system implementations for
networked and cloud computing environments. The planned center site at Purdue
University has the potential to further expand the diversity of member companies
in the overall center and expose all member firms to a broader base of discovery
in the net-centric area. Student engagement in center research promises to
provide graduates with a broad, industry-oriented perspective of their research
and practice. Dissemination of the research results will be achieved through
publications at conferences and journals as well as special seminars to be
organized by the PI and collaborators that can serve to increase awareness of
the problems faced by industry in net-centric computing.
