9403624 Golubitsky In this project we study both the theory and application of
symmetric dynamical systems. In many applications, symmetry is introduced either
by the supposition of a regular geometry or by the interchangability of parts in
a complex system. It has been well established that the existence of regular
patterns in experiments and in computer simulations are often due to symmetry.
Only recently has it been shown that the existence of intermittency in the
dynamics and patterns in the time-average of solutions or experiments can also
be forced by symmetry. It is the purpose of this proposal to investigate these
and related phenomena. In particular we will study how symmetry and chaotic
dynamics intertwine in dynamical systems and how symmetry affects the types of
solutions found in systems of coupled cells. In this project we will study
iteration of symmetric maps (symmetric chaos), the investigation of coupled
systems of ODEs where each subsystem or cell has its own internal symmetry, the
stability of heteroclinic cycles (which occur naturally in symmetric systems of
differential equations), and the effect of forced symmetry breaking (where
perturbations of a symmetric equation to one with less symmetry are considered).
Applications to patterns on average in systems of PDEs and experiments
(particularly in the Taylor-Couette system and the Faraday surface wave
experiment) will be considered as will the existence of intermittency
(heteroclinic cycles) in an experiment modeling convection in a porous media. In
addition, the dynamics of a number of differential equations with symmetry will
be studied by direct computer simulation and the results compared with current
theory.
