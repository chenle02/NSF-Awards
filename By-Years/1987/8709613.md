This study examines the social and technical dimensions of computerization in
work groups where they are dominant elements of work life. The basic research
question posed in the study is, "How does worklife change (if at all) when
computing is a pervasive and salient feature of work places and information
handling?" The study focuses on desktop computing, defined as computer-based
services accessible through terminals or microcomputers near people's immediate
work places. This style of computing is the focus of most scenarios of offices
of the future and is of tremendous practical and theoretical importance. The
study examines the use of desktop computing and changes in work life as they are
experienced by a variety of white collar workers. A longitudinal study of 25
work groups with substantial amounts of desktop computing over a period of three
years will provide data to analyze characteristics of these groups (e.g., work
organization, technology) in their organizational contexts, as well as
individual jobs. The primary forms of data collection are a questionnaire
administered to approximately 300 users at three points in time and interviews
with a variety of users and resource controllers in those same work groups at
the same point in time. The study is the first systematic, empirically based,
one on the subject and is significant for the contribution to theory about the
role of computers in organizations and for the knowledge it can shed on the
integration of desktop computing with human work in organizations.
