9726992 Pickett &amp; Morin Ecological succession has long been a central focus
of plant community ecology. Despite the interest and numerous studies, most of
our understanding of the process is based on examination of different aged
communities at the same point in time. Such an approach can not always factor
out site to site variables and thus following the same site over time has
advantages. This project will continue a long-term study of plant succession
that began 40 years ago, longer than any other published study. It takes
advantage of permanent plots that were delineated in 10 oldfields in the
northeastern U.S. in 1958 and have been periodically monitored since that time.
This long-term study records the course of ecological succession following
abandonment of fields used for different crops and following abandonment in
different years and in different seasons. The present funded research will
continue field monitoring, maintenance of field plots, data entry and data
analysis.
