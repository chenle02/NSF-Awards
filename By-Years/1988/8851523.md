This project is designed to provide Natural Resources Management students with
a sequential program of computerized data collection, monitoring, analysis and
presentation of synthesized resource and climatic information. Implementation of
this program dramatically improves the Natural Resources Management curriculum
by providing state-of-the-art computer equipment, and the opportunity for
"hands-on" application of resource management principles with "real-time"
analysis and interpretation. Equipment being purchased through this project
include geographic information system hardware (including a digitizer, a color
terminal, and plotter), hand-held data logger computers, micro-computer
workstations, and a computer projection system for classroom demonstration. This
project is vital to the Natural Resources Management curriculum as it provides
the opportunity for undergraduates to be exposed and to develop a working
understanding of today's technology as currently used by professionals in both
industry and government agencies. The grantee institution is matching the NSF
award with an equal sum obtained from non-Federal sources.
