In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program Dr. Kenneth R.
Leopold will use tunable, high-resolution tunable far infrared spectroscopy to
study 1) potential energy surfaces and internal dynamics of weakly-bound
complexes and 2) the dynamics of intramolecular proton transfer reactions. Work
in the first area will focus on systems with multiple secondary potential minima
and large amplitude vibrations. These are important as models for more general
chemical complexes which exhibit competitive binding sites. In the second area
intramolecular proton transfer dynamics will be investigated for the internally
hydrogen bonded molecule molecule malonaldehyde. In particular, the tunneling
splittings produced by the proton motion will be examined in the presence of a
quantum of vibrational excitation in several of the skeletal vibrational modes
of the molecule. %%% Hydrogen bonding and other weak intermolecular interactions
are important because they can steer the course of many chemical reactions of
vital technological and biological importance. It is therefore important to
understand these interactions at a fundamental level. Dr. Leopold will add to
this understanding by probing the strength and nature of intermoecular
interactions using a special, high resolution infrared spectrometer constructed
in his laboratory.
