The goal of the proposed Research Planning Grant is to structure a three-year
program of research on mathematical conversations among bilingual students.
During the proposed R.P.G. project the Principal Investigator would complete
literature reviews, conduct a pilot classroom study, consult with researchers in
relevant areas, develop an initial theoretical framework, and design the
subsequent research project following the planning period the Principal;
Investigator would submit a proposal to NSF for a three-year research project to
investigate how middle-school Latino students construct mathematical meaning
during bilingual (Spanish and English) conversations while using mathematical
representations and concepts.
