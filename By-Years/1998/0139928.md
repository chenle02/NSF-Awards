A new approach to calculate the energies, transition rates, hyperfine constants
and other related parameters for large atoms with two or more electrons is
developed within the framework of relativisitic many-body theory. The goal is to
evaluate the amplitudes of parity non-conserving transitions in thallium, lead
and bismuth to 1% or better. This will provide invaluable tests of the standard
model of electroweak interactions.
