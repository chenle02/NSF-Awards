9553509 Rosenstein Rutgers University will initiate a four week residential,
Young Scholars project in discrete mathematics for forty-five students entering
grades 10-12. The program will introduce students to discrete mathematics, an
accessible field with many applications and many open problems; will increase
students' problem solving ability; will expose them to a wide variety of
mathematical scientists as role models; and will encourage them to consider
careers in mathematics and the sciences. Workshops conducted by college faculty
will focus on applications of graphs, algorithms in graph theory, iteration and
fractals, and applications. A variety of technology environments will be used
for explorations and demonstrations related to these topics. Research projects
will be mentored by university and industry mathematicians and computer
scientists. The program will include speakers from industry, field trips, career
orientation workshops and discussions of ethics in the mathematical sciences.
Follow up sessions will be held on four Saturdays during the school year.
