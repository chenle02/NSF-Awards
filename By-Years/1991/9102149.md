This project addresses the topic of fault diagnosis of mechanical systems.
Unexpected machinery breakdown can lead to lost production, expensive repair
work, and safety problems. The two traditional methods of maintainance involve
either letting machines run to breakdown or scheduling repairs at predetermined
intervals. An alternative is to monitor machine condition in process, and
implement repairs only when necessary. The research focuses on this fault
diagnosis approach and attempts to cope with fault signature variability, the
main source of difficulty for existing diagnostic systems. In the proposed
method, multi valued influence matrix (MVIM), diagnostic signals are monitored
on line, and flagged upon the detection of an abnormality. The method offers a
methodical approach to diagnostic reasoning which is suited to on line
application and also establishes a framework to select and optimize diagnostic
sensors. Two diagnostic problems, tool breakage in machining and fault diagnosis
of helicopter power trains will be used to test the MVIM method.
