The research Institute at Oberwolfach organizes weekly workshops bringing
together leading mathematicians from all over the world to exchange recent
results and initiate new research. This project aims to add more promising
junior scientists to these meetings. This will give young mathematicians from
the US the chance to meet top people from their specific area, hear their
results and present their own research. Also the more senior people will
enormously profit from these contacts since very often breakthroughs in
mathematics come from junior people. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project provides
both supports living costs and for travel money. On average two people will be
added to each workshops and so a total of 92 US Junior Oberwolfach Fellows will
be supported. The costs for a stay &lt;br/&gt;for a week at Oberwolfach are 580
USD and this project supports 500 USD per person.
