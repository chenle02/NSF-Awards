The proposed investigation will develop a methodology to determine the worst
shape of imperfection for any lattice type structure, as well as a simple
relationship between the magnitude of the imperfection and the corresponding
drop in a load carrying capacity that is a asymptotically exact for small
imperfections. This will be achieved by means of the Lyapunov-Schmidt-Koiter
decomposition followed by asymptotic results, as well as by an iterative
numerical technique which allows the limit point for the imperfect structure to
be traced while changes in the size and/or shape of the imperfection (or other
design parameter) are made.
