This is a study of fuel-doped flames designed to identify possible chemical
mechanisms responsible for the formation and destruction of toxic hydrocarbons
and soot in coflow nonpremixed flames of practical fuel components. The basic
methodology is to study flames that are perturbed by doping the fuel in
systematic ways to address specific mechanistic issues related to the formation
of small aromatics. This strategy allows perturbation analysis, which offers
mechanistic insight and model discrimination for systems with many coupled
unknowns. Hydrocarbons, such as two-ring aromatics, branched aromatics, large
linear or cyclic hydrocarbons, and other compounds typically found in liquid
fuels, are doped into methane used as a fuel in an air nonpremixed coflowing
flame, and profiles of intermediate and product hydrocarbons are measured.
Hydrocarbons are measured with an on-line single-photon photoionization/time-of-
flight mass sprectrometer. Small species are measured with electron-impact mass
spectroscopy, laser-induced fluorescence, and resonantly enhanced multiphoton
ionization, temperature with thermocouples, and soot with laser-induced
incandescence.
