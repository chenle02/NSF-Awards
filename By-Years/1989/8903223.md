Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
available to the chemist for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It
is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectroscopy is essential
to chemists and biologists carrying out frontier research. This RUI award from
the Chemical Instrumentation Program, the Instrumentation and Instrument
Development Program and the Instrumentation for Materials Research Program will
be used by the Department of Chemistry at San Jose State University to help
acquire a high-field NMR spectrometer. The areas of research that will be
enhanced by the acquisition include the following: 1) Studies of low dimensional
solids 2) Observations of intermediates in the folding of ribonuclease A with
proton, carbon-13 and nitrogen-15 magnetic resonance 3) Synthesis of
polyfluoroaryl polymers and polyfluoroaryl- siloxane copolymers 4) Studies of
metal-protein complexes and chemically bonded stationary phases 5) Lanthanide
and actinide coordination chemistry.
