This project deals with the establishment of an upgraded laser materials test
facility. The current facility enables investigation of high field effects and
failure mode mechanisms in many materials in bulk form (crystalline and vitreous
forms), then films supported by dielectric substrates, optical liquids,
(including liquid crystalline compounds), and liquid or self supporting optical
polymers and sol-gel structures. This equipment grant will enable improvements
in the laser's per pulse energy, repetition rate, beam quality and reliability
thus enabling more accurate testing of layer areas of more damage resistant
materials in less time.
