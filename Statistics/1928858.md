The Diversity Workshop and Mentoring Program will be held July 28-31, 2019 at
the Joint Statistical Meetings (JSM) at the Colorado Convention Center. The
program brings historically-underrepresented undergraduates, graduates, post-
docs, and early career professionals together with more senior statisticians in
academia, government, and the private sector for mentoring, networking, and
leadership and skills development. The ultimate objective of this workshop is to
foster enduring mentoring relationships and prepare statisticians and data
scientists of diverse backgrounds for career success.

The program will include information sessions, small group discussions and one-
on-one meetings of mentor/mentee pairs during the conference. The overarching
theme for the sessions is Developing Leaders, Growing Community, and Ensuring a
Diverse Profession. Participants will have an opportunity to participate in
parallel sessions on topics such as Career Success: Tips and Traps, Graduate
School Success, Effective Presentation Skills, Strategic Networking, and
Developing Successful Mentoring Relationships. The program will conclude with a
Keynote address and a 100th Birthday Celebration of David Blackwell. The program
is organized by the American Statistical Association's Committee on Minorities
in Statistics with additional support provided by a workshop planning committee.
