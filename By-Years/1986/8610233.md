While the field of Design Theory and Methodology has emerged only recently in
the United States, in Europe design, particularly mechanical design, has long
been a subject of research. A large body of literature on design methodologies
exists that is largely unknown and inaccessible to researchers in the United
States. Many of these methodologies pertain only to narrowly defined disciplines
and depend strongly on assumptions about the culture and training of the people
who use them; however, the basic design research from Europe must be studied and
incorporated into the developing field of design in the United States. A
computer-oriented innovative design method is created using the principals of
morphological analysis based on the work of Hartkopt and Gowalski as well as the
work of Zwicky. Throughout the project, this method will be compared with the
assumptions and procedures or related methods.
