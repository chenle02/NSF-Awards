The Department of Mathematics and Computer Science is establishing an
Interactive Mathematics Classroom, containing 16 student workstations and one
teacher workstation/file server, all Macintosh Quadra 700s. The goal of the
project is to have students use the current generation of mathematical software
to gain mathematical intuition and to apply mathematical theory to realistic
problems. The Classroom is enabling students to experiment with examples in ways
that are not possible with the traditional pencil-and-paper approach and, in
addition, is allowing those who are being trained as teachers to gain needed
hands-on exposure to mathematical software. A unique feature of the Classroom is
the network software, featuring screen sharing as well as file and resource
sharing. This permits automated interaction between instructor and students and
high quality access to mathematical software including Mathematica and MATLAB.
The first classes to use the Interactive Mathematics Classroom are those
designed for prospective K-8 teachers, covering number systems, geometry, and
functions. In the second year of the project, the classroom will be used to
augment standard mathematics instruction in linear algebra, differential
equations, number theory, geometry, and linear optimization.
