A mathematical model, using the dual-porosity concept, is proposed for the
transport of contaminants in unsaturated fractured rocks. The formation is
visualized as a composite of two overlapping continua, the porous mixtrix and
the fractures. These two media communicate via interporosity exchange mechanisms
that are functions of the difference in the solute concentration (for the specie
transport problem) or the pressure (for the fluid flow problem) in the two
media. We will examine various mathematical representations of these intermedia
exchange terms. A special attention will be paid to radioactive waste. The
proposed model is the first step towards developing a comprehensive computer
model for assessing the movement of pollutants in unsaturated fractured
formations. Our objective is the establishment of a field-consistent
mathematical model for the transport process in a variably saturated fractured
rock. Approximate analytical solutions using parameter perturbation, asymptotic
analyses and transform techniques will be obtained in order to examine key
characteristics of contaminant migration in unsaturated fractured formations.
