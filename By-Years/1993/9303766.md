The theme for this Gordon Research conference is Advances in Modeling and Novel
Applications of Crystal Growth Methods. Its scope will be covered by 9 sessions,
24 speakers, and 11 discussion leaders. Formal sessions will be augmented by
poster presentations, numbering about 20. Official language is English. The
planned program includes sessions on Crystal Growth Fundamentals; Crystal Growth
&amp; Defects in High Tc Cuprate Superconductors; Oxide Crystals;
Characterization of Advanced Photonic Crystals; Wide Band Gap Semiconductor
Crystal Growth; Atomic Ordering and Scanning Probe Microscopy; and Doping
Phenomena in III-V and II-VI Multinary Semiconductor Crystals. Speakers include
experts from U.S., European, and Japanese institutions. %%% This proposal is for
the support of the Gordon Research Conference on Advances in Modeling and Novel
Applications of Crystal Growth Methods. Speakers include experts from the U.S.,
European, and Japanese institutions. Knowledge information exchange under this
format can enhance the progress in the areas covered in this Conference.
