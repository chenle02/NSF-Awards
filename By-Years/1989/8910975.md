This research, part of the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, focusses on
experimental and theoretical studies of photodissociation. Details of early-time
dynamics on the potential surface(s) of the electronically excited state(s) will
be elucidated by means of spectroscopic techniques. Photodissociation is a
process of central importance in photochemistry and represents one of the most
widely studied classes of unimolecular reactions. The approach relies on the use
of absorption spectroscopy and/or Raman spectroscopy. The basic measurements are
the absolute Raman cross-sections for long progressions in ground-state
vibrational numbers. These measurements will be done at several wavelengths
within the absorption system comprising the dissociative continuum being
studied. The polarization properties of the scattered light will be determined
along with the other measurements. The theoretical work which will be directly
supportive of the experimental work, will include dynamic studies modelling the
specific molecules for which experiments are being done. Molecules to be studied
include: alkylhalides, hydrogen peroxide, ozone and acetone.
