The awardee intends to pursue his continued interest in studying nuclear
transition densities using electrons as probe and to use the measured transition
densities as reference points in inelastic scattering studies with strongly
interacting probes. Knockout reactions such as (e,e'p) will be complemented with
(e,e'n) reaction studies to measure amplitudes which are inaccessible to the
former. The awardee plans to perform an (e,e'n) experiment using a deuterium
target. He will also study deep inelastic reactions involving electro-pion and
-kaon productions.
