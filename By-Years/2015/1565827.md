Software version history captures how software evolves, records application-
specific domain knowledge, and tracks success as well as failure in the software
maintenance. By learning from software evolution history, researchers can
leverage the knowledge to help improve programmer productivity and software
quality. However, the ?big data? aspect of software version history presents
challenges. It requires sophisticated program analysis and automated tools to
identify project-specific knowledge and to suggest coding accordingly to
developers. Existing solutions are only capable of identifying and automating
simple code changes. The objective of this research is to advance the state-of-
the-art programming knowledge discovery and suggestion through innovations in
automatic inference and application of program
transformations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will characterize recurring
global edits in software, and investigate tools to fully automate the crucial
process to generalize, locate, and apply complicated program transformations
based on code change examples. The unifying theme of this research is the
judicious application of inter-procedural program analysis and constraint
solving techniques. Inter-procedural analysis will identify relationship between
applied changes by developers to cluster relevant changes. Constraint solving
techniques will reason about the rationale behind the applied changes to infer
the manifested general program transformation patterns. The PI will incorporate
the results from this research into both undergraduate and graduate software
engineering courses with the aim of maintaining the competitive vitality of the
national technology workforce.
