This award supports travel of U.S. postdoctoral researchers and junior faculty
participating in the meeting "Emerging Topics in Dynamical Systems and Partial
Differential Equations," held in Barcelona, Spain from May 31 through June 4 of
2010. The meeting is organized jointly by the Society of Industrial and Applied
Mathematics Activity Groups on Analysis of Partial Differential Equations and on
Dynamical Systems, the Real Sociedad Matemática Espanola, the Societat Catalana
de Matemàtiques, and the Sociedad Espanola de Matematica Aplicada. The meeting
features plenary talks by distinguished speakers, presentations contributed by
junior participants, and lectures for a general audience. The conference
includes a panel discussion on new directions and open problems in the fields.

The conference brings together a globally diverse group of participants and
facilitates interaction between U.S. researchers and their Catalan and Spanish
counterparts, with the goal of catalyzing new research collaborations. The
conference includes time devoted to discussion of global diversity issues and
sharing of experiences on how to improve participation of minority groups in
professional mathematics.
