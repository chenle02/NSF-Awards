A High-Performance Compression Infrastructure for Extended Program Traces

Abstract

Program execution traces are widely used by researchers and educators to study
program and processor behavior. Unfortunately, even capturing only a byte of
information per executed instruction generates on the order of a gigabyte of
data per second on a modern high-end microprocessor. Hence, nontrivial traces
need to be stored in compressed form to be manageable. While good compression
schemes exist for traces that capture only the PCs of the executed instructions,
these schemes can be ineffective on extended traces that include important
additional information such as the content of registers, effective addresses,
values on a bus, etc. We propose to employ techniques from the value-prediction
literature to compress extended traces. Preliminary results show that our
approach delivers substantially improved compression rates on the traces where
it matters the most, i.e., on the traces that other algorithms cannot compress
well. The extended information is important because it encapsulates the
parameters that are of interest in many current research endeavors.

To enable the utilization of this kind of information in the classroom and the
laboratory, high-performance compression tools need to be developed and made
publicly available. This is the primary goal of this proposal. The tool will
allow students and researchers alike to gain a better understanding of real
programs and processors, and will promote the teaching and learning about these
topics. It will be made available on the Web along with commented source code,
documentation, and a tutorial. Moreover, the inner workings of the compression
algorithm will be publicized and disseminated in research papers to encourage
the usage as well as further studies of the compression algorithm.
