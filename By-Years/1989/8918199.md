The objective of the proposed pilot project is to gain greater insight into the
relationship between various racial compositions and their psychological effects
upon whites and blacks. Such a study of the psychological factors thought to
contribute to interracial tensions that result in the withdrawal of whites from
integrated settings would have its greatest implications for issues bearing on
school integration. The investigator feels that results from this study could be
used as a guide in composing a variety of integrated work and therapeutic
groups. By varying the racial composition of a series of small groups, the
investigator will attempt to determine the following: 1) What effect does the
racial composition of a group have on the perceived levels of control and
comfort for blacks and whites? 2) Do whites and blacks experience the effects of
varying racial compositions at different or similar racial configurations? The
investigator plans to use the results in the pilot study to strengthen the
quality of an anticipated full MRI proposal.
