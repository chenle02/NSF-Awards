One of the most reliable signatures of the youngest observable stars is the
emission of their infrared CO spectral lines from a wind or a pair of collimated
bipolar jets. The source of this energetic outflow is still unknown, but there
are reasons to believe that the energy for this particle ejection comes from the
infall of matter from a circumstellar accretion disk. The matter is then
deflected by a combination of magnetic and stellar rotation forces and ejected
in a collimated flow. The object of this proposal is to study the emission
profiles of CO, hydrogen, oxygen, and lines of other elements in order to test
the correctness "x-celerator" model. The Principal Investigator and his Co-
Investigator have just constructed a high dispersion infrared spectrograph that
they will use for this program at the infrared telescopes on Mauna Kea
Observatory, Hawaii. They will use their data to constrain the kinematical
models for observed flows and work closely with the originator of the
x-celerator model, Dr. Frank Shu of U. Calif. Berkeley. The results of this
investigation are expected to have application not only to young stars but to
other sites where bipolar jets have been observed, such as the nuclei of
"active" galaxies.
