Wireless devices have become ubiquitous. New devices are coming on line all the
time, and protocols for these devices continue to evolve. This research will
investigate a flexible platform that can support a variety of different devices
and protocols for both high data rate wireless networking and low power, low
bandwidth devices that are part of the Internet of Things (IoT). This represents
a shift from the rigid networks of previous generations, towards greater
versatility and adaptability. The resulting research will enable new devices to
integrate with existing systems more easily, and has the potential to change the
way wireless networking is supported worldwide. Essential enablers for this
versatility include: more flexible radio access technologies and dynamic
management of resources at the edge of wireless networks.

This research represents a new collaboration between researchers in the US and
in Ireland to pursue a common strategy to investigate physical layer wireless
protocols. Prototyping of new protocols as well as developing an agile approach
to support existing protocols will be investigated. The platform includes both
hardware and software to enable prototyping and experimentation across a range
of protocols especially at the physical layer. The base platform will use state-
of-the-art hardware that can easily be upgraded as new hardware becomes
available. In addition, supporting software packages will ease the use of the
base hardware for researchers with wireless and communications backgrounds.
Hardware/software implementations will allow the support of a range of wireless
applications at different performance points. Run-time reconfiguration of
hardware will enable rapidly adapting to the existing environment. Flexibility
and reconfigurability will ensure that real time implementations of future
protocols can be experimented with. Shared test-beds for wireless networking
research will be developed between Ireland and the US. The test-beds will be
flexible and reconfigurable and thus support novel designs in wireless protocols
and edge computing. The test-beds, which include both hardware and software,
will be used for both research and educational purposes. Educational materials
that can be used in both the US and Ireland as well as worldwide will be
developed and shared widely. Material developed in this project will be shared
with European Horizon 2020 researchers, as well as through the internet,
conferences, and open source software. The resulting platform will enable
flexible, adaptable and scalable wireless networking.
