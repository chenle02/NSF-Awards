A one-week workshop is being presented to 50 college and university faculty who
teach statistics to undergraduates majoring in engineering, mathematics,
statistics, and business administration. The workshop is presenting the
management concepts and statistical tools that are used by leading companies to
achieve their world-wide competitive position in quality and productivity.
Through the use of well-tested case studies, participants are receiving "hands-
on" experience in addressing and solving real-world problems. Course
participants will be able to bring to their own classroom teaching the tools and
concepts needed by our next generation of engineers and managers, if the U.S. is
be competitive both here and abroad. Participant's home institutions are cost
sharing by the contribution of participant travel to the workshop.
