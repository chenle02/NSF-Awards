9520606 Houghton This research is aimed at developing capabilities of predicting
precipitation on the meso- scale (20 to 200 kilometers) for the 24 to 48 hour
time period. A critical area to be addressed in this research is to determine
the observational requirements for initialization of prediction models. The
proposed research will result in a better understanding of determining factors
for accurate meso- scale precipitation prediction. Specifically, it is necessary
to assess the relative importance of meso- initial conditions to internal scale
interactions and boundary conditions. Previous work has suggested a hypothesis
for wintertime extratropical cyclones that meso- structure not initially
resolved can be important for subsequent meso- precipitation structure in the
storm system, particularly if the structure includes a potential vorticity
anomaly. The proposed investigation will explore this hypothesis using a
sophisticated mesoscale model that can explicitly resolve the meso- scale. The
research will allow isolation of specific aspects of the initial condition
structure impacts and general assessments of impacts in the operational setting.
