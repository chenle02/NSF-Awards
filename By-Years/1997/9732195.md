This Chemistry Division award provides continued support for a Research
Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in the Chemistry Department, Louisiana
State University (LSU). Drs. Robert P. Hammer and Robin L. McCarley will
coordinate the 10-week summer program for the next three years. Ten students
from institutions other than LSU will carry out research in all areas of
chemistry. Activities will emphasize finding chemical information, written and
oral communication, and presentation skills, as well as knowledge of research
and career opportunities in the chemical sciences. A series of lectures and
tours will be given by professional chemists drawn from industry, national
laboratories and government agencies. During the last week of the program,
participants will prepare a presentation for the joint poster session with
students supported by other summer programs, including the Louisiana Alliance
for Minority Participation and the Howard Hughes Biomedical Research Institute
