This award is made under the high performance connections portion of NCRI's
"Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64. It provides partial
support for an OC-3 connection to the enhance and accommodate research needs for
the University of Alabama in Huntsville by establishing a connection to the Very
High Performance Backbone Network Service (vBNS) via the co-located National
Center for Supercomputing Applications existing connection to the vBNS. Some of
the projects in this proposal include: Lightning Studies, Ozone and the
environment, National distribution of global climate data, Radar data for
tornado research, Satellite Remote Sensing Efforts, Tropical Energy Balance
Assessment, Solar Plasma Physics, High Performance Communication for Space and
Astrophysical Plasma Physics Research, Ultraviolet Imager, SSME Flow Process
Modeling, Remote Polarization Sensing Data Analysis, Optical Phased Array
Systems, Virtual Laboratories in Probability and Statistics, Alabama
Supercomputing Program to Inspire Computation Research in Education, Remote High
Performance Visualization and Virtual Reality for Surgical Planning and
Rehearsal and Related Investigations in Telemedicine, and Collaborative Multi-
Archive Data Mining. With this high performance network capability the
University of Alabama in Huntsville will expand current research and
collaboration with both academic institutions and federal laboratories. On this
project, collaborating institutions include: Pennsylvania State University,
National Center for Atmospheric Research, MIT's Lincoln Laboratory, Texas
A&amp;M, University of Arizona, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Georgia
Institute of Technology, University of Virginia, university of Washington,
University of Maryland, University of Colorado, University of California-San
Diego, NOAA/NESDIS, NOAA/NCDC, EDC, NASA/LaRC, NASA/MSFC, NASA/GISS, NASA/GSFC,
NASA/JPL, Environmental Protection Agency, and the National Environmental
Assessment Laboratory in Research Triangle Park.
