In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor Jean-Luc Montchamp of the Department of Chemistry at Texas
Christian University will explore the development of methods for the formation
of compounds that are chiral at the phosphorus atom (P-chiral organophosphorus
compounds). Access to P-chiral compounds remains a major synthetic challenge,
and chemists largely still rely on rare commercially available but expensive
compounds for the development of their various catalytic methodologies. This
proposal aims at the general and practical preparation of P-chiral phosphorus
compounds. Although a variety of methods exists, to date every single method
suffers from significant limitations such as high cost, limited scope and
scalability, extended time-investment, or complicated experimental conditions.
&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Practical routes to P-chiral compounds could have a major
impact on enantioselective catalysis, as chiral phosphines are ubiquitous in
enantioselective catalysis. More effective enantioselective catalysis will have
an impact in all areas of chemistry where the synthesis of chiral molecules is
needed such as the pharmaceutical, agricultural, and chemical industries.
Additionally, this project will provide excellent training of coworkers, from
undergraduate research participants to post-doctoral, including those from
groups historically underrepresented in the physical sciences.
