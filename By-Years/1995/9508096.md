Thermal and mechanical processes during deformation of the middle crust affect
the style of tectonic interactions observed at the earth s surface, however not
enough is known about the middle crust to allow predictive models. This project
will use the extensively exposed middle crustal rocks of the southwest United
States to study the mutual interaction of plutonism, deformation and
metamorphism at middle crustal levels to attempt to determine its control on the
strength and behavior of the continental lithosphere during orogeny. Work will
focus on testing the idea that the middle crust is heterogeneous but crudely
rheologically layered and that various depths have characteristic Ptt loops.
Results will help clarify middle crustal deformation dynamics for the
Proterozoic of the Southwest, which should provide elements of general model for
middle crustal deformation.
