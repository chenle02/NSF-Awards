This grant provides partial support for a workshop on non-solar neutrino
astronomy, specifically concerning the development of future neutrino detectors
and neutrino telescopes. Neutrinos are very elusive nuclear particles. Most
neutrinos pass right through the Earth. Until recently, the only captured
astronomical neutrinos came from the Sun. But the recently observed supernova
was first detected through the neutrinos emitted at the very beginning of that
stellar explosion. The number of captured neutrinos is consistent with earlier
estimates and demonstrates that vastly more information about cosmic explosions
could be learned through better neutrino detectors. This grant supports a
workshop to discuss present and possible future neutrino detectors and neutrino
telescopes.
