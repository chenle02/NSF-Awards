9319977 Hamilton Peculiar velocities distort the pattern of clustering of
galaxies observed in redshift space. Analysis of these distortions offers an
exciting and powerful tool for understanding the large scale distribution of
matter and its velocity in the Universe. Dr. Hamilton has recently been
developing new methods of measuring these subtle distortions, and with this
award he will continue this work and pursue its various ramifications. He has
introduced the idea of measuring redshift distortions from the harmonics of the
correlation function, and has suggested improved techniques to allow these
harmonics and their uncertainties to be measured reliably from observations. The
study of redshift distortions on large scales should become an increasingly
important tool as redshift surveys increase in depth and reliability.
