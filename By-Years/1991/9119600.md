This award supports planning activities in preparation for high-resolution
paleoclimate studies in the large lakes of the East African Rift Valley. This
effort, entitled the International Decade for the East African Lakes (IDEAL),
resulted from a workshop held in Bern, Switzerland in March 1990. The African
rift valley lakes hold a record of climatic change in the tropics that is
unparalleled anywhere in the world. It is resolvable on a time scale of years or
decades and may be continuous back to 10-20 million years before present. The
lakes respond dramatically to relatively minor changes in climate, leaving
strong signals in sediment composition. Our ability to interpret these signals,
however, is constrained by our limited knowledge about how the lakes respond to
climate forcing. We know little about the biological, chemical physical dynamics
of these lakes, or how they impact sediment composition. A comprehensive, multi-
disciplinary study is proposed that will involve scientists from the North
America, Europe and Africa.
