w:\awards\awards96\*.doc 9623992 Sellmyer This research program is directed
towards advancing our understanding of magnetism and magneto-optic phenomena in
novel nanoscaled materials. The types of structures to be studied include
nanocrystalline and metastable-phase compounds and alloys, and novel multilayer
and particulate nanocomposite systems. Special attention will be paid to the
thin-film synthesis of these materials by epitaxial stabilization of nanoscaled
crystal structures which do not exist in bulk form, and by rapid thermal-
processing methods. A significant emphasis of this program is on fundamental
understanding of the inter- particle or inter-grain interactions, phase-
transition and coercivity behavior, and electronic structure and magneto-optical
properties of these novel materials. %%% The synthesis and control of the
magnetic properties of thin films play an extremely important role in modern
science and society. A significant aspect of this is our growing ability to
artificially structure novel materials at the nanometer scale (1 nanometer
equals about four atomic diameters) and to fabricate such materials into devices
with properties and applications which were hardly imagined only a decade ago. A
large part of the interest in nanoscaled magnetic films is stimulated by
information storage and magnetoelectronic devices. In recent decades the
information density in computer hard disk drives has been increasing at the rate
of about a factor of 10 every 10 years and recently the rate has increased. This
progress is dependent on major advances in understanding and control of
nanostructured magnetic materials, which is the subject of this research. ***
