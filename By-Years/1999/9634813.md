9634813 Peshkin Assistive devices aid in maneuvering subcomponents with safety
and ergonomic benefit, thereby reducing worker strain and fatigue during
assembly operations. However, these devices usually reduce freedom of motion and
dexterity. This Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry cooperative
research project between Northwestern University and General Motors will
investigate programmable constraint machines as assistive devices for assembly,
promising to retain dexterity and freedom of motion. Programmable constraint
machines use sensors and control methods to provide two modes of operation: a
free or "castering" mode where essentially unconstrained motion is possible for
moving subassemblies into position, and a constrained or "wall" mode where a
software barrier or guide is used to move a subassembly into prescribed
position. Programmed constraint devices do not servo an assembly into position,
so they are essentially passive devices that rely on the human operator's
dexterity and the use of these software guides to ease the assembly task. This
cooperative project will result in half scale prototype devices and full scale
implementation at the General Motors Assembly Center. This project will advance
theoretical and applied research in the areas of robotics and assembly. The
potential impact of this research on improved worker safety will lead to
productivity and cost benefits.
