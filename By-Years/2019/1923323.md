The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to
potentially replace reduce the costs of solar panel, enabling wider spread
adoption. Solar panel manufacturing depends heavily on conductive pastes in the
manufacture of the conductive busbars and finger grids on the top of solar
panels, with the market potential for the conductive pastes being currently
estimated to be about $2 billion and its growth at a CAGR of 4%. With silver
components accounting for close to 20% of the current photovoltaic solar cell
costs, 100-fold cheaper copper pastes can substantially reduce the manufacturing
cost. New materials developments have led to increases in copper paste sales and
usages. Commercialization of this technology offers an opportunity to accelerate
the demand for solar panels by supplying high-performance conductive pastes to
solar panel manufacturers at attractive prices.

This I-Corps project focuses on determining the commercialization feasibility of
a high performance and low-cost copper nanowire paste technology to help
photovoltaic solar panel manufacturers who suffer from the pain of high-cost
silver paste that requires high processing temperature and is subject to
corrosion of silver grid fingers to degrade the electrical performance. Customer
discovery will be performed to test a number of initial hypotheses, identify the
market opportunity, and develop the business model. Manufacturing of silicon-
based solar cells involves screen printing of conductive silver pastes as front
electrodes to provide good contact and efficient electrical performance. Major
barriers include high cost of silver, high-temperature manufacturing process and
corrosion of silver grid fingers. These barriers will be overcome by using new
copper nanowire pastes that are sinterable and oxidation-resistant at room
temperature for manufacturing highly conductive electrodes on solar panels.
