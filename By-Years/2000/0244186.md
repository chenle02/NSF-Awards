0244186 Ostermann&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides funding to the
University of Kansas Center for Research for the establishment of a three-year
Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site for 13 students each year for
research opportunities in chemical and petroleum engineering. Projects will be
available in areas such as biomedical engineering; fuel cell technology;
catalyst development; computer-aided molecular modeling and design; plasma
deposition; and microchip fabrication. Students will be assigned individual
projects and will interact with teams of faculty, graduate students, and
professional staff. In addition to the research experience, students will
participate in weekly seminars, oral presentations of interim results, written
report preparation, and lectures on research methodology. Participants will be
recruited from institutions nationwide, with special attention to recruiting
students from institutions without extensive research programs and students from
underrepresented groups. It is anticipated that this program will help encourage
and direct American students to graduate school and careers in
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
