This project is being funded through the Learning and Intelligent Systems (LIS)
initiative. The project is concerned with the intelligence exhibited in
interactions among sensory-motor activities and cognitive capacities such as
reasoning, planning and learning, in both organisms and machines. Such
interaction is regularly shown in the act of navigation, which is engaged in by
humans and other animals from an early age, and seems almost effortless in
normal circumstances thereafter. Whatever there is in navigation that is innate
and whatever is learned, it is important to try to understand the interaction of
the various cognitive, perceptual, and motor systems that are involved. The
complexity of these interactions becomes clear in the development of mobile
robots, such as the one recently deployed on Mars, not to mention the more
autonomous ones planned for the future. It is still a major and imperfectly
understood task to create programs that will coordinate sensors, keep an
internal emapn of the area, and allow the robot to cross a space efficiently and
without collisions with obstacles. An interdisciplinary approach is being taken
in this research project, exploring human capabilities through experiments,
developing models based on the experimental results and what is already known
about human navigation, implementing these models in programs for robot control,
then testing these programs in robotic navigation experiments for their efficacy
and their reasonableness as models of human navigation. The goals are both to
understand the phenomena in humans and machines and to develop robust algorithms
to be used in mobile robots. This alliance of researchers studying
psychophysics, cognition, computation, and robotics will lead to gains in
knowledge across many disciplines and will enhance our understanding of spatial
cognition and visual navigation in agents, both artificial and natural.
