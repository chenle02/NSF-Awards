By using the new isothermal plateau fission-track method of dating tephra
layers developed by Westgate, by applying a proven detailed method for
characterizing (fingerprinting) individual tephra layers, and by outlining the
paleomagnetostratigraphy of the loess, it is planned to develop a reliable and
detailed chronostratigraphic framework for the 3 million year loess sequence
with the abundant tephra beds, and plant and animal remains near Fairbanks,
Alaska. The long-studied loess exposures will now be able to be tied together to
create a veritable "Rosetta Stone", permitting the dating of detailed geologic,
biologic, and climatic records of environmental change in interior Alaska for
late Cenozoic time. This record then can be widely correlated from the Yukon to
eastern Siberia. The State of Alaska has created a Loess Study Preserve at Gold
Hill near Fairbanks where the loess record extends back 3 million years, perhaps
the oldest in the world. Of the three detailed investigation trenches dug at
this site, only one is completely studied; paleomagnetic dating is required on
the other two. Also, only two of the many tephra have been dated here. Continued
detailed sedimentologic, tephrochronologic, and paleomagnetostratigraphic work
at this and other exposures near Fairbanks will strengthen the preliminary
chronostratigraphic framework outlining the long, cold time periods of loess
deposition in tundra environments interspersed with forest environments of
interglacial times.
