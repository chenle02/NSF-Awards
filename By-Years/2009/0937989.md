&lt;br/&gt;The collection of statistical learning resources being made available
by this NSDL project enables both introductory statistics and traditional STEM
educators to infuse real-world data and statistical computing into their
courses. Each learning resource has a complimentary web-based formative
assessment that contributes to understanding of teacher usage while measuring
the impact of using digital resources on student learning. To enhance current
statistical and data analysis capabilities within the NSDL, the site also serves
as a central repository for learning materials that pertain to R, the open
source language for statistical computing and graphics. The site also provides a
web-based interface for R called R-web, providing a barrier-free computing
environment for all. Finally, the project provides an opportunity for students
to create a repository of STEM data sets that meet the needs of the introductory
statistics and larger community of STEM learners.
