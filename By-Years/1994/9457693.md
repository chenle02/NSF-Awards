9457693 Rubin With this National Science Foundation Young Investigator (NYI)
award, the Synthetic Organic Program of the Chemistry Division is supporting the
research and teaching activities of Dr. Yves F. Rubin of the Department of
Chemistry and Biochemistry of the University of California, Los Angeles. The
focus of Professor Rubin's research is the functionalization of
buckminsterfullerene with an emphasis on the preparation of compounds with
biological relevance and new materials that arise from mono- and
regioselectively controlled multicycloadditions. Also, the total synthesis of
buckminsterfullerene and its endohedral metal complexes from acetylenic, bowl-
shaped precursors will be investigated. The focus of Dr. Rubin's teaching
activities will be curriculum development at both the undergraduate and graduate
levels.
