This grant is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the
subfield of mass spectrometry. The PI will support the travel of young faculty
and graduate students to the Internaional Conference in Mass Spectrometry to be
held in Amsterdam in August of 1991. This is a most important triennial meeting
for this field of science and the impact of the grant on these young scientists
will be enormous. A subcommittee of the Board of Directors of the American
Society of Mass Spectrometry will choose the persons receiving support.
