This is a proposal to study the problem of predicting the Dst index which is
driven by the growth and decay of the terrestrial ring current. The study will
be aimed at defining a better Dst index, creating a quick time Dst index for
scientific investigations, and understanding the solar wind coupling function.
The proposed approach uses both historical data and new data available from
satellite and ground-based instrumentation.
