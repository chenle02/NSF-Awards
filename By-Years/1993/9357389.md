9357389 Neufeld This NSF Young Investigator award will support Dr. Neufeld's
theoretical investigation of astronomical masers. He will explore the physical
conditions required to pump such masers, the astrophysical phenomena which give
rise to those conditions, and the geometry needed to generate an individual
maser feature of given observed properties. ***
