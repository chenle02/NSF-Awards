The problem of moral hazard is commonplace. A firm may sell an inferior product
to its customers, a worker may shirk rather than learning new skills, and a
credit-rating agency may give advice based on a poor model. In a repeated
setting, reputational concerns can mitigate such opportunism. For example, high
reputation and the ability to charge a premium price can give a firm an
incentive to produce excellent products.

This project uses game theory to advance our understanding of the value of
reputation, the incentives to invest in (or run down) a reputation, and the
dynamics of reputation. The PIs develop a new analytical approach that promises
a substantial advance on existing methods for studying these questions. The new
method uses more realistic assumptions; product quality is modeled as a lagged
function of past investment and product quality is imperfectly observed by
consumers.

The PIs use their method to study the how reputational incentives and dynamics
are determined by the ways in which consumers learn about product quality. They
develop predictions about how investment in research and development creates a
product life cycle.

Existing methods for modeling and analyzing reputation have been widely used
across the social sciences. The new method will have significant broader impact
in these same implications.
