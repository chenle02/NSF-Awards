Depth images are used as rendering primitives in the high-performance graphics
engine that is being constructed in this project. A depth image is a two-
dimensional image that includes depth relative to a viewpoint, in addition to
color and other properties. From a small number of depth images, each of which
represents an arbitrarily complex scene from a single viewpoint, an image can be
computed for any viewpoint within the neighborhood of the original viewpoints.
This image-based rendering approach offers advantages in realism and
distributing the rendering computation among processors that generate depth
images and those that reproject them to new viewpoints. The project is using the
existing PixelFlow graphics engine to test the image- based rendering ideas.
During the first part of the project, algorithms for acquiring and pre-
processing depth images will be investigated. At the same time, the PixelFlow
machine will be enhanced for image acquisition and storage. This will permit
software for image-based rendering to run in real-time on the PixelFlow machine,
performing the following operations: determination of reference images to be
used as sources of depth pixels, warping of reference image pixels to the screen
space, evaluation color, area, and other parameters for each pixel, and blending
of pixels to form the final reference image. In later stages of the project,
hardware support may be developed and evaluated for some of these operations.
