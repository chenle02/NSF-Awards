9617972 Key In this project, the PI will continue to assemble and quality-
control the WOCE Carbon-14 data set, to begin synthesis of that data, and to
collaborate with modelers in applying the data to quantitative model comparison
and validation. In addition to quantitative and qualitative descriptions of the
radiocarbon fields, focus will be on thermocline ventilation in the North and
South Pacific, mixing, upwelling, transport and particle flux in the deep and
abyssal North Pacific, deep return circulation in the Pacific, and description
of the global correlation between carbon-14 and silicate.
