Selective visual attention serializes the processing of stimulus data to make
efficient use of limited processing resources in the human visual system. This
work will develop a connectionist network to emulate a variety of attentional
phenomena that have been reported by Treisman, Wolford, Duncan and others. As
demonstrated in preliminary work, a hierarchical, multi-scale network that uses
feature arrays with strong lateral inhibitory connections is capable of
producing responses that are suggestive of a number of key behaviors associated
with visual attention. The work to be done involves integrating the network
structures of the earlier work into a single cohesive architecture, elaborating
this network model to support additional function, and tuning the network
structure to provide a more quantitative match with behavioral and neural data.
The goals of the work are to provide (1) a practical computational model for
machine recognition systems, (2) a model of human visual attention that is more
comprehensive than current theories, and (3) a network model that makes contact
with data on the neural basis of attention.
