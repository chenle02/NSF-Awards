The organization of the cortex of the brain is far from being understood,
despite extensive work on anatomy and physiology, particularly on visual cortex.
We are still revising basic principles, such as the usefulness of multiple maps
of sensory representations, the nature of modular or topographic projections of
neural pathways, and the degree of strict hierarchy in ascending sensory
systems. This project uses sophisticated modern neuroanatomical tracing methods
to address problems of connections and micro- circuitry within and between
visual cortical areas of well- studied functions. The novel emphasis is to get
extensive quantitative details on cellular connections at the rarely studied
integrative level between the large-scale of cortical mapping and the small-
scale of single cells. Data are analyzed in terms of modularity, divergence,
topographic organization, and morphometry of the terminal branchings of nerve
axons. Results will clarify the relative importance of these various circuits
for feedback and feed-forward modulation of sensory processing. These results
will contribute to a more comprehensive, quantitatively coherent database of
comparative cortical organization and phylogenetic trends. The potential impact
extends beyond visual neuroscience into evaluations of cortical architecture,
and cognitive and computational models of network processing.
