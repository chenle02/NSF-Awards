This award supports research in connection with experiments in meson
&lt;br/&gt;spectroscopy. The primary effort is directed at the RadPhi
experiment, &lt;br/&gt;which aims to measure the radiative decays of the
phi(1020) meson to&lt;br/&gt;scalar states a0(980) and f0(980) in phi
photoproduction. The&lt;br/&gt;experiment has collected its data during a 60-day
run in summer 2000,&lt;br/&gt;and is in the final stages of data analysis. The
P.I. is spokesman of&lt;br/&gt;Radphi. In addition to radiative decays, the
Radphi data also contain a&lt;br/&gt;number of all-neutral final states in
photoproduction at 5 GeV, which&lt;br/&gt;are being studied using partial-wave
analysis. These studies are a&lt;br/&gt;significant contribution to preparations
for the GlueX experiment, which&lt;br/&gt;undertakes a comprehensive analysis of
both charged and neutral final&lt;br/&gt;states in photoproduction at 9 GeV.
Within the GlueX experiment, the&lt;br/&gt;UConn group has responsibility for
the coherent photon source and&lt;br/&gt;tagger, and for physics
simulations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
