The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a GC/MS to give undergraduates hands-
on experience with electron-impact and chemical ionization mass spectrometry in
combination with gas chromatography in several upper division courses. The
principal applications of the system are the identification of unknown
compounds, both singly and in mixtures, quantitative analysis, exploration of
reaction mechanisms, and the study of ion- molecule reactions. The instrument is
also being used in undergraduate chemical research.
