The purpose of the proposed project is to stimulate competitive research and
the development of top quality academic programs in computer science and related
fields. To attain this goal the Ana G. Mendez Educational Foundation proposes to
carry out a two day Regional Proposal Writing Workshop for computer science and
engineering faculty of all major colleges and universities in Puerto Rico. The
Workshop will be held June 29-30, 1989. The workshop will be conducted by NSF
program representatives and AGMEF specialists. It will focus on 1) information
on sources of funding within NSF, 2) developing plans for CISE support programs
3) improving the understanding of participants of the mechanics of proposal
writing, and 4) developing proposal writing and evaluation skills. Eighty
faculty from all major institutions will participate. The project will be
coordinated by the Office of the President of the AGMEF. An evaluation of the
project will include a questionnaire and a follow up survey to determine the
number of proposals actually submitted to the Foundation.
