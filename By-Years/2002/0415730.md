With this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program
continues its support of the work of Professor Michael R. Wasielewski of the
Department of Chemistry, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL. The research
will extend the PI's research on the design and synthesis of novel molecular
materials with the capability of undergoing light induced electron transfer to
generate radical ion pairs. Taking advantage of the fact that the properties of
radical pairs are affected by magnetic fields, an internal magnetic field in the
form of a stable free radical will be incorporated. The effect of the additional
unpaired spin and the ability to turn this spin on and off on electron and spin
transfer will be investigated. These studies will provide fundamental knowledge
concerning intramolecular interactions among unpaired electron spins that will
aid in the design of systems for harvesting solar energy and for use in
molecular optoelectronics. The project will provide important training for
undergraduate and graduate students with an emphasis on women and
underrepresented minorities.
