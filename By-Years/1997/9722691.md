This is a program to conduct spectroscopic studies of molecular cations. The
species on which the investigations will focus most are H+3 and CH5+. Results of
measurements on the former have extremely important astrophysical applications,
as this cation was recently observed in two young stellar objects. The second is
chosen as a natural continuation of earlier work by this group on CH2+, CH3+ and
C2H3+, species which are very important in carbon chemistry. Extensions to
molecular clusters will also be attempted.
