The PI seeks support for an investigation of a novel technique to quantify the
changes in intracellular concentrations of calcium that are associated with the
activity of hippocampal neurons involved in learning and memory. Specifically,
calcium- sensitive fluorescent dyes will be mircroinjected into selected neurons
and monitored using a dual-wavelength spectrofluorimeter and scanning confocal
microscope following manipulation of neuronal activity, such as high-frequency
tetanus to produce long term potentiation. The proposed research is a gamble and
there is a minimum of preliminary data to allow an easy judgement. However, the
investigators have made excellent progress in analyzing calcium changes in
cultured cells. The difficulty is in extending these procedures to the tissue
slice. The potential for a significant outcome seems sufficient to justify the
risk. The ability to make high-resolution measurements of calcium changes in
hippocampal neurons will have an impact on many areas of neuroscience, including
computational psychology, neural net modeling, and electrophysiology. This work
has the potential to move neuroscience significantly closer to an understanding
of the synaptic molecular mechanisms that underlie learning and memory.
