With the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor
Jay S. Siegel, of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Calfornia,
San Diego, is studying the stereochemistry of nanoscale molecules. Professor
Siegel is carrying out the synthesis of molecules representing unusual
topological stereoisomers, including chiral catenanes, enantiopure D3 trefoil
knots, and Borromean links. As these molecules are prepared, properties arising
from their unusual structures, including highly efficient fluorescence emission,
are studied. The synthesis of bowl-shaped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
similar to corranulene and the dynamics of their bowl-to-bowl inversion are also
under investigation. Chiral derivatives of these structures will be prepared and
their chiroptical and molecular recognition properties, including affinities for
ions, gases, and polar molecules, will be studied. Liquid crystalline and
dendrimeric corranulene-based structures will also be
prepared.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Molecular design, coupled with chemical
synthesis, offers the best approach to the development of truly new molecular
materials. Nanoscale molecules represent a relatively unexplored family of
synthetically designed chemical structures, intermediate between classical
natural products and biomolecules and polymers. Design principles for this area
are still in their infancy, and the three-dimensional structures
(stereochemistry) of these compounds remain fascinating. Professor Jay S.
Siegel, of the Department of Chemistry at the University of California at San
Diego, applies experimental, theoretical, and computational techniques to the
synthesis and stereochemical elucidation of nanoscale molecules representing a
variety of classical stereochemistries which are unrepresented by synthetic
organic chemical systems, including trefoil knots and Borromean links.
