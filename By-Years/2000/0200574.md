The author proposes to work on various extremal problems&lt;br/&gt;for
functionals which are defined in terms of integrals&lt;br/&gt;or eigenvalues.
These problems include: Lieb-Thirring&lt;br/&gt;inequalities for the number
bound states of Schrodinger &lt;br/&gt;operators; sharp Moser-Trudinger and
Sobolev inequalities&lt;br/&gt;for the CR sphere, with applications to
determinants of CR &lt;br/&gt;invariant operators; sharp inequalities for
integrals&lt;br/&gt;involving cross-ratios, with applications to zeta
functions&lt;br/&gt;of Laplacians on the sphere; sharp inequalities of log-
Sobolev&lt;br/&gt;type on the disk, with applications to zeta functions
of&lt;br/&gt;Dirichlet and Neumann Laplacians on the disk;
dimension&lt;br/&gt;-free Carleson measure inequalities. The research
will&lt;br/&gt;touch on important questions arising in
differential&lt;br/&gt;geometry, harmonic analysis, and mathematical
physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is difficult to understate the importance of
eigenvalue&lt;br/&gt;estimates in both applied and theoretical sciences. It
is&lt;br/&gt;very often the case that to given physical structures,
such&lt;br/&gt;as systems of particles, vibrating membranes, or
strings,&lt;br/&gt;one can attach certain characteristic numerical
values,&lt;br/&gt;called "eigenvalues". These numbers are important, as
some&lt;br/&gt;relevant properties of a given structure can be often
coded&lt;br/&gt;into numerical functions of the eigenvalues,
called&lt;br/&gt;"spectral functionals". In an extremal problem one
tries&lt;br/&gt;to find out which structures of the same type
would&lt;br/&gt;yield the highest (or lowest) possible spectral functionals;
&lt;br/&gt;very often, they are the ones with exhibit the
most&lt;br/&gt;symmetrical geometry. &lt;br/&gt;
