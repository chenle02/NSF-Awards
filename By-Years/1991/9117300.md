This is a combined experimental, theoretical, and field investigation of the
physics of fracture systems, particularly applied to geological systems. In the
experimental program the PI will investigate the development of fracture systems
in brittle films on ductile substrates. This will be accomplished by the
analysis of video images made during the experiments. The evolution of the
statistics will be measured, as well as the specific terms in the network growth
equations: crack propagation rates, coelescence, and crack-crack interactions.
The field work will involve detailed mapping, with still video techniques, of
several natural exposures of systems of normal faults in the cm to 10m scale
range, for comparison with the experimental results and with other natural
examples.
