This award will support a seminar on "Finite and Infinite Dimensional Dynamical
Systems," organized by Prof. Shui-Nee Chow of the Georgia Institute of
Technology and Prof. Kyuya Masuda of the University of Tokyo. Participants will
meet in Kyoto, Japan, on July 17-21, 1989 to exchange recent research results
and promote future joint research projects. The seminar will deal primarily with
partial and ordinary differential equations as dynamical systems on finite- and
infinite- dimensional spaces. This fairly recent approach has been applied to
certain important systems, but the theoretical basis for such application is as
yet relatively primitive. This multidisciplinary seminar will bring together
researchers in such areas as classical ordinary and partial differential
equations, abstract ergodic theory and dynamical systems, and map theory; as
well as experimentalists. Discussion will center on general approaches to
dynamical systems, treatment of traveling waves, turbulence, chaos, and problems
in gas and fluid dynamics. These discussions may have important implications for
the development of new and efficient simulation methods for fluidmechanical
systems.
