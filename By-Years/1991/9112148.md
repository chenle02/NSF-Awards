This is an award to support research on the environmental reduction of chromium
from the hexavalent to the trivalent state by contact with mineral and humic
substances in soil, a reduction process that can be influenced by interactions
with aqueous ions, electron transfers at mineral surfaces, reaction with simple
organic molecules or by interactions with soil humic substances. This research
involves determination of the oxidation-reduction processes that affect the
transport and fate of hexavalent chromium in soil as influenced by ionic
strength and background electrolytes. Results are expected to be used in the
development of mathematical models that characterize the process by which
chromium is chemically reduced and physically transformed to a less
environmentally damaging form. Chromium is an important industrial metal that
finds its way into surface and groundwaters by leakage from waste management
sites. The results of this project are expected to be used in development of
models and techniques that can be used in planning the engineering design of
remediation measures that can be used to reduce the pollutional impact of
chromium discharges on surface and groundwater.
