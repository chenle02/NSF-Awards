A program of experimental and theoretical crystal chemistry is proposed. The
experimental part consists of synthesis by solid- state methods and
characterization, principally by X-ray and neutron diffraction, of new solid
ternary nitrides and nitride- fluorides of the metallic elements. Materials will
be screened for interesting electrical and magnetic properties. The theoretical
part consists of (a) extending the bond valence method of analyzing crystal
structures to provide a general and rapid method of simulating crystal
structures and (b) development of a general theory of the topology of infinite
periodic nets. The latter will be used particularly for the computer
identification and classification of structures.
