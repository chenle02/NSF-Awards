9407132 Simon The investigator and his colleague undertake an extensive
computational and analytical study of the energy surfaces given by the energy
functions on finite-dimensional conformation spaces of knots. The focus is on
two conformation spaces: polygonal knots, and harmonic knots, where harmonic
knots are those given by finite Fourier series parametrizations. Recent theorems
relate the invariants given by these energy functions to classical invariants
such as crossing number. So this project should lead to a better understanding
of knots realizable with relatively low degrees of freedom. Knot theory is the
mathematical study of the everyday objects called knots. Once thought the
purview of theoretical mathematicians, knot theory has recently found a wide
range of applications, in fields as diverse as molecular biology and cosmology.
For example, DNA molecules are usually knotted, and in the replication process
must somehow become untangled. In this project the investigators apply
sophisticated computing techniques to the study of knots. In particular, they
continue the development of a new approach to knots: physical knot theory. The
mathematical knot is given physical properties, and knot types are distinguished
by computations involving these properties. For example, knot conformations can
be assigned an energy, and then knot types can be distinguished by considering
minimum energy conformations. The conceptual basis of the approach is familiar
to researchers in biology, chemistry, and physics as well as mathematics. The
project produces both theoretical results and software.
