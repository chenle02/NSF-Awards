0418422 &lt;br/&gt;Yi&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Pan-American Advanced Studies
Institutes (PASI) award, jointly supported by the NSF and the Department of
Energy (DOE), will take place at the Centro de Modelamiento Matematico,
Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile, on January 10-21, 2005 on the topic of
"Differential Equations and Nonlinear Analysis." The purpose is to bring
together recognized leaders from the Americas in the field of differential
equations, nonlinear analysis and dynamical systems, allowing them to present
cutting-edge research in these topics. In addition it will allow for a free
exchange of ideas leading to new developments and directions of
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The combination of mini-courses, plenary
lectures, invited lectures and poster presentations will provide an important
learning experience for the large number of graduate students and post-doctorals
who will attend the proposed PASI. The international scope of the meeting will
help to promote scientific and personal interactions within the mathematics
community of the Americas.&lt;br/&gt;
