IBN-9317868 Stewart Hulse Animal communication is an important biological
process, playing a role in mate choice, predation and sociality, for example. It
also has considerable practical significance. Sound provides an important
channel for much animal communication. Dr. Hulse will study how auditory
communication takes place. We know a great deal about what animals "say" to one
another. However, we know less about how animals make sense out of what they
hear. A series of experiments using complex artificial and natural sounds will
shed new light on auditory perception. Behavioral tests will be used to analyze
the perceptual processes underlying the ability of songbirds to discriminate and
classify sounds based on their pitch, spectral structure and temporal structure.
These studies of auditory perception and communication are interesting not only
in their own right, but also because they may eventually help us to understand
communication processes generally -- such as the brain and behavioral processes
underlying human language and speech.
