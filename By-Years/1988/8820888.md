They are exploring the magnetic and structural behavior of rare earth
superlattices and buried layers. These systems can now be grown with a, b or c
axes perpendicular to the plane. They seek to understand the orientation-
dependent epitaxial phase diagrams of the antiferromagnetic rare earths such as
Dysprosium, Erbium, Holmium, Terbium, which depend strongly on magnetoeslastic
strains in the presence of epitaxial "clamping". The way different types of
spacer layers couple successive magnetic layers into superlattices with modified
properties is also of central interest. These phenomena are pursued using novel
materials synthesis, by magnetic and mechanical measurements, and by the
techniques of light, x-ray and neutron scattering.
