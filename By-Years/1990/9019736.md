A broad program of research on the magnetically ordered phases of solid 3He is
proposed. The plan is to investigate magnetic ordering over a wide range of
temperature, molar volume and magnetic field. Measurements will be made of the
melting pressure, specific heat, pressure at constant volume, magnetization, and
NMR line-width and relaxation times. The results should provide a significant
advance in our understanding of this model magnetic system.
