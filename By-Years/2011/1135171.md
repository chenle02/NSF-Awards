The Antarctic Mesoscale Prediction System (AMPS) effort has created and
maintained an experimental, real-time, high-resolution numerical weather
prediction (NWP) capability for the United States Antarctic Program (USAP). It
additionally supports a wide range of NSF scientific and logistical activities
across Antarctica (including on-Ice emergencies), offers numerical guidance to
international Antarctic forecasting efforts, and provides a research tool and
database for researchers and students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the
proposed renewal effort are to: &lt;br/&gt;a) maintain and enhance AMPS while
providing numerical forecasts tailored to the needs of the USAP; &lt;br/&gt;b)
improve the WRF (AMPS numerical weather model) capability in its high latitude
applications; and &lt;br/&gt;c) foster collaboration among forecasters,
researchers, and students to advance NSF operational and scientific aims, while
positioning AMPS to serve the Antarctic scientific
community&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award was supported in part with funding
from the CIF21 Venture Fund for Software re-use.
