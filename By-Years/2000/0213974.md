Many studies of individual decision-making have shown that people rely on
heuristics that lead to systematic biases. Many economists belief that market
forces decrease the prevalence of such biases. This research consists of a
series of experiments that add an insurance market to tests of decision-making
under uncertainty. We address the question of whether insurance markets create a
byproduct - information - that helps people to better understand risk and
therefore make better decisions. For example, if a smoker finds out that the
price for purchasing life insurance is higher than for a non-smoker, this might
convey more easily understood information about the increased risk of smoking
than would statistical tables. Our hope is that this research will help increase
the understanding of how individuals process and use information from insurance
markets, and therefore how information about risks might be presented in a more
easily understood manner.
