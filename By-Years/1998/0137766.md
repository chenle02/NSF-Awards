CCR-0137766 &lt;br/&gt;Alexander Wolf &lt;br/&gt;Association for Computing
Machinery&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Impact Project will identify and document
research contributions that have had substantial impact, determine the research
modalities that have been successful, identify technology transition approaches
that have worked best, and anticipate directions that software engineering
research might most effectively pursue, based on its history and positioning.
Funding will support travel costs for a series of meetings to plan, discuss, and
execute the studies. As a special initiative partially funded by the ACM Special
Interest Group in Software Engineering (SIGSOFT), the project seeks to be highly
inclusive, involving a large number of members of the software engineering
community, as well as others whose interests overlap with software engineering.
The project's outputs will be a series of documents and briefings, including
scholarly, reports. Project results should be useful to the software engineering
research and practitioner communities, to other academic disciplines, to
government funding agencies, and to the public by helping objectively assess the
software engineering community's record of achievement.&lt;br/&gt;
