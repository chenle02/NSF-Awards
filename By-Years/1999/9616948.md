The Philadelphia College of Pharmacy and Science requests support from NSF to
connect it's campus to the Internet. The College provides health science
education and research with a student population over 2,000 graduate and
undergraduate students. The College intends to connect to the Internet through
the Health Sciences Libraries Consortium, a local nonprofit Internet service
provider. The campus needs the Internet connection to be able to access
information resources throughout the state, the nation and the world. The
connection will benefit the faculty, staff students of this institution as well
as the community in general. The award provides partial support of the project
for two years.
