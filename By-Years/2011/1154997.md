This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Reserch (EAGER) award provides funding
for the study of a computer network based manufacturing system that will allow a
designer to specify, monitor and control the part fabrication process. Computer
networks have evolved into a vital part of our everyday life, transforming
commerce, communications, and social networking. However, the tremendous
capabilities of computer networks have yet to have a substantial impact on the
manufacturing sector. The current generation Internet is not suitable for
manufacturing process monitoring and control. One of the major shortcomings is
that real-time operation cannot be ensured. To overcome this shortcoming
different protocols and architectures will be explored. Leveraging the
experimental GENI platform, researchers can experiment with next generation
networking protocols to determine how they can be most effectively applied to
manufacturing applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of
this research will lead to identifying the requirements of networks to be
applied to manufacturing, and also to improve protocols and architectures to
meet these requirements. The work will focus on small-lot manufacturing, which
is of prime importance to the innovator. This research would enable the
innovator to expand the entrepreneurial culture of the US at lower cost. A user
would no longer need to contact a company and wait for them to fabricate and
deliver a final product. They could just select a station, send the product
information about the product, and control the process until completion. The
goal is to have this occur automatically, without any part-specific human
intervention or delay.
