This award provides support to continue a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates Site at the University of Michigan Biological Station in
Pellston, MI. Ten undergraduates interested in research in field biology will be
selected each summer to participate in the program. Students will both learn and
live at the Station during the nine-week summer session. The research experience
will be the sole focus of their academic activities during that period. The
selected students will each work with a faculty mentor, attend special REU
evening workshops, attend REU weekly discussion meetings, attend general
seminars at the Station, and develop their own research project (from conception
of the ideas through data collection to verbal and written presentation of the
study). Students will be selected on the basis of academic excellence, letters
of recommendation, and evidence of interest in research. After participation in
the program, each student would help in the evaluation of his/her experiences in
the program.
