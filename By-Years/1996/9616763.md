ABSTRACT CTS-9616763 This is an examination of the use of resonance-enhanced
multiphoton ionization spectroscopy in conjunction with time-of-flight mass
spectrometry (REMPI/TOFMS) for continuous monitoring of incinerator stack gas
emissions. Detection limits for 28 compounds found in incinerator stack gases
have been determined in earlier studies; in this study polychlorinated biphenyls
(PCBs) and chlorinated polycyclic aromatics are added to this list. Also pursued
in this study are the establishment of reliable methods for direct sampling of
semivolatile polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs) and other combustion
products and the development of calibration methods for absolute concentration
measurements of stack-gas components. Finally, the reliability of the method to
function under simulated incinerator-upset conditions is evaluated. The goal of
this effort is to adapt a technique for chemical analysis that has been used in
research studies of combustion for monitoring of stack gas emission from
incinerators for purposes of incinerator control and environmental compliance. A
simple, real-time measurement of chemical species in stack emissions is needed
to make waste incinerators acceptable environmentally and politically. ***
