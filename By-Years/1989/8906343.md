A numerical simulation is to be carried out which simulates the distribution of
solid particulates in the flow of two phase liquids through channels, and in the
annular gap between concentric cylinders. This will be a direct numerical
simulation, requiring no modeling, using a pseudo-spectral code. The flow will
be laminar but have sufficient inertia effects to exhibit three- dimensional
vortex structures driven by flow instabilities. The focus is on clarifying the
mechanisms which keep particles in suspension. The bounding walls will be wavy,
with various amplitudes and wave lengths of the wall roughness, in order to find
the conditions for the maximum suspension and efficient transport of the
particulates.
