In this project, measurements of elemental mercury (Hg(0)), reactive gaseous
mercury (RGM), and particulate mercury (HgP) will be made at Appledore Island,
10 km off the southern New Hampshire coastline, and sampling artifacts for RGM
and HgP will be investigated. Three objectives will be addressed at this island
sampling site: 1) determination of the phase partitioning of mercury (Hg(0),
RGM, HgP, and TGM [total gaseous mercury; Hg(0) + RGM]) with high time
resolution, quantification of its spatial and temporal variation in the marine
environment, and comparison with nearby coastal and inland sites, 2) assessment
of the relative importance of sources and sinks of atmospheric mercury in the
marine boundary layer (MBL) and construction of a first-order budget, and 3)
documentation and an improved understanding of the impact of Hg(0)-rich polluted
continental outflow on maritime cycling of atmospheric mercury. This work will
provide detailed information on mercury source and sink strengths in the MBL,
which is critical for determining the lifetimes of Hg(0), RGM, and HgP, and
ultimately regional and global budgets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two graduate
students will be involved in the measurement and data analysis components of
this research. Two undergraduates will help with the field site setup and
ongoing maintenance activities at Appledore Island and participate in data
analysis. An outreach program at the University of New Hampshire will be
utilized to better inform the public about mercury (a ubiquitous toxic
contaminant in the global atmosphere) in the Northeast through public displays
and a quarterly publication. The results from this project will also be
integrated into an NSF-sponsored teacher training program.
