Under this award Professor Thomas Ebrey of the Department of Physiology and
Biophysics of the University of Illinois will spend seven months in Japan
working with Professor Toru Yoshizawa at Kyota University and his associate,
Professor Akio Maeda, conducting research on the photochemistry of
bacteriorhodopsin. In particular, they will work on how light causes the pumping
of protons across the cell membrane. They will test the hypothesis that
bacteriorhodopsin exists in two or more pH dependent forms and will explore
explanation for the discrepancies in different values for the quantum efficiency
of the photocycle.
