As the objective of vision (human and machine) is to compute a hierarchy of
increasingly abstract interpretations of the observed images or image sequences,
it is of fundamental importance to know what are the concepts used at each level
of interpretation. In more plain language, what are the visual "strokes", visual
"characters", and visual "words"? Or what are the visual "electrons", "atoms"
and "molecules"? The goal of the proposed research is to discover dictionaries
of various levels of visual concepts that correspond to fundamental topologic,
photometric, geometric, and dynamic structures of the images and scenes. In a
mathematical language, these structures are the low dimensional manifolds
embedded in very high dimensional image space.

More specifically, we propose to construct top-down generative models for
natural images, 3D surfaces, human faces, video sequences, and 2D shape
contours. The fundamental atomic structures are defined by parameters in the
generative models, and these parameters are estimated by fitting the models to
the training data. These structures are intrinsic to the ensemble of natural
images and video. We propose stochastic (Markov chain Monte Carlo) learning
algorithms which is capable of computing globally optimal solutions.
