This project is aimed at obtaining a better understanding than now exists of the
role played by natural colloids that are present in interstitial water of
sediments in the transport of organic chemical pollutants of natural waters.
This knowledge is expected to permit the construction of improved chemical
transport models that can be used to predict the fate of organic chemicals that
tend to become associated with sediments in lakes and streams. The specific
chemical compounds being addressed in this research are the polychlorinated
biphenyls and the polyaromatic hydrocarbons. The expected improvements in
chemical transport models will assist in clarifying assumptions made regarding
the accessibility of the target chemicals to biological uptake and
biodegradation.
