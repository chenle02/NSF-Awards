Applications of Data Grouping for Effective Mobility Darrell D. E. Long

The problem of reducing a mobile computer's communication and power requirements
will be investigated. Specifically, this research will address both issues
through improved storage management. Based on successes with automated data
grouping and predictive power conservation, research will be conducted into
improved data hoarding and disk power management techniques. Effective grouping
of data will make it possible to improve the automation of mobile file hoarding,
and decrease the effects of network latency and disconnections on the mobile
user. Similarly, through the grouping and retrieval of related on-disk data, it
is possible to improve disk power management beyond the theoretical limits of
any previously attempted scheme. This will be done by actively modifying the
access sequence to minimize power requirements. Through transformation of data
access workloads, this novel approach reshapes disk idle times to effectively
increase the amount of time a disk can be spun down. Improving the battery life
of mobile computing devices is critical to their usefulness, and such power
efficiency is clearly an environmentally responsible goal. This research will
establish the effectiveness of on-line data grouping techniques to increase the
amount of data accessed per operation, while simultaneously reducing the total
number of disk operations.
