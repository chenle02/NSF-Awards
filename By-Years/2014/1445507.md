This request is for support to broaden and diversify the student
participation&lt;br/&gt;in the 23rd International Conference on Parallel
Architecture and Compilation Techniques (PACT&lt;br/&gt;2014). PACT is the
premier event that brings together researchers from architecture,
compilers,&lt;br/&gt;applications and languages to present and discuss
innovative research of common interest.&lt;br/&gt;The students receiving travel
support will benefit from the opportunity to engage in the technical,
&lt;br/&gt;professional, educational and social exchanges that PACT fosters.
&lt;br/&gt;The conference serves as an open forum to exchange research results
and develop new ideas,&lt;br/&gt;as an educational platform to expose students
to new research methodologies, tools, and infrastructures,&lt;br/&gt;and as a
social event to network and prepare students as future researchers.
&lt;br/&gt;More broadly, this travel support will increase the attendance of
under-represented minorities&lt;br/&gt;and talented undergraduate students,
attracting them to graduate schools.
