This study seeks to define the circulation of groundwater by measuring nutrient
transport through sediment and into coastal waters. Such a study has not been
attempted with the thoroughness made evident in this experimental design off
Cape Cod. Observations will be made using six wells that are sampled over a 10-m
length for pressure and nutrients. Hydrologic and chemical data from this work
will be used to develop models for describing total flow and nutrient transport
from typical waste sites to their adjacent coastal waters.
