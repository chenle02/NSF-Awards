The study of thin film amorphous solids by Raman scattering will be employed to
provide basic information on the dynamics and structural order of noncrystalline
semiconductors. Raman studies will be utilized in thin and ultrathin film
geometries. This includes "modified geometries" such as interfaces, voids,
ultrasmall microcrystals and in ultrathin film island configurations.
Information about the effects of these special geometries on the vibrational
Raman spectra are studied. These experiments utilize Raman scattering
enhancement methods to allow weak signal levels associated with such
configurations to be explored. The growth of ultrathin film amorphous solids
will be monitored by Auger electron spectroscopy and selected scanning
transmission electron microscopy measurements. Raman scattering measurements
will additionally be employed in thin film dilute alloys with tetrahedrally
coordinated systems of amorphous semiconductors amorphous germanium and
amorphous silicon to obtain information about structural modifications in the
nonmetal-metal transition. Complementing these Raman studies will be optical
adsorption and spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements of changes in the
electronic states.
