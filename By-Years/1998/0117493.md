&lt;br/&gt;IIS-0117493&lt;br/&gt;Carl H. Smith, University of
Maryland&lt;br/&gt;$8,500 - 12 mos (joint funding with IDM program, total awad
$17,000)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discovery Science
2001&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a standard award to
provide funding for 2 plenary speakers and up to 10 graduate students attending
the fourth conference on Discovery Science to be held in Washington DC in
November 2001. The goal of the new field of Discovery Science is to automate (as
much as possible) the process by which scientific insights are distilled from
large data sets. The intellectual scope of the field is very broad, covering
topics from philosophy, logic, automated reasoning and computational learning
theory, as well as empirical investigations of various implemented discovery
algorithms. An important contribution of the conferences is that they assemble a
wide range of perspectives on the process of discovery in the hopes of
generating synergy. This year's conference will be the first to be held in this
country, and the PI is the local organizer of the meeting. Student participants
will be selected by the Steering Committee from among the student authors, based
primarily on the rankings of the papers by the Program Committee but moderated
slightly by a desire to achieve diversity. The two invited speakers will be
senior researchers from related fields, chosen by the Steering Committee with a
view to building bridges to related research communities.&lt;br/&gt;
