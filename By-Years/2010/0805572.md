The objective of this project is to increase the understanding of how individual
and school level factors shape the academic achievement of Latino adolescents
using quantitative and qualitative data. This objective will be accomplished
using the data and resources of the New York University-Center for Research on
Culture, Development and Education (CRCDE), a center, currently funded by the
National Science Foundation that employs an integrative conceptual framework and
multiple methods to examine how various contexts influence youths? academic
engagement and performance. To conduct this research advanced methodological
training in mixed methods and statistical procedures will be completed through
courses and participation in seminars offered by the university and CRCDE.

This study provides a major contribution to the academic achievement research
across disciplines by using quantitative and qualitative data to examine how
relative and concurrent associations among individual and school level factors
shape Latino academic achievement over time, especially examining how perceived
academic competence, psychological adjustment and adolescents? perceptions of
their school climate (e.g., teacher/student relationships) influences academic
achievement.

Broader Impacts: The evidence generated from the proposed research may be
translated to create appropriate intervention efforts and educational policies
to help Latino youth remain in school, graduate from high school and continue
into higher education. Findings from this research study will be disseminated
through written materials and presentations to a variety of audiences interested
in improving the educational outcomes among underrepresented groups, including
the research community, schools and parents, education practitioners and policy
organizations.
