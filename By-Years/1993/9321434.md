This project in molecular electronic structure theory is supported by the NSF
Theoretical and Computational chemistry Program. Ab initio electron propagator
theory (EPT) is applied to the computation of ionization potentials, electron
affinities, and related properties. Improved computer codes for EPT computations
will be developed using algorithms adapted from other areas of ab initio theory.
These include the computation of second and third-order quasiparticle and
renormalized self-energy for large molecules using direct generation of
electron-repulsion integrals, density basis sets, and elimination of energy
denominators using Laplace transform techniques. These methods will be
implemented in parallel code for a small cluster of workstations. The theory
will be applied to multiply charged carbon cluster anions and to organometallic
radicals. Like all ab initio methods for the calculation of the electronic
structure of molecules, electron propagator theory (EPT) is based on the
fundamental equations of quantum mechanics. The EPT equations provide a more
direct route to the rigorous calculation of electron excitation energies and
thus of spectroscopic excitations, ionization energies, and electron affinities.
The emphasis in this project is on the development of improved computational
methods and their implementation on parallel computers, particularly, on
clusters of workstations.
