The communication of earthquake hazard and risk information to increase public
hazard awareness and preparedness and mitigation activities is an integral part
of the nation's effort to reduce earthquake losses. A gap exists, unfortunately,
between efforts to inform the public about risk and knowledge based on
scientific evidence about how this might most effectively be accomplished. Few
empirical studies have ever been performed on the link between risk
education/communication to the public and public risk perception and/or
behavior, and the conclusions which can be drawn are, at best, unclear. This
research is a comprehensive study of public response (perceptual and behavioral)
to risk information in a multi-county area in California in response to public
education efforts and risk communications there concerning the Parkfield
Earthquake Prediction. Research will be performed in three study communities.
Mail questionnaires will collect relevant data on 1200 households. The impact of
earthquake experience and distance to risk will be assessed through the sampling
design. The effect of risk communication factors on perceived risk and behavior
will be assessed through statistical analysis. Hypotheses tested in this
research will be based on a synthesis of findings that stem from public risk
education research, warnings research and communications research. The Parkfield
Earthquake Prediction Experiment has led to risk communications to citizens in
some six central California counties. It is the first scientifically credible
prediction for a quake in the U. S. with specified time, place, magnitude and
probability that has been approved by national and state prediction councils.
This provides an opportunity to study public risk communication/education
effects comprehensively.
