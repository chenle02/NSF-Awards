9626375 Grove The project deals with global problems in Riemannian geometry. The
investigator intends to study approximations of Riemannian manifolds by singular
spaces such as Alexandrov spaces and finite metric spaces; to study stability
and inverse stability problems for Riemannian manifolds; to investigate the
relationship between curvature and symmetry of Riemannian manifolds via the
geometry of orbits; to find examples of manifolds with large isometry groups and
with positive curvature. Riemannian manifolds are an abstraction of curved
spaces possessing a distance function. Unlike curves and surfaces in 3-space
these manifolds do not necessarily sit inside an ambient space, hence they are
abstract spaces. The proposed research aims to understand various global aspects
of these manifolds, in particular, the investigator is interested in
approximations of Riemannian manifolds by finite metric spaces and in symmetry
properties. Finite metric spaces are closely related to graphs so that the
project may impact on discrete applications of Riemannian geometry.
