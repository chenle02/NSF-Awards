Abstract

Award: DMS-0548644 Principal Investigator: Jeremy Tyson, Luca Capogna and Scott
Pauls

The conference "Geometric Analysis and Applications" will take place at the
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in July 2006. The focus of the
conference will be on recent developments in the study of analysis and geometry
in metric measure spaces with a particular emphasis on geometric analysis,
geometric measure theory and subelliptic PDE in Carnot groups and general sub-
Riemannian manifolds. Applications of these subjects to problems in robotics,
control theory, the geometry of the visual cortex, and digital image
reconstruction will also receive significant attention. An important aim of the
conference is to provide a forum for the exchange of ideas among researchers in
a variety of pure and applied fields and to foster new avenues for collaboration
and exchange.

The basic theme of sub-Riemannian geometry is the "geometry of constrained
motion"; it provides mathematical models for any physical situation in which
allowable motion is subject to specific a priori geometric constraints.
Historically, the roots of the subject lie in Carnot's work on thermodynamics
and adiabatic processes, but it has progressed significantly beyond these
motivating questions to a central position in modern nonsmooth geometric
analysis, and has seen remarkable applications in numerous areas: robotic path
planning, remote control of satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles, digital
image reconstruction and computer vision, neurobiology, and the mathematics of
finance, to name a few. The goal of the conference is to bring together a wide
spectrum of pure and applied mathematicians with common interests in the subject
of sub-Riemannian geometry to develop new methods and techniques for its study.
Special emphasis will be placed on supporting graduate students and junior
participants, to train the next generation of researchers in this exciting and
rapidly expanding field and to lay the foundation for a "North American" school
in this area on a par with the established centers of research in sub-Riemannian
and Carnot-Caratheodory geometry in Europe. Further information regarding the
