The investigator works on the topology of algebraic maps, with applications to
algebraic cycles. The study of the relations between the topology of the domain
and target of a map is interesting and has broad applications in the fields of
geometry and topology. This project aims at 1) Furthering the study and the
understanding of the Hodge and Chow-theoretic properties of complex algebraic
maps and 2) Explicitly studying these properties in significant cases, such as
the Hitchin systems and the system of hyperplane sections.

The investigator works in the field of algebraic geometry. Algebraic geometry is
the discipline devoted to the study of polynomial equations. It is an ancient
subject rooted in the early achievements of humanity, like the wheel, the
Egyptians' elliptical flowers arrangements and Archimedes' burning parabolic
mirrors. Circles, ellipses and parabolas arise from the polynomial equations we
study in high school. They are both beautiful and ubiquitous in nature as they
describe many natural phenomena, from the motion of planets to the shape of
leaves and flowers, to the behavior of microscopic particles. The funded project
is strongly inclined towards pure research and proposes to study the deeper
properties of the solutions to more complicated algebraic equations (called
algebraic maps). As it has always been the case, pure and applied mathematics
will influence each other and new abstract ideas will fuel the progress of
applications.
