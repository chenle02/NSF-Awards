Cellular slime molds form by the aggregation of amoebae into a multicellular
organism that orients and moves as a unit and ultimately forms a fruiting body
consisting of a stalk supporting a mass of spores. In the last year Dr. Bonner
has shown that NH3 orients (repels) moving cell masses and it does this by
speeding up cells on one side of the cell mass. In this proposal he wishes to
gain further evidence for the effect of NH3 on cell speed, especially on
separate individual cells, so that ultimately it will be possible to study how
NH3 affects cell speed. Dr. Bonner has also shown recently that exogenous NH3
affects the prespore-prestalk ratio rapidly and dramatically. Again he wishes to
establish this effect on a firm basis and show how the cells can rapidly shift
from the prestalk to the prespore state. There is great interest in morhphgens,
signals which direct major events in development. NH3 is an example of a
compound that affects both differentiationn and cell movement.
