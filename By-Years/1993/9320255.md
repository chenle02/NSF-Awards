9320255 Goldfarb In each of three summers, carefully selected pairs of science
teachers from fifteen high schools will take part in a program to help them
reformulate their science courses so as to offer students the opportunity to
learn concepts and skills within the context of ethical inquiry. The teachers
will explore a variety of contemporary issues confronting practicing scientists
which raise questions of ethics and values. They will select issues for
development into lessons on the basis of their own interests and experience.
Specific attention will be given to the multitude of ethics issues related to
the explosive developments in biotechnology, and the teachers will also peform
genetic engineering experiments to illustrate the techniques and their
applications. Follow-up sessions held during the fall and spring will be used to
encourage the teacher pairs to share and critique the progress they have made in
integrating ethics and values issues into their own curricula. The project
instructors, working with the teachers, will edit teaching materials that have
been developed and distribute them to all participants. Both the case studies
and instructional materials for the institute, and the teaching materials, will
also be widely disseminated to other interested teachers and administrators. A
broadbased advisory committee will oversee and evaluate the project, as will a
project consultant and the participants themselves. ***
