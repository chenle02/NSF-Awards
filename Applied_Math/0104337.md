NSF Award Abstract - DMS-0104337 Mathematical Sciences: Workshop on Soliton
Equations: Applications and Theory

Abstract

0104337 Carlson

This award supports U.S. participants (primarily young researchers and graduate
students) in the Workshop on Soliton Equations: Applications and Theory, held at
the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs, on August 10-12, 2001. The
workshop involves interdisciplinary examination of soliton equations by experts
in both theory and applications. Nonlinear problems of optical communications
are emphasized, particularly the use of the nonlinear Schroedinger equation and
its variants for the modeling and design of long distance fiber optic
communication systems. Additional applied topics include the appearance of
solitons in other optical problems, magnetic thin films, and Bose-Einstein
condensates. Theoretical topics include extensions of inverse scattering and
inverse spectral theory to Schroedinger or Dirac type operators, new methods of
analyzing Riemann-Hilbert problems, connections of soliton equations with
geometry, and new insights into meromorphic or real analytic solutions of
soliton equations.

Since the initial discoveries relating the Korteweg - de Vries equation to the
scattering transform, soliton equations have provided a veritable fountain of
physical and mathematical surprises. This workshop offers researchers in this
field a chance to exchange new results and new problems, and it provides young
researchers with an overview of the field. The workshop aims at
interdisciplinary presentation, with a healthy mix of successful applications of
the ideas to physical problems, computational studies which can illuminate
applications and suggest new theoretical issues, and new theoretical results.
