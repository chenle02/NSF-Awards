This project will conduct laboratory experiments on the dynamics of
hydrothermal plumes. The focus will be on the meso-scale flow, where rotation
and geostrophic adjustment are important. The first experiment will examine the
effects of rotation on the rise height of plumes. The second will study the
effects of ambient flows on plume vortex generation. The third will examine the
effects of rotation on the dynamics in instantaneous releases of finite volumes
of buoyant fluid to simulate megaplume formation. The overall goal is to improve
knowledge of the dynamics of hydrothermal venting and to help in the
interpretation and understanding of observations of the local vent field
ecology, chemical and heat fluxes, as well as deep ocean circulation.
