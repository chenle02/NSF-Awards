This award is to assist approximately 15 US-based graduate students to attend
the 16th USENIX Conference on File and Storage Technologies (FAST 2018) in
Oakland, CA. Participation in FAST 2018 and similar conferences is a valuable
and important part of the graduate school experience. It provides students with
the opportunity to interact with more senior researchers, and exposes students
to leading work and practical industry practices in this important area of
research.

Past grant recipients have gone on to run their own research labs and organize
conferences including FAST, and the long-term merits of this program?s impact on
storage research is well established.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
