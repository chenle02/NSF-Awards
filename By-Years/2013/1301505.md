In this award, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms
(CSDM-A) Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Jianhua Ren of the
University of the Pacific and her graduate and undergraduate research students
are investigating the conformational effects on the gas-phase acidities of
important biopolymers. Specifically, Prof. Ren and her group will: (1) Construct
quantitative correlations between the gas-phase acidities and the conformations
of a large number of peptides, including peptides containing unnatural amino
acids; (2) investigate the effects on the gas-phase acidities of peptides
containing D-amino acids; and (3) examine the helix conformational effects on
the gas-phase acidities of peptoid polymers. Prof. Ren and her researchers will
carry out these studies using a variety of mass-spectrometry
methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ultimate goal of the work by Professor Ren and
her group is to develop better models for understanding the acid-base properties
of proteins. The acid-base properties of proteins have a profound impact on the
reactivity of proteins (enzymes), and the overall acidity of peptide groups in a
protein are influenced by a myriad of subtle electrostatic effects. Dr. Ren is
trying to unravel the relative contributions of these subtle effects. Along the
way, Prof. Ren will train a very large number of undergraduate and graduate (MS)
student researchers in the important area of biological mass spectrometry, after
which they will enter the technological and medical workforce.
