Recent work in syntax and semantics has yielded dramatic developments in the
depth and cross-linguistic breadth of our understanding of the role of topic and
focus in language. At the same time, there has been increased interest among
phoneticians and phonologists in the cross-linguistic study of intonation. One
area of intonation which has proven to be a rich yet relatively understudied
area of research is focus and topic. Studies of various languages have indicated
that utterances involving a focused or topicalized element are typically
associated with intonational properties different from utterances without any
focused or topicalized elements, e.g. increased pitch range, specialized tonal
configurations, different durational characteristics. These studies suggest a
close link between differences in prosody and the kinds of differences in
meaning associated with various kinds of topicalization and focus.

Nevertheless despite recent advances in the study of intonational properties of
topic and focus, there is ample room for further advancing our cross-linguistic
knowledge of the interaction between the phonetics and phonology of intonation
and the syntax and semantics of topicalization and focus. In particular,
increased interaction between syntacticians, semanticists, phonologists and
phoneticians promises to yield important progress in the study of intonational
correlates of the meanings associated with topicalization and focus.

A workshop on Topic, Focus and Intonation will be held at the 2001 Linguistic
Society of America Summer Institute in Santa Barbara, CA. In this workshop, we
hope to explore further the effects of various kinds of topicalization and focus
on intonation. It is especially hoped that the workshop will lay the groundwork
for future collaborative efforts between linguists devoted to the study meaning
and linguistics engaged in the quantitative study of intonation. Both
descriptive and theoretical papers on any aspects of the relationship between
intonation, on the one hand, and topic and/or focus, on the other hand, are
welcome. Papers may deal with intonational aspects of topic and/or focus in any
language, whether relatively well-studied or relatively underdocumented.
