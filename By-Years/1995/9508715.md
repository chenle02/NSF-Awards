9508715 Smith This research will investigate evolutionary and ecological
response of woodrats to climatic change since the last glacial maxima. Species-
specific primers for woodrat ancient DNA will be developed with the goal of
reconstructing population genetic fluctuations during interglacial/glacial
events. %%% This research in its examination of genetic variation in ancient
woodrat populations will provide the necessary framework to examine the
stability of habitats over time, determination of critical thresholds for
species replacement, and the comparative genetics of populations at the
periphery versus the center of their geographic range. ***
