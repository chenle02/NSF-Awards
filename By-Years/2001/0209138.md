This research addresses an important set of questions arising&lt;br/&gt;in
optimization of industrial systems for network design,&lt;br/&gt;data
classification, facility location, and scheduling.&lt;br/&gt;A fundamental
problem arising in all these areas is called&lt;br/&gt;set covering. Set
covering problems range from easy to very&lt;br/&gt;difficult and it is the more
difficult ones that form the focus&lt;br/&gt;of this research. The problems
studied are approached through&lt;br/&gt;rigorous and mathematical
methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research studies several approaches to the
design of&lt;br/&gt;algorithms for set covering problems arising in the areas
of&lt;br/&gt;network design, facility location and data classification,
mostly&lt;br/&gt;based on mathematical programming techniques. The
focus&lt;br/&gt;is on the study of complexity and approximability of set
covering&lt;br/&gt;and its extensions in network design and classification,
including the&lt;br/&gt;design of general algorithmic techniques and the
analysis of&lt;br/&gt;mathematical programming formulations and relaxations. A
special&lt;br/&gt;emphasis is made on set covering problems defined on
directed&lt;br/&gt;graphs, which is an area where very few results are available
in&lt;br/&gt;the literature.&lt;br/&gt;
