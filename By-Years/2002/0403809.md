PROPOSAL NO: 0403809&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION: MIT&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL
INVESTIGATOR: Cory , David&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: NER: Hydrogen in Carbon Nanotubes -
NMR and Multiscale
Simulations&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;The properties
of complex material systems such as nanoscale structures are determined by the
physical and chemical interactions among its constituent elements, both at the
microscopic and mesoscopic scales. This project uses a unique combination of
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments and theory to elucidate the
properties of a particular nanoscale system - hydrogen gas stored within carbon
nanotubes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Carbon nanotubes have emerged as an important
candidate technology for hydrogen storage in fuel calls. Understanding how the
hydrogen interacts locally with the carbon framework - in essence achieving an
atomic level insight into this process - would be very useful in furthering this
technology. This study combines detailed NMR experiments designed to probe how
the hydrogen and the carbon interact on the surfaces of the nanotube, with
computer modelling at the atomic level, to correlate how the bulk properties of
the hydrogen - carbon nanotube system are determined by the interactions between
the two at the microscopic level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
