This planning planing grant will lead to a proposal from a coalition of five
independent public school districts in northern Maine. The sparse population,
diversity of the districts, and economic impact of a closing military base have
caused the districts to investigate new ways of providing for the post-
baccalaureate education of their teachers and, consequently, to improve the
science and mathematics education of their students. The districts have data to
show that of the students who graduate from their schools, few go to college and
those that do tend not to concentrate in science or mathematics. The PI's feel
that if the teachers are better prepared and the system is better able to
respond to the teachers needs, the students will become better educated and more
enthusiastic. The five step planning grant includes a series of conferences in
the Fall followed by a week-long Summer institute where detailed plans will be
specified. The written plan (Step 4) will lead to a formal grant proposal (Step
5) for establishing a long-term self-supporting teacher education program in the
region.
