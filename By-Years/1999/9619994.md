This award provides funds for an REU Site in program in Psychology to be
coordinated by Saint Louis University. The aim of the project is to provide
research experience opportunities for selected African-American undergraduate
students in five participating institutions (including Clark-Atlanta, Morehouse,
Morris Brown, and Spelman. The program involves identification of students in
the sophomore year, preparation of research plans during the junior year, an
intensive research experience during the following summer, and completion of
program activities in the senior year. Research will be supervised
electronically and through faculty exchanges that typically will involve visits
of 3-4 days to plan cooperative research projects and help students prepare for
their summer activities. In addition to involvement in research during the
summer, students also will take a one-credit ethics course, present their
research at a local conference, and participate in two workshops, one on the
Graduate Record Exam and the other on careers in psychological science. In the
senior year, projects will be submitted for presentation and publication, and
students will be assisted with their graduate school applications. This award
contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract talented students
into careers in science through active undergraduate research experiences.
