Nickel is known to be at the active site of four distinct types of metalloenzyes
urease, hydrogenase, methyl-coenzyme M reductase and carbon monoxide
oxidoreductase. How and why nature uses nickel to catalyze such widely different
reactions as the hydrolysis of urea, the oxidation of H2, the reductive
desulfurization of methyl thioether, and the interconversion of CO and CO2 are
fascinating questions. However, at present the coordination environment and role
of nickel in the catalytic mechanisms are not well characterized in any of these
enzymes. The objectives of this research proposal are the characterization of
the structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of the Ni centers at the
active sites of hydrogenase, urease, methyl coenzyme-M reductase, and Ni-
substituted Zn enzymes such as liver alcohol dehydrogenase, carboxypeptidase and
carbonic anhydrase. The approach is spectroscopic involving the combination of
absorption, variable- temperature magnetic and natural circular dichroism,
resonance Raman and electron paramagnetic resonance studies of the
metalloenzymes, together with parallel investigations of well- characterized Ni-
substituted proteins and appropriate synthetic complexes.//
