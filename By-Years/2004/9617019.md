This project connects Wallace Community College in Selma AL to the Internet
over a T1 (1.544 million bits per second) line. Faculty and students at the
school benefit from access to the resources of the Internet, including libraries
and supercomputers. In addition, they are able to communicate and collaborate
with colleagues at other institutions in pursuit of research and educational
projects. The award provides partial support of the project for two years.
