In this project, the Scripps Satellite Oceanography Center will re-archive AVHRR
data from the west coast time series from magnetic tape to magneto-optical
discs, in order to prevent loss of the data to the community due to aging of
magnetic tape. In addition, a user-friendly online browse system and automated
ordering system will be installed.
