Princeton University Press is publishing The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein
in their original languages, which for the most part is German. As English
supplants German as the most common language of science, the papers become
increasingly inaccessible to most readers. This grant supports the direct costs
of translating the papers to ready them for publication in a series of large-
format paperback volumes.
