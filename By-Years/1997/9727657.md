David Beratan is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program to study response properties of biomolecules including
electron transfer reactions and Raman spectroscopic probes of chirality. The
goal of the proposed work is to develop a general new tool that will enable the
theoretical exploration of biochemical structure-function and reactivity
relations by exploiting the local nature of chemical interactions. An ab initio
divide-and-conquer method is proposed, tailored to describe the electronic and
vibronic response properties of macromolecules. The methods will be developed in
such a way that they can be used to: 1) establish a link between 3D structure
and electron transfer rates in proteins and DNA; 2) assist in relating molecular
structure to chiroptical properties critical for drug discovery and protein
structure determination, and 3) expand the structure-property interpretations of
proteins available via Raman spectroscopy. The actual implementation of this
strategy involves the use of an effective Hamiltonian, and Greens function
theory to determine the relevant response function. A quantitative molecular-
level description of biological function will arise from a detailed description
of macromolecular electronic and vibronic structure. Yet, reliable electronic
structure calculations are possible on systems of only modest size. Beratan's
research program will enable the theoretical exploration of biochemical
structure-function and reactivity relations at the molecular level for
macromolecular systems of biological interest.
