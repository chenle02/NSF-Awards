The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the
learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM)
by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative
resources, models and tools (RMTs). Projects in the DRK-12 program build on
fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development
efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed
projects. One significant challenge facing elementary STEM education is the
varied preparation of English-language learners. The project addresses this with
an innovative use of engineering curriculum to build on the English-language
learners' prior experiences. The project will support teachers' learning about
strategies for teaching English-language learners and using engineering design
tasks as learning opportunities for mathematics, science and communication
skills. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project's cross-disciplinary approach is
grounded in both inquiry-based science education research and bilingual
cognition research. These complementary foci bridge research areas to highlight
how engineering experiences for students can capitalize on bilingual students'
experiences as problem solvers. The project will develop teachers' ability and
instructional efficacy for both STEM and bilingual student instruction. The
project adapts a previously developed curriculum for engineering education by
adding resources and tools to support bilingual students. The research design
primarily measures teacher-level phenomenon such as implementation of
instructional strategies, STEM self-efficacy and ability to address the academic
development of bilingual students through engineering design activities. Data
collected include classroom observations, teacher surveys, focus groups, and
teacher interviews. Student assessments will be piloted in the final year of the
project.
