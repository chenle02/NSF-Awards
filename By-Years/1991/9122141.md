A study of the synthesis and reactivity of highly strained allenes will be
conducted. The proposed investigation will include studies of cumulene
photochemistry, asymmetric photochemical processes, photogeneration of carbenes,
and photoinduced reactions to give highly strained allenes. A major objective is
to develop general synthetic methods for the generation of strained dienes and
trienes. The identity and reactivity of the highly strained intermediates will
be detected by use of matrix isolation methods and transient spectroscopy. In
addition, attempts to make high molecular weight cyclic-type polymers will be
conducted via pathways involving strained intermediates. %%% This grant from the
Organic dynamics Program supports the work of Professor Richard P. Johnson at
the University of New Hampshire. These investigations will be aimed at the
synthesis of highly strained organic molecules that are expected to undergo a
variety of quite unusual reactions. By the development of general methods for
the synthesis of such species, it should be possible to produce a variety of
compounds which are currenty impossible to generate by any other process. The
highly reactive strained ring species live for only very short periods of time
and therefore specialized techniques are required to prove their existence.
