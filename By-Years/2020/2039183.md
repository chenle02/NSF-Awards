Representation theory originated as the mathematical study of algebraic objects
that arise from the study of of physical and probabilistic systems. Quantum
groups are a large class of such objects that encapsulate the structure of
certain highly symmetric models in statistical mechanics. Though the origins of
quantum groups are in statistical physics, their underlying structures appear
also in probability theory, string theory, and combinatorics. This project will
apply the theory of quantum groups to study solutions of differential equations
that appear in certain physical models known as quantum integrable systems and
probabilistic models of random matrices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In more detail,
the project focuses on quantum affine algebras and q-KZB systems, Macdonald
theory and its affine generalizations, and integrable random matrix models. In
previous work, the investigator related traces of intertwiners of quantum affine
algebras to certain theta hypergeometric integrals and proposed so-called affine
Macdonald conjectures. The first part of the project will use a representation-
theoretic approach to prove these and related conjectures. The second part of
the project studies Whittaker and Macdonald-Koornwinder functions from the
perspective of finite-type quantum groups. The third part of the project applies
methods motivated by quantum integrable systems to the asymptotic study of
eigenvalues of certain sample covariance matrices arising in statistics.
