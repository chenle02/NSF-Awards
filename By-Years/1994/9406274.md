9406274 Segall This award provides partial funding (61%) necessary to acquire a
computer system upgrade consisting of six workstations and associated peripheral
hardware to be installed in the Department of Geophysics at Stanford University.
The University is committed to providing the remaining funds necessary to
acquire the equipment. The computing system is to be used by the PI, colleagues
and students in computationally intensive research in earthquake seismology,
crustal deformation, in situ stress measurements in boreholes, tectonics, and
fault mechanics. ***
