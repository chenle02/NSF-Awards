An NSF-CBMS Regional Conference on Wavelet Analysis as a Tool for Computational
and Harmonic Analysis will be held at the Department of Mathematics, University
of Central Florida on May 2-8, 1998. Professor Ronald Coifman, Professor of
Mathematics at Yale University, will serve as Principal Lecturer of the
conference. The organizing committee will consist of mathematicians and
scientists drawn from the Departments of Mathematics, Electrical and Computer
Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Aerospace sciences, the Center for
research in Electro-Optics and Lasers, and the Institute for Simulation and
Training at the University of Central Florida, as well as outside experts from
academic and industrial institutions. The general area of the conference's
endeavor is of great topical interest and has seen as explosive expansion of
activity in the last ten years, both in theoretical aspects and in applications
of the mathematical theory to problems in computer science, electrical
engineering, mechanical and chemical engineering, biomedical engineering and
their related areas. Despite the intense activity over the past decade, there
are still numerous outstanding issues, many of which are only now coming within
the ambit of modern computational techniques. Coifman, who is a consummate
lecturer and a major contributor to the area, has a very broad view of the
subject matter, from the mathematical analysis to the numerical and
computational work and even the engineering and industrial aspects. He is
currently leading a research program to develop new wavelet based mathematical
tools for future extraction recognition and denoising. His lectures will serve
to survey and unify major developments in the field, assessing both achievements
and unsolved problems. Professor Coifman is an obvious choice to lead a
gathering of experts in this area.
