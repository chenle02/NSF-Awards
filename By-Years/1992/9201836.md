This award provides continued support for the operation of the National
Drosophila Species Resource Center (NDSRC) at Bowling Green State University.
The NDSRC collects and maintains a collection of living culture of 260
Drosophila species. The center serves a broad area of biological research
community by supplying properly identified cultures of Drosophila species, and
providing information and technical assistance. The Center also provides limited
research facilities to scientists interested in working with the collection on
site. Current users of the Center include scientists in the areas of
developmental biology, cellular and molecular biology, evolutionary biology and
systematics. In addition, the Center collection is often used for teaching
purposes both at the college undergraduate and high school levels.
