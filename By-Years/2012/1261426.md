This award supports a specialty conference entitled "Community Workshop on Radar
Technology" to be held from 27 to 29 November 2012 in Boulder, Colorado. The
primary objective of this meeting is to bring together scientists from
universities, federal agencies and industry to examine the types of radar
currently in use in the atmospheric sciences and to review emerging radar
technologies. Through oral and poster presentations and in breakout sessions,
attendees will describe key atmospheric science research questions that can be
addressed with radar technologies and will identify future technological
needs.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this project include an
assessment of the current and emerging radar technologies and establishing
priorities for their application to scientific issues and questions. A summary
of the meeting outcomes will be published in the Bulletin of the American
Meteorological Society, which will broaden the reach of the workshop to include
thousands of students, researchers and practicing meteorologists.
