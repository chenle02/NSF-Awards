Grasping in the pigeon is a stereotyped, morphologically unambiguous visuomotor
behavior involving a functional relationship between quantifiable stimuli and
response variables (jaw opening amplitude/target size). It may be readily
elicited and measured under controlled conditions, is modulated by motivational
states and is influenced by experiential factors. The behavior serves a
prehensile function but is also a component of the pigeon's ingestive behavior.
Grasping in this species approximates the complexity of primate grasping but is
mediated by a much simpler effector system (the jaw), involves movements
confined to a single plane and produced by a small number of muscles. The jaw
movement system is amenable to experiments involving the correlated recording of
movement and neural activity in awake behaving animals or Philip Zeigler will
examine neural activity in jaw muscles during grasping, develop a procedure for
eliciting the behavior in the immobilized pigeon and utilize this preparation
for studies of motoneuron activity during jaw movement. This work is important
because the pigeon gives us a model system from which we can study motor control
and fine movement even at the cellular level.
