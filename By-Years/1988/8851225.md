The objectives of the molecular biology research laboratory for undergraduate
women in science are: (1) to establish a state-of-the- art research laboratory
in molecular biology to prepare women for biomedical careers and/or graduate
research; (2) to strengthen the College's existing research internship program
by establishing an on- campus lab equipped to permit more sophisticated student
research and independent study; and (3) to foster a "partners in scholarship"
atmosphere for faculty and students in the Biology Department. The acquisition
of the electrophoresis apparatus, centrifuges, a spectrophotometer, and support
instrumentation (incubators, sterilizer, orbital shaker) are modernizing the
laboratory for student research in molecular biology. This lab enables students
to learn the latest techniques employed in studying the molecular biology of
proteins and nucleic acids, and then permits them to apply these techniques by
designing and carrying out an independent research project. Research projects
culminate in a seminar presented to the Missouri Academy of Science and a
research manuscript. Some of the latter have proved to be suitable for
publication. The grantee institution is matching the NSF award with an equal sum
obtained from non-Federal sources.
