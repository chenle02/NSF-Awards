A laboratory is being developed to enable large numbers of students to make use
of The Calculus Companion, which is a computerized system allowing the symbolic
algebra Maple to be accessible to first-year calculus students. This interface
makes complex computations available by the use of pull-down menus in the spirit
of Macintosh. Classroom laboratories have been developed which integrate the
system into the curriculum. These laboratories lead the student step-by-step
through the solution of a problem. Many of them reflect a reform in calculus by
presenting interesting and challenging problems. Others follow along the
syllabus of a more standard calculus curriculum. Both utilize the Calculus
Companion's advanced features.
