This dissertation compares the process of racial identification among first
generation Dominican and Puerto Rican immigrants in New York with racial
identification among these groups in their countries of origin. Latin Americans
tend to see race as a continuum with many more categories than are accepted in
the United States. For immigrants from these racially heterogeneous countries,
racial identification should be affected by cultural contexts in both the U.S.
and their countries of origin. In depth interviews will ask about attitudes
toward race, the perceptions of how their group is viewed by others, and the
respondents' systems of racial classification. Changes in racial identification
because of immigration should be related to the respondents' social networks and
economic outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
