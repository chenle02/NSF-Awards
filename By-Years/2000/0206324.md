The long-running and highly successful National Public Radio series "Science
Friday" is venturing in new directions. Given that basic research underlies all
of the technological advances influencing our world and that tax dollars pay for
that research, the public needs to be informed about the basics of research. To
address this need for public education, "Science Friday" will examine the
importance of research as a theme underlying all science and technology changes
by:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finding the research roots at the bottom of each
story;&lt;br/&gt;Exploring the cooperation among corporations, private
institutions, and research foundations and illuminating how each plays a role in
the research process;&lt;br/&gt;Following the research "bumps" along the road to
illustrate that research success depends upon failures -- not all research
produces positive results; &lt;br/&gt;Illuminating the barriers to successful
research;&lt;br/&gt;Helping listeners understand the thought process of
researchers;&lt;br/&gt;Scaling the "ivory tower" by enabling listeners to
question and talk directly with researchers; and &lt;br/&gt;Helping listeners
understand the role of basic research in policy-making.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ira
Flatow, the host, will take "Science Friday" on the road and produce programs in
Oklahoma, Iowa, Michigan, Massachusetts, Arizona and other locations. He also
will visit schools and universities and will speak at public events. NPR also
will reactivate the "Science Friday Kids Connection" which will take each week's
program and its guest scientists directly into classrooms across the
country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
