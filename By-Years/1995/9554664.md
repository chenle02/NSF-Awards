A three-year project is proposed to train faculty in the integration of new
teaching techniques that utilize interactive methods, personal computers, and
miltimedia. Faculty will also be educated as to the student needs resulting from
the recent growth in diversity in the student population. Thirty participants
will be selected from two and four-year colleges within the New York
metropolitan area. These institutions include Long Island University,
Kingsborough Community College, St. Francis College, Pace University, and New
York City Technical College among others. Participants will be required to
submit a plan for dissemination as a condition for acceptance into the project.
The options under this plan are: present the results of the utilization of the
teaching methods learned at the workshops at one of six dissemination seminars
conducted during the last two years of the project; present techniques learned
from the activities of the project to faculty at the participants' home
institutions; mentor two faculty members at the participants' home
instititutions in the teaching techniques learned from the project. The
workshops and dissemination seminars will be subject to formative and summative
evaluation procedures.
