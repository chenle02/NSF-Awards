This is a travel request to attend the 5th World Filtration Congress in Nice,
France. Originated and organized in Paris by the French Filtration Society in
1974, the First Congress was a success in identifying the processing and
technology problems of that period associated with filtration. Since then three
other Congresses have been held, in London in 1979, in Dowington, PA (USA), in
1982, and in Ostend (Belgium), in 1986. The major theme of the 5th Congress is
separation by filtration, giving due attention to the increasingly significant
role of membranes. Emphasis is on the adaptation of processes to market
requirements, energy savings, and quality of life.
