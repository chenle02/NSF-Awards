The hydrofracturing method of in situ stress measurement has evolved in the
last fifteen eyars into an indispensable tool in geophysical research. For
example, a major objective of the first deep scientific drilling in the U.S. at
Cajon Pass, California, is to measure the state of stress, primarily by
hydrofracturing, in the vicinity of the San Andreas fault. Depsite the general
reliability of hydrofracturing, uncertainties in its interpretation still exist
and cases where the method is only partially successful or totally unsuccessful
are now surfacing. There are at least three major sources of diffi- culties in
hydrofracturing data interpretaion: (1) reading the correct pessures from field
records, (2) using the correct model for calculating the in situ stresses and
(3) evaluating the effect of preexisting fractures on hydrofrac pressures and
directions. The research is an attempt to resolve some of these difficulties
through laboratory testing and data analysis. In addition, experimental
verification of suggested innovative improvements of the method will be carried
out. Such confir- mation of one or more of these alternate techniques would
enable their use in either complementing orreplacing conventional
hydrofracturing.
