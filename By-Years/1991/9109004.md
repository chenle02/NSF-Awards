A unique experimental apparatus will be constructed, capable of preparing, by
vapor deposition, thin-film alloys from 4K up to 1100K and permitting
measurement of thermodynamic and transport properties of these samples in situ
from 1k to 1100K. %%% Many of the more interesting magnetic-alloy materials are
both highly reactive in air and, too, only available in thin-film form. With the
proposed apparatus, it will become possible to measure thermal properties of
such materials and furnish a test of current theory.
