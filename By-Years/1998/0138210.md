The main thrust of the research is the further development of methods to
calculate QED corrections to energy levels and g-factors of loosely bound
systems. Nonrelativistic quantum electrodynamics is applied to the Lamb shift in
H, hyperfine splitting of muonium, Lamb shift in muonic H and the bound
electrong g-factor
