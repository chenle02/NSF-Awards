This proposal for a Research Planning Grant expands previous research on safety-
monitoring systems in the air traffic sector to other sectors. The main purpose
of the planning grant is to conduct preliminary research to determine which
monitoring systems will be studied in depth as part of the planned research
project. The research will examine the ways organizations collect information
about and learn from near accidents. During the planning period, the principal
investigator will examine archival data and conduct interviews. Research sites
include systems for monitoring medical instruments, the production of nuclear
energy, and the coordination of telephone operations. The proposed research will
contribute to the study of information acquisition and processing in
organizations, as well as to analysis of organizational learning.
