A calculus curriculum is being developed that uses the computer algebra system
MAPLE in conjunction with writing assignments that are designed to promote
student learning. The courses will be organized in diagnostic learning units and
will require students to keep a journal, which will be evaluated regularly by
the instructor. This system of ongoing feedback between student and teacher will
enhance self- evaluation on the part of the student.
