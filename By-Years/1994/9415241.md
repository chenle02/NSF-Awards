This project involves the dissertation research of a student of cultural
anthropology from the University of Michigan. The project will study a pastoral
people in Tanzania, East Africa. The question to be asked is how global
processes of capitalist market change have changed the local rural economies,
specifically in the evolution of cattle-raiding. The student will test the
hypothesis that closer connections with the national state and regional markets
have expanded the scope of cattle raiding. Using ethnographic methods of
intensive interviews and observation in two rural villages as well as the study
of local and regional archives and documents, the project will analyze how the
increased commodity value of cattle has affected their importance in ceremonial
and prestige activities in these societies. This research is important because
in addition to expanding our expertise in this important regional of the world,
the study will illuminate the process by which the international capitalist
market expands into local-scale traditional areas, transforming local practices
into larger-scale commercial practices.
