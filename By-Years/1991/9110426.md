This Phase II proposal addresses research on III-V semiconductor materials grown
heteroepitaxially on silicon (Si). The feasibility of the proposed approach was
demonstrated in Phase I (Award No. ISI-8861448, during which Kopin evaluated
lasers formed in GaAs grown heteroepitaxially on Si by organometallic chemical
vapor deposition. Although the approach was found feasible, the Phase I work
also demonstrated the need for further reduction in the defect density of the
heteroepitaxial GaAs films; thus, the objective of the proposed Phase II
research is the attainment of an improved understanding of growth mechanisms
that can be applied to reduce the deleterious effects of dislocations arising
from the lattice mismatch. To more fully address the fundamental aspects of this
research problem, we propose a collaborative program involving the University of
Florida. By with a high h level of characterization effort, we will develop an
improved understanding of the materials and growth processes, leading ultimately
to defect densities on the order of 104 cm -2.
