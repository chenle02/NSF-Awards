The central nervous system (CNS) is a structure of immense complexity and
intricacy, whose overall architecture has been conserved throughout vertebrate
evolution. The molecular and cellular mechanisms by which the three-dimensional
(3D) structure of the CNS is generated during development are not well
understood. One of the earliest steps in brain assembly occurs during
neurulation, the coordinated movement of cells to form the neural tube, which
will give rise to the brain and spinal cord. The Jontes lab has identified an
evolutionarily conserved molecule, Protocadherin-19 (Pcdh19), that plays an
important role in neurulation. Loss of Pcdh19 function inhibits cell movements
that contribute to neurulation, resulting in abnormal brain morphology. The
goals of this research are to understand how Pcdh19 regulates cell behavior
during neurulation, and the molecular pathways through which Pcdh19 functions.
To do this, the Jontes lab uses quantitative in vivo time-lapse microscopy to
follow the 3D movements of cells in the developing zebrafish embryo. The results
of this research will advance our understanding of the mechanisms of early brain
development. The broader scientific and educational goals of this work are to
provide a training environment in which students at different levels,
particularly those from under-represented groups, will be exposed to
sophisticated imaging techniques and quantitative image analysis. In addition,
the imaging data that will result from this work will be of high educational
value and will be made easily accessible to researchers and teachers.
