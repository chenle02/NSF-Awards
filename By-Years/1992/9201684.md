This is a renewal grant jointly funded by the Divisions of Materials Research
and Chemistry. The theoretical project focuses on the role of disorder on the
transport and spin properties of granular metals and conducting polymers. The
work on granular metals represents a new thrust to this ongoing project.
Impurity band and scaling arguments are proposed to explain the experimentally
observed conductivity in granular metals. It is shown how the impurity band
model for granular metals can be applied to conducting polymer polyaniline. In
addition, an interacting electron model is used to explain the magnetic
properties of polyaniline. Studies will be conducted on polyacetylene and the
role of structural disorder on the insulator- metal transition. Finally, a study
of the crossover from two- to one-dimensional dynamics in the polymer poly-
pyrolle perchlorate will be undertaken. %%% In real materials disorder manifests
itself through impurities or the misplacement of atoms or molecules in an
otherwise perfect crystal or chemical structure. This disorder can have profound
effects on the properties of materials. The understanding of various types of
disorder and its influence on materials represents a major challenge to
materials scientists. The proposed research will study a novel approach to the
effects of disorder on two types of systems: conducting polymers and granular
metals. Both of these materials have important applications and pose formidable
theoretical difficulties.
