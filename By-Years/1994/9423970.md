9423970 Kay The International Junior Investigator and Postdoctoral Fellows
Program enables U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four
months of research abroad. The program's awards provide opportunities for joint
research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and
experimental conditions abroad. This award will support a six-month postdoctoral
research visit by Dr. Laura E. Kay to work with Associate Professor Antonio
Mario Magalhaes at the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil. This project will
involve the development of a collaboration for establishing the technique of
spectropolarimetry at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO) in La
Serena, Chile. Dr. Kay will test polarimetry optics on the spectrograph at the
4m telescope at CTIO. She will also visit the Instituto Astronomico e Geofisico
(IAG) in Brazil to analyze data and explore modifications of the CTIO
spectrograph that will increase its usefulness. In addition, Dr. Kay's visit
will serve to strengthen the Gemini partnership involving Brazil and Chile. ***
