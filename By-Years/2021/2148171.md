Climate change impacts are becoming increasingly common, severe, and complex.
Multiple climate disasters (droughts, floods, extreme heat) may occur
simultaneously or in succession, and interact with non-climate factors (COVID-19
pandemic, land management legislation), compounding the overall impacts and
leading to increased vulnerability of social-ecological systems. While the
potential impact of compound disasters is recognized, little is known about how
societies experiencing them respond and build resilience. Thus, this project
aims to understand the response to and impact of compound disasters within
pastoral systems. Such understanding is directly relevant to climate change
adaptation and efforts to reduce disaster risk and build resilience in the face
of compound disasters. In pursuing these aims, the project will train students,
including at a minority serving institution, and more generally enhance the
capacity for environmental science in undeserved scientific
communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This interdisciplinary project brings together
senior and junior faculty, who have decades of experience working in pastoral
contexts, to ask research questions focused on (1) the impacts of compound
disasters on pastoral systems with different land management systems, (2)
understanding objective and subjective resilience to compound disasters, and (3)
the impacts on the social institutions that are critical to a societyâ€™s ability
to respond, cope, and recover. Interviews, surveys, and participatory research
approaches will provide the data needed to understand how responses of
households and communities to one extreme event affects their ability to respond
to subsequent or concurrent events. This study is unique in marshaling both
objective and subjective measures of resilience in understanding the capacity of
both individuals and societies to respond to compound disasters, thereby
transforming the growing interdisciplinary study of resilience of those most
affected by natural hazards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
