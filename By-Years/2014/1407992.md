The research addresses the basic understanding and optimization of various types
of III-Nitride power switches such as SuperJunction structures with immediate
environmental impact. This work has important applications in smart power grids,
transportation systems, and electric drives for small and large vehicles. The PI
plans to integrate his research in a power electronics curriculum that will
address novel power devices with new functionalities. The research will provide
a very strong educational platform to train graduate students in a frontier
research topic, with active collaborative industrial participation. The outreach
activities to high-school and undergraduate students include the Boston
University High School Honors Research Internship and UROP programs.

The PI proposes to conduct a systematic approach for designing and optimizing
III-Nitride based power switching devices by addressing fundamental theoretical
aspects related to material properties and device structures. The
characteristics of vertical devices made with such materials and operating at
high-voltage and high-current will be addressed, allowing at the same time
higher frequency of operation compared with traditionally used devices and thus
significant system size reduction. The PI proposes to address the challenges
faced by the need for switching voltages in excess of 5KV and hundreds of
amperes at one hundred kilohertz or faster by addressing the fundamental
theoretical aspects related to the III-Nitride material properties and device
structures and developing transformative vertical device structures such as GaN-
MOS and vertical enhancement mode HFETs. The results obtained from the studies
will be validated using experimental data obtained through collaboration with
laboratories specializing in this area. The research is well conceived and would
deepen fundamental understanding of the physics of III-Nitride MOS devices and
impact of defects and dislocations, as well as channel transport.
