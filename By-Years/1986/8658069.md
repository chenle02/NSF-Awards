Dr. Kier plans to continue his morphological and biomechanical analyses of the
skeletal and muscular systems in animals that lack typical bony endoskeleton of
vertebrates (fish, birds, and mammals) or hard exoskeletons of crabs and
insects. These organisms use an intricate combination of muscles that work
against each other or against hydrostatic pressure of fluid in the body cavity
to produce rigidity. Mammals (including man) utilize similar elements for
movement and use of the tongue, the trunk of the elephant, and erection of the
penis and the nipples, etc. Dr. Kier plans to focus most of his studies on the
musculature in the highly mobile and exquisitely controlled squid and cattlefish
tentacles which will have practical applications in the design of prosthesis and
in the area of robotics. More importrant, these results will provide insight to
the organizations of these systems and shed light on the behavioral and neural
mechanisms that control their operations.
