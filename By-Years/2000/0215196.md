This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to study the
feasibility of a phytoremediation process to remove lead, a model metal, from
the soil. The approach is to increase the efficiency of chelate-assisted
phytoremediation of environmental contaminants by using transgenic technology to
provide plants with the ability to exude significant amounts of a specific
chelating agent from their roots. Isolated from the DNA of the organism
pseudomonas stutzeri, this chelating agent, pyridine-2,6-bis (thiocarboxylic
acid) (ptdc), has the ability to degrade carbon tetrachloride and to attain high
stability constants for most heavy metals, thereby assisting preferential plant
uptake of these metals into harvestable leaves and stems. In this Phase I
project, the pdtc transgene will be placed under the control of plant promoters
to overexpress the gene in roots. ptdc excretion will be explored in two model
plants, tobacco and canola.

The commercial application of this project is in the area of environmental
phytoremediation.
