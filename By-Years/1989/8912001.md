The PI of this proposal will collaborate with Alan Guth of MIT to examine and
test the model of the universe presented by Blau, Guendelman, and Guth (known as
the BGG model). The effect on the spacetime manifold and the dynamics of the
false vacuum bubble was ignored in the BGG model. The PI proposes to develop a
scheme for the modification of the BGG model in the presence of radiation. In
time, the PI would like to construct a consistent generalization of the BGG
model which will give new insights into the structure and development of the
very early universe.
