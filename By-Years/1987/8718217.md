The Information Sciences Institute (ISI) of the University of Southern
California using its extensive experience with computer communication protocols
and software, propose to continue their efforts in aiding the foundation's
efforts to provide a reliable and robust research network for scientists and
engineers, NSFNET. ISI proposes to do work in two areas: The first area is
protocol engineering. The particular requirements of the NSFnet user community
as well as the general need to resolve outstanding difficulties in the Internet
architecture will require the design, testing, and standardization of new
protocols, modifications to existing protocols, and further documentation and
clarification of the underlying Internet architecture. Examples of protocols
which need protocol engineering work for NSFnet include: routing protocols,
gateway monitoring protocols, network file protocols, transaction protocols, and
remote job entry protocols. Within budgetary limitations, ISI proposes to
perform protocols engineering in the first two of these areas. In addition, ISI
proposes to continue documentation and standardization of protocols and
architecture. The second area encompasses technical planning and coordination
activities which are directly relevant to NSFnet development. These activities
include participation on key technical planning bodies for NSFnet and for the
general Internet, as well as direct advice to NSF.
