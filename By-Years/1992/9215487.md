Under a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER), an experiment will be
conducted to examine the acoustic characteristics of a large and complex
numerical data set. The intent is to explore acoustic rather than visual post-
processing of certain numerical simulations. These simulations model
compressible turbulent shear layers at both high and low Mach numbers. Data will
be fed into a sound system and listened to. It is expected that differences in
organized vortex structures and instability modes will led to identifiable
acoustic signatures. The mixing properties of compressible shear layers are
important for high speed propulsion systems. The novel diagnostic system may
also lead to widely applicable new methods for the post-processing of complex
data bases.
