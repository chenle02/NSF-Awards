This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project shall develop a
computational sensor array for 2D real-time acquisition and tracking of moving
objects. The Phase I prototype system is implemented in CMOS VLSI and consists
of a foveated, spatially variant array of photoreceptors (retina) with resistive
coupling for contrast (edge) detection, circuits for the measurement of local,
directional motion velocity in the foveal array and circuits for the acquisition
and tracking of a moving object boundary. The velocity signal generated in the
fovea is independent of illumination and contrast. The sensor is fitted with
appropriate optics and mounted on an electromechanical positioning assembly
which in tracking mode sets the relative velocity of the target and retina to
zero. The acquisition signal codes the location of temporal changes of contrast
in the periphery and serves to position the retina such that the moving feature
is projected on the fovea. The retina and the ancillary circuits are placed on a
single chip and the entire system, including the positioning mechanism, could be
housed in a volume of less than two cubic inches.
