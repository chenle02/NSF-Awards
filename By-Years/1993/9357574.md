The primary focus of this work is to resolve issues dealing with the design and
implementation of high bandwidth reconfigurable interconnect systems based on
Micro ElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS) which are commonly referred to as
Micromachines. Different guided-wave optical and holographic free-space optical
switch elements are being implemented and compared in terms of bandwidth, switch
reconfiguration rate, and range of programmability. Application to data
switching, and programmable interconnect devices for rapid prototyping are being
addressed with attention to both technological and system-wide performance/cost
design issues. Comparisons are made with conventional technologies. Also being
investigated is the application of some of the optical MEMS elements to advanced
image projection.
