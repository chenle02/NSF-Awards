9457981 Long This research addresses the interaction between humans, machines,
and electronic media by exploring the potential of Force- Reflecting Haptic-
Environment for Computer-Aided Design, Telerobotics, and Virtual Reality
applications. The research draws upon an indepth understanding of haptic
recognition in humans, force-reflection and haptic-simulation schemes, and
screw-systems theory. The force-reflecting haptic-environment is comprise of
adjustable left/right haptic hand-imprints, each mounted on separate six degree-
of-freedom in-parallel force-reflecting plat- forms. the hand-imprints simulate
various haptically important properties such as texture, hardness, and thermal
conductivity. The six degree-of-freedom in-parallel force-reflecting platforms,
which engage the upper limbs, constrain hand motion along prescribed geometric
contours. The entire system is compact and light enough to place in a brief
case. This novel force-reflecting haptic-environment is intended for rapid
development of computer-designed products, manipulation of remote physical
objects (telerobotics and robotics-surgery), and interaction with computer-
generated non-physical objects (virtual reality).
