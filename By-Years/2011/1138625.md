The project advances the state-of-the-art of autonomous Simultaneous
Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms, and maximizes the ability to explore
under extreme conditions with minimal time using real-time 3D methods in nuclear
power plants. The integrated system consists of a hardware system with three
LIDAR's, a CPU, a GPU, a battery and a wireless unit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
state-of-the-art in nuclear power plant disaster mitigation is a direct
consequence, as well as the development of more advanced and robust SLAM
techniques that are applicable in all domains.
