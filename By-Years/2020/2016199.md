The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide a nearshore (just offshore of
inhabited coastal land, in shallow water) solution to reduce coastal flooding.
The proposed project addresses a need to lessen heavy flood protection solutions
based on carbon-intensive concrete in the form of seawalls and other barriers.
This project will prototype an interconnected network of floating growth mats,
made to seed marsh grass above the water and seaweed below. The heavy biomass of
these mats and their network properties as a large interconnected group provides
wave and storm surge reduction. A proposed turnkey kit offers a low-cost system,
readily deployable and expandable over time. Additionally, as a floating park-
like marine landscape, it has many co-benefits to the surrounding communities.
As plant-based infrastructure, it serves as a site for native marsh grasses and
local seaweeds to populate, providing new habitats and improving water quality.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase I project is a natural coastal resilience
technology designed to be pre-fabricated, modular, and easy to implement for a
variety of coastal environments and communities. The technology consists of
robust vegetated mats linked in a network and deployed in the nearshore. The
mats are colonized by local varieties of semi-aquatic marsh flora above the
water line, and aquatic seaweeds below. Research objectives to validate this
approach include comparing mat network performance in a range of flow
conditions, including extreme waves, to inform mat design. A second research
thrust will measure biomass accumulation and ecological performance through in
situ deployments of mat structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
