Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0432603&lt;br/&gt;Principal
Investigator: Andreas R. Blass, Edward Griffor&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A series of
three yearly meetings will bring together U.S.,&lt;br/&gt;Russian, and other
logicians and set theorists to present&lt;br/&gt;progress and new problems
connecting logic to several other areas&lt;br/&gt;of mathematics. The first
meeting, in 2004, concerns Logic,&lt;br/&gt;Algebra and Geometry; the second, in
2005, addresses&lt;br/&gt;Computability and Models of Arithmetic; and the 2006
session will&lt;br/&gt;be on The Modern Impact of Set
Theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Logic and set theory concern mathematical
investigations of the&lt;br/&gt;most fundamental notions of mathematics, such
as: What are the&lt;br/&gt;rules of inference? What are the objects to which we
apply them?&lt;br/&gt;How does changing this axiomatic background alter the
resulting&lt;br/&gt;conclusions? Theories that result from systematic
investigation&lt;br/&gt;of these concerns near the roots of mathematics can
have&lt;br/&gt;applications much farther up the developmental ladder,
for&lt;br/&gt;example by providing estimates of the number of solutions to
a&lt;br/&gt;system of algebraic equations or by developing a notion
of&lt;br/&gt;complexity that can show that different dynamical systems
are&lt;br/&gt;similar or genuinely distinct. Each of these meetings will
be&lt;br/&gt;held in Russia, at the Euler International Mathematical
Institute&lt;br/&gt;of the Steklov Mathematical Institute of the Russian Academy
of&lt;br/&gt;Sciences in St. Petersburg. This is a joint award of the
Office&lt;br/&gt;of International Science and Engineering's Central and
Eastern&lt;br/&gt;Europe Program and the Division of Mathematical Sciences
program&lt;br/&gt;in Foundations.&lt;br/&gt;
