The Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships are awards to
recent recipients of doctoral degrees. The fellowship is designed to provide 24
months of support divided into 18 academic months and 3 periods of two summer
months. The recipient has the option of a Research Instructorship which allows
the 18 months of academic support to be taken as 9 months of full-time support
and 18 months of half-time support. Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research
Fellowship awards allow fellows to choose research environments that will have
maximal impact on their future scientific development. Elise Cawley will receive
her doctoral degree from the University of California, Berkeley, and will pursue
research in the area of thermodynamic formalism and dynamical systems, under the
guidance of Dennis Sullivan at CUNY Graduate Center.
