The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology
Transfer (STTR) Phase I project relates to the treatment of end-stage renal
disease, a significant health burden in the US. Trends are moving toward
patient-managed, in-home treatments. The goal of this proposal is to accelerate
adoption of safer home hemodialysis therapy through development of prototype
dialysis systems. Despite the recognized economic, health and quality-of-life
benefits of more frequent hemodialysis treatments, adoption of home hemodialysis
using present systems is being limited by doctors? and patients? safety
concerns. Simpler and safer hemodialysis therapies will require breakthroughs in
both device components and form-factors. The development of a small-scale,
highly efficient dialysis system enabled by silicon nanomembranes holds
potential for increasing adoption of home dialysis and its related benefits for
the 430,000 individuals affected by end-stage renal disease in the
US.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project concerns the scale up of silicon
nanomembranes, which offer extraordinary and unparalleled permeability, enabling
small-scale hemodialysis. This project focuses on the optimization of membrane
?liftoff?methods which enable the release of large areas of silicon
nanomembranes from silicon wafer supports on which they are produced, thereby
simultaneously increasing active membrane area and reducing production cost.
Fluidic housings will be developed for these membranes appropriate for blood
volumes for large animal (Pig/sheep) and human scales. Bench-top validation will
be conducted to measure toxin clearance and ultrafiltration in the prototype
system.
