Abstract for Project "Collaborative Research: Field Investigation of Transient
Effects of the 2001 Republic Day, India Earthquake"

Field seismological and geological studies of the devastating earthquake of
January 26, 2001 in India are being carried out to collect information about
transient phenomena, including aftershocks and surface effects. This earthquake,
called the Republic Day earthquake, had a magnitude of about 7.7 and was an
unusual earthquake. It occurred in western India, far from the plate boundary
between India and Eurasia. The Republic Day earthquake was an intraplate
earthquake, with unusual characteristics. A network of about two dozen
seismographs is to be operated for a period of 3 to 6 months to record and
locate aftershocks. Related field geological studies are to be done to learn
about the liquefaction and other surface effects produced by the mainshock. The
hypocenter of the mainshock was relatively deep in the crust for such a large
earthquake (25 km) and no surface faulting has been found from it. Recordings
from the temporary network will help confirm the depth of the mainshock as well
as information about the mainshock fault mechanism.
