cAMP receptor protein (CRP) is one of the better characterized gene activators
and provides an excellent model with which to study the mechanisms involved in
gene regulation. CRP:cAMP complex binds a select group of promoter sequences and
regulates the activity of gene controlled by those promoters. This project
provides a research plan designed to utilize mutant forms od CRP to examine the
mechanistic role of both CRP:RNA polymerase interaction and CRP-mediated DNA
bending promoter activation. These experiments utilize both an acrylamide-based
DNA mobility assay and an intramolecular DNA ligation assay. A second aspect of
this work is designed to investigate the response of the wild-type and mutant
forms of CRP to changes in template DNA structure. These studies will
characterize the effect of varying DNA superhelical density on both CRP binding
and CRP-mediated lac promoter (lacP) activation in vitro. CRP:DNA binding
constants will be determined in experiments that utilize a small (877 base pair)
covalently closed circular DNA containing lacP. The results generated in vitro
will be assessed in vivo in studies that monitor, through RNA:DNA hybridization
and integrative recombination assays, the effect of different culture conditions
on both plasmid-born lacP activity and plasmid superhelical density. A major
focus of biological research is the study of mechanisms involved in regulating
gene expression. Productive interaction of RNA polymerase (RNAP) with promoter
DNA sequences is a ubiquitous requirement. Studies dealing with the individual
regulatory properties of different genes have uncovered an important class of
DNA binding proteins, termed gene activator proteins, that function to promote
the association of RNAP to select promoters. This well written proposal is
submitted by a very experienced but beginning investigator.
