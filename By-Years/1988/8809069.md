This project is in support of Johns Hopkins' Japan-U. S. Mathematics Institute.
Its purpose is to further mathematical research, to enrich Johns Hopkins and the
U. S. mathematics communities by interaction with exceptional Japanese
mathematicians, and to promote ties of friendship between the U. S. and Japan.
Each year, approximately 4 outstanding Japanese mathematicians will be invited
to spend the year at Johns Hopkins, and visits by U. S. mathematicians to Johns
Hopkins and by the visiting Japanese to other U. S. universities will be
supported. Each year, an area of mathematics will be emphasized. In the year
1988-89 that area is algebraic analysis, and the Japanese visitors are
anticipated to be M. Kashiwara, T. Oshima, J. Sekiguchi, T. Matsuki, and Y.
Shimizu. Professor J. Igusa of the Johns Hopkins Mathematics Department is
chairman of the Institute.
