With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at Colby College will acquire a time-resolved laser
flash photolysis system for undergraduate research and training in chemistry.
This equipment will enhance research studies in a) carbene chemistry and b) the
aquatic photochemistry of iron. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This instrumentation will
bring laser based techniques into the undergraduate education (both teaching and
research) of Chemistry majors, and further strengthen the quality of
undergraduate research and education at Colby College. &lt;br/&gt;
