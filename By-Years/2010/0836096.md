The Division of Chemistry supports Andrea Munro of the University of Arizona as
an American Competitiveness in Chemistry Fellow. Dr. Munro will synthesize and
study the properties of semiconductor nanocrystals (CdSe) embedded in a polymer
matrix. Dr. Munro will work in collaboration with scientists at the National
Renewable Energy Laboratory. In her plan for broadening participation, Dr. Munro
will develop hands-on materials with associated curriculum to be used by
teachers of grades K-6 in the Tucson and Sunnyside school districts. Some of
these materials may be modified for use in the University of Arizona Biosphere
II for outreach to the general public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research like that
of Dr. Munro is aimed at developing better materials for photovoltaic devices
with improved properties, as well as developing a better understanding of how
these materials behave. The ultimate aim of research like this is to develop
better materials for solar energy applications. The efforts at broadening
participation being pursued by Dr. Munro are aimed at increasing the
participation of young people from underrepresented groups in the
sciences.&lt;br/&gt;
