In order to understand the effects of COVID-19 on the US economy, we need
measures of economic activity that can keep pace with the spread of the virus.
This means measures that can be constructed not just for the nation as a whole,
but for states and localities. It also means measures that can be constructed
very quickly from available data sources; it takes months to finalize existing
economic statistics. This award funds a project that seeks to meet this urgent
need by using existing data streams that measure electricity consumption. The
available data divide the US into 100 different geographic zones and are
measured hourly. The PI will use statistical methods to determine how past
economic crises have affected electricity consumption. The results will help
them see when and how electricity generation is a useful economic indicator. If
successful, the project will give policymakers and businesses better measures of
how the economy is performing during fast-moving
crises.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team will develop a real-time index of economic
activity using weather-adjusted electricity consumption. Data will come from
publicly available sources, including the individual Independent System
Operators (ISOs) that conduct wholesale electricity markets, the Energy
Information Administration (EAI), Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC),
and the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity
(ENTSO-E). The data will be merged for weather state from the National Weather
Serviceâ€™s Automated Surface Observing Systems (ASOS) to control for the effect
of heating and cooling needs on electricity demand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
