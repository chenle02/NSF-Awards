0119110&lt;br/&gt;Thonnard&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides partial
support to complete development of technology necessary for measuring the
abundance of two rare krypton isotopes, Kr-81 and Kr-85. These isotopes, whose
concentration in the atmosphere is stable and known, are potentially ideal
tracers for a variety of environmental studies. Kr-81, with a 229,000 year half-
life, can determine how long ancient ice or ground water has been isolated from
the atmosphere in the 20,000 to 1,000,000 year time range. Similarly, Kr-85,
with its 10.8 year half-life, can determine isolation times in the 1 to 50 year
time range. These type of measurements can, for instance, provide important
insight into the movement of groundwater, identify pathways for pollution
infiltration, and provide input to overall resource management. Being chemically
inert, it is anticipated that the krypton isotopes will provide more reliable
results than other, chemically active tracers, by eliminating the complexity of
interactions with the underground environment. The work sponsored by this grant
includes completion of the necessary improvements to existing instrumentation,
and application of the technique to several important groundwater problems to
highlight its utility.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
