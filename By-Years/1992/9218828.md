The PI will continue research initiated under a grant to P. Olson and J. Vanyo.
The research will explore secondary surface flows and interior flows in the
liquid core caused by luni-solar precession of the mantle. The experimental
research will use liquids in an available oblate spheroidal cavity under
simulated liquid core conditions. Thermal convection will be added to initiate a
study of combined precession and buoyancy driven convective motions. The PI will
continue detail designs and planned operation of a later experiment using a more
precise cavity with 1/400 elliptocyte and additional internal flow measurements.
