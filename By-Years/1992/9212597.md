This is the first year funding of a three-year continuing award IRI-9212597.
Several problems are to be investigated in the continuation of research on
information-based complexity: weak and strong tractability of multivariate
problems, weak and strong optimal information, verification, and computational
learning theory/information-based complexity for continuous problems. In the
first two problems, breaking intractability and unsolvability of multivariate
problems are explored in various settings. The concepts of strong tractability
and strong optimal information are introduced. For strongly tractable problems
the dependence on the number of variables is eliminated. The third problem is
verification. Surprisingly, for continuous problems, verification can be
exponentially harder than computation. Finally, it has been observed that there
are parallels between computational learning theory and information-based
complexity. Research is conducted on the similarities and differences between
these two areas for continuous problems.//
