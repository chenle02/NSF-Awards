The proposed research involves the development of a high spectral resolution
optical interferometer for measurement of the dynamics of the Jovian magneto-
nebula, the latitudinal distribution of CO on Mars, and the dynamics of
Mercurian sodium escape. The instrument is designed for transportability and
adaptability to a wide range of emerging solar system targets of opportunity.
