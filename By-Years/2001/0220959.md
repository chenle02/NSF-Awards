ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OCE-0220959&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taking advantage
of existing cruise opportunities to take place in the Eastern Tropical North
Pacific, off the coast of Mexico, a number of field analytical measurements and
laboratory investigations are proposed to further research into iron
bioavailability and marine iron ligand chemistry. Dominant phytoplankton
communities in this region, Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus, are to be studied
in the context of a layered euphotic zone overlying a suboxic zone presenting
distinct sub-environments having strong chemical gradients in nutrient, trace
metal, oxygen and light regimes. Activities such as trace metal sampling, on-
deck incubations using competitive ligand binding voltammetric techniques,
deliberate iron amendment and natural ligand photochemical decomposition studies
will be studied in a mechanistic and process study manner. The anticipated
outcome of these investigations is increased understanding of the
biogeochemistry, speciation and cycling of dissolved iron, a trace element often
thought to be limiting to phytoplankton growth, in the
ocean.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
