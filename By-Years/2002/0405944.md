The investigator and his colleagues study several examples mimicking the
behavior of more complex, realistic systems in atmosphere/ocean dynamics. The
main focus here is on understanding the importance of various low-dimensional
chaotic structures in full dynamics with many degrees of freedom and deriving
low-dimensional stochastic models which correctly capture the interaction of the
low-dimensional chaos with fast scales. In addition, significance of non-
Gaussian small-scale processes is analyzed in the context of the Barotropic
Quasi-Geostrophic Equations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An area of great importance
for many problems in science and engineering involves derivation of effective
equations for a small number of suitable variables capturing the essence of
large systems with many unknowns. Important examples include evolution of the
coupled atmosphere/ocean systems, folding of large proteins in molecular
dynamics, distribution of air-pollution over a long period of time, etc.
Effective equations are required first because these systems vastly overwhelm
direct numerical computations. In addition, often only a few variables in the
problem provide most of the needed information. In the above examples, these
essential variables might be the seasonal average temperature in the US, a few
angles describing the folding changes in the protein, or the primary direction
for the spread of an air-pollutant from its source. The main aim of this work is
to further advance the stochastic mode-reduction strategy originally developed
for derivation of the effective equations in the atmosphere/ocean dynamics.
Several idealized problems are examined in order to develop a systematic
approach for more realistic systems and validate the applicability of the method
in various settings.
