This award will support a collaborative project between Dr. Peter T. Cummings of
the University of Virginia and Dr. D.J. Evans of the Australian National
University. This research is to better predict and understand the transport
properties (shear viscosity, thermal conductivity and diffusivities) of several
representative classes of simple fluids, liquid metals and molecular fluids and
mixtures in terms of the microscopic forces between molecules. The research is
innovative in that algorithms developed only very recently will be applied to
understanding transport properties, with the potential of significant advances
in rigorously justified computationally efficient simulation techniques of
predicting transport properties. The project represents excellent collaboration
between the Australian researcher due to his unique expertise in non-
equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) algorithms and Cummings' on-going, NSF-
supported comprehensive simulation studies of transport properties. More
accurate prediction of transport properties is crucial to successful chemical
process design and optimization, a key technology in the development of
manufacturing processes to the U.S. chemical industry.
