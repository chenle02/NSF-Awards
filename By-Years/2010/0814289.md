Katherine A. Kantardjieff of California State Fullerton (with Co-PIs Raymond J.
Butcher from Howard University, Alanah Fitch from Loyola University of Chicago
and Donald F. McMullen from Indiana University) and Allen D. Hunter from
Youngstown State University (with Thomas B. Higgins from Harold Washington
College, Bernard D. Santarsiero from University of Illinois at Chicago and
Matthias Zeller from Youngstown State University) are supported by the NSF
Chemistry Division Integrative Chemistry Activities to organize a workshop on
"Cyber-Enabled Instrumentation Strategic Planning". The workshop will (1) assess
the impact of cyber-enabled instrumentation in chemistry, especially for awards
by the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Facilities:Multiuser program; (2)
identify future directions of instrument cyber-enabling; (3) determine
priorities for future instrument cyber-enabling that best suit the broader
chemistry community and (4) create a cyber-enabling instrumentation
network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shared instrumentation is a corner stone of
research. Efficient and secure transfer of data between multiple users in
collaborating institutions is essential for advancement of research, education
and science. The workshop is viewed as having potentially broad impact not only
within chemistry, but other disciplines as well.&lt;br/&gt;
