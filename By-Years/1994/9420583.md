9420583 O'Melia ABSTRACT The proposal is presented in five major components.
First are described the four major research thrust areas related to contaminant
transport, fate, and remediation within which our proposed educational
objectives will be implemented. This theme represents an important and timely
topic both in research and in engineering practice. Curriculum development is
then discussed, including a description of new courses for our revised program,
modifications to existing courses, and detailed examples of plans for
integrating modeling and measurements into selected courses. The participants in
the proposal are briefly described. In addition to Hopkins faculty, these
include interested individuals from private and government sectors, to help
bring real-world problems into the classroom and to assist in designing a
program that will produce graduate who are to advance the practice of
environmental science and engineering. Next we describe our plans for ongoing,
substantive project evaluation and assessment, as well as for dissemination of
results. Finally, we conclude with a detailed schedule of activities. ***
