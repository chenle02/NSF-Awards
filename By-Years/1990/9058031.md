>. J H.During her five.year Presidential Young Investigator award, Dr. Root,
University of Michigan, plans to continue investigating the factors affecting
the distribution and abundance patterns of all birds wintering in North America.
Two major studies are proposed. Initially, Dr. Root will investigate various
physiological mechanisms that may cause winter ambient temperatures to shape the
northern range boundaries of some birds. Metabolic rates and various
energy.storage and energy.use characteristics will be compared among several
species at different sites along cross.continental, latitudinal transects. Study
2 will use the physiological information obtained in the first study to
investigate the possible effect of global warming on avian biogeographical
patterns. This will involve the development of a theoretical model that
addresses how the winter ranges of birds change, given a particular shift in
ambient temperature. Such a model could not only provide insight about the basic
biology of North American avian communities, but also suggest management
strategies for combating the negative impacts of climate change.
