This award will support a "Conference on Value of Researchers with Japan
Experience to U.S. S&T Communities" in May 1989 in Santa Clara, CA. About 60
alumni of the Japan internship programs offered by the American Electronics
Association and Massachusetts Institute of Technology will interact with
representatives from the U.S. industrial, government and scientific communities.
There are numerous barriers to increasing the number of American
scientists/engineers who spend significant periods doing research in Japanese
laboratories, and to the larger U.S. scientific community obtaining maximum
benefit from the Japan-related experiences of technologically sophisticated
Japan experts. Objectives of this conference are: 1) To generate awareness of
the value of scientists and engineers with Japanese language fluencey and
knowledge about the Japanese culture and research environment to U.S. industry;
2) To inform industry and scientific community that technologically
sophisticated Japan experts are available and ready to join the ranks of U.S.
companies; and 3) To provide a forum to discuss future directions and priorities
needed to fully utilize and assure futher development of the human resources
vital to building the U.S.-Japan relationship.
