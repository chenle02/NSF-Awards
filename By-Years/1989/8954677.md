People Sharing Information Network, PSInet, is a National Computer Conferencing
Network for Science and Mathematics Education which currently links all State
Science Supervisors, a number of science education agencies, and which has
intra-state networks in place in six states. This project will extend PSInet
capabilities to the State Mathematics Supervisors and to the Presidential Award
Winners for Excellence in Science and Mathematics Teaching. In addition, intra-
state networks will be established in the 44 states which are currently not "on-
line". Cost Sharing in the amount of $650,000 is 97% of the NSF contribution.
