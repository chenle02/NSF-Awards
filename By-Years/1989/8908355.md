The project addresses problems in the design and implementation of incremental
program development and analysis techniques. Two topics are under investigation:
l. Automatic generation of program analyzers. A framework that supports the
effective development of program analyzers will be developed. These analyzers
can be specified by a formal semantic definition derived from a standard
denotational language definition. 2. Incremental modification and analysis of
attribute grammars. The goal is to develop techniques that allow attributes and
attribute dependencies to be interactively added or deleted, with grammar
analyses and evaluators incrementally updated. This will support attribute
grammar development and also allow new approaches that enhance the efficiency
and flexibility of attribute grammars.
