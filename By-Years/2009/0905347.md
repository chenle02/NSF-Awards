Abstract

Award: DMS-0905347 Principal Investigator: Wei Zhu

This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).

These research projects concern the interaction of geometric measure theory and
partial differential equations. Particular projects will study stationary-
harmonic multiple-valued functions, frequency and branch sets of multiple-valued
functions, and regularity of integral varifolds. Work on these problems will
address some longstanding questions in geometric analysis such as boundary
regularity of area minimizing integral currents in general codimensions and the
singularity estimate of integral varifolds under natural assumptions on the mean
curvature or the second fundamental form.

Some of most useful and significant classes of submanifolds in geometry arise
are characterized as critical points of natural energy or area functions. For
example, surfaces formed by soap bubbles are critical points of the mean
curvature functional, while geodesics (shortest paths) are critical points for
the length functional. Geometric measure theory offers powerful tools for
establishing that critical objects exist by expanding the class of allowable
objects from surfaces to generalized surfaces. These methods often leave open
questions of regularity, or smoothness, of solutions, and those issues are
emphasized in these projects.
