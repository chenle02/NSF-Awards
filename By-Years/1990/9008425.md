It is proposed to purchase a rheometer capable of making steady, transient, and
dynamic rheological measurements of polymer solutions. This equipment would
support research in liquid crystals, polyelectrolytes, characterization of novel
polymers, aggregation phenomena in nitrocellulose and hydrozpropyl lignins, and
ionomers used as elastomers. These materials have complex rheological behavior
including shear rate- and time-dependent viscosity and elasticity. In order to
characterize these microstructures in their unpreturbed state, it is essential
to make rheological measurements at very low stress levels. These materials such
low viscosities and storage and loss moduli that extremely sensitive torque
transducers are needed. Rheological measurements with the proposed equipment
serve two purposes. First, one can relate a polymer's microstructure to specific
rheological properties, providing guidance on how to alter the molecular
structure of a polymer to obtain a desired property. Secondly, one can determine
the optimum processing conditions for obtaining desired properties.
