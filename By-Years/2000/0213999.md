This project will digitize historic records and briefs of the United States
Supreme Court, and make them available to the public through the Project's web
site and database, at http://curiae.law.yale.edu. The Project web site will
provide public access to electronic versions of more than 2,000 records and
briefs from the 300 most important U.S. Supreme Court cases in American history.
Over 150,000 pages of materials will be provided through a user-friendly
interface, supported by what will be the most complete, publicly accessible
database of historic U.S. Supreme Court records and briefs to date. Briefs and
oral arguments presented to the Supreme Court provide crucial information to
scholars, to legal practitioners, and to the public at large as they seek to
understand America's historic constitutional battles and Supreme Court
decisions. Unfortunately, the public has highly inadequate access to these
valuable materials. Bound print versions of these materials are rare, difficult
to locate, and continue to be subject to significant damage through use; on-line
versions do not provide access to the bulk of the most significant case
materials and are often costly to use. The web site and documents will be
searchable both full-text and by individually-indexed fields at the project
site, in addition to through public search engines. All documents will be freely
available to all users. Initial case selection will be made based on citation
information in historical studies of the Supreme Court and constitutional law
casebooks. Copies of the briefs, oral arguments, and related materials will then
be transferred to electronic format by a data conversion service. The files
produced by the service will be located on the Yale University institutional web
server. The accessibility of these materials will not only save researchers
time, but will encourage and allow research and analysis that would not
otherwise have been undertaken.
