Although recent theoretical and empirical work on predation has shown that
spatial heterogeneity in the abundance of predators can qualitatively affect the
outcomes of predator-prey interactions, the mechanisms by which predators
aggregate are poorly known. In this study field experiments and a computer
simulation will determine whether the hunger dependent emigration rate of a
stinkbug, Perillus bioculatus (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae), is responsible for its
pattern of aggregation to its prey Leptinotarsa decimlineata (Coleoptera:
Chrysomelidae), the Colorado Potato Beetle. Considerable theoretical attention
has also been devoted to the effect of age and stage structure on predator-prey
interactions. An important effect of age structure occurs when juvenile
predators are small, and only able to attack some stages of their prey
effectively. Therefore, in addition to aggregation behavior, the effect of prey
stage on the growth and survivorship of Perillus juveniles, and on the numerical
response of the Perillus population will be examined. The information on
aggregation behavior and the effect of prey stage on the numerical response will
be used to evaluate the ability of Perillus to regulate its prey, and to assess
its competence as an agent of biological control.
