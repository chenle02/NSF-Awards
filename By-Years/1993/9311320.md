9311320 Fader This award provides partial support for a three-part project to
increase the interest, understanding and involvement of university students in
science, technology, and society issues. The project will also promote awareness
of these issues among high school students and their teachers. The project parts
are an international conference in the summer of 1994, the production of an
issues guidebook for student and teachers, and follow-up with chapter program
initiatives on university, college and high school campuses. The project will
begin in fall 1993 with publicity about the coming summer conference and a call
for issue papers for the guidebook. The papers will explore cutting-edge science
and technology issues and their social and ethical ramifications. The conference
will unite selected college students and eminent professionals to explore these
issues and develop the guidebook further. The chapter program will follow on the
conference to continue efforts to expand student awareness and discussion of
these critical issues. Oversight of all of these activities is the
responsibility of several boards of advisors. Evaluation involves statistical
recordkeeping as well as qualitative reports about project activities and
products. ***
