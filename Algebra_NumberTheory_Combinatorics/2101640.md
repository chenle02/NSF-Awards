Algebraic geometry is concerned with the study of algebraic varieties, that is
geometric objects defined by polynomial equations. Such objects are ubiquitous
in mathematics, and are relevant to a variety of real world applications ranging
from cryptography, to computational biology, to models of the universe in
physics. Indeed, the Calabi-Yau threefolds, a special class of algebraic
varieties, are abstract representations of the shape of the universe in string
theory. A very consequential, wide-open question regarding the Calabi-Yau
threefolds is the existence of finitely many types of such objects. This
proposal is concerned with the study of Calabi-Yau threefolds and of a related,
wider class of algebraic varieties, the so-called K-trivial varieties. A number
of questions ranging from the above-mentioned finiteness question to more
tangible questions will be investigated. This study will involve a number of the
PI?s graduate students and postdocs. Some additional research and outreach
activities related to the subject are also planned.

The study of K-trivial varieties, that is algebraic varieties with trivial
canonical class, is a central subject in algebraic geometry. The proposed
projects will focus on two main classes of K-trivial varieties: hyper-Kaehler
manifolds and Calabi-Yau threefolds. The motivational goals driving this study
are the finiteness of deformation types for such objects, and the complementary
question of constructing new deformation classes (especially in the hyper-
Kaehler case). Intermediate steps towards these challenging objectives include
questions regarding the automorphism groups, that is the symmetries of such
objects; the deformations and degenerations, that is breaking up the K-trivial
varieties into simpler, more manageable pieces; and the fibrations of K-trivial
varieties (especially Lagrangian fibrations for hyper-Kaehler manifolds), that
is constructing such varieties from lower dimensional objects. A main tool in
this investigation is Hodge theory, and the associated period maps.
