The undergraduate program for majors and minors in the Department of Geography
and Environmental Studies is being expanded, updated and strengthened at
Slippery Rock University through the utilization of the Earth Resources Data
Analysis System (ERDAS). This powerful, yet moderately priced system includes a
microcomputer-based (IBM PC/AT- enhanced) work station which supports peripheral
hardware and supporting software. Students are learning how to generate digital
data bases (using a Digitizing Tablet and Video Digitizer) in order to analyze
spatially distributed phenomena (with Image Processing, Geographic Information
System Module and Topographic Module) in evaluating natural resources. Also
provided is instruction in data plotting in a cartographically accurate format
using the Color Hardcopy Module.
