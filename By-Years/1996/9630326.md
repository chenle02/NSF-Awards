Taste remains a poorly understood sensory system by comparison to our knowledge
of nerve activity patterns and pathways in the brain for other senses. At all
levels of the taste pathways from tongue to cortex, taste neurons generally are
multi-sensitive, responding to some degree to more than one of the four basic
taste qualities of salty, sour, bitter and sweet. Little is known about the
central organization of response profiles for taste cells, defined as their
relative sensitivities across a variety of taste stimuli. This project uses a
novel approach combining electrophysiological recording with computational
techniques to study the dynamic interactions among single cells in two important
taste centers in the brainstem. Multi-site simultaneous recordings display
activity patterns for ensembles of nerve cells, which are analyzed for their
functional connectivity, and for the relatedness of their profiles of taste
sensitivities. In going beyond the usual single-unit studies, results will
permit inferences about the interneuronal dynamics, and generate hypotheses
about how excitatory and inhibitory connections among central subgroups of cells
may provide mechanisms for spatial as well as temporal central coding for taste.
Results of this novel approach will have fundamental importance to better
understanding taste mechanisms, which can have impact beyond basic science to
the food industry; the novel techniques and the investigation of coding
mechanisms will be useful beyond chemosensory science to neuroscience in
general.
