ABSTRACT ARC #0437201

This SGER award will support the proposing preliminary testing on two
archaeological sites in the Norton Sound area of Alaska. The two sites are
thought to shed light on the "Norton" archaeological culture, believed to be
ancestral Yup'ik (Eskimo). River erosion and subsistence digging increasingly
threaten the chosen sites and the preliminary investigations being proposed are
critical in determining if they can shed light on the Norton culture. More
extensive archaeological investigations involving local communities, who have
expressed a great interest in their pre-history, will be planned on the basis of
the current field investigations
