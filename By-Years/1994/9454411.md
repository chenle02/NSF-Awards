9454411 Reid The Earth Systems Implementation Project (ESI) is the culmination
of an elementary science reform effort which was first initiated by the
Anchorage School District's (ASD) elementary teacher in 1992 and which builds on
the systems award winning elementary science program. The effort has involved
administrators, parents, and community members from the major Alaskan science
professions working with teachers to develop an advanced K-6 inquiry-based
hands-on science curriculum. This new curriculum made up of modules from
nationally validated elementary science materials development projects will be
implemented in each of the districts 58 elementary schools. To accomplish this
the project will prepare approximately 1,000 elementary school teachers with the
content and teaching strategies needed to implement the program. The project
will also involve over 2,000 parents to work directly with teachers in support
of the project. Cost sharing will be 69% of the NSF funds. ***
