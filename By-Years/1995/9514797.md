9514797 Hall This proposal deals with a wide range of problems in high energy
theoretical physics, but there are several themes. One avenue is to explore new
formulations of the basic tools of quantum field theory with which one describes
the interactions of elementary particles. Possible generalizations are proposed
and some new facets of string theory are considered as well. String theory is an
attempt to arrive at a unified description of all interactions including
gravity. There are formidable mathematical obstacles in obtaining such a
formulation: some of these are addressed in the proposal. A second avenue is to
attempt a more phenomenological description of the interactions of elementary
particles, in particular incorporating supersymmetry, the proposed but as of yet
unobserved symmetry between bosons and fermions. Several models are discussed
and their predictions for high energy experiments are detailed. The links
between phenomenological models and underlying string theories are another
subject of this proposal as are the predictions of models for phenomena in the
early universe and for cosmology. ***
