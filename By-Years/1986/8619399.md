The PIs propose to use a flow cytometer to gather information on the feeding,
growth, and reproduction patterns of ciliated protozoa in varying environments.
The information thus generated could have ultimate use in wastewater treatment
facilities as well as serve as a model system for other similar microorganisms
in various ecological systems. Protozoa are unicellular, eucaryotic
microorganisms that ingest and digest bacteria. Flow cytometry can not only
provide large scale statistical information but also information on the internal
structure of single cells. The specific objectives of the project include: (1)
Development of an index or measure of the physiological state of a single cell
in a constant environment (2) Extension of (1) above for changing environments
(3) Development of a model of suspension feeding by cells of different
physiological states that will be applicable to situations where the number
density as well as the composition of the population of particles fed upon vary.
(4) Development of a mathematical model that will allow the prediction of the
joint distributions of cellular properties in a ciliate population and how these
distributions change in response to changes in environmental conditions. Both
PIs are well respected by their peers and the facilities are ideal for this
work.
