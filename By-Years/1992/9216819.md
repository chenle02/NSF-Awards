Effective power system operation requires well-planned commitments of generating
units in a planning phase combined with responsive real-time dispatching of
power in an operational control phase. Typically, the unit commitment plan is
determined by an optimization model that considers a forecast for demand, fixed
security constraints, and known unit availabilities. The operational controller
considers actual random demand, varying security reserves, and unforeseen unit
losses. This project will combine these tasks by integrating the planning and
operating phases in a unified control framework. The emphasis in the planning
phase will be on considering random effects, contingencies and the values
attributed to potential ending states. The emphasis on the operating phase will
be on considering longer term effects, recognizing conditions requiring
corrective actions, searching for similar situations and potential actions for
learning from both practical experience and simulated events.
