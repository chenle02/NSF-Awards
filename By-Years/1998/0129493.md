Rajaniemi&lt;br/&gt;0129493&lt;br/&gt;Competition can play a key role in
structuring plant communities, and understanding the mechanisms of plant
competitive interactions is therefore critical for successful management of
natural and cultivated systems. Yet despite years of study, the nature of plant
competitive interaction and their relationship to environmental conditions is
incompletely understood and continues to be debated. Belowground competition and
its relation to fine-scale heterogeneity in soil resources is a particularly
little explored area, despite the ubiquity of soil heterogeneity in nature. This
research will use experimental and modeling approaches to investigate root
foraging traits and their relationship to plant competitive ability and plant
community diversity in spatially heterogeneous soil. Greenhouse and field
experiments will be used to measure the scale, precision, and rate of root
foraging and their relationship to the competitive ability of herbaceous
perennial species, including an important invasive weed. An especially novel
focus of this research is the phenomenon of belowground size asymmetry and its
role in plant competitive ability and community structure. Field experiments and
simulation modeling will examine whether fine-scale heterogeneity affects
competitive size symmetry and competitive hierarchies, and the consequences for
plant species coexistence and the maintenance of plant community diversity. This
research has the potential to redirect our understanding of root competition and
its role in the structure of plant communities.&lt;br/&gt;
