This award will support a two-day Virtual NSF Project Scoping Workshop on the
topic of "Precise and Accurate Calculations of Neutrinoless Double-Beta Decay".
Theoretical nuclear physics input is critical to the interpretation of
experimental results that could demonstrate that neutrinos are their own
antiparticles. As such, theoretical nuclear physics will play an important role
in understanding the excess of matter over antimatter in the universe, one of
outstanding grand challenges in modern science. This Project Scoping Workshop
will provide a forum for the community of practitioners in this field to take
stock of recent scientific advancements, identify current challenges, discuss
opportunities to overcome those challenges, and map a way forward for the
success of the experimental Neutrinoless Double-Beta Decay projects. This
project advances the goals outlined out in the 2015 LONG RANGE PLAN for NUCLEAR
SCIENCE regarding “the timely development and deployment of a U.S.-led ton-scale
neutrinoless double beta decay experiment.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
