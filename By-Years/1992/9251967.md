This proposal provides equipment (a UV/VIS spectrophotometer with computer
interface, an environmental chamber, temperature- controlled aquaria, a seawater
holding system, and computers with data handling and analysis software) that
enable students in marine biology laboratories to investigate adaptation and
energy expenditures of organisms in relation to changes in their environments.
The seawater system, in conjunction with the aquaria, enables the class to use
locally collected and purchased specimens. Students collect and store data from
instruments directly on the computer; making data acquisition quicker and
allowing students to analyze experiments with statistically valid sample
sizes.Use of the equipment will be encouraged for all classes needing a seawater
supply and animal maintenance facilities. Experience with modern equipment will
enhance students potential as professionals and during graduate study.
