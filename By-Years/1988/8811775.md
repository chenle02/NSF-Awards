Work to be done on this project will focus on problems arising in the modern
theory of harmonic analysis and its relationship with partial differential
equations. This relationship arises naturally when differential equations are
transformed by various means into integral expressions or operators. In 1976,
the fundamental inequalities relating bounds of Calderon-Zygmund operate to
weighted function norms were obtained. Extensive work on these estimates
followed, but most work was confined to one-parameter operators. In this
project, a multiparameter theory is laid out for investigation. The basic
inequalities are much harder to achieve in this context because of the
complexities of higher dimentional analogues to dyadic intervals. Nevertheless,
inequalities have been established for the two parameter case. Applications are
to be made to elliptic operators such as two-parameter Schrodinger operators and
the development of a correspondinguncertainty principle.
