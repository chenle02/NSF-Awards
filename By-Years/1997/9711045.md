A primary concern of this Mexican research project is the preservation of
metallic maritime structures such as bridges, oil platforms, piers, etc.
Metallic structures may fail because of one or a combination of different
problems related to electrochemistry and mechanics. Those problems include
fatigue, localized corrosion, wear, general corrosion, and others. The ability
to prioritize the importance and the extent of each problem and their combined
effects under real life conditions will greatly improve our capability of
increasing the life of those structures.
