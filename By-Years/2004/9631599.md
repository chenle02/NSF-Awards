The purpose of the project is to refine several inequalities and to extend some
theorems pertaining to Nielsen extensions of finite Riemann surfaces and to
obtain moduli for surfaces which remain constant in the Nielsen extension
process. These results would lead to a better understanding of the relationship
between a surface and its Nielsen extension and the classification of conformal
structures on Riemann surfaces. Numerical methods using mathematical software
such as Mathematica and Geomview will be utilized in investigating the problems
by obtaining numerical and graphical approximations of a conformal function
mapping a Nielsen convex region onto the upper half-plane.
