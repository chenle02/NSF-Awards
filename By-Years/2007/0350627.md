This CAREER award to Nicholas A. Kotov at Oklahoma State University is supported
by the Advanced Materials Program in the Chemistry Division. The focus of the
research is the synthesis and characterization of chemically modified
semiconductor nanoclusters where the modification consists of coordinatively
binding transition metal complexes to the chalcogenide atoms on the nanocluster
surface. Specifically, stabilized cadmium chalcogenide nanoclusters will be
prepared and surface modified by reaction with copper and ruthenium amine
complexes. The chemically modified nanoclusters will be characterized by TEM,
XRD, ESR, NMR, MS, and emission and absorption spectroscopy. Optical properties
will be studied by time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy, pump-probe
spectroscopy and Stark spectroscopy. Electronic interactions between the
semiconductor nanocluster and the surface bound transition metal complex
markedly effect the nonlinear optical properties of the nanoclusters including
second and third harmonic generation. By adapting optical properties of
nanoparticles to a particular application, chalcogenide modified systems will
provide a new pathway for the preparation of novel light-emitting and nonlinear
optical materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CAREER educational plan will
integrate research and education in the area of photonics. Specifically, a
curriculum will be developed in support of the new interdisciplinary Photonics
Ph. D. program at Oklahoma State. Laboratory courses in optics, spectroscopy,
microscopy and semiconductor synthesis will be formulated. These courses, in
concert with industrial internships and a photonics business lecture series will
prepare Ph.D. students with the necessary skills for meaningful careers either
in the business or academic sectors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
