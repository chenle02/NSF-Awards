Multiplexed spectral imaging has led to many valuable discoveries in biological
studies. To further improve our knowledge of biological systems and enhance our
understanding of signaling pathways, more and more proteins and other molecules
are being studied simultaneously. Such studies are complex, often requiring the
spectral multiplexing of optical labels. Similarly, high-throughput and/or high-
data rate measurements are also needed. Our objective is to develop metal
nanoparticles for highly multiplexed imaging. The goals for this project are to
synthesize nanoparticles, functionalize nanoparticles, and characterize and
optimize the nanoparticle performance. Work toward meeting each of these goals
will be performed in parallel because frequent iteration of methods involved for
each goal will be required to reach the desired final result. The development
effort can serve user communities involved in a range of biological studies,
including cellular labeling, particle tracking studies, protein-protein
interactions, and cellular protein dynamics. This work will have broad
scientific impacts, as well as social and educational and training impacts. The
one-year project will integrate research and education through the training of
one postdoctoral fellow and one undergraduate summer student. Although the
student will be supported by this grant, he or she will participate in the NSF-
supported Research Experiences for Undergraduates program, which SRI's Molecular
Physics Laboratory has conducted for the past 17 years. The transformative
capabilities of the enhanced imaging method will lead to greater understanding
of biology, cell biology and disease processes.
