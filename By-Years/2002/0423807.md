The goals of this research are to elucidate an understanding of the molecular
principles of membrane protein interactions. These interactions are important
for cellular function, but they are currently poorly understood. To accomplish
this goal, the stability of the transmembrane beta-barrel protein, OMPLA, will
be determined. The influence of calcium and substrate, two biological effector
molecules, on OMPLA self-association will also be quantified. To meet these
goals, two sets of experimental studies will be carried out. Sedimentation
equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation will be used to measure OMPLA self-
association equilibrium constants in the presence and absence of substrate and
calcium. Spectroscopic techniques will be used to determine the strength of
calcium binding to the monomeric and dimeric forms of OMPLA. To understand the
mechanisms by which these three effects regulate the OMPLA activity, the
thermodynamic linkage relationships between them will be determined. This
thermodynamic data will be used to construct appropriate mathematical equations
that describe the species populations, from which one can gain a greater
understanding of the OMPLA species that are biologically relevant. The
structure/energy relationships for membrane protein interactions have only been
extensively studied in two helical membrane proteins. These results will be the
first for a transmembrane beta-barrel protein and will facilitate a comparison
of interaction motifs and principles between transmembrane alpha-helical and
beta-barrel proteins.

This project will allow students to gain expertise in analytical
ultracentrifugation as well as mathematics. To train young scientists,
undergraduate students will be given the opportunity for a meaningful research
experience. At the same time, this will have the dual benefit of offering
graduate students the opportunity to learn how to mentor students and
troubleshoot projects.
