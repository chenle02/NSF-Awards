"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5)."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quantum dot (QD) active
regions hold potential for realizing extremely high performance semiconductor
diode lasers. Unfortunately, these unique features of ideal QD active layers
have not been fully realized to date. The most successful approach to date of
forming QD's are self-assembly under the Stranski-Krastanow (SK) growth mode.
However, this approach results in a relatively large distribution of QD sizes,
leading to significant inhomogeneous broadening of the spectral gain. SK QDs
inherently form on top of a two-dimensional 'wetting layer', leading to weak
electron and hole confinement to the QD, which results in low gain saturation.
Here, we employ dense nanoscale diblock copolymer lithography-based
nanofabrication which eliminates the wetting layer states and improves QD size
uniformity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual
merit is that these structures will allow for the first time the study of the
optical gain characteristics of near ideal (i.e. complete 3D quantum
confinement) QD active regions, improving understanding carrier recombination
mechanisms, optical gain, and radiative efficiency of QDs. The broad impact of
such studies encompasses the first realization of compact diode laser sources
with power conversion efficiencies in excess of 80%, drastically reducing power
consumption for high output power applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;The educational broad impact is that graduate students will
learn all aspects of optoelectronic device engineering, from design to
fabrication and characterization. Students will have access to state-of-the-art
crystal growth facilities at UW-Madison and extensive material characterization
techniques to assess the optical and structural quality of the quantum dots.
