The Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division is
supporting continuation of a research program by Professor William Reinhardt at
the University of Washington to investigate chaotic Hamiltonian systems, their
phase space structures, and semi-classical quantization. New work is
concentrating on the properties of water in inhomogeneous states, the surface
melting of polar molecular solids, and the development of new methods for
determination of entropies and free energies of solvated systems from trajectory
and Monte Carlo simulation. In a second part of the research, a scalable,
massively parallel computer is being constructed from 24 RS/6000 processors to
provide computing speeds in the range of 200-300 Mflops. The system will be used
to explorea variety of problems in theoretical chemistry and develop parallel
codes and algorithms for their solution. %%% In surface melting, there is a very
inhomogeneous environment at the surface boundary layer. Phase transitions in
this environment are being studied from fundamental quantum and classical
mechanical viewpoints using extensive Monte Carlo computations. A parallel
processor computer is being constructed to meet the needs of theoretical
chemistry for higher computing speeds than are available from the present
generation of supercomputers.
