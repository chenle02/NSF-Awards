0137166/Werne&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main aims of this proposal are to develop
a better understanding of mixing during the active phase of deep open-ocean
convection and to obtain parameterizations of temperature and salinity changes
occurring during convection. Its physical novelty is that it includes the study
of physical processes not previously examined in detail, including: (a) vortical
interactions between plumes and (b) slant-wise convection. The study will use
ambitious numerical simulations to examine the dynamics of turbulent ensembles
of convective plumes and will include the effect of the horizontal component of
the Earth's rotation vector. Simulations will use both the full Boussinesq
equations as well as less stiff, asymptotically reduced sets of dynamical
equations developed by the PIs. The information on the lateral stirring and
penetration of strong convective events in the upper ocean that will be
developed in this project will be used to improve parameterizations of open-
ocean convection in large-scale ocean models of the sort used to study global
ocean circulation and climate. &lt;br/&gt;
