Proper development of eukaryotic organisms requires differential expression of
a multitude of genes with precise timing and tissue selectivity. Dr. Singleton
is utilizing the developmental program of the cellular slime mold, Dictyostelium
discoideum, as a system to investigate the molecular details of differential
gene expression and the developmental regulation of this expression. He has
identified and characterized three groups of genes which show various forms of
differential expression upon the onset of development or shortly thereafter. Two
groups are deactivated upon initiation of development, and the mechanisms of the
deactivation events are very different between the two groups. A third set of
genes is induced as development begins and is transiently expressed during the
first few hours of the program. Dr. Singleton's analysis of mutant strains
unable to develop has led to subclassification of the genes into those that
appear to be under the same regulatory system. He will continue to isolate the
genomic clones corresponding to certain of these genes and utilize them to
investigate the molecular events involved in their regulation. The sequences
necessary for transcription and proper regulation will be defined, and the
protein factors which mediate the regulatory events will be identified and
characterized. A system for generating and identifying mutations present in the
genes encoding the regulatory machinery will be developed. Finally, through
mutagenesis of a selected gene, he will begin to address what role these genes
play in the establishment of the developmental program. %%% These investigations
should result in a more comprehensive picture of the complexity and the details
of the regulatory events leading to the activation and establishment of
development using a simple model system. They will provide significant insight
into the molecular machinery that is utilized in the control processes of early
development.
