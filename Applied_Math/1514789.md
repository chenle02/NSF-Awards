This award supports the research program of the Principal Investigators in the
area of kernel-based meshless approximation methods, which have applications in
a number of modern large-scale scientific computing problems. The need for
analyzing and modeling data taken from scattered, irregularly placed sites
arises frequently in diverse fields: computer-aided design graphics, data
mining, medical imaging, learning networks, and geoscience, in addition to many
other areas. For example, weather prediction or climate modeling is based on
geophysical data collected at scattered sites, by sensors on satellites, ground
stations, or stations at sea. Carrying out such tasks presents difficulties for
traditional methods, which are based on collecting data at uniformly placed
sites or which require constructing "meshes"---think of a wire fence---that must
be carefully tailored to deal with the data sites involved. Newer methods, so-
called "kernel methods", do not require such meshes and can handle scattered
data. In addition to analyzing and modeling such data, these methods can solve
numerically the equations governing, say, atmospheric flow. This project will
further the development of kernel methods, making them easy to use, faster, less
expensive to implement, and capable of handling data from a hundred thousand or
more sites. It will provide support for graduate students, who will be trained
in both the theoretical and the applied aspects of using and developing these
methods.

The main object of this project is to develop new methods and tools for
attacking the analysis and synthesis of scattered data (i.e., data collected
from non-uniformly distributed sites) by means of kernel methods and, in
particular, for numerically solving partial differential equations and non-local
diffusion problems in peridynamics, for example. Efficiently dealing with such
problems requires constructing local, stable bases, preconditioners, and other
similar tools. To address such problems, the PIs plan to use their recently
discovered highly localized stable kernel-based bases to develop novel kernel-
based meshless Galerkin methods. The PIs plan to further develop the full
potential of these recently discovered basis functions, and to investigate
constructing such bases in situations where boundaries or data that is not quasi
uniform occur.
