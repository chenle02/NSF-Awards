This two year program, sponsored by the University of Arizona, will offer a
three week program in techniques of instrumentation to 30 outstanding high
school chemistry teachers selection from a national pool of applicants. In the
summer program teachers will learn how scientific instruments work, how they can
be used, and what chemical processes they demonstrate. The project also supports
follow up activities by providing components for the instruments, by providing
curriculum materials for the workshops, and by arranging for industrial mentors
to help the teachers conduct the workshops. The matching funds from the
university and participating schools amount to about 25% of the NSF grant.
