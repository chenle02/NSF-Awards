9700680 Fung This project involves the further development and implementation of
new nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques and their application to the
study of liquid crystals of current interest, viz., ferroelectric and
antoferroelectric systems. The NMR data will be combined with Fourier Transform
Infrared (FTIR) results to be generated through a collaboration with colleagues
at the University of Colorado. This comprehensive approach will be used to
advance a theoretical modeling approach that will contribute to the
understanding of molecular conformations and interactions on the phase behavior
of liquid crystals, and perhaps to the formulation of new low-viscosity nematic
mixtures. %%% The synthesis and properties of new liquid crystal systems are
playing an increasingly important role in advancing a number of applications
areas that include new materials for infrared and microwave liquid crystal
modulators, and fast-switching liquid crystal displays. Furthermore, since the
phase behavior of liquid crystal mixtures formulated to optimize certain
materials properties is often complicated and unpredictable, the focus of these
studies should advance significantly the use of these systems for industrial
uses. ***
