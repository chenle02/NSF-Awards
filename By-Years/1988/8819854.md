The primary objective of this U.S.-Bulgaria cooperative mathematics project
between Dr. David Eisenbud of Brandeis University and Dr. Luchezar Avramov of
the University of Sofia is to jointly pursue several problems that lie at the
heart of contemporary research in algebra and algebraic geometry. Efforts will
address the theory of free resolutions as a means of deriving invariants of
geometric structures algebraically. Homological methods will be used to extend
contemporary experience in non-commutative algebra and general ring theory.
Additionally, the researchers will examine the construction of cohomological
invariants in relation to underlaying algebraic variety. Collectively, results
of the new work should extend present knowledge in a number of related
mathematical fields centering around algebraic geometry and commutative and non-
commutative algebra, potentially yielding contributions to important topics like
string theory and topology. This mathematics project fulfills the program
objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the
United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool
resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
