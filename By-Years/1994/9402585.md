This three-year award will support U.S.-France cooperative research between
Yorai Wardi of the Georgia Institute of Technology and Jean-Marie Proth of the
French National Institute for Computer Science and Applied Mathematics (INRIA)
in Metz, France. Their objective is to investigate optimization problems
frequently found in the preliminary design and management of manufacturing
systems. Problems related to production lines, job-shop systems, `Just-In-Time`
systems, and assembly systems will be addressed. They will use Petri nets for
developing fast and efficient simulation-based optimization algorithms. Petri
nets are considered a powerful simulation tool for modeling and evaluation of
modern manufacturing systems. In this proposal Petri nets are linked to
sensitivity analysis and optimization of manufacturing systems. The U.S.
investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in analysis of dynamic
systems and in numerical models for the optimization of manufacturing systems.
This is complemented by the French investigator's significant research in Petri
nets in manufacturing. In combining these techniques, the proposed research
could lead to the development of novel design methods for complex manufacturing
systems.
