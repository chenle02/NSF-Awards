This research, part of the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, is designed
to investigate the mechanisms of oscillating chemical reactions. This work is
expected to lead to new insights into the basic dynamics of oscillating
reactions as well as the chemistry of the systems involved. Information will
also be obtained about the aqueous sulfur chemistry which is of environmental
and industrial importance. The first chemical oscillator to be investigated is
the methylene-blue-catalyzed oxidation of sulfur-containing ions by oxygen in a
continuous-flow, stirred tank reactor. A major role will be to sort out the
importance in this system of kinetic nonlinearities related to autocatalysis
and/or inhibition. In addition, the mechanism of both catalyzed and uncatalyzed
bromine-ion-driven oscillators will be examined. An attempt will be made to
interpret the well-documented appearance of aperiodicity in stirred tank
reactors in terms of coupling between areas of different composition in the
reactor resulting from imperfect mixing.
