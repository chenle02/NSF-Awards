Dr. Lynda Johnson has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Johnson's doctoral degree was from the California Institute of
Technology under the supervision of Professor Robert Grubbs. Dr. Johnson intends
to continue research at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill under
the sponsorship of Professor Maurice Brookhart. As a postdoctoral fellow, Dr.
Johnson will extend her interest in transition metal catalysts to late-metal,
electrophilic systems. Longer term, she plans to explore the synthesis and
catalytic reactivity of coordinatively unsaturated organocobalt alkoxide
complexes. %%% The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as an
important infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge and
experience of new Ph.D.s and attract them into meaningful careers in
contemporary chemical research and teaching.
