Continued research is proposed on MVT type Zn-Pb ore deposits in Ireland. These
deposits are related by common metal sources in underlying metasediments and a
regional hydrothermal plumbing system controlled by large fault systems. Further
research goals address: (1) the chemistry and isotopic characteristics of the
metal-rich fluid, (2) the cause of oxidation of metasediments underlying major
ore deposits (i.e. is this related to reduction of sea water sulfate?), (3)
geographic controls on sulfur isotope chemistry in locally-derived sulfur-rich
fluids. Specific objectives include (1) mineralogic, fluid inclusion, and
isotope studies of feeder veins, (2) background studies of unaltered meta-
sediments to evaluate alteration associated with mineralization, (3) detailed
studies of oxidized metasediments to characterize the alteration fluids.
