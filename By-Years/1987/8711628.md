When the Atmosphere of the earth is disturbed and heated by energetic particle
impact it responds much like a pond when a stone is dropped in it. Waves
propagate from the source of the disturbance. These waves, identified as gravity
waves, have the potential to impart energy and momentum to the atmosphere
depending upon how they propagate. Currently, there are two ideas on how these
waves propagate: the first is that the spectrum of waves are breaking and
causing turbulence: the second is that the waves are confined to a guide of
sorts (ducted) and travel undisturbed. The resolution of this issue is of
current concern in atmospheric sciences. The research program here has as the
objective the identification of the source regions and propagation direction of
the waves that travel through the ionosphere (Traveling Ionospheric
Disturbances). The tool that is used is an array of ionosondes arranged along a
line stretching 23 degrees from the auroral zone and including two sets of
closely spaced ionosondes used for triangulation. Progress to date indicates
support for the ducted mechanism. The PI is a highly regarded scientist who has
made innovative contributions in the use of ionosondes as a research tool. His
past record qualifies him to continue this project.
