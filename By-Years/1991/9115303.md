The objective of this workshop is to critically review and evaluate the
significant developments in geomechanics in the recent past, and to discuss and
identify the future trends that will have a significant impact on basis and
applied research in this important interdisciplinary engineering area in the
21st century. Attention will be given to new and emerging areas including
computer aided engineering, modeling and testing of a wide range of available
and new geo-materials, mechanical/in situ/centrifuge/non-destructive evaluation,
neural network models/ expert systems/fuzzy sets, manufacturing underground
space, global change and adverse geo-environmental effects.
