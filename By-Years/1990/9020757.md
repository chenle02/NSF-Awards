This research, carried out by one of the world's leading young theoretical
astrophysicists, is aimed at furthering our understanding of the large scale
structure in the universe and its origins. While the work is primarily
theoretical, it also will include an observational test of a proposed high z
supercluster. Other investigations will examine the statistical properties of
the distribution of distant matter, and the evolution of the Lyman alpha forest
of absorption lines, and the evolution of hydrodynamic instabilities relevant to
galaxy and star formation.
