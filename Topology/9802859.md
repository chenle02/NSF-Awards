9802859 Kauffman This project studies problems related to polynomial invariants
in knot theory, particularly for the Jones polynomial and its generalizations
via methods in statistical mechanics, quantum groups and quantum field theory. A
central problem about the Jones polynomial is whether its triviality implies the
triviality of the knot to which it is applied. An affirmative answer to this
question would constitute a breakthrough in our understanding of the nature of
knottedness in three-dimensional space. Mathematical ideas motivated by physical
ideas have succeeded in producing a medley of invariants of knots, links, and
three-manifolds. The investigator is in the process of extending these ideas to
knotted surfaces in four-dimensional space and to four-dimensional manifolds.
Here the discovery of new invariants would itself constitute a breakthrough in
the study of four dimensions. Such a breakthrough would have implications for
the physics of quantum gravity. The mathematical study of knots is important not
only for its own sake, but also for its applications to molecular biology and
its relationships with physics and the foundations of mathematics. The research
indicated in this project is linked with these applications and with the use of
both computer graphics and expository writing to enlarge the discussion of these
ideas in both interdisciplinary and educational contexts. By using computer
models of knots, one can study questions such as how the knot will behave if it
is coated with electrical charge (self-repelling knots), how it will appear if
it is tied with a least amount of rope for a given diameter, how the geometry of
the complement of the knot appears to an observer flying about in it, how DNA
molecules behave when moving in their cellular environment. All these directly
physical questions are, at levels that we do not yet fully understand, related
to the more algebraic methods of the polynomial invariants. Knots and Nature are
inextricably entwined. ***
