9350897 Leung The proposed work involves the further development and improvement
of a number of experiments in a Modern Optics Laboratory course emphasizing
light interactions with matter, laser properties and modern optical techniques.
The aim of the course is to enable students to make more precise measurements,
advance beyond the fundamentals and become familiar with the latest equipment.
The project is part of the planned development of an optics center at the
university. One central piece of equipment is a programmable VIS/UV
spectrophotometer. This allows students to measure accurately the oscillator
strength of rhodamine 6G in water for the experiment dealing with the classical
dispersion theory, the absorption spectrum of CdS in an experiment dealing with
band-gap energy, and the absorption spectrum of leaded glass in an experiment
concerning Faraday rotation. The light scattering experiment will be improved
with an argon-ion laser and a photon counter system. Students can measure the
intensity of light at different lasing wavelengths, as well as different
scattering angles. With a dye laser pumped with a nitrogen laser, students
measure the response time of CdS photodetectors. It is important that students
have a concept of response time of a detector. For optical filtering
experiments, students use a new optical imaging system consisting of a CCD
camera, a frame grabber and a personal computer to record the filtered images
and analyze them precisely. For an electrooptics experiment, students control
the function of a Pockels cell and analyze the state of light passing through
the cell with a computer. Finally a new experiment illustrates the powerful
technique of optical modulation and demodulation using a photoelastic modulator
and a phase-sensitive detector. ***
