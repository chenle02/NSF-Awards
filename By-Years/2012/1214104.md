With the support of the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanism Program
(CSDM) in the Chemistry Division, Professor Piotr Kaszynski of Vanderbilt
University will be developing a new and potentially broad class of organic
molecular paramagnetic semiconductors with high molecular and supramolecular
structural diversity for electronic applications, such as solar energy
harvesting. The centerpiece of the molecular design is a stable heterocyclic
radical, which is substituted with groups that promote self-organization of the
molecules into layers or columns and formation of liquid crystalline phases.
These molecular materials will be investigated for magnetic and photovoltaic
properties in which the charge transport is coupled with the magnetic properties
of the unpaired electron. The project is interdisciplinary and involves
synthesis, extensive characterization, understanding of structure-property
relationships (both molecular and supramolecular), and theoretical analysis of
new materials. The acquired knowledge will provide tools for fine-tuning of
thermal, optical, electronic and possibly magnetic properties of the proposed
materials for applications such as energy harvesting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
work will have a broad impact on several fields of modern chemistry, and will
open up access to a potentially large and versatile class of unprecedented
liquid crystals, that are of increasing interest to the scientific community and
industry as materials with potential applications in molecular electronics and
energy conversion. Realization of the project will also impact education and
scientific training of the workforce through a diverse educational experience.
Professor Kaszynski has been successful in attracting women and minority
students to his research group by maintaining a creative and supportive
environment that has fostered many careers in science and medicine.
