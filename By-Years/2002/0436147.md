Lichtenbaum Conjectures: Progress and Prospects". One purpose of the conference
is to honor Steven Lichtenbaum on the occasion of his 65-th birthday by bringing
together some of the major contributors to the field of arithmetic algebraic
geometry. The main intellectual purpose of the conference will be to evaluate
the state of progress on the famous conjectures due to Professor Lichtenbaum, as
well as to outline the prospects for future developments. It is intended that
these lectures will be accessible to both faculty and graduate students
interested in this area, and that these lectures and discussions will stimulate
understanding and future research.
