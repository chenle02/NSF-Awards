This is an award to provide support for research to be initiated by this
Presidential Young Investigator who was nominated under conditions contained in
the Program Announcement NSF 89-58. The broad goals of this investigator's
research are concerned with understanding the processes that govern the
concentrations and fate of indoor air pollutants. He plans to work on
development of fundamental information that is needed to assess and control the
physical processes that affect the quality of indoor air. He plans to apply
deterministic mathematical modeling of laboratory systems as an interpretive
framework in relating the results of experimental studies to actual indoor
environments. Results of this research are likely to be utilized in engineering
design of processes and systems to reduce the unfavorable impact of air
pollutants on occupants and provide the basis for removal of contaminants from
indoor air. Examples of indoor pollutants he plans to investigate include radon,
radon decay products and airborne particles.
