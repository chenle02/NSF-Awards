This award provides funds to aid in purchase of an automated DNA sequencer and
related equipment and software needed for sample preparation and data analysis.
Use of the instrumentation in research and training efforts will be shared by a
large group of faculty, students and postdocs. Research areas to be addressed
include regulation of surface proteins in various protozoa, gene-flow in
tropical trees, yeast gene regulation and variability in flower color. Many
research questions in biology now require use knowledge of genotypes as a basic
unit of observation. These questions span diverse fields and include hypotheses
related to protein structure and function, gene regulation, genome organization,
relationships within and among species, spatial and temporal organization of
genetic polymorphism and the exchange of gametes among populations or
individuals. Automated approaches to DNA sequencing and fragment genotyping are
faster and more accurate than the manual methods they replace, increasing the
quantity and quality of data. In addition to use in research, the faculty plan
to employ the instrument in hands-on laboratory exercises, now technically
beyond their laboratory capabilities, for both undergraduate and graduate
courses.
