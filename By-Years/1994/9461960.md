This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes an innovative
solution to the generic problem of transfer of information, logical data and
analog signals, between rotating and stationary members in a mechanical system.
In particular it applies the solution to precision measurement of torque in a
rotating shaft. The precision torque transducers available in the market are
based on more than 20 years old technology, are costly to make, and require
specialized equipment to recover the torque signal. They have a practical upper
limit to shaft speed of about 25,000 RPM. The objective of this research is to
develop a new technology for contact-less transfer of information between
rotating and stationary members in a mechanical system. In particular, it will
be directed to the goal of making precision contact-less torque transducers at
lower cost which are suitable for speeds even up to 100,000 RPM. The approach to
research is to process the analog torque signal on the rotating shaft where it
is generated, and to optically communicate the result to the stationary
subsystem. The goal of Phase I research is to build a test set-up to demonstrate
the feasibility of the proposed concept. While the opportunity in this proposal
is presented in terms of rotary shaft torque transducer application, the
developed technology will be useful for measurement of other physical variables
such as force, temperature, pressure, etc., in mechanical systems with moving
parts.
