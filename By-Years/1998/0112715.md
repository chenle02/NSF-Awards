An effective way of using increasing powerful computer systems in improving
numerical weather prediction is through ensemble forecasting. Experience shows
that the ensemble forecasts do not diverge enough so that often the true state
of the atmosphere lies outside the spread of the ensemble. In this project, the
PIs seek to broaden the spread by exploring the variability of model's climate
through the perturbation of the convective processes. The approach is to
introduce stochastic noise in cumulus parameterization schemes to account for
the sub-grid scale effects. The design of the fluctuations will be based on
high-resolution data from cloud-resolving models, radars, aircraft, and
radiosondes. These ideas will be implemented in models with different types of
complexity. The results have the potential of providing new methods for
improving ensemble forecast systems at major meteorological centers and also
leading to improved understanding of existing cumulus parameterization. This
project is being done collaboratively between Drs. Brian Mapes and Thomas
Hamill, CIRES, University of Colorado and Dr. Steven Mullen, University of
Arizona.
