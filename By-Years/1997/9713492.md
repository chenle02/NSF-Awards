This is a project to develop a model that specifies and forecasts the
conditions of the magnetospheric bow shock, magnetosheath, magnetosphere, and
ionosphere for given upstream solar wind conditions. The study extends work
currently being funded under the High Performance Computing and Communication
(HPCC) program. While this code is utilizing advanced numerical schemes to
achieve the best efficiency and accuracy, additional work is needed to apply it
to space weather objectives. The effort consists of three major components.
First, realistic physical parameters and boundary conditions will be used to
guide the model development. Second, the physical understanding of space weather
events will be used to develop other theoretical models. And third, the
investigators will compare the model output with observations for specific space
weather events. The end product of the project is a global MHD simulation code
able to both specify and forecast the state of the near-Earth space environment.
