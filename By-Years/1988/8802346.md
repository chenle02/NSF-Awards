This project involves the use of mathematical models to study the population
dynamics of species occupying a heterogeneous environment. This study could have
implication for such problems as the restoration of fish in polluted bodies of
water and the design and maintenance of wildlife refuges. The particular models
used are systems of reaction diffusion equations and it is also part of this
project to produce new theoretical results for general classes of such systems.
