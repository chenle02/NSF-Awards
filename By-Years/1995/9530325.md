The objective of the study is to investigate crustal accretion styles and
parameters in backarc setting and their differences from mid-ocean ridges. The
study has implications for ophiolites that are presumed to be generated in
backarc environments. The study will also test various models of tectonic
history of the Lau spreading center area. A multichannel seismic reflection
survey of the Lau Basin on the Ewing with a 4 km - 160 channel streamer over 9
acquisition days will be undertaken.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
