The purpose of this project is to conduct a regional cooperative program at the
Texas Engineering Experiment School in College Station, Texas for the content
and pedagogical training of twenty-four (24) under-prepared high school physics
teachers over a three year period. The project utilizes an instruction team of
experienced, highly successful high school physics teachers who have been
trained as Physics Teaching Resource Agents (PTRA's) in conjunction with physics
professors from a community college and a university. The project includes three
components. The first is a two week series of workshops conducted in the summer
which focuses on the most challenging aspects of the basic concepts taught in
the first year high school physics course. The second component, conducted in
November and March of the following academic year, is a series of follow-up
workshops on supplementary topics. The third component involves classroom and
school visits by experienced teachers to provide participants with mentoring and
assistance in the implementation and evaluation of the program.
