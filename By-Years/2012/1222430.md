Learning Mathematics of the City in The City is an exploratory project that is
developing teaching modules that engage high school students in learning
mathematics and using the mathematics they learn. Using geo-spatial
technologies, students explore their city with the purpose of collecting data
they bring back to the formal classroom and use as part of their mathematics
lessons. This place-based orientation is helping students connect their everyday
and school mathematical thinking.

Researchers are investigating the impact of place-based learning on students'
attitudes, beliefs, and self-concepts about mathematics in urban schools.
Specifically, researchers want to understand how place-based learning helps
students apply mathematics to address questions about their local environment.
Researchers are also learning about the opportunities for teaching mathematics
using carefully planned lessons enhanced by geo-spatial technologies. Data are
being collected through student interviews, classroom observations, student
questionnaires, and student work.

As the authors explain, "The use of familiar or engaging contexts is widely
accepted as productive in the teaching and learning of mathematics." By working
in urban neighborhoods with large populations of low-income families, this
exploratory project is illustrating what can be done to engage students in
mathematics and mathematical thinking. The products from the project include
student materials, software adaptations, lesson plans, and findings from their
research. These products enable further experimentation with place-based
mathematics learning and lead the way for connecting mathematical activities in
school and outside of school.
