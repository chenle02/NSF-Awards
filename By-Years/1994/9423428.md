9423428 Rowe This project is a study of the evolutionary relationships among
living crocodylians and their closest extinct relatives (eusuchians) based on
morphologic characters from the skull and postcranial skeleton. The use of
computed tomographic or CT scanning will permit study of detailed aspects of
cranial morphology and provide an additional source of characters for analysis.
%%% The study of crocodylian evolutionary relationships is significant in terms
of including for the first time both fossil and living taxa and characters from
the postcranial skeleton. Beyond establishing a phylogeny for crocodylians, this
study will investigate character evolution in relation to aquatic adaptation and
the role of differences in developmental timing (heterochrony) in crocodylian
evolution. ***
