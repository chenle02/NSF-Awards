We have isolated and sequenced a gene from petunia (GRP1) which codes for a
glycine rich structural protein (67% gly). The carboxyterminal 320 amino acids
of the protein sequences can be described by the formula Gly-X-Gly-X, and should
form a large b-pleated sheet. GRP1 is only the fourth class of structural
proteins to be identified in plants. We have found that GRP1 RNA expression is
developmentally regulated and enhanced by wounding. In addition, the predicted
amino acid sequence of GRP1 shows that it contains an optimal signal sequence
for transport out of the cytoplasm. Our working hypothesis therefore is that the
GRP1 gene product functions as a cell wall protein. In this proposal we will
determine the possible organ specificity of GRP1 RNA, determine the kinetics of
the wound response and determine at what level GRP1 RNA expression is
controlled. Using a variety of anti-GRP1 antiboidies raised against synthetic
peptide sequences specific to GRP1, we will determine: (1) the subcellular
location of the GRP1 gene product, (2) its possible organ and/or cellular
specificity and (3) monitor GRP1 protein accumulation in developing or wounded
cells. Little is known about the structural proteins of plants. Dr. Carol Condit
of the University of Georgia isolated and characterized a gene from petunia
which encodes a glycine-rich structural protein. The protein, based upon codon
usage, contains 67% glycine and a signal sequence for transport of the
cytoplasm. The epxression of the gene is enhanced by wounding. These
characteristics strongly suggest that it is a cell wall protein. Dr. Condit
proposes to extend these studies by determining the subcellular location of the
protein, determining its organ or cellular specifity and monitoring its response
to wounding. This work should result in important basic information on plant
structural proteins, wound response and mechanisms of transport in plants.
