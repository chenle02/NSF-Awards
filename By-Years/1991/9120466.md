ABSTRACT This project will examine the realtionship between language and rank
on the island of Pohnepi in Micronesia, to discover how social hierarchies are
reflected in and at the same time reconstituted through language structure and
use. The study will focus on the use of honorific forms, particularly during the
daily ceremonial practice of kava preparation and consumption (kava is non-
alcoholic, soporific beverage made from the pounded root of the piper
methysticum plant and water). Although enthnographers have noted the importance
of kava rituals throughout Oceania and their role in sustaining structures of
prestige, very little is known about the use of language in these contexts.
Preliminary investigation by the doctoral student has shown kava settings to be
particularly rich in the range of participants and linguistic choices. Through
the observation and video-recording of spontaneous kava events, this study will
investigate: a) how honorific forms are actually used by Pohnpeians in daily
practice and how the presence of honorific words affects other aspects of the
language, b) the relationship between lexical choices and the exploitation of
the social space in which verbal interaction take place, and c) the range of
competence in honorific use across generations and how such competence is
acquired.
