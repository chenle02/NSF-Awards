The Department of Mathematics and the Center for Applied Mathematics and
Statistics at the New Jersey Institute of Technology will purchase a graphics
workstation with a memory upgrade, mass storage devices, and a printer which
will be dedicated to support faculty and students research in the mathematical
and engineering sciences. The equipment will be used in support of several
projects, including in particular: 1. Chaotic behavior of infinite-dimensional
dynamical systems. 2. Simulation of Stokes flow with moving boundaries. 3.
Discrete element modeling of vibrating granular beds. 4. Automated cluster
tracking in granular shear flows.
