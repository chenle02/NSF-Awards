This application is intended to secure funding for a high-field (11.75 Tesla)
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer intended primarily for structural
and dynamic studies of biological macromolecules in aqueous solution, including
polynucleic acids, small-to-medium size (5-20 kD) proteins, enzyme-subtrate
complexes and natural products. It will also be used for spectroscopic analysis
of synthetic targets and intermediates the resonances of which are not
sufficiently resolved for detailed structural work at lower field strengths. The
instrument will be accessible to all members of the physical science departments
at Brandeis University (Chemistry, Biochemistry, Physics, Rosenteil Basic
Medical Sciences) who require the use of high sensitivity/high resolution NMR in
the course of their research. For all of the projects described in the body of
this application, the spectrometer is required to perform NMR structure/dynamics
experiments which would be impossible to do on our present equipment, either
because of time or resolution limitations on the Redfield group spectrometer,
time/sensitivity/resolution limitations on the Varian XL300, or hardware
limitations on both.
