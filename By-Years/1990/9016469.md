Melanins are a class of cellular pigments found in the tissues of organisms.
Neuromelanin, a product of catecholamines metabolism, is a pigment found in the
central nervous system of some mammals, including man. The catecholamines
involved in the production of neuromelanin are two neurotransmitters, dopamine
and norepinephrine. The function of neuromelanin is unknown but there is
indirect evidence that it may be important in determining the behavior of
aminergic neurons, particularly those neurons involved in the genesis of
Parkinsonism. The goal of this project is to determine the role of neuromelanin
by studying the pigment in vivo, using the scanning tunnelling electron
microscopy and magnetic resonance imaging techniques. With these techniques it
should be possible to monitor changes in the paramagnetic and semiconductor
properties of the pigment and relate them to different functional states of the
neurons. This investigation will increase the understanding of this
neurochemical which may be involved with the cause and treatment of Parkinson's
disease and neuropsychiatric disorders.
