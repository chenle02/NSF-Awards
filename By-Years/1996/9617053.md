This project will bring together researchers who have conducted investigations
on the January 17, 1994 Northridge earthquake with other researchers and
professionals in a conference to be held in Los Angeles on the third anniversary
of the earthquake. The conference will consider the main scientific and
technical findings of the Northridge earthquake research, the important
conclusions reached for assessing and reducing seismic hazards posed by future
events, and critical gaps in our current knowledge that need to be addressed by
new research. To accelerate the dissemination and utilization of research
results, a multi-volume proceedings will be compiled. This document will provide
an interdisciplinary overview of research undertaken as part of the National
Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program's response to the most damaging of U.S.
earthquakes. Also, research summaries and other Northridge earthquake materials
will be provided on the World Wide Web.
