This project focuses upon the creation of an interactive physical sciences
computer lab at Trident's Main Campus, as well as the incorporation of computers
into the physics labs for data acquisition and analysis. The use of the
interactive physical sciences computer lab, which supports both chemistry and
physics, has been integrated with assignments in the chemistry and physics wet
labs to reinforce concepts and provide students a more comprehensive
understanding of entry-level and college transfer physical sciences. This
approach encourages further exploration and practice on the part of the students
so they can proceed to more complicated experiments in a safe environment. A
computer interfaced with traditional laboratory equipment in the physics labs
enables the student to store, manipulate, and retrieve data from any particular
experiment. Through the use of innovative and integrated course delivery between
the existing wet labs and the proposed interactive lab, students become more
involved in sciences, develop a better knowledge base from which to progress to
upper level courses, and they become more confident in pursuing a science-
related career path. The proposed approach of combining lecture, wet lab, and
computer lab in the teaching of physical sciences provides the student with an
integrated learning environment.
