9806702 Calvetti The numerical solution of image processing problems gives rise
to very large nonsymmetric linear systems whose solutions are extremely
sensitive to perturbations in the data. To avoid or at least contain the
disastrous effects of such instability regularization is required.
Regularization yields slightly modified problems which are less sensitive to
inaccuracies in the data. The aim of the research by the investigator and her
colleague is to develop effective and efficient regularization methods for the
solution of large nonsymmetric linear systems that arise in image processing
applications, as well as to develop new algorithms for image compression. The
new numerical methods will be tested on medical imaging data and will be applied
to interventional magnetic resonance imaging in collaboration the department for
Biomedical Engineering at Case Western Reserve University.
