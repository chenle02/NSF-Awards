Three basic classes of heme containing enzymes, peroxidases, oxygenases and
oxidases, each play a critical role in a number of biological processes. As with
any class of enzyme, a thorough understanding of structure-function
relationships is not possible without crystallographic information. To date the
crystal structure of only three heme-containing enzymes are known. Dr. Poulos
plans to build on what he has learned from the determination of the cytochrome c
peroxidase, catalase and cytochrome P450 structures. He will explore in greater
depth the structure-function relationship in these enzymes. The study will
contribute to the body of understanding of electron transfer processes and heme-
enzyme function.***//
