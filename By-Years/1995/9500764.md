This one-year award supports planning and initiation of a U.S.- U.K.
cooperative research project in environmental engineering. The researchers are
Michael Semmens and John Gulliver at the University of Minnesota, Thomas
Stephenson at Cranfield University and Andrew Livingston at Imperial College in
the United Kingdom. They plan a cooperative research project on the technical
and economic feasibility of using membranes for gas transfer in water and
wastewater treatment applications. The objective is to identify how design and
operating conditions influence overall process performance and economics of
biological and gas transfer processes. The U. S. investigators have developed
new gas-permeable hollow-fiber membranes for the transfer of gases such as
oxygen into water. This is complemented by British expertise on applications of
membrane technology in biological waste treatment and chemical separation
processes. The joint effort has potential for improving a delivery system for
pure oxygen in the treatment of wastewaters.
