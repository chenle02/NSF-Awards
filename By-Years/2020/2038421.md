The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a surge in demand and shortages of
clinical and non-clinical personnel to treat patients in long term care
facilities. Long term care facilities have proven to be hotspots for COVID-19
outbreaks and medical personnel in these facilities themselves faced increased
risk of disease, making staffing decisions very difficult. This Rapid Response
Research (RAPID) project will collect data on staffing, disease prevalence, and
absenteeism from a centralized authority that oversees staffing in these
facilities. These data will help support better decision support tools to
dynamically match medical staff with different skills and preferences to long
term care facilities on a daily basis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Working with the
the Massachusetts Executive Office of Elder Affairs, the project will collect
and archive data from the long term care facility portal on daily needs for
clinical and non-clinical medical staff, job applications, absenteeism rates,
facility testing data, as well as qualitative information from daily state-wide
phone conference status updates. The data collected as part of this project will
be valuable in improving the dynamic matching process for regional staffing of
long term care facilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
