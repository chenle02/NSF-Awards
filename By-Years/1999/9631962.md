9631962 Etzel The overall goal of this proposal is to develop an experimentally
based model that describes the sorption of proteins from complex biological
fluids, e.g., human blood, onto affinity membranes, and from this model, the
elution process that follows. The sorption characteristics of the four human IgG
proteins on an immobilized protein G membrane will be determined, a model
developed, and experimental breakthrough times compared with model predictions
for each protein. The second aim of the proposal is to determine the effect of
naturally-occurring components of human plasma on the sorption model. Components
such as other proteins, sugars, salts, and lipids may have much lower affinities
but are generally present in larger quantities. Finally, the proposal aims to
develop a mathematical model of the elution of the protein from the affinity
ligand. This model will be valuable in optimizing the process variables, e.g.,
pore size, flow rate, etc. ***
