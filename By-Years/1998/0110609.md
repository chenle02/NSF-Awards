0110609&lt;br/&gt;Stith&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the major event of
fertilization is known to be the release of intracellular calcium, the exact
cause of this calcium release is unknown. Activation of phospholipase C appears
to be required for the release of calcium at fertilization; however, it is not
known how this enzyme is activated. One possible path to activation of
phospholipase C may be through another lipid signaling path. In an effort to
quantify various lipid signaling paths, it has been noted that the mass of
sphingomyelin, phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylinositol decrease whereas
choline, IP3, DAG and phosphatidic acid increase (phosphatidylethanolamine and
phosphatidylserine do not change) during Xenopus fertilization. From these data
and others, it is suggested that phospholipase D plays an important role in
fertilization. Phosphatidic acid is a product of the reaction catalyzed by
phospholipase D. Phosphatidic acid may be required for membrane fusion events
(e.g.: sperm-egg merger, cortical granule-plasma membrane merger) and the DAG
increase (since phosphatidic acid can be dephosphorylated to DAG) at
fertilization. Most importantly, phosphatidic acid binds to and activates
phospholipase C; thus, phosphatidic acid from sperm or that produced in the
newly formed zygote may induce the central event of fertilization: the increase
in intracellular calcium. Through the use of exogenous phosphatidic acid, or
inhibition of phospholipase D, the role of this enzyme and the product
phosphatidic acid in fertilization will be examined.&lt;br/&gt;
