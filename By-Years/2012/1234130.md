The research objective of this award is to study, a new class of nanocomposite
materials termed covetics, and compare their behavior to their respective base
materials. The nanocomposites consist of a metal matrix and carbon nanofillers
which are combined with metal in a new way. The carbon-metal bond is strong and
the carbon does not separate out during remelting, laser ablasion or magnetron
sputtering. Preliminary results have shown that these materials exhibit some
unique structural features and deformation behaviors not seen in traditional
metals, and have superior properties to the base metals. However, fundamental
knowledge of these materials is lacking. The proposed university-industry
collaborative project between the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and
Third Millennium Metals, LLC will address the multi-scale experimental study of
the structure and composition, and mechanical, thermal and electrical properties
of these materials. These will serve as inputs and validation for multi-scale
modeling of these newly discovered materials.

If successful, these studies would lead to a fundamental understanding of these
new materials, would stimulate further research on covetics, and facilitate a
transition from scientific discovery to commercialization and applications
including energy, thermal management, transportation, and environment. The
proposed research may potentially lead to new discoveries regarding material
structure, bonding, and/or new deformation mechanisms. The knowledge gained
would lead to more accurate predictions of properties of nanocomposites, new
materials? designs, and more reliable structures, in general. The educational
plan focuses on course development and incorporation of findings of this
research into existing courses on materials. The results will be published and
course notes will be posted on the NSF NanoHub website.
