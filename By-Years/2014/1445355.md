The failure causes and mechanisms of lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries are crucial
in improving the reliability of batteries used in hybrid vehicles, military and
aerospace applications. Failure analysis of Li-ion battery cells is a very
challenging task that can be further complicated by the disturbance of failure
modes by any destructive measurement methods. Conducting an accurate, non-
destructive failure analysis is the desire of every Li-ion battery manufacturer,
OEM, dealer, and end-customer. Destructive measurement methods, which ultimately
render the battery inoperable, are currently employed as a means to determine
root cause of failure. Non-destructive test methods, such as load analysis,
currently provide little insight as to why or how a Li-ion battery is failing.
The proposed technology offers the customer a repeatable, non-destructive
methodology of digital measurement that is capable of qualifying or quantifying
material damage at a multilevel fashion. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed
innovation is a battery failure testing system for evaluating potential failure
modes and identifying root causes of concern within Li-Ion batteries. This
system consists of software and hardware. The software includes a series of
computer simulation programs based on unique algorithms and the concept of
applying material damage mechanism into computer simulation. The hardware is
composed of a series of fixtures, working platforms, instruments, and computers.
The digital measurement technology proposed in this project is a novel
methodology with the following unique features: (1) quantification of material
damage in a multilevel way, (2) effective reconstruction of material defects
with consideration of surface roughness, (3) accurate de-noising for high
precision metrology, and (4) multilevel finite element meshing for supporting
multi-scale/multi-physics simulation based on digital measurement data.
