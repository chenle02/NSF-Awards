Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Design in power-limited scaling era.
This proposal presents a general framework of minimization of power and energy
in digital CMOS integrated circuits. This proposal presents a framework for
designing digital circuits to either minimize power/energy dissipation for given
performance or maximize the performance under power/energy constraints. The
problem is defined at the circuit level, but is also expanded to include the
device, microarchitecture and system levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This framework
will be used in designing signal processing blocks for communications and
storage systems. The particular applications targeted are iterative decoders for
turbo and low-density parity check
decoding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this proposed project are
twofold: 1) to widen the education in digital integrated circuits including
power, energy, as well as robustness as key determining variables within digital
integrated circuit designs and 2) to include these areas within the revised
edition of a widely used textbook in Digital Integrated Circuit. My education
plans aim at providing a solid analytical background and design intuition for
our students in the design of digital circuits and systems. &lt;br/&gt;
