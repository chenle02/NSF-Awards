The investigators will study a collection of problems in combinatorial analysis
of stochastic structures on trees. Specific topics include random fields and
discrete spatial processes, Markov properties of random fields, critical random
walk in random environment on trees, and random fields on trees and conditioned
branching processes. These topics are in the field of probability theory.
