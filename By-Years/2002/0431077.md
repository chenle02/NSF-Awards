Technical abstraction boundaries, such as the layers of the OSI model, have
been instrumental in the evolution of high performance/power hungry information
networks in the past. However, they are currently representing a bottleneck to
the development of the large distributed networks such as networks of embedded
systems, unmanned vehicles, robots and sensor networks. These networks could
have tremendous impact on our society, making it easier to manage and safer.
Deploying existing wireless and processor technology in these applications can
be dangerous because of the cost of keeping them operative, because of the
difficulties in managing them on large scales and because of their vulnerability
of the systems to power outages. This research is motivated by the need of a
solid scientific framework and a practical set of algorithms that surpass the
limiting architectural models used in the present technology and provide working
solutions for these new emerging applications.&lt;br/&gt; To address this
problem this research uses the concept of cooperation at the physical layer as
the guiding principle for removing some traditional design boundaries that limit
networks scalability and also as a systematic methodology to develop cross-layer
solutions. The main partition removed is the network abstraction of "point to
point communications", where the information from every source is encoded and
transmitted independently and it is received and processed independently. The
cooperative networking reference model studied in this research changes all this
by allowing the nodes to collaborate in compressing/elaborating the data and in
transmitting them. Cooperation seems appropriate in networking sensors, unmanned
robots, embedded systems since all the nodes of these networks naturally
complement each other activities and information. The study addresses the
cooperative modulation, channel acquisition and data compression
problems.&lt;br/&gt; Level of effort&lt;br/&gt;To compress the projects tasks in
one year of activity and encompass the main research objectives of our project
we will dedicate our focused effort to solve the key issues of channel
acquisition, link control and decentralized multiple access in the physical
layer cooperative channel model. The aim is to build a new reference model for
cooperative networks that clarifies the structure of the communication
architecture. A more detailed description of the issues we are going to address
is expressed in our original "Statement&lt;br/&gt;of Work" [c.f. Section 2.2 in
the proposal] and specifically in the first three research tasks described
therein. By addressing them we will set the solid framework for the development
of fully cooperative and decentralized network architectures. Other research
items will be left for future projects.
