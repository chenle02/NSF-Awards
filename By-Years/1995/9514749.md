Audrey Light Ohio State University SBR-9514749 The research will analyze the
effect of schooling on job turnover. There is little consensus in the economics
profession about whether job turnover is higher or lower among more highly
educated young individuals. One of the questions to be investigated is whether
whatever compels a young person to stay in school also compels him to stay with
his employer. An alternative question to be investigated is whether young people
go to school instead of looking for the "right" job. If this is true, job
turnover may increase later. The answer to these and other related education/job
turnover research questions could affect future education policies. The research
will use 1979-94 data on young people, covering both males and females, whites,
blacks and Hispanics. It will employ sophisticated econometric techniques to
separate individual effects from education effects.
