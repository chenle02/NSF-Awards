This award provides funds to the Department of Biological Sciences at the
University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee to purchase equipment to interface state-of-
the-art physiological modules with computers to permit interactive,
multidimensional analysis of basic physiological principles in undergraduate
anatomy and physiology courses. Instrumentation to be purchased includes four
computer interfacing units (SPI) that will interface with the physiology module
packages (four) containing dual-trace oscilloscopes; respiration and blood
pressure modules; EKG, EEG, and force- transducer modules; strain gauge
preamplifiers etc.; four IBM compatible computers, printers and appropriate
mobile workstation units and commercially available software for use with the
interfacing equipment. This project will make physiological data acquisition,
storage, retrieval and interaction more dynamic and interactive than ever before
possible in teaching laboratories, and the experience that every undergraduate
needs to be exposed to in an outstanding physiology curriculum. The grantee is
matching this award with non-Federal sources.
