Like humans, rats make rational causal inferences from their interactions with
the world. The goal of the current project is to understand the cognitive and
neural mechanisms of causal cognition in humans by studying these processes in
rats. The theoretical frameworks used (causal model theory and causal Bayes
nets) are parallel to those developed to account for rational causal cognition
in humans and the development of these processes in children. Major questions
include: Do rats engage in rational reasoning processes about cause-effect
relationships? How do rats reason about absent events, such as hidden causes?
What is the role of goal-directed action in the ability to draw rational
inferences? Answers to these questions can extend our knowledge of the
distribution of causal cognition among mammals and can lead to new insights into
the cognition and neuroscience of self identity, freedom of choice and action,
event cognition, and a theory of agency, all of which play a central role in how
individuals reason.

The principal investigators also serve as faculty mentors in three programs for
high-school students from diverse backgrounds in the greater Los Angeles area,
providing the students with university research apprenticeships.
