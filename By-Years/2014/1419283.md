The award supports the attendance of fifty US-based students to attend the sixth
Federated Logic Conference (FLoC 14) which will be held in Vienna, Austria, in
July 2014, as part of the Vienna Summer of Logic (VSL 14). The federated logic
conference is an event which brings together ten major international conferences
in the area of Formal Methods, and around 75 satellite workshops. While the
participating conferences are normally held individually by their local
conference organization on an annual basis, they all agree to this joint and
federated event to be held every three-four years.

Enhancing the security, privacy, usability, and reliability of computing systems
is widely accepted as one the grand challenges facing the computing-research
community. Formal Methods have emerged as one of the primary approaches towards
that goal. A federated conference provides an opportunity for accelerating
research via synergy between the different strands of research in Formal
Methods. It is also an outstanding training opportunity for young researchers,
as it offers them a grand view of the whole area.
