This is an SBIR Phase I award for the investigation of a new electro-optic
modulator based on polymer gelatin waveguide on metal thin film. In Phase I a
gelatin waveguide modulation will be demonstrated on Au/Alumina substrates. The
success of this research project will generate a great impact on passive and
active electro-optic systems. The proposed concept has high potential for
commercial applications in optical communication and processing.
