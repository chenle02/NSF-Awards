This project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program
is in the area of organometallic chemistry. The focus of the project is
metallacycle complexes which play an important role as intermediates in numerous
organometallic reactions such as cycloadditions of alkynes and olefin
metathesis. The goal is the development of new transition metal-mediated
cyclizations involving a carbene moiety and two equivalents of alkyne. Such a
reaction is fundamentally different than the Pauson-Khand reaction and would
ultimately allow for novel intramolecular cyclizations in which acyclic
precursors are converted to fused tricyclic ring systems. The general approach
will involve the formation of a metallacyclopentadiene-carbene intermediate
either by the introduction of a carbene or carbene precursor onto a
metallacyclopentadiene complex, or by the formation of a metallacycle from a
complex already containing a carbene precursor. The development of an efficient
cycloaddition reaction of the type under investigation would simplify greatly
the laboratory synthesis of a wide variety of biologically important organic
compounds.
