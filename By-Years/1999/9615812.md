This goal of this proposal is to convene two international workshops
incorporating social and natural scientists in order to examine how small-scale
societies, such as the Labrador Inuit, have responded to long- and short -term
climate fluctuation in the North Atlantic region. The collaborators all conduct
research in the North Atlantic region and conceive of their individual study
areas as regional monitoring sites in which chronology, climate, subsistence,
and technological issues can be examined. The study sites range from northern
Greenland to Newfoundland. This region is strongly influenced by El Nino
effects, and ice core data afford exceptional climate records for comparisons
with human settlement and resource changes over time.
