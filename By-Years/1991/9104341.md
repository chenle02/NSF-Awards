This award funds a postdoctoral research fellowship in plant biology for two
years. The project entitled "Biosynthesis of N- acylphosphatidylethanolamine" is
to be carried out in the laboratory of Dr. Thomas Moore at Louisiana State
University. The fellow's Ph.D. thesis work concerned the cell biology of
glyoxysomes in cotton. In his postdoctoral training, Dr. Chapman will focus on
the biochemistry of lipid biosynthesis in soybean. The Postdoctoral Fellowships
in Plant Biology are designed to increase the number of outstanding young
investigators in plant biology.
