IRI-9626345 Buchanan, Bruce University of Pittsburgh $24,995 - 12 mos WORKHOP ON
EVALUATION OF KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS This grant is to provide partial funding
for a Workshop on Evaluation of Knowledge-Based Systems, to be held December
7-8, 1995 at the National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, Maryland. The purpose
of this meeting is to clarify the questions and tradeoffs involved in evaluating
knowledge-based software designed to assist decision-makers in contexts
involving human health and welfare. These principles will have applications to
all knowledge-based systems, but the acuteness of the need is most apparent in
deployments that directly involve human life. Knowledge-based systems are
complex pieces of software, so empirical studies are necessary to predict their
performance. The workshop will bring together many persons who have undertaken
systematic evaluations of such systems to share their knowledge and develop
principled approaches to such evaluation.
