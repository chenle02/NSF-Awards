This starter grant award to Occidental College will support the research of
Professor Eileen M. Spain. The theme of the research is the study of transition
metal chalcogenide thin films deposited by pulsed laser vaporization, which can
produce high kinetic energy species. To understand the issues of film growth and
nucleation with high kinetic energy species, two modern experimental techniques
are employed. Film topography is measured by atomic force microscopy and the
experimental parameters that produce crystalline films are determined. With
single-photon ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, the identity, kinetic
energy distribution, and relative concentration of the plasma species that
affect the deposited film properties are measured. This research will advance
the fundamental understanding of materials issues underlying the growth of thin
films. Such films are the basis for fabrication of submicron electronic devices
composed of various metal and metal-containing layers, a technology of intense
interest in the microelectronics industry.
