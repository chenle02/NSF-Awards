This is funding to subsidize travel and housing expenses of students selected to
participate in the Student Research Workshop to be held in conjunction with the
2nd Annual Meeting of the North American Chapter of the Association for
Computational Linguistics (NAACL-2001), which will take place June 3-7, 2001 in
Pittsburgh. The intimate workshop format will encourage student participants to
begin building a rapport with established researchers. Students will have
sufficient time to present their research (25 minutes) and then receive feedback
from a panel of established researchers in the field (15 minutes). The workshop
will provide students with invaluable exposure to outside perspectives on their
work at a critical time in their research, and will also allow them to put their
work into perspective based on feedback from the panel and from fellow
participants.
