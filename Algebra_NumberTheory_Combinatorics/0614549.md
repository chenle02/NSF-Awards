A five day conference on category theory and it applications in memory of
Saunders Mac Lane will be held on April 7--April 11, 2006 at the University of
Chicago. Its themes will be: 1. The influence of the work of Saunders Mac Lane,
2. The current status of category theory, 3. Recent applications of category
theory. The third theme will be the primary mathematical focus. There is much
interesting work in category theory going on in other countries that is little
known in the United States. Several leading foreign experts will participate.
The conference will highlight recent work aimed directly at applications in
differential geometry (and hence to mathematical physics) and in algebraic
topology.

The conference will in large part be a memorial tribute to Mac Lane, who was one
of the most influential American mathematicians and died last year at age 95. He
spent most of his career at Chicago. Mac Lane and his collaborator Eilenberg
created the subject of category theory. Mac Lane was interested both in the
internal development of category theory and in its development with a view
towards applications in other areas of mathematics. The conference at Chicago
will help make manifest how these are intertwined and will heighten the
visibility of the subject. This is something that MacLane greatly desired in his
lifetime. More information can be found on the conference homepage
