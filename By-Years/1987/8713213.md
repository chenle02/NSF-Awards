"The Application of Optical Disc Technology for Archiving Large Meteorological
and Oceanographic Data Sets" The goal of this project is to explore the
feasibility of using compact discs as a medium for the storage of large data
sets that can be used on a variety of computer systems ranging from
microcomputers to superminicomputers. The project is part of the UNIDATA
(University Data) program, a community initiative designed to help universities
employ modern computing and networking technologies to access, analyze and
display atmospheric and related data. Under a previous grant, the Principal
Investigator was successful in creating several compact discs which are
undergoing initial testing in the community. The major activity under this award
will be the development of the necessary interfaces with the UNIDATA Local Data
Management System so that compact discs can be used on a variety of local
computer systems. This project is important to atmospheric scientists who
routinely deal with voluminous data sets in their research. The compact disc
technology offers the potential for as an inexpensive, reliable, and efficient
means of data access.
