Postharvest technology is recognized as the means to increase crop productivity
by decreasing loss due to mishandling and decay. Thus, in a time of increasing
population and decreasing production `tools,` it has become critically important
to impart to students of agronomic and horticultural curricula a practical
knowledge of postharvest technology. The postharvest technology effort of the
Crop Science Department has been severely hampered by a lack of controlled
temperature storage. This project provides the moneys to purchase three
controlled-environment chambers to be used in the department's undergraduate
instruction. The chambers allow the development of more meaningful laboratory
exercises and demonstrations for the course, Fruit Science/Vegetable Science
421: Postharvest Technology of Horticultural Crops. The chambers also allow a
much broader range of senior project (required undergraduate research) and
special problems topics to be offered to both traditional and underrepresented
students who desire careers in agriculture outside that of field management.
Agriculture has become a highly technical industry. The acquisition of
controlled-temperature chambers allows the university to better educate students
in hands-on, practical aspects of postharvest technology.
