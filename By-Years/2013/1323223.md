Dartmouth College is awarded a grant to fund a workshop in support of the
Partnership for Undergraduate Life Science Education (PULSE) initiative. The
PULSE partners hope to transform undergraduate life science education through a
variety of national efforts to help implement recommendations made in the 2011
Vision and Change report. One outcome from this effort was the announcement of
40 Vision and Change Leadership Fellows in September, 2012.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Vision and Change Leadership Fellows are exploring
ways to encourage departments to reward faculty member's efforts to improve
undergraduate life sciences education. These efforts to improve teaching should
increase student learning, should increase retention rates for students in the
life sciences, and should prepare all students to be more curious and
scientifically literate citizens. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current award is to
fund a workshop for eleven of the Fellows who are part of the ?Taking the Pulse?
working group. The working group plans to help departments use existing
assessment evidence and design new tools to evaluate progress in departmental
efforts to implement Vision and Change recommendations. This working group is
developing a recognition or certification system for undergraduate biology
departments that have adopted recommendations in the Vision and Change Report.
The workshop organizers plan to develop specific criteria of what a future
"transformed" department might look like; design an accreditation model for
certification; assemble a rubric for certification; and begin to share the
products of this workshop with the life sciences community, primarily via the
www.pulsecommunity.org website.
