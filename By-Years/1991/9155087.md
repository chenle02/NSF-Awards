The Brooklyn Campus of Long Island University will initiate a six- week,
commuter Young Scholars project in Molecular Biology for 16 students entering
grades 10-12. The program will emphasize student participation in the basic
techniques in molecular biology including isolation of DNA, DNA cloning,
restriction enzyme analysis, Southern blotting, hybridization, expression
screens, etc. Experiments will be supplemented with lectures about the
methodology employed, data analysis, and selected topics in molecular biology
(i.e., structure of macromolecules, gene regulation, etc.). Participants will
utilize the knowledge they have gained to perform an independent research
project during the final 2-3 weeks of the program.
