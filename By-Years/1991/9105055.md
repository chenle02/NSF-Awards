The principal investigator will (1) study fluid connectivity and fluid-assisted
diffusive transport in rocks at elevated temperatures and pressures, (2) apply
experimental and analytical techniques he has developed for measuring
crystal/fluid partition coefficients to a broad suite of minerals, and (3)
evaluate the suitability of ion-beam depth profiling techniques to study
diffusion in minerals. Results of this investigation will help geologists
understand fundamental processes occurring in the Earth.
