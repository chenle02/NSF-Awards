A 300 MHz Fourier Transform Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectrometer (FTNMR) is
being purchased for use throughout the chemistry curriculum, beginning in the
first year. In freshman chemistry a simple reversible photolysis is being
studied as a possible solar energy storage vehicle. Sophomore organic chemistry
students are using the instrument for mechanistic studies, indentification of
compounds and undertaking multiple pulse sequence experiments. Students in upper
level courses are investigating phase changes, rotational barriers, reaction
rates, equilibria, and advanced nmr techniques.
