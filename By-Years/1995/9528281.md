9528281 Lindeman "Enabling Faculty Development in Indiana Extending the
Advantages of the Internet" Indiana University requests support from NSF for two
connections to the Internet through the INDnet regional network. One connection
will serve Martin University in Indianapolis and the other connection will serve
Ivy Tech College at Logansport. INDnet is a regional network located in the
state of Indiana that will provide operations and network information services.
It will provide Martin University and Ivy Tech College with a connection to the
Internet, a collection of interoperable networks that connect most research and
education organizations in the United States. The institutions need the Internet
connections to be able to access information resources throughout the state, the
nation and the world. The connections will benefit the students, faculty and
staff of Martin University and Ivy Tech College.
