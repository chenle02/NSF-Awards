St. Philip's College (SPC), a public, two-year Historically Black College and
Hispanic Serving Institution in San Antonio, Texas, launched a new Cyber
Security: Cyber First Responder Program with funding support from the National
Science Foundation. The project's goal is to educate and prepare cyber first
responders to increase the number of professionals in the information assurance
and cyber security workforce who are highly trained to prevent, detect, respond
to, and recover from cyber security incidents impacting one or more
organizations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project's activities include
professional development for SPC college faculty and area K-12 educators,
creation of a certificate program for emergency operations personnel,
development of curriculum leading to an Associate of Applied Science degree in
Cyber First Response, formation of collaborative agreements with 4-year
institutions to provide transitions to 4-year programs to complete a Bachelor or
higher degree, development of a secondary school component for middle and high
school students as well as the creation of a cyber-learning laboratory at SPC.
&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project is producing a skilled group of cyber first
responders capable of implementing basic cyber security prevention measures,
collaboratively identifying intrusive activity when it occurs using research-
based best practices to respond to incidents from an organizational viewpoint,
and implementing innovative approaches to resolve incidents that impact more
than a single organization. As a result, this project is leading to the
development of a model cyber first responder program that may be replicated at
other institutions. Additionally, it creates and optimizes a regional network of
productive cyber first responder partnerships between academia, businesses, and
industries in South Texas and the nation.
