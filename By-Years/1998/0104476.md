This project provides for international technology assessments and related
workshop and staff support. While a division of Loyola College, the World
Technology Evaluation Center conducted over 50 such technology assessments using
a peer review methodology that many believe is the best single method for
evaluation of research and development abroad. The objectives include seeking
technologies to transfer to the U.S., evaluating the position of U.S. science
and technology with respect to leading competitors, and seeking opportunities
for international cooperation in research.
