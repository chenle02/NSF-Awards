Orchard Efficient compression of video sequences should exploit the high
interframe redundancy due to the smoothness of motion fields in typical scenes.
Current video coding algorithms use very simplistic motion models, limiting the
degree to which motion- induced redundancy can be exploited in video coding.
This research is investigating improved methods for estimating motion in video
sequences, and compensating for that motion to achieve increased coding
efficiency. Methods are being considered which estimate motion at the encoder,
requiring transmission of motion overhead, and as well as those which estimate
motion directly at the decoder. The goal is to provide a unifyied framework for
these two approaches to motion estimation, and to develop hybrid algorithms
taking advantage of the best features of both approaches.
