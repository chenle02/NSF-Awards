Population ecology is a recent approach to understanding how organizations are
born, grow, and die. Population ecologists use the term "niche" to refer to
combinations of resources that allow specific organizational forms to prosper.
As resources ebb and flow, new forms are created while old forms die. The
present research will focus on the exchange relations through which
organizations obtain resources. The researchers will model the dynamics of niche
structures by analyzing how the organizational networks that define the exchange
structure of an organizational community change over time. The organizational
community to be studied consists of U.S. commercial biotechnology firms. This is
a fruitful arena for studying organizational niches since the industry's rapid
development has spawned numerous new resources for organizing as well as a
variety of new organizational forms. Longitudinal data will be collected on the
structure and performance of organizations engaged in commercial biotechnology
as well as on the relationships among the organizations. The data will be
analyzed to specify how patterns of interorganizational ties have influenced the
structure and life chances of biotechnology firms. The results will lead to a
theoretical sharpening of the "niche" idea, as well as enhance or understanding
of organizational dynamics.
