This award will provide funds to the Department of Natural Sciences at South
Carolina State College to establish a Research Experiences for Undergraduates
(REU) SITE. The focus of the program will be to expand the independent research
capabilities of primarily minority undergraduate science majors, provide
interactive opportunities for REU students with career research scientists, and
to stimulate and prepare students for successful graduate studies and research
careers. Research projects will be unified around an aquatic ecology theme, but
students will have great flexibility in choosing projects. The locations of
cooperating institutions; the Marine Resources Research Institute (MRRI)
adjacent to coastal estuarine systems not far from the Edisto River mouth and
the Savannah River Ecology Laboratory (SREL) further inland near upper coastal
plain habitats will provide students with a comprehensive picture of the kinds
of research taking place along the length of an entire river system. Additional
training benefits to students will be derived from a series of ecological
excursions guided by off-site career researchers in cooperation with SREL and
MRRI. This will not only help students improve their concepts of ecosystem
interactions, but also provide for increased awareness of career options and
graduate studies through interactions with host scientists. A guest researcher
seminar series will be held at SCSC to introduce students to outside researchers
and students will present seminars of their findings.
