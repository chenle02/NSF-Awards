This project involves acquisition of a modern, user-friendly FT-NMR
spectrometer that enables the department to integrate a progressive modern
instrumentation training program into the curriculum. Undergraduates are being
introduced to NMR in organic chemistry. They gain expertise in sophisticated
techniques in their junior and senior years. The project incorporates 16 new or
improved NMR experiments throughout the organic, physical, analytical, and
inorganic courses. It has allowed creation of a new course, Advanced Practical
Organic Spectroscopy. The FT-NMR spectrometer also has a positive impact on
undergraduate research programs, as all chemistry majors are required to work
with faculty mentors on original research projects during their junior and
senior years.
