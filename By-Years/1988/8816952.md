This project investigates asymmetric seafloor spreading by determining the
amount and timing of asymmetries in an ocean basin and examining possible
correlations with other plate kinematic parameters such as age or size of
lithospheric plates or motion of plates with respect to the hot spot reference
frame. This study may prove important in establishing a link between variations
in the process of seafloor spreading at mid-ocean ridges and the motion of
lithospheric plates with respect to the deep earth interior.
