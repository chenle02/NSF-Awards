This award supports participation in the second Temple University Graduate
Student Conference in Algebra, Geometry, and Topology, taking place in
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on May 14-15, 2016. This conference will involve
more than 90 graduate students from the East Coast and beyond, with a variety of
backgrounds and research levels. The conference provides an opportunity for
graduate students to develop their academic careers at an early stage by
presenting mathematics in front of their peers. With thirty graduate student
talks on a wide range of topics and a diversity of research interests among the
plenary speakers, the conference also provides opportunities for graduate
students to learn about areas of mathematical research that are not prevalent at
their home universities. The conference provides unique opportunities for young
mathematicians to initiate collaborative research projects and to make
connections between their fields of study.

The main topics of this conference are algebra, geometry, and topology broadly
construed, with emphasis on interactions between these areas, including: knot
theory, geometric group theory, geometric structures on manifolds, differential
geometry, homotopy theory, representation theory, homological algebra, quantum
invariants of manifolds, quantum groups, and algebraic geometry. The conference
will feature over thirty talks by graduate students, both original research
talks and expository presentations. It will also include four plenary speakers
renowned for both their presentation skills and research work: Zajj Daugherty
(City College of New York) in combinatorial representation theory, Jordan
Ellenberg (Univeristy of Wisconsin) in arithmetic algebraic geometry, Elisenda
Grigsby (Boston College) in low-dimensional topology and knot theory, and Alan
Reid (University of Texas) in hyperbolic geometry and group theory.
