The Information Assurance Program (IAP) of the Informatics Research Institute
(IRI) at Idaho State is supporting two additional cohorts of undergraduate and
graduate students in Information Assurance (IA) and MBA as a part of their
existing Federal Cyber Service: Scholarship for Service (SFS)
program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A unique feature of this program is a mandatory
participation in a weekly 20-hour Practicum, generating a variety of student
research projects focused on the broad theme of organizational information asset
protection. The program is recognized for producing students possessing solid
knowledge and abilities to conduct routine IA activities such as certification
and accreditation audits. To date, thirty seven students graduated from the
program and were employed in cybersecurity positions in the federal government.
Another unique feature of the Idaho State University SFS program is a
requirement to complete three standard IA certifications: Security+, SSCP and
CISSP. An interesting aspect of the program is its integration of MBA business
skills with IA knowledge, producing rare and attractive graduates that are in
demand by hiring managers of many federal agencies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project is having an immediate impact on the cybersecurity capabilities of the
federal workforce by providing graduates with security skills to federal
agencies. Recruitment of underrepresented groups expands upon the normal
recruitment of women and minorities at ISU and is resulting in a better
diversity in the SFS program than the overall campus percentages. Both PIs have
developed a very active partnership with Hampton University, an HBCU, which is
creating a strong minority pipeline to the ISU program.
