We propose to hold a U.S. Finnish Auroral Workshop in Helsinki from 19-21 March,
1992. The purpose of the workshop will be to review the past collaborations, to
initiate new activities, and to establish collaborative links between a new
generation of scientists in both countries. Significant new opportunities soon
will be available due to recent or upcoming initiatives in auroral,
magnetospheric, and deep space research. Finland has committed significant
financial resources to space research and has greatly expanded the number of
young scientists. Finnish scientists are presently operating major ground-based
observation facilities, and several groups are involved in the FREJA, POLAR,
CLUSTER, and INTERBALL spacecraft missions. In the U.S., the National Science
Foundation has begun a major new program, Geospace Environment Modeling (GEM),
that could significantly benefit from U.S. - Finnish collaboration. Working
groups will form to identify specific investigations for both near- and long-
term. We expect 24 Finnish scientists to participate, of which many are students
and young scientists. Forty U.S. scientists will be invited, and a large
fraction of these are also young scientists. In spite of the size of the
workshop, limited funds are requested, and the money will be used almost
exclusively to support the travel of young U.S. scientists who have not
participated in previous U.S. - Finnish workshops.
