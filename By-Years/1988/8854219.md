Many exciting possibilities are now becoming realities in biology and medicine
due to the use of recombinant DNA. Human insulin, growth hormone and several
other hormones are now becoming available for the first time in quantity.
Undergraduate students need to understand the fundamentals of these methods in
order to participate in the future advances in biology and medicine. A DNA
Laboratory Workshop for Undergraduate Science Faculty is an intensive week-long
program for small college teachers. The workshop, consisting of lecture,
laboratory and discussion periods, will enable 25 science faculty who have never
had "hands-on" experience with recombinant DNA laboratory techniques to gain
familiarity with several of these techniques. These new techniques will then be
taught in the undergraduate college setting. The DNA workshop will be hosted by
a consortium of eight Liberal Arts colleges in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West
Virginia (the East Central Colleges, or ECC), but will include science faculty
members from about twelve to fourteen colleges. The instructional staff will
consist of staff scientists from Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, a leading
laboratory in DNA research and education. The workshop will be held at Bethany
College in Bethany, WV. In addition to NSF funds, the participants' institutions
will provide about 20% in travel funds.
