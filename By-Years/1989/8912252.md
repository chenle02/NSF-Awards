Economic theory, as well as ordinary intuition, indicates that uncertainty about
future income should have important effects on people's consumption and savings
decisions. Such effects of uncertainty on consumption choices are of more than
theoretical significance, since they could have an important influence on (1)
the effect of social and private insurance on the saving rate, (2) the effect of
government debt on risky investment, (4) the effect of movements in wealth on
consumption, and (5) the effects of short-term and long-term real interest rates
on the level and rate of growth of consumption. The purpose of this project is
to develop and analyze models of consumption under conditions of uncertainty.
Previous research has focused on relatively simple tow period models. This
project well involve the use of more realistic multi-period models. The models
will be analyzed by the use of simulations to estimate the effects of
precautionary saving behavior.
