This project supports two cultural anthropologists studying ways in which
Protestant Pentecostalism and more traditional or Catholic forms of popular
religion are involved in the creation of new cultural models of gender, family,
and definitions of personhood in southern Italy. Popular religionists and
Pentecostals are found in close interaction within the same families, kin
networks, and neighborhoods. The project will examine similarities and
differences in these cultural models by studying domestic relations, healing
performances, conversion accounts and life histories, and in the house shrines.
Two principal investigators will conduct the research in two major urban centers
of Sicily -- Palermo and Catania. In each field site participant-observation
will be supplemented by survey analysis and oral historical methods, comparing
Pentecostal church members, non-Pentecostal kin of church members, former
members (dropouts) of the Pentecostal churches, and in a group of popular
religionists without connections to Pentecostalism. This research is important
because popular religion is an important force in most of the world's cultures,
and understanding the dynamics of the relation between newer and older forms of
popular religion will help us understand how religions wax and wane in
importance.
