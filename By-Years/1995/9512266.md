9512266 Jordan The proposed project is to provide a central, high-performance,
and network-based computational facility with high-quality graphics,
visualization and animation capabilities for the needs of faculty and graduate
students in sciences. The facility supports a large number of diverse research
projects in scientific and mathematical disciplines. Four general types of
research are identified, namely; (1) compute-intensive, (2) algorithm
development and applications, (3) data analysis, visualization and animation,
and (4) modelling simulation. The computational environment encourages an
interdisciplinary approach which brings together the common elements of research
projects in the Departments of Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, Geology and the
multi-disciplinary Center for Complex Systems. An important consequence of the
proposed project is that it will not only enhance the current faculty and
student research and education but that it will act as a catalyst for new
collaborations with the College of Science. ***
