This conference proposal requests support that will assist 25 US doctoral
students and 15 early-career post-doctoral researchers with travel expenses so
that they may attend the International Conference on the Learning Sciences to be
held June 25-28, 2008 in Eindhoven, Netherlands and so that they may participate
in two pre-conference programs on June 23 and June 24, 2008. The Doctoral
Consortium and The Early Career Workshop are designed specifically to provide
special training and support for junior researchers in the Learning Sciences and
to create international community among them. This grant will also provide
support for senior US faculty who are serving as US coordinators and
facilitators for these programs, and for mentors who will participate in the
program as faculty.
