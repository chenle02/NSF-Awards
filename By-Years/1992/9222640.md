9222640 Garmire This project will continue our on-going investigations of
nonlinear optics and carrier transport in semiconductors. This transport in
semniconductors and offers promise for improving the optical response of
semiconductors. By using advanced materials, which include multiple quantum
wells (MQW) in dping superlatices (nipi structures), sensitive and large
nonlinearities at useful wavelengths can be achieved. Several collaborative
projects are proposed which will all contribute to improved usefulness of
semiconductor materials for nonlinear and optical applications. These are: a)
Mode-locking of Nd:YAG laser using saturabel absorption of GaInAsP at 1.06 um,
b) Improved optical modulators consisting of SPSLS MQ W waveguides in p-i-n and
inpi structures, C) Psec studies of carrier transprot in strained-layer
InGaAs/GaAs MQW hetero-nipi's modulators, d) Eperiments to better understand MQW
hetero-nipi's e) Modelling carrier transport in MQW hetero-nipi's, f) improved
design for MQW hetero-nipi's. Investigations to date at 980 nm will be extended
to 1.3 um and/or 1.55 um in the proposed new project. The proposed studies will
provide no only more useful nonlinear optical devies, but also assist in the
understanding of carrier transport within strained materials in the presence of
both quantum wells and inernal fields. The results are needed for the better
understanding of opto-electronic lasers, modulatores, detectores, and optical
switches. *** v s t nipitransportExperimentsModelingheaternip'sheterodevicesinte
