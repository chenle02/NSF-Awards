The PI requests funding to purchase shipboard instrumentation in support of NSF-
funded research. The instruments will be used aboard the R/V Thompson, a 274
foot vessel that is owned by the University. Both ships are operated by the
University in support of basic oceanographic research efforts. NSF-funded
scientists are the primary users of both ships. Instrumentation requested
includes computer hardware and network upgrades, a set of 12-position carousels,
meteorological sensors for the R/V BARNES, thermal graphic recorders, and
upgrades to the side-scan sonar system. The instrumentation requested is
required for support of NSF-funded cruises aboard the THOMPSON and the BARNES
during 1996 and will enhance the scientific capability of the vessels in the
future.
