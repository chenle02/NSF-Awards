This project, in the area of analytical and surface chemistry, involves the
comprehensive, systematic, and detailed investigation of ion-surface reactions
involving self-assembled monolayers, SAMs, of alkanethiolates on gold. The
primary goal of the research is to improve our understanding of the ion-surface
chemistry observed when gas-phase polyatomic ions collide with a well-
characterized organic surface at collision energies in the tens of electron
volts regime. The information obtained from these surface induced dissociation
(SID) experiments will be used to improve the characterization of both organic
surfaces and projectile ions. %%% Professor Wysocki and her students will
investigate the chemistry of low energy, polyatomic ions interacting with solid
surfaces covered with self-assembled monolayers of organic molecules. The
proposed research is of special technological significance because of the
potential application of self-assembled monolayers as photoresists for X-ray
microlithography, i.e., reactive ion etching.
