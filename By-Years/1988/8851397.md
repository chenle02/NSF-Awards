Atomic absorption spectroscopy and its uses for trace elemental analyses are
being integrated into introductory and advanced courses offered by the
Departments of Chemistry and Geology. Introduction to this fundamental
analytical capability, whose applications extend into virtually every field of
inquiry where accurate measurements of specific metals are required, is
occurring in the first course in chemistry, with advanced courses in
instrumental analyses and geochemistry expanding upon the initial experience.
New instructional materials and laboratory experiments are being developed to
facilitate student understanding of this technology and its broad applications
in all fields of materials science. Application of atomic absorption
spectroscopy suitable to nonscience majors and preservice teachers is being
implemented, and access and instruction is being provided to area high school
classes for their ongoing environmental research. Development of this program is
being achieved through the purchase of an atomic absorption spectrometer
equipped with a sample changer and accessories needed to obtain quantitative
analyses at the part-per- billion range. The grantee is matching the award from
non-federal sources.
