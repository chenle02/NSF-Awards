Transcription factors, proteins that regulate gene expression, play critical
roles in all aspects of growth and development in higher organisms. In order to
understand how an individual transcription factor exerts its function, it is
necessary to identify the genes that it regulates. One way to do this is to
identify DNA sequences that a transcription factor binds to in a live cell.
However, many transcription factors are present in very low abundance and/or are
expressed in a small number of cells, making the identification of target genes
technically challenging. The goal of this proposal is to develop a method for
purifying transcription factor-DNA complexes from the model plant Arabidopsis
thaliana. A genetic approach will be used to tag individual Arabidopsis
transcription factors with the small molecule biotin. Biochemical methods will
be used to purify the biotin-tagged transcription factor and associated DNA from
plant cells, taking advantage of the strong interaction between biotin and the
protein streptavidin. Following purification, the sequence of DNA fragments that
co-purify with the transcription factor will be determined. This project will
determine the genomic binding sites of SHOOT MERISTEMLESS and LATERAL ORGAN
BOUNDARIES, two developmentally important Arabidopsis transcription factors.
Identification of downstream targets of these transcription factors will further
our understanding of genetic networks that regulate organ formation and stem
cell maintenance, critical processes in plants. More generally, this project
will develop methods for tagging and purifying any plant transcription factor
and associated DNA, which will be a major scientific advance. The project will
contribute to training of graduate and undergraduate students, who will be
directly involved in the research.
