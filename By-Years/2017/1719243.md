Wildfires have a tremendous impact on lives and property around the country and
the globe. One aspect of wildfires that has not received as much attention is
the the smoke plume and how it interacts with the atmosphere. In the late summer
of 2016, NSF approved a short deployment of the Wyoming King Air research
aircraft to provide airborne measurements of a fire near Boise, Idaho. This
award will fund the analysis of that data to determine whether the measurements
are able to provide enough information to answer the many outstanding questions
about the characteristics of wildfire plumes. The potential impact of the
project is on the validation and improvement of fire behavior models, which may
allow a safer and more efficient usage of air and ground resources for fighting
wildfires. There is also a significant connection between wildfire plumes and
aviation and air quality.

The researcher will analyze data collected during the Rapid Deployment to
Wildfires (RaDFIRE-2016) campaign which sampled a large wildfire northeast of
Boise, Idaho in August 2016. Studies of wildfire plume dynamics and microphysics
have mainly been conducted through numerical modeling simulations and observed
through ground-based remote sensing. The RaDFIRE campaign was an initial test to
determine whether instruments on the University of Wyoming King Air research
aircraft could successfully observe important wildfire characteristics. Initial
analysis suggests that the test was successful, but more thorough analysis is
needed to determine whether the data is adequate enough to answer unresolved
questions about plume dynamics and microphysics. The project fits within the
EAGER program at NSF due to the focus on untested but potentially transformative
research ideas that employ a radically different analysis approach.
