This award provides funding for US participation in a conference about harmonic
analysis and related topics, to be held at CRM Barcelona in May 25-29, 2020.
This award gives early career researchers, members of underrepresented groups,
and researchers not funded by NSF, an opportunity to speak and participate in
this conference. The organizing committee will strive to make this funding
opportunity known to target groups through a number of different activities.

Plenary lectures on various recent cutting-edge developments in harmonic
analysis (decoupling, sparse domination, weighted theory) and its applications
to other fields (geometric measure theory, approximation theory, mathematical
physics) will be delivered by a diverse group of prominent speakers. Several
sessions of shorter talks will be organized during which early-career
participants will present their work and, additionally, a poster session will be
held. The meeting provides an excellent opportunity to facilitate discussions
between senior and early-career experts in different areas of harmonic analysis.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
