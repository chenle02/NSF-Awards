The University of Georgia will develop a four-year model program for the
preparation of both middle school science and middle school mathematics
teachers. The proposed effort involves the development of new content courses in
both science and mathematics, and the development of innovative "parallel"
methods courses for each content course. Each science teacher will complete 35
quarter hours of science content and 15 quarter hours of science education; each
mathematics teacher will complete 30 quarter hours of mathematics content and 25
quarter hours of mathematics education. Each student will also complete an
innovative course focusing on writing, with special emphasis on mathematics and
science. The proposed program represents a cooperative effort involving
scientists, science educators, mathematicians, mathematics educators, teacher
educators, and public school personnel. This program will prepare a teacher who
has both content knowledge and knowledge of and skill with methods of teaching
middle school children. Numerous practicum and clinical field experiences are
provided through the program.
