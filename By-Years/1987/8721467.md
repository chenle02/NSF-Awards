This project in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program is concerned
with studies of the properties of molecular clusters. Problems to be addressed
include clustering around charged centers, at surfaces, in hydrogen bonded
complexes, and in matrix isolation. The goal is to provide a unified theoretical
framework for description of a wide variety of clustering phenomena. The
potential surfaces, forces, and torques that will be used for static and dynamic
treatments will be based on high-level electrical interaction analyses, firmly
rooted in high-quality electronic structure determinations of the properties of
cluster constituents. Methodological developments will involve the quantum
chemical treatment of small molecules and the analysis of the interaction
potentials in clusters. A key aspect of this work is that it will test the
uniform application of interactions ranging from the detailed spectroscopic
parameters of hydrogen bonded dimers to the collective level of a hundred or
more interacting species.
