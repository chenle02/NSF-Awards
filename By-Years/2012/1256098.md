In partnership with other organizations, the Northwest Arctic Borough (Borough)
proposes to conduct aworkshop in Kotzebue, Alaska during November 2012 to
identify ways to improve the involvement of local residents in scientific
research projects. The workshop will involve approximately 60 participants,
including residents of the 11 Borough communities, students and researchers
doing work in the region. The partner organizations who will be involved in
organizing the workshop include the University of Alaska Chukchi Campus, NANA
Regional Corporation, and theNorthwest Arctic Borough School District. The
workshop will build on the findings from related previous workshops and
conferences held in this region.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This locally-driven
workshop will involve discussions on ways to improve local involvement in
research, including meaningful participation in planning research design,
conducting studies, reviewing preliminary findings, and reporting research
results. It will also involve identification of recommendations for future
research topics. This workshop will address ways to improve the integration by
indigenous knowledge and Western science. The workshop will result in
threeprimary outcomes: Development of Principles for Conducting Research in
Northwest Alaska, completion of a workshop summary that includes recommended
future actions, and establishment of a work group that will address ways
toimplement recommendations developed during the workshop.
