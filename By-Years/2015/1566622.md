In this project funded by the Chemical Catalysis program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor Dean M. Roddick of the University of Wyoming is developing
new hydrogen transfer catalysts for the conversion of plentiful, but less useful
hydrocarbon feedstocks to more useful olefin products. An extension of this
research to the synthesis of highly valuable hydrofluorocarbons is pursued.
Polymers with high fluorine content possess high thermal and chemical inertness.
They are used in high-tech applications such as fuel cell membranes, synthetic
lubricants, and microelectronics. In this project, catalysts for the production
of these materials are being designed and optimized for several important
processes. Dr. Roddick and coworkers introduce community college students to
chemical research on the campus of Wyoming's only 4-year university through
annual Structural Chemistry workshops. Extensive participation and leadership in
the new state-mandated Science Initiative brings tangible benefits to scientific
research and education across the state of Wyoming.

Diphosphine platinum systems are generally more active than well-established
diimine catalysts. This work extends the use of platinum catalysis to palladium
and nickel systems containing perfluorinated phosphine ligands. These species
are being developed as as fluoroalkene oligomerization catalysts. DFT
calculations on model palladium compounds predict energetically accessible
fluoroethylene insertion barriers for M-R and M-Rf bonds. The calculations also
support a general fluoroalkene oligomerization mechanism.
