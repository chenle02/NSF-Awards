This research program introduces new methods into the study of dynamical
systems and represents a continuation of a program established by the principal
investigator. The work is comprised of three major components: (1) Global
perturbation methods in dynamical systems related to nonlinear elasticity and
fluid mechanics; (2) Studies of knotted period orbits in forced nonlinear
oscillators and of the chaotic attracting sets exhibited by such systems; (3)
Analysis and predictions of the power spectra of strange attractors and analyses
of the effect of small noise on such systems. These studies represent the use of
applied mathematics in understanding properties and behavior of mechanical
systems.
