9550715 Hawk Clark Atlanta University (CAU) will continue to build its
comprehensive academic, research, and outreach program in Earth System Science
(EES) through the establishment of a Research Careers for Minority Scholars
(RCMS) Program in ESS. Earth System Science is the study of the earth and its
component parts, which include the atmosphere, maritime regions, biological and
hydrologic cycles, and geographic features, their interaction and evolution. The
proposed program is an outgrowth of an existing RCMS program in Geosciences. The
overall objective of the ESS program at CAU is to expose a large segment of the
University's faculty and students to the interdisciplinary nature of the study
of the interactions among the earth, its atmosphere and oceans while
simultaneously increasing the number of minority students pursuing graduate
degrees and careers in this and related areas. This project will support the
following activities: (1) Establishment of sixteen undergraduate student
research positions, eight in year one, four in year two, four in year three; (2)
Summer research experiences for pre-sophomore ESS students; and (3) Student
travel to national laboratories and conferences.
