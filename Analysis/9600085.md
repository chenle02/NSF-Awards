ABSTRACT Proposal: DMS-9600085 PI: Duren In the area of Bergman spaces, Duren
will continue his recent work by investigating properties of canonical divisors
and their analogues in more general invariant subspaces. Specific questions will
include structural properties of extremal functions and the determination of
generators for invariant subspaces. Also to be studied are sampling sequences
and interpolation sequences in Bergman spaces. For planar harmonic mappings, the
project will investigate the connection between dilatation and boundary
correspondence, will seek to develop improved forms of both the existence and
uniqueness assertions in the harmonic version of the Riemann mapping theorem,
and will continue a study of harmonic mappings of multiply connected domains.
Duren also plans to investigate a curvature problem for minimal surfaces and to
make further studies of the connections between minimal surfaces and their
underlying harmonic mappings. Finally, a basic coefficient conjecture for
harmonic mappings will be addressed. Bergman spaces often arise in connection
with complex analysis, approximation theory, and operator theory, so it is
important to understand their structure. Sampling sequences make contact with
the modern theory of wavelets, which has broad applications to image processing,
signal analysis, and data storage. Conformal mappings have long been used to
change coordinates in solving problems of fluid flow, heat conduction, and the
like. Harmonic mappings are significant generalizations of conformal mappings
which share some of their properties but present many new phenomena. They are
particularly useful in the study of minimal surfaces (area-minimizing surfaces),
represented physically by soap films spanning loops of wire.
