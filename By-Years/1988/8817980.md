The Catalogue of the Miridae of the World, now 34 years old, is the basic
reference for students of the plant bugs. It brings together in one place all of
the information on the classification and distribution of the 10,000 or so
members of this group of true bugs. Because of its age, it does not reflect the
many changes in the classification of the group presented in the literature in
the last three decades, nor information on the many new species described. Thus,
the preparation of a supplement is the most efficient way to bring this
invaluable resource up to date. Over the past 15 years the principal
investigator has amassed the bibliographic resources necessary for preparation
of the supplement, and has laid much of the ground work toward its completion.
The final volume will allow access to all literature on the classification of
the group, present lists of hosts by predator and host, and--having been
prepared using a computer database--can be updated on a periodic basis as well
as queried in order to answer more complex questions than would be possible with
the printed version of the catalog. This project provides funding for
preparation of the supplement, which will be useful to systematists, ecologists,
agriculturists and insect pest-control specialists.
