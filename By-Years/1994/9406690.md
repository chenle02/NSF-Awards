9406690 Brown In convergent margin settings orogensis commonly involves
emplacement of batholiths, deep burial and Barovian metamorphism of supracrustal
rocks, thrust stacking of terranes and strike-slip displacements. The connection
between theses processes is not entirely resolved however. The cause of deep
burial and metamorphism is commonly ascribed to thrust loading; this proposal
entertains the idea that large-volume magma emplacement could also accomplish
the required loading. Similarly, large-volume plutons present difficulties in
explaining how they could be emplaced in a convergent margin, as they presumably
require dilatational space. This project will critically examine these issues in
the Coast Plutonic Complex of British Columbia in conjunction with personnel of
the Geological Survey of Canada. Results will test the viability of the magma
loading idea and will contribute to the resolution of the space problem for
large batholiths.
