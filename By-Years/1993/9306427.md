9306427 Remmel This award supports the research of Professor Remmel to work in
combinatorics. Professor Remmel will continue his research into the
combinatorics of symmetric functions. First, Professor Remmel plans to develop
the combinatorics of the Macdonald polynomials and then he plans to study the
action Macdonald operators on various bases of symmetric functions. Next,
Professor Remmel plans to study the computation of Kronecker products and
plethysms for the symmetric group and the hyperoctahedral group. The research is
in the general area of combinatorics. Combinatorics attempts to find efficient
methods to study how discrete collections can be organized. The behavior of
discrete systems is extremely important to modern communications. For example,
the design of large networks, as in telephone systems, and the design of
algorithms in computer science all deal with discrete objects, and this makes
use of combinatorial research. ***
