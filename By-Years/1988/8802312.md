Two of the most important problems facing software engineers are how to improve
the quality of their software products,and how to improve the productivity of
people who build them. A mainstay of engineering design - reusability - attacks
both problems and promises potentially huge economic benefits. This study
concentrates on various technical aspects of data-oriented reusable software
parts. The research objectives are to determine how formal specifications for
reusable software can be written so they are at once understandable by humans
and suitable for use in certification of correctness (through verification and
testing); to identify general ways to build efficient implementations of such
parts; and to explore the ramifications of reusability for the methodologies,
languages, and systems used to design, build, and instantiate software
components.
