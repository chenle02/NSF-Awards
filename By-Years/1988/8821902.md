The fundamental mechanisms involved in the resuspension and deagglomeration of
particles on a surface when other particles bombard the surface will be studied.
Experiments will be made with monodispense, spherical particles and with
agglomerates of these particles, as well as with polydisperse, nonspherical
particles. Controlled parameters include size, particle shape, and surface
material. Particle size distributions before and after impact will be measured
with optical counters. The number and location of particles remaining on the
impaction surface will be measured by scanning electron microscopy via automatic
image analysis and fluorescent tracers. Thus, the elementary processes in
particle collisions will be identified and parametized. Resuspension and
deagglomeration are among the least understood but most important aerosol
phenomena. The production of dust during the process of soil erosion is not well
understood; the resuspension of radioactive or toxic chemicals from soil has
resisted major efforts at modelling. Dust from coal and ore piles and dust
generated during the handling of powdered materials are other important problems
affected by this work. The accuracy of sampling devices used to measure aerosols
will also be improved by results of this work. The basic understanding provided
by this project will advance the theory and control of these and other important
engineering problems.
