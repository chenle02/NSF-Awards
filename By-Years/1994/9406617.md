9406617 HARTIGAN The Department of Statistics at Yale University will purchase a
SPARCstation 10 (Model 512MP) server, two X-terminals a laser printer and
peripherals. This equipment will be dedicated to supporting research in the
mathematical sciences, including (i) neural network computations; (ii)
probabilistic models for constructing and evaluating classifications, and the
role of classification in data collection and justification of probability
distributions; (iii) exact finite sample confidence bands for nonparametric
functionals; (iv) symbolic computation to guide asymptotic theory; (v)
information in semiparametric mixtures and hierarchical mixture models.
