0929759&lt;br/&gt;Billen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). Granted funds
will support upgrade of compute facilities in the Department of Geology at the
University of California at Davis. A U.S. assembled and tested, 120 CPU compute
cluster with 240 GB of RAM will be acquired. The computational facility will
support a range of numerically intensive geodynamics research including modeling
studies of 3-D deformation field in the Southern Alaska subduction zone, ridge
subduction, plume-subduction interaction, oceanic plateau deformation and
crustal-fragment accretion during subduction and mantle mixing. The cluster will
also support development of new algorithms for control of 3-D immersive virtual
reality environments. Students will be trained in state-of-the-art parallel code
development and testing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;*** &lt;br/&gt;
