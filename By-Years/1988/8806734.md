The objectives of this research effort are 1) to extend to motion and
surfacedeformation the investigator's prior research in perceptually
basedvisualization of texture, and 2) to develop a practical system based on
thisapproach that will handle actual motion and deformation
visualizationproblems. The method is based on the method the investigator has
already employed withsuccess for texture visualization. The method will proceed
in a number ofstages. First the computational paradigm used in the
investigator's texturesynthesis system will be adapted to surface deformation.
Then an initial setof texture attributes that are potentially of perceptual
significance will bedefined. This set will form the foundation for a library of
applicativefunctions that will be implemented. Users will compose these
functions tocreate visual syntheses of specific types of naturally occurring
motion andsurface deformation. Those functions discovered to be useful for this
processwill form the basis of a perceptual attribute taxonomy. This taxonomy
canthen be used to form a systematic parameterized approach to
realisticvisualization of surface deformation. The new contributions will be a
taxonomy of perceptually significant motionand deformation operations, and a
working system of perceptually based userinterface for visualizing motion and
surface deformation. A key result willbe that the user of such an interface will
be able to specify and controlhighly realistic visual simulations without having
to be overly concerned withdetails at lower levels.
