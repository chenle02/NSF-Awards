9506716 Rea A high-resolution stratigraphic study will be undertaken to
ascertain the timing of the onset of global conditions on Siberia and Alaska and
the timing of the massive late Pliocene volcanism on the North Pacific rim on
orbital and millennial timescales, based on IRD fluxes and tephrochronology of
cores from North Pacific, respectively. The temporal relationship between the
two phenomena will determine if the massive volcanic activity was responsible
for the onset of large scale glaciation in the Northern Hemisphere at the end of
Pliocene. ***
