This workshop in engineering education will bring together a panel of experts to
address the chronic question of why under-representation persists in engineering
degree programs. The participants of the workshop will identify the technical,
social, political, and/or economic impediments to implementing decades of prior
recommendations on mechanisms to enhance racial and ethnic diversity in
engineering and develop potential strategies for overcoming these
impediments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this workshop can potentially
inform more effective efforts to draw on the diverse population of the United
States and thus improve both the number and quality of engineering graduates, as
well as prepare a more diverse 21st Century workforce. This project overlaps
with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers through preparation of
an engineering workforce with new capabilities and expertise. Additionally NSF's
goal of innovating for society is enabled by creating results and research that
are useful for society by informing educational policy and practices.
