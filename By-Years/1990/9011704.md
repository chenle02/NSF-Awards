This award will support the research of a cultural anthropologist in developing
a large database (over 200 cases) of irrigation systems from about 20 nations.
These cases will be measured on several variables, including size and structure
of authority. Previous work show no relationship between size and political
centralization between 700 and 458,000 Hectares. The relationship between size
and structure of authority will be investigated in the new and larger sample.
Additional variables include information on climate, nature of irrigation, type
of agriculture, and type of national political system, should account for some
of the variation. Results should be of interest to management theorists and
policy makers who must deal with irrigation projects which are not performing up
to standards.
