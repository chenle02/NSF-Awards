The coupled chemical reactions that perform photosynthesis, although not common
to all organisms, are among the most crucial to the existence of life on this
planet. Although photosynthesis has been studied intensively for many years,
detailed structural and functional information at the molecular level about how
the proteins and membranes that make up the photosynthetic apparatus are
assembled is just beginning to become available. Such information should prove
valuable in understanding not only photosynthesis itself, but also the structure
of highly ordered membranes and the mechanisms of electron transfer reactions.
This, in turn, should prove important for the future development of
biotechnology in the areas of membranes and electrochemistry. This award will
provide funds to a group of investigators at Arizona State University for the
purchase of an advanced picosecond spectrophotometer, an NMR and other equipment
to be used for primary protein structure determination. The research to be
performed includes physical, chemical and genetic studies of the photosynthetic
apparatus, including the individual steps of electron transfer that follow
photon capture. Other related structural studies of non-photosynthetic proteins
are also planned. These investigators are among the most outstanding now working
in the area of photosynthesis. In addition to this award, they have recently
been selected to receive one of three Plant Research Center awards.
