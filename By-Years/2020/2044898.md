This project investigates so-called nonlocal differential equations in
combination with geometric and topological effects. Models involving nonlocal
differential equations play a role in natural sciences such as physics (e.g.,
turbulence formation) and organic chemistry and biology (e.g., DNA and protein
knotting). In recent years, refined techniques have been developed to treat
nonlocal differential aspects, and it is the aim of the investigator to further
develop and implement these techniques for geometric-topological aspects. The
fundamental issues the project aims to understand are optimal shapes under such
nonlocal equations, and the controllability of geometry and topology via
nonlocal models. Integrated in this project are research opportunities for
undergraduate and graduate students. A particular approach is to develop,
together with undergraduate students, virtual reality visualizations of the deep
geometric and topological effects that this project is investigating, to be used
in training and public outreach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project aims at
further developing the analysis of fractional Sobolev spaces and fractional
variational problems, especially problems with a geometric background. The
methods, in particular from harmonic analysis, provide bridges between different
areas of analysis, geometry, and topology, and the underlying goal is to find
and further study these links. A large part of this project is concerned with
applications of fractional harmonic analysis in geometric partial differential
equations and the geometric calculus of variations. Problems include nonlocal
self-repulsive knot and curvature energies (existence and regularity), the half-
wave map equation motivated from physics (well-posedness), and analysis of the
free boundary of variational problems with geometric constraints (regularity). A
second part is concerned with application of harmonic analysis in quantitative
topology for problems with maps that have less than one derivative (i.e., HÃ¶lder
maps, maps in fractional Sobolev spaces): sharp estimates of the topological
degree and the topological-analytical study of the Heisenberg group are treated.
Integrated in this project is the use and development of virtual reality
programs as a method for engaging undergraduate students in current research
topics in analysis and geometry, for helping graduate students developing
intuition for geometrical and topological concepts, and for enabling the broader
public to visualize mathematical phenomena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
