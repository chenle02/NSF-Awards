Research activities for this Presidential Young Investigator Award include two
areas within the Construction Engineering and Construction Automation fields:
(1) Design of construction work systems for the application of advanced
robotics, and (2) application of expert systems to contractor prequalification
process. The first of these research areas focuses on the restructuring of the
traditional industrial construction processes to meet the capabilities and
expose the advantages of automated construction equipment, either sensor-driven
or numerically controlled. After the design of the new processes performance of
the automated construction equipment may be estimated through computer
simulations of relevant work parameters. The second research area recently
undertaken by the investigator pertains to the application of expert system
methodology to the analysis of construction contractor prequalification
processes. The work concentrates on the creation and structure of the
heuristics-based body of knowledge and knowledge engineering for a
prequalification expert system. The investigator is also involved in the
development of a prototype of such a system as an aid to owners and developers.
