The design, construction and testing of a Polarimetric Emission Pyrometer (PEP)
will be undertaken. The PEP will measure the spectral emissivity and optical
constants of solid or liquid surfaces in real-time concurrent with the
measurement of the apparent temperature, and consequently provide a dynamic
measurement of the true thermodynamic temperature. The device is sample
independent and works extremely well on specular and near- specular surfaces. In
addition, the errors in the emittance measurement are temperature independent.
Initially the device will cover a temperature range of 800 - 2500 K. This would
probably be the first absolute thermodynamic temperature and optical property
measuring device available.
