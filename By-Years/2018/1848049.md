Algebraic varieties are the spaces of solutions to polynomial equations, and
algebraic geometry seeks to describe those solutions geometrically. Ubiquitous
in mathematics, algebraic varieties are critical objects of study in complex
geometry, number theory, topology, and representation theory. It is often
particularly important to understand their moduli, that is, how they vary as the
coefficients of the polynomial equations defining them are varied. Hodge theory
offers one perspective on this problem: the moduli of algebraic varieties can be
understood in terms of how integrals of differential forms vary. This research
project will use new methods stemming from model theory, representation theory,
and complex geometry to understand this connection. The project especially aims
to promote interactions with closely-related areas of mathematics and to
encourage the participation of students and young researchers.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will address two main types of research
problems. Hodge theory is a powerful tool in algebraic geometry but it is
fundamentally transcendental in nature. Recent work of the PI and coauthors has
demonstrated that techniques from model theory and complex geometry can be used
to bridge this divide systematically, and the first goal of the project is to
develop the application of these techniques more deeply. Secondly, the project
will develop a more detailed understanding of the moduli of certain varieties
which are particularly closely related to Hodge theory, including abelian
varieties and hyperkahler varieties. Building on previous work using techniques
from differential and complex geometry, the PI will further investigate the
geometry and arithmetic of the moduli spaces of these
varieties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
