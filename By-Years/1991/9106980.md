When streams in tropical rain forests flood, their fish populations often swim
into the adjacent forests, in some cases for dozens of miles. Fish species that
feed on tropical fruits may then disperse seeds over large areas beyond the
normal stream boundaries. Previous studies have revealed that fish of the genus
Brycon are major components of this seed dispersal system. Accordingly, the P.I.
proposes to investigate the diet of Brycon, and particularly the use of figs,
and the nature and degree of seed dispersal into forest next to tropical streams
in Costa Rica. The study will provide important insights into an unknown
component of the maintenance of tree diversity and community structure in
tropical rain forests.
