The primary goal of this project is to help beginning physics students make the
transition from high school to college physics instruction. The student are
being helped to take responsibility for his/her own learning by providing
physics instruction in an environment with a heavy emphasis on direct
observation and active student involvement. The already well- integrated
laboratories at Jamestown Community College are being enhanced by the addition
of computer data acquisition systems at each lab bench. Students, working in
pairs or threes, are using this equipment to verify the laws of physics, by
directly measuring force, motion, temperature, displacement, magnetic fields,
etc., and by using computer tools such as spreadsheets, mathematical and
graphics packages, and data acquisition software designed by Tools for
Scientific Thinking at Tufts University. Furthermore, a powerful mathematics and
graphing program called Mathematica is also being used to help students deal
with difficult mathematics concepts. Via this project the college is building
the laboratory resources necessary to move gradually toward a heavily
observation-based approach to introductory physics, consistent with the nature
of physics as an observation-based discipline. Nine Macintosh IIsi computers,
equipped with Vernier U.L.I. data acquisition boards and analysis software, are
being networked to a Quadra 900, which runs Mathematica 2.0, which was purchased
earlier. This project has been designed in consultation with faculty at several
colleges and universities. This cooperation should enhance the chances of
project success and replication.
