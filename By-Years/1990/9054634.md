The Institute of Ecosystem Studies is requesting two year support to enhance,
test, produce and disseminate an ecology curriculum entitled Eco-Inquiry. The
foundation of this multi-dimensional, 8 to 15 week, 5th and 6th grade curriculum
has been built through four years of local development and testing. Eco-Inquiry
has three distinctive features: 1) its emphasis on the conceptual underpinnings
of ecological literacy - nutrient cycling and energy flow, 2) its commitment to
demystifying the practice of science and scientists, and 3) its approach to
developing students' inquiry skills and dispositions through modeling the
scientific community in the classroom. Eco-Inquiry uses a diversity of teaching
methods (e.g., collaborative learning, teaching for conceptual change) to engage
students in activities that are imaginative and highly participatory. The
Institute of Ecosystem Studies (IES) is a division of The New York Botanical
Garden, founded in 1983 to promote educational programs in ecology. IES field,
laboratory and education facilities are at the Mary Flagler Cary Arboretum in
Millbrook, New York; additional field sites are located throughout the
northeastern United States and elsewhere.
