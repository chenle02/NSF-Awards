The Noyce Transition to Mathematics and Science Teaching (T-MAST) Scholars
program educates and certifies people who hold a degree in science, mathematics,
or engineering and who desire to change careers in order to teach middle school
mathematics or science. T-MAST is a fast-track four-semester Master of Arts
degree program that features a paid job-sharing internship. Job-sharing is one
of the most innovative characteristics of T-MAST. It streamlines the pathway
into the classroom for T-MAST Scholars by having two T-MAST Scholars job-share a
vacant middle school position in mathematics or science. During the regular
school year, the T-MAST scholars each teach part-time in a middle school during
the day, while attending graduate courses during the evening hours. The
knowledge and skills acquired from these graduate courses at the University of
Central Florida are thus applied directly to instruction in public middle
schools. The job-share position is highly mentored by both university personnel
and a carefully chosen, accomplished teacher at the school where the T-MAST
Scholars work. Mentoring is continued in the year after the T-MAST Scholars
complete the UCF program. Additionally, T-MAST Scholars proceed through the
program in a cohort group designed to promote the development of professional
communities.
