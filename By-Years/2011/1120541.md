Intellectual merit&lt;br/&gt;The public genome data base identifies about 44
potential aminotransferase-like enzymes that are present in the genome of the
model organism Arabidopsis thaliana. Aminotransferases are ubiquitous enzymes
that catalyze the transfer of an amino group from a donor that is usually an
amino acid to an acceptor that is usually a 2-keto acid. These enzymes are
involved in numerous anabolic and catabolic pathways including; amino acid
metabolism, vitamin metabolism, and secondary metabolism, among others.
Determination of the functional and biochemical proprties of these enzymes
becomes important to understanding basic plant biology including plant growth
and development. Because aminotransferases are ubiquitous also in other
organisms, this study will provide insights into the role of these enzymes in
other organisms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts&lt;br/&gt; This project
will provide research mentoring and training opportunities for undergraduate
students enrolled in the biology related programs at the Rochester Institute of
Technology. This training is particular critical to mold future scientists,
policymakers and informed citizens. The students are frequently from demographic
groups that are under-represented in the STEM disciplines, most notably African
American, Latino and Native American students.
