9403263 Chu Cardueline finch (subfamily Carduelinae, family Fringillidae)
species exhibit considerable interspecific differences in plumage colors, and
extent to which it varies with age. Comparative methods will be employed to test
hypotheses about the evolution of plumage coloration patterns among cardueline
lineages: cladistic analyses will be performed on morphological and behavioral
characters. That framework will then serve to anchor further research on the
evolution of plumage characters (including their variation with age) and the
evolution of carotenoid - based color displays. %%% More is known of control and
function of plumage coloration in cardueline finches than for any other group of
passerine birds, but investigation into even this group have been hampered by
the lack of a robust phylogeny. Substantial progress with this taxon will
provide a procedural model for similar analyses of additional taxa in the
future, and as a demonstration of the puissance of rigorous systematic methods
in elaborating evolutionary "adornment" among vertebrate fauna. Systematics
provides a fundamental "guide" for study of other facets of any given taxon's
biology, within the context of the planet's overwhelming biodiversity. ***
