The mechanisms by which cells repair DNA interstrand crosslinks remain largely
unknown. In mammals, the nucleotide excision repair endonuclease XPF-Ercc1 plays
a key role in interstrand crosslink repair. This function is conserved in the
Drosophila XPF homolog MEI-9. This project concerns the interaction between
MEI-9 and a newly identified crosslink repair protein, MUS312. Genetic analyses
of mus312 mutants will be done to better understand which repair and
recombination pathways require mus312, and to what extent mus312 and mei-9 act
in the same pathways. Additional alleles of mus312 will be generated to better
understand the MUS312 protein. Both mei-9 and mus312 are also essential for
generating meiotic crossovers, and this function will also be studied
genetically and molecularly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DNA is under constant attack
by both internal and external agents; several chemotherapy agents exert their
effects by creating interstrand crosslinks in DNA. The mechanisms by which
normal cells repair this type of damage are unknown. The present research seeks
to understand the contribution to this repair of two key proteins, MEI-9 and
MUS312. These proteins interact physically to carry out this repair process in
Drosophila melanogaster.
