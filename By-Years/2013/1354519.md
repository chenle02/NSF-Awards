This award partially supports the GSA research grants program. The primary role
of this program is to provide partial support of Master's and Doctoral thesis
research in the geological sciences for graduate students at universities in the
United States, Canada, Mexico and Central America. Grants are intended as an aid
to a research project, not to sustain the entire cost. Students may receive a
GSA graduate student grant once at the Master's level and once at the Ph.D.
level. Since the amount of money requested for grants usually greatly exceeds
the amount available, applications are evaluated on a competitive basis.
Applications are evaluated on the basis of the scientific merits of the
problems, the capability of the investigator, and reasonableness of the budget.
Grants are awarded only to individuals; institutions, societies, and
universities are not eligible. GSA strongly encourages women, members of under-
represented groups in Geosciences, and persons with disabilities to participate
fully in this grants program.
