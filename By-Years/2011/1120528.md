The International Conference for Supercomputing (ICS) brings together experts
from diverse fields, including parallel application writers, libraries and tools
developers, compiler developers, computer architects, and programming languages
experts. The conference solicits papers on all aspects of research, development,
and application of large-scale, high-performance experimental and commercial
systems. In 2011 the conference will be held May 31 - June 4, 2011 in Tucson,
Arizona.&lt;br/&gt;It is proposed to offer up to 10 NSF-sponsored student travel
and junior faculty (without travel support) grants for a total budget of
$10,000. Applications will be solicited via email mailing lists, personal
contacts, and the conference web site. The selection process will consider the
applicant?s level of participation in ICS, followed by how closely the student?s
research interests match areas covered by ICS.
