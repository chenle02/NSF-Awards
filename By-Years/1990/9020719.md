This work is directed to the elucidation of the magnetic microstructure of
coronal loops under the stresses imposed by footpoint motion due to photospheric
convection. The microstructure determines the (i) the extent and width of the
singular current layers postulated earlier, (ii) the filamentation of the
current flow along the field lines and the resultant enhanced dissipation. It
could also lead to the presence of stochastic magnetic fields with a greatly
enhanced rate for shear Alfven waves. Thus the magnetic microstructure plays a
critical role in the physical processes that contribute to solar coronal
heating. This microstructure is also critical in the reconnection processes
which relax the stressed magnetic field to a lower energy state. These processes
are investigated using a mathematical model that is treated both analytically
and through numerical simulation. The calculations thus obtained are compared
with observational data. ***
