This SBIR Phase I Award emphasizes research on processing of single mode
waveguides in aluminum gallium nitride and measurement of the electro-optical
properties of these materials. The waveguides will be deposited using low
pressure metalorganic chemical vapor deposition and characterized using computer
controlled test facilities for electrical resistivity, thickness and chemical
composition (sputter Auger), optical losses (prism coupling technique). Due to
its large band gap, aluminum gallium nitride has potential for application as
solar-blind ultraviolet detectors and ultraviolet filters, solid state laser
scanners, and thin film miniature ultraviolet spectrometers.
