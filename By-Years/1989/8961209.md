The objective of this SBIR Phase I award is to support the development of a
non-invasive method of precisely sensing surface temperature in the range 600 to
1200 degrees Centigrade acutely needed to support development of "expert"
Metalorganic chemical vapor deposition systems. A wireless system based upon
remote detection of the temperature dependent gamma ray flux from trace
radionuclides buried in the heated surface will be studied. The proposed
approach will induce minute quantities of near-surface gamma activity at the
site to be monitored, then remotely sense decreases in photon flux due to
evaporation. Multi-point measurements yielding temperature uniformity should be
feasible.
