This Pathways project will develop and evaluate a new model for a STEM career
exploration program for at-risk Hispanic youth and their families in New Mexico
where 46% of the population is Hispanic. The target audience includes Hispanic
youth incarcerated in juvenile detention centers. The Hispanic Communications
Network will partner with the Juvenile Justice Division of the New Mexico
Children, Youth, and Families Department, Youth Development Inc.; and Youth
Works in Santa Fe. STEM professionals from Los Alamos and Sandia labs and
private sector companies in New Mexico will participate as role models. The
evaluation findings will add to the knowledge base about strategies to increase
interest and engagement in pursuing STEM careers among hard-to-reach Hispanic
audiences including low income families, gang members and incarcerated youth.

The project design includes using two main strategies: family evenings with STEM
role models; and a social media and Facebook contest focusing on Green Jobs of
the Future. The evaluation will use a mixed-methods approach for gathering data
including brief questionnaires after the family evenings, pre-and past-activity
surveys, observations, and telephone and online surveys. The evaluation will
provide ongoing feedback to the project team on how well the strategies are
working.

The project will hold 8 family nights, involve approximately 16 STEM
professionals (role models), and projects about 16 edited media submissions by
the youth teams. Toward the end of the project the evaluation will comment on
the viability, efficacy and potential transferability of this model to other
communities.
