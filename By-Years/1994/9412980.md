This project seeks to develop denotational semantics for a variety of
programming languages, tailored to support compositional reasoning about various
important forms of program behavior. It studies a typical functional programming
language, and two typical parallel imperative languages: a language for shared-
variable parallelism, and a language of communicating processes related to
Hoare's CSP and Milner's CCS. Notions of behavior considered for the parallel
languages include safety and liveness properties, and partial and total
correctness, assuming various forms of fairness properties that correspond to
natural assumptions about the runtime execution of concurrent processes. This
should permit reasoning about parallel programs to be carried out without
knowledge of or reference to details concerning scheduling. There also is a
research focus on intensional properties concerning runtime and efficient use of
resources. Technically, the project aims to develop fully abstract semantics,
with respect to a variety of important notions of program behavior. A semantics
is fully abstract if it gives the same meaning to two program phrases precisely
when they induce identical behavior in all program contexts. This provides a
rigorous criterion for judging the utility of a semantics in supporting
compositional or modular reasoning about program behavior. The long term goal is
the development of a unifying framework suitable for establishing and exploiting
relationships between languages, models, and proof methods for reasoning about
programs. In particular, the research seeks to establish a mathematically
tractable theory and use it to develop practical techniques for modular design
and analysis of parallel programs.
