The Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program at the University of
California - Santa Barbara is an eight-week-long program designed to introduce
its participants to mathematical research. It seeks to admit twelve students
each summer from 2015-2017 to work with two faculty members on original research
problems in mathematics. Previous iterations of this REU have prided themselves
on their track record of recruiting women, minorities, and students from
colleges that lack research opportunities for their students. The program aims
to continue this trend of recruiting underrepresented and underserved groups in
mathematics, and views this as one of the fundamental goals of this
REU.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this REU is to introduce its undergraduate
participants to the practice and culture of mathematical research. The topics
researched will vary from year to year; likely candidate areas include the
fields of design theory, matrix theory, linear algebra, and graph theory. On an
academic level, students in the REU will be exposed to a large amount of
background material in mathematics. They will learn about their fields of
interest through minicourses taught by faculty and immersion in their research
problem. As well, students will be guided in the practical-level concerns of how
to give talks, create posters, and write research papers through weekly
meetings, presentations, and written reports. Students will be guided by faculty
in how to present their results in appropriate research conferences and in
submitting papers containing their work to refereed journals. Moreover, panels
throughout the summer will advise students on how to pursue graduate studies,
write a resume and personal statement, network in conferences, and continue to
engage with the wider mathematical community once they return to their home
institution among others.
