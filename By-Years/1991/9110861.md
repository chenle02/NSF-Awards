The objective of this research is to provide analysis tools and techniques to
support the evolutionary maturation of a software system from an early prototype
implementation used to explore requirements to a robust, production
implementation. The approach taken is to first develop automated analysis
mechanisms for the generation of detailed structural models for highly
evolutionary or "exploratory" software systems. These mechanisms will then be
applied to representative software systems, and the resulting models will be
analyzed both individually and collectively for information that supports
incremental improvements in structural robustness and reliability. The tools and
techniques will build upon prior experiences with type flow analysis, a program
analysis technique in support of exploratory software development. This research
will yield new insight into the phenomena of software evolution, new tools for
automated support of software development, and insights into the appropriate
characteristics of languages for prototyping and production quality
implementations.
