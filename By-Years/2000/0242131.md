Drs. Brett Tyler and Bruno Sobral of Virginia Tech., in collaboration with Dr
Jeff Boore of the DOE Joint Genome Institute have been awarded a grant to create
a rough draft of the entire DNA sequence of the soybean pathogen Phytophthora
sojae. Plant pathogens from the genus Phytophthora cause destructive diseases of
an enormous variety of crop plant species as well as forests and native
ecosystems. The potato pathogen P. infestans was responsible for the Irish
potato famine, and is still a destructive pathogen of concern for biosecurity.
Superficially, Phytophthora pathogens resemble fungi, but they in fact belong to
a group called Stramenopiles that are most closely related to algae such as kelp
and diatoms. Hence conventional fungus control measures often fail against these
pathogens. P. sojae has been chosen for the project because it is relatively
easy to genetically manipulate. This project will be tightly integrated with a
project funded by the DOE to determine a draft sequence of the oak sudden death
pathogen P. ramorum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the project will
include direct training of postdoctoral fellows and undergraduates, and visiting
researchers from minority institutions in a multidisciplinary, team-oriented
environment that emphasizes development of the communications skills required
for synergistic interactions between experimental and computational biology. The
community annotation platform will provide a multi-disciplinary training
environment for researchers world-wide. This research will advance the microbial
genome research infrastructure by developing and making publicly available, the
first in-depth genomic resource for a pathogen from the Stramenopile kingdom.
This resource will provide a basis for new control measures against a group of
pathogens which have major impacts on global ecosystems, food security and
agricultural production. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a Microbial Genome
Sequencing Award funded through a collaborative program between the National
Science Foundation and the Department of Agriculture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
