The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to improve
food safety and security of hand harvested food crops through individualized
geo-spatial data collection. Much like highway cameras have an ability to tell
the status of traffic on a given freeway are vastly improved through the
individualized data of each driver and their phones, hand harvested food can
benefit from improving traceability and transparency from block level data to
single points of harvest, recalling intersecting mapping data. Geo-specific data
can also enable better land productivity measurement over textual block data.
Individualized, personally owned, data enables workers to have portability of
information, building a resume of dependability and performance. In addition, it
becomes an integral component of a viable transparency scheme. The project will
potentially improve the economic standing of harvesters, improve the capability
of farmers to better understand their workforce and land, assist marketers with
improved data to insure against breakdowns in food safety, and enable consumers
transparency without added steps to the system.

This I-Corps project further develops improved data collection methods in high-
value hand-picked specialty crops. The data in question is a precise record of
who harvests what, where and when. Contextual data (quality,
irrigation/fertilization data, cultural practice maps, etc.) are added and
visualized for farmers. The project will test the relationship of data sets
toward improved decision skills; better management depends on better
measurement. It provides a better understanding of inhomogeneities in space and
time. Addressing these inhomogeneities leading to investigation and reductions
of variance. The system will enables comprehension of bottlenecks and workflow
problems in labor process and allow dynamic and real-time decisions. The system
will also allow quantitative approaches toward finding optimal decisions in
several parts of the system and provide a platform for decentralized decision-
making based on common data.
