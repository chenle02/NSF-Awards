Design is constraint-oriented, that is, much of the design process involves the
recognition, formulation, and satisfaction of constraints. Constraints range
from soft constraints imposed by aesthetic considerations to hard constraints
imposed by physical laws. Constraints may impose relationships upon geometric as
well as non- geometric aspects of a design. The goal of this research project is
to develop a new theory and new interactive graphic tools for conceptual design.
The problem of interest is constraint negotiation and, in particular,
constraints that relate to a design's geometry (i.e. form), its performance
(i.e. function), and the physical laws which govern it (i.e. physics).
Constraints related to marketing, economics and fabrication are not considered.
