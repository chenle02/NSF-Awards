ABSTRACT DMS - 0202796. PI: Dan Knopf

My research centers on geometric evolution equations, notably the Ricci flow and
related curvature flows. I plan to study seven areas in which I have obtained
prior results, and where continued work is likely to yield new and useful
mathematics. [1] When a flow converges, it is valuable to study the stability of
its limit, in order to improve our global understanding of the dynamics of
flows. [2] If a flow fails to converge but behaves in a nonsingular way, one can
still study the dynamics of this collapse by classifying the asymptotic behavior
of nearby solutions. [3] In most cases, a flow does become singular; so it is of
paramount importance (particularly in regard to Hamilton's program to resolve
Thurston's Geometrization Conjecture) to develop a better classification of
singularities. [4] The basic method of studying singularities is the
construction of a sequence of parabolic dilations (blow-ups). To take limits of
these solutions, one must obtain (partial) injectivity radius estimates by
various means. [5] The most powerful (but perhaps most difficult) way to obtain
such injectivity radius estimates would be to study and extend existing Harnack
estimates of the type pioneered by Li and Yau and further developed by Hamilton.
[6] It is also useful to study the asymptotic behavior and stability of
parabolic dilations at certain model singularities (a method which has been very
fruitful in studying the mean curvature flow). [7] Further information about
singularities can be obtained by constructing and studying solitons: self-
similar solutions that often arise as limits of blow-ups. Moreover, Kaehler
Ricci solitons have interesting connections with complex geometry and algebraic
geometry.

Geometric evolution studies the way an object's shape changes. In some cases,
such as the mean curvature flow and porous media flow, the motivation is to
model certain physical phenomena such as the motion of an interface in forming
metallic alloys, the shape of a thin film of highly viscous oil, or the flow of
oil in shale. In other cases, the goal is to improve the shape of an object,
either to find optimal (most efficient) shapes, or else to help mathematicians
recognize and classify geometric objects. My own research is part of a large
program to resolve one of the most compelling open questions in mathematics: the
desire to understand and classify all possible 3-dimensional shapes. But
regardless of whether their motivation comes from material science or pure
mathematics, all geometric evolution problems have much in common; so that the
field benefits from rich cross-fertilization. In particular, ideas and
techniques that are developed for any of these highly nonlinear problems are
usually quickly adaptable to related applications.
