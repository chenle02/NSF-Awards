This grant will be used to research problems in the harmonic analysis of the
plane. In particular, we will investigate the boundedness of certain directional
maximal operators, both those corresponding to sets of directions and those
related to Zygmund's conjecture on differentiation in the direction of a
Lipschitz vector field. We will investigate some other geometrical problems in
the plane which are related to spaces of functions with bounded mean
oscillations.

One of the most basic results in the history of mathematics is the fundamental
theorem of calculus, which states that one can recover a function by
differentiating its integral. The beauty of this result has led to a search for
generalizations, giving rise to so-called differentiation theory. The purpose of
this project is to study a problem posed by Zygmund some 40 years ago which
tests how well differentiation works with respect to not-very-smooth choices of
directions.
