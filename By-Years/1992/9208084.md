The statistical mechanics of ordering in intermetallic alloys will be studied by
performing numerical simulations and renormalization group calculations based on
a model atomistic hamiltonian derived from the Hohenberg-Kohn density functional
theory. The construction of the hamiltonian is based on the effective medium
theory of chemical binding which provides a simple yet accurate description of
the interatomic interactions mediated by the fermi sea of electrons in a metal.
The specific systems to be studied include copper-gold binary alloys and
aluminum based transition alloys which exhibit quasicrystalline structures. We
will study both equilibrium and nonequilibrium phenomena. %%% The proposed
research will conduct theoretical studies of the phase diagrams, including both
equilibrium and kinetic effects, for two classes of alloys. The copper-gold
system is a prototypical binary alloy which is well studied experimentally. The
aluminum based transition alloys are of more technological importance and are of
additional scientific interest due to the quasicrystalline phases which can
form. The Principal Investigator has conducted preliminary work through a
Research Opportunities for Women Career Advancement Award.
