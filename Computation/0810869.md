The proposed research emphasizes that dramatic advances in computation must be
driven by a fundamental understanding of the theory behind numerical methods.
One of the main innovations in this proposal is the development of central
schemes. While central schemes are considered to be among the most powerful
numerical methods for time dependent PDEs, in particular for solving transport
equations, there are still several fundamental issues to be resolved if they are
to reach their full potential. This proposal also concentrates on the
investigation of the power of anisotropy of level set methods, the
implementation of implicit methods, and the power of multi-scale techniques in
data assimilation.

Most real world problems are solved by computers. Many such problems are so
complicated that the existing computational methods are insufficient to provide
the accuracy needed. This situation cannot be solved by simply building faster
computers. Indeed, the quest for finer resolution and more accurate models far
outstrips gains in computational power. Moreover, as has been demonstrated often
in the past, innovations in computer algorithms and software pay larger
dividends than advances in computational power. The research in this project
seeks to make innovative advances in the mathematics behind computer programs
(so-called numerical algorithms) which will have the effect of significantly
speeding up computation and thereby solving many scientific and engineering
problems facing this country such as tracking pollutants in coastal areas or
developing fast and accurate sensors for medical imaging.
