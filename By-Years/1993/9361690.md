9361690 Jacobsmeyer This project is funded under the National Science
Foundation's (NSF) Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, which is
designed to provide an opportunity for small business, particularly the small
high technology firm, to participate in NSF research. Phase I of the SBIR
program serves as a filter to select promising proposals and determine if the
firm can do high quality research. Phase II is the principal research project.
Phase III is the conversion of the NSF-funded research into commercial
applications and technological innovation supported by follow-on private venture
capital or other non-federal financing. The focus of this Phase I project is to
investigate a new adaptive technique for code division multiple access (CDMA)
channels that will increase digital cellular capacity. The technique
automatically and dynamically adjusts each user's data rate to the instantaneous
fading and interference conditions of the CDMA channel. The research objectives
are to model the channel, simulate the technique, and demonstrate performance
improvements in throughput and blocking probability. Throughput improvements of
a factor of 5 and reductions in blocking probability of a factor of 4 appear
possible.
