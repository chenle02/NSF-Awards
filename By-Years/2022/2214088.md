This project studies the development of social relationships between culturally
distinct groups and how people use those relationships. As populations around
the world face growing pressure from climate change, the risk of environmental
catastrophe, depletion of local resources, and conflict between groups
increases. Yet, social relationships can supply resources for day-to-day
survival, such as food, money, and physical assistance. Social relationships
that cross groups may be especially important in times of stress because they
provide access to crucial resources that cannot be obtained locally. The social
relationships a person has are shaped by the groups a person belongs to, such as
their household or neighborhood, and by their personal characteristics such as
their age or gender, as well as the relationships they have with others.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To better understand how between-group relationships
develop and function, this project studies multilevel networks of friendship and
social support in two adjacent but culturally distinct populations. The project
collects data on how these networks develop and evolve over time. It also
collects data on individual characteristics, such as age, gender, and status to
understand how personal characteristics shape social relationships. Bringing
together theory and data from anthropology, network science, and sociology, this
project uses network models to identify the factors that encourage relationships
between these two populations, including factors that promote resilience in the
face of limited resources. The project uses state-of-the-art simulation-based
methods to analyze data at the level of individuals and at the level of groups,
combining several sources of data to learn about how network structure and
individual and group characteristics are related to the mechanisms of
relationship-building. In doing so, this work tells us how individuals build and
leverage relationships that provide access to supportive resources within and
beyond their communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
