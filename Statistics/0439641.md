As technology has advanced dramatically in recent years, both statistical
research and wildlife, fisheries, and ecological research have moved into a new
era. However, the use of advanced statistical methods in wildlife, fisheries,
and ecological research is in its infancy. There remain many fundamental
statistical and computational issues. There is a substantial interest among
biological scientists and statisticians in the development of modern statistical
methods with which to answer the relevant scientific questions. In the recent
years, many new statistical methods (such as spatial-temporal models, multiple
testing, stochastic search variable selection, Bayesian model averaging,
Bayesian hierarchical models, latent variable methods, and Markov chain Monte
Carlo methods, to name a few) are developed to deal with such questions.

The investigators request funding to host a Conference on New Development of
Statistical Analysis in Wildlife, Fisheries, and Ecological Research at the
University of Missouri. The goal of the conference is to advance the
understanding of statistical problems in wildlife, fisheries, and ecology. In
particular, the goal is to identify future research needs and to encourage and
facilitate collaboration among biological and statistical scientists and to
pursue the interdisciplinary research programs. The broader impact of this
conference will be manifested through fostering interaction between junior and
senior researchers and promoting communication between researchers from
government and acedamia on research problems, methodology, and theory.
