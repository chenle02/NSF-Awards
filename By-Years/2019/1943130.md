Randomized algorithms play a central role in important applications, including
machine learning, data privacy, and cryptography. Like all software,
probabilistic programs are susceptible to bugs. Furthermore, correctness
properties rest on mathematical proof; missteps in these arguments can render
algorithms incorrect before they are even implemented. Regardless of their
source, errors may go unnoticed for years, posing increasing risks as
probabilistic programs see broader adoption. This proposal seeks to advance the
theory and practice of verification for probabilistic programs, developing
technology to increase our confidence that these programs are correct.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops a software system to formally verify
randomized algorithms, by leveraging three complementary ideas: (1) Employ
higher-level properties that allows formal proofs to cover more ground with each
step; (2) Strive for compositional reasoning which can allow complex systems to
be verified by analyzing each component separately; and (3) Formalize human
proof techniques which should inform verification methods. In the near term,
results will enable verification for new algorithms. In the long term, this
proposal works towards a world where all randomized programs can be computer-
checked for correctness prior to deployment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
