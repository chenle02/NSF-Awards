This action funds Xuan Luong of University of California, Berkeley to conduct a
research project, entitled "Determining the basis of differential estrogen
sensitivity in African clawed frog larvae (Xenipus laevis)," during the summer
of 2012 at Kitasato University in Sagamihara, Minami-ku, Kitasato. The host
scientist is Dr. Michihiko Ito.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to determine if variances in
gene expression are the bases of differential estrogen sensitivity observed at
the population and individual levels of Xenopus laevis, and if so, identify the
responsible gene(s). The goal is to better understand the mechanisms of sex
differentiation using an amphibian model, the African clawed frog. an important
aspect to address is the role of estrogen (E2) in this process at the population
and individual levels.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
