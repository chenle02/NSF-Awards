The goal of this research is to achieve a better understanding of the limit
behavior of a class of stochastic systems related to statistical mechanics,
random matrix theory and representation theory. Examples of such systems include
random stepped surfaces in three-dimensional space which, in particular, model
melting crystals; square-ice model which is a mathematical two-dimensional
approximation for a thin layer of ice; and interacting particle systems used for
modeling (e.g., a one-lane highway, the growth of plankton in the ocean). Our
aim is to extract macroscopic properties of very large systems starting from
their microscopic definitions, with main accents on the appearance of the
universal random fields and distributions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two
main distinctions of the systems we study. First is that we concentrate on and
explore 2d structures which generalize many classical 1d probabilistic models
such as eigenvalues of a random matrix. The two-dimensional extensions that we
consider give new and often more natural interpretations of earlier one-
dimensional results and also pave the way to prove new interesting asymptotic
results about well-known one-dimensional models. Second, most models in this
research enjoy a rich algebraic structure, which usually means that expectations
of many observables can be computed in a concise manner. The techniques include
usage of symmetric functions of representation-theoretic origin, eigenfunctions
of difference operators, orthogonal polynomials, etc. This exact solvability
provides tools for delicate asymptotic analysis and gives access to the
properties of the universal objects appearing in the limit, such as Tracy-Widom
distributions, the GUE-eigenvalues distribution, the GUE-corners process (its
two-dimensional extension), and the Gaussian Free Field. The results obtained
for the exactly solvable models are generally believed to extend to a large
variety of similar stochastic systems.
