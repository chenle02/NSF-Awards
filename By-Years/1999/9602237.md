9602237 This award will provides renewed support to a Research Training Group in
Cytoskeleton Biology at the University of Minnesota. Support will be phased out
gradually during the tenure of the award as other sources of funding are
secured. The faculty group includes members of the departments of Cell Biology
and Neuroanatomy, Genetics and Cell Biology, Biochemistry, and Plant Biology.
The funds awarded will provide stipends for graduate students and postdoctoral
trainees, will support research participation by undergraduates, and will defray
part of the cost of the trainees' research. In addition, funds will be used to
purchase specialized research equipment to be used by trainees and to bring
investigators from other research and academic institutions to the campus for
seminars . The cytoplasm of all eukaryotic cells contains a dynamic, fibrous
network of actin filaments, microtubules and intermediate filaments that
participate in virtually every aspect of cellular form and function. Because of
the ubiquity of the network and its role in cellular processes as diverse as
gene expression, cell replication, cell division, and cell movement, studies of
the cytoskeleton provide an excellent focus for multidisciplinary training in at
the forefront of modern biology.
