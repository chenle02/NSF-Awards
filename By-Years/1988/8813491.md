The sun is frequently thought of as a star in hydrostatic equilibrium, which
means that the inward force of gravity is balanced everywhere by the outward
force of pressure. The assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium is, however, just a
first-order approximation, particularly in its surface layers. There,
convection, sunspots cycles, magnetic fields, energetic outbursts (e.g., flares)
reveal a rather dynamic, cyclic, as well as chaotic behavior. This proposal
focuses on continuing with observations of the sun's global surface velocity
fields and magnetic fields that have been in progress for the past 21 years. The
principal investigator will also interpret the observations, which is difficult
and controversial at present. The contribution of this work, about which there
is no controversy, is that a priceless data base of solar surface activity,
already two decades in the making, will be extended.
