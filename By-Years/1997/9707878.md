This project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program,
involves bringing together a group of academic, industrial, and governmental
scientists, with broad experience in the area of chemical sensing, for a
Workshop that aims to enhance the US position in this field in the global arena.
Professor Richard M. Crooks of Texas A &amp; M University, together with Dr.
Jiri Janata of Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and Dr. Antonio J. Ricco of
Sandia National Laboratories, are the organizing committee for this Workshop.
This Workshop will describe the current state of chemical sensing and then
target those areas in chemical sensing that can be best attacked by an
interdisciplinary approach. The status of US work in chemical sensors will be
improved through this Workshop. The US is not a world leader in the area of
chemical sensing. This Workshop on chemical sensing aims to describe the current
status of chemical sensing in the US and then to foster an interdisciplinary
group approach to moving basic laboratory research in this area to practical
devices for the market place. Workshop participants come from academe, industry,
and government.
