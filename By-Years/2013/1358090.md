This award by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research is
in support of the 2013 Materials Research Society Fall Meeting symposium titled
"Synthetic Tools for Understanding Biological Phenomena." The goals of the
symposium are to: a) showcase recent advances in the design, synthesis,
characterization, and application of synthetic tools for understanding and
directing biological phenomena; b) facilitate a dialogue between polymer
scientists, chemists, bioengineers, and biologists to further the design and
application of biomaterials with controlled properties through networking and
the open exchange of ideas; and c) provide opportunities for young
investigators, including junior faculty, post-doctoral fellows, and graduate
students, especially from underrepresented groups, to present their latest
research results. The planned oral and poster sessions would provide a cutting-
edge scientific program and discussion forum that focus on specific fundamental,
applied sciences and engineering challenges that would facilitate the
translation of novel and facile chemistries for biomaterial synthesis and
applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts are high in terms of
their impact on students, post-docs, as well as in stimulating new ideas within
the biomaterials research community. The organizers of this MRS Symposium are
junior faculty scientists in their areas of specialization and have put together
an excellent program, and group of speakers and discussion leaders. Three of the
four symposium organizers are women, and five of the twelve invited speakers are
female scientists. Presentations by graduate students and post-doctoral
researchers including members of underrepresented groups will be strongly
pursued to encourage and facilitate scientific discourse, collaboration, and
education.
