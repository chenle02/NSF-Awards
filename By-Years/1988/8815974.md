Dr. Richard H. Judge is supported by an RUI grant from The Experimental
Physical Chemistry Program to perform high resolution spectroscopic studies of
small gas phase polyatomic molecules of interest to the astrophysical community.
Spectroscopic studies to be performed include: 1) Near Infrared, Ultraviolet and
Vacuum Ultraviolet studies of the molecule selenoformaldehyde, 2) Far
Ultraviolet and Vacuum Ultraviolet studies of methyleneimine, and 3) Vacuum
Ultraviolet studies of thioformaldehyde. Several undergraduate students will
actively participate in the proposed research.
