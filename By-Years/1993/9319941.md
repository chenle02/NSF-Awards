9319941 Harris This award supports the Chlamydomonas Genetics Center at Duke
University. The Chlamydomonas Genetics Center serves as a central repository to
receive, catalogue, preserve and distribute wild type and mutant cultures of the
green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and other chlamydomonas species in which
extensive genetic analysis has been done. The Center also maintains and
distributes gnomic and cDNA clones of Chlamydomonas nuclear, chloroplast and
mitochondrial genes. Information on culture methods, genetic analysis, and other
aspects of Chlamydomonas research is also provided, and an extensive
bibliography of references on Chlamydomonas, and a DNA sequence database are
available. Descriptions of strains and plasmids in the Chlamydomonas Genetics
Center are directly accessible to the public on the Duke University gopher
server, and will in the future be part of a comprehensive public database now
being created.
