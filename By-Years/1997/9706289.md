9706289 Burnley The goal of this investigation is to develop improved mechanical
models of the internal stresses and strains caused by nucleation and growth of
dense transition zone phases, wadsleyite and ringwoodite, in olivine. There is
much evidence to argue that the mechanical response of the host olivine
influences kinetics and fabric development during transformation. These
mechanical effects should be most profound in low temperature environments
within subducting lithospheric slabs where olivine is relatively strong. Phase
transformation and the resulting metamorphic fabrics it produces can have a
strong influence on the behavior of a subducting slab because transformation in
the slab determines its relative buoyancy as well as its strength. The PIs will
develop numerical models of the mechanical interactions between parent and
daughter phases during transformation, guided by observations of experimentally
produced transformation microstructures collected over a wide range of pressure,
temperature and stress conditions. ***
