This research explores various applications of the extension theorems and
commutant lifting theorems for contraction operators on Krein spaces. Some of
these problems, such as the Krein space formulation of Foias' generalization of
an interpolation problem of Dym and Gohberg, are natural restatements of
classical Hilbert space problems. Other of these problems, such as the study of
maximal negative subspaces of bicontractive operators, make sense only within
the context of indefinite inner product spaces. This research is in the general
area of modern analysis. Its focus is on the commutant lifting theorems for
certain classes of operators on Krein spaces. For Hilbert space contractions,
the lifting theorem has been well known since the late 1960's and has been a
powerful tool in areas such as classical interpolation theory and in corona
theory.
