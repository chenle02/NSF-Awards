This proposal focuses on theoretical study of the physical realizability of
topological phases from two perspectives. The first is to perform numerical
simulations of several proposed Hamiltonian models that have been put forward as
candidates for supporting non-Abelian topological phases, with the general goals
of i) identifying the conditions under which these emergent phases arise from
physically realistic Hamiltonians, ii) characterizing these phases and analyzing
their robustness, and iii) evaluating the effects of braiding operations. The
second is to explore theoretically how to artificially engineer one such
Hamiltonian model using cold trapped molecules. Since numerical simulations of
emergent phenomena address new physics that is not well understood today, we
need new computational tools to characterize and understand the subtleties of
the resulting quantum many-body behavior. We shall employ a range of Quantum
Monte Carlo (QMC) techniques to address these phenomena, with new variants
introduced as required for specific problems.
