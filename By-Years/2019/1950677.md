The REU Site: Mathematical Modeling in the Sciences is established at Prairie
View A&amp;M University, a historically black institution. The REU Site aims to
engage freshmen and sophomores from predominantly teaching universities across
the nation in interdisciplinary research and prepare them for successful study
by developing their mathematical background and interdisciplinary vision among
other professional skills. The research focus of the REU Site is incorporation
of mathematical modeling and techniques to investigate various practical
problems in biology, chemistry, and physics. REU site students participate in
eight-week summer research activities. An introductory seminar given by all
research mentors will help students choose a project and plan their activities.
Participants will have two mentors from two different disciplines, one of which
is mathematics. The REU site summer research activities, training in MatLab and
other software, and daily meetings with mentors will help participants succeed
in their research, present their outcomes to peers and mentors, and prepare
conference talks and publications. Students will continue to communicate with
their mentors to finish their work on presentations and papers during the
following academic year. This program will contribute to preparing a new
generation of young educators, scientists, and engineers from minority groups.
The proposed activities increase the visibility of research activities provided
in minority-serving, predominantly teaching universities and the involvement of
African-American and Hispanic undergraduates in
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed interdisciplinary projects will
provide participants with new mathematical techniques applicable across
disciplines, as well as demonstrate new areas where powerful mathematical tools
are needed and can be used. Students will get an interdisciplinary research
experience while investigating problems with meaningful practical interpretation
and working on their papers and presentations. This experience will enrich REU-
site participants with new interdisciplinary knowledge and demonstrate the power
of mathematical techniques to address practical problems. This project is co-
funded by the Division of Mathematical Sciences, the Division of Biological
Infrastructure, the Division of Physics, the Office of Multidisciplinary
Activities, and the Division of Human Resource
Development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
