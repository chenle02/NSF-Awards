This Presidential Young Investigator Award given in the Organic and
Macromolecular Chemistry Program provides support for the work ("Molecular
Design" or "Molecular Engineering") of Dr. Eric V. Anslyn at the University of
Texas at Austin. The research involves the design, synthesis, and utilization of
molecules that accomplish a specific objective or task in a similar manner to
biological molecules. Molecular recognition and molecular assembly are being
used to approach problems in bioorganic and organometallic catalysis, and solid
state structure design. One area of study is involved with developing molecular
clefts. The interior of the cleft can be used to recognize and bind several
different types of molecules. The molecules are being designed to catalytically
hydrolyze amides and phosphodiesters. A second area of study involves
development of templates that recognize and bind organic functional groups in
organic media. These templates will be attached to organometallic catalysts in
order to accomplish substrate multipoint binding and to impart specificity in
the catalysis. Another focus of research is on the development of electrical
conductors and ferromagnets which possess important properties desired in the
semiconductor and data storage industries.
