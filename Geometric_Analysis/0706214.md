Abstract

Award: DMS-0706214 Principal Investigator: Lizhen Ji

This award provides partial support for six days of meetings in Cambridge,
Massachusetts during late summer 2008 on geometric analysis and related fields.
The conference aims to develop a comprehensive overview of the present status
and future directions of geometric analysis and its connections to many areas
including algebraic geometry, analysis, topology, mathematical physics, and
string theory.

The occasion for this large conference on geometric analysis and related
geometric subjects is the sixtieth birthday of Shing-Tung Yau, one of the
leaders in the area. Geometric analysis is a marriage of geometric problems and
ideas, which often concern properties of geometric spaces on large scales, with
analytic techniques that begin with small-scale features of geometry and
sometimes allow us to extrapolate those to large-scale statements. Two of the
great successes of geometric analysis are the Calabi Conjecture, settled by Yau
in the 1970s and later found to be a key to the development of string theory,
and the Poincare Conjecture, a celebrated problem that was open for more than
one hundred years before its resolution just a few years ago by G. Perelman, who
brought to maturity a program launched in the 1980s by R. Hamilton. Many of the
results and techniques developed over the last thirty years in geometric
analysis and differential geometry were essential to the proof of the Poincare
Conjecture, and the ideas contributed to the problem by Perelman have set off
worldwide activity on new questions in geometric analysis. For more information
