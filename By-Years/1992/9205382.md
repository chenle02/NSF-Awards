This project is an investigation of the structural characteristics, provenance,
and sedimentology of proximal synorogenic conglomerates of Late Cretaceous-
Paleocene age in northeastern Utah. Because these deposits contain progressive
structures and well developed unroofing sequences of clast types, they should be
useful for incremental retrodeformation of the NE Utah thrust belt. The general
questions to be addressed include: (1) What are the structural characteristics
of proximal, thrust-derived fans, and can these structures be used to
retrodeform the conglomerates? (2) What are the spatial relationships between
angular unconformities and large-scale morphostratigraphic lithosomes in these
proximal fans, and can these relationships shed new light on interpretations of
tectonic control on sediment distribution during thrust faulting? (3) What
structures control the production and distribution of sediment in thrust belts--
large scale structural culminations or frontal tip anticlines? In addition to
these general questions, the proposed study will address several longstanding
regional problems in the NE Utah thrust belt, such as the location of the
southern terminus of the Crawford thrust and the former extent of the Wilard
thrust sheet. This study will take an integral approach to working out the
complexities of the linking zone between the thrust belt-proper and the adjacent
basin. The results of the proposed research will be of use to structural
geologists, foreland-basin stratigraphers and sedimentologists, and basin
modelers.
