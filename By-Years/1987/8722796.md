This research concerns the generation and evolution of magnetic fields in
astrophysical environments. The effects of partial ionization on dynamo models
of the galactic magnetic field and of pregalactic magnetic field amplification
will be investigated. This work will build upon a preliminary exploration of
these effects by Dr. Zweibel. The formation of electric current sheets or
filaments in the magnetic fields of stellar coronae with consequences for
heating of the coronal gas will also be studied. This area too has been of
longstanding interest to several principal collaborators at the University of
Chicago: A. Konigl, E. Parker, and R. Rosner. In addition to research
activities, Dr. Zweibel will teach graduate courses in her specialty (Fluid and
Plasma Dynamics I or II, Special Topics in Plasma Astrophysics), participate in
Theoretical Astrophysics and Faculty Research Seminars and in the regular
Astronomy and Astrophysics Colloquium Series, and deliver guest lectures to
undergraduate classes in Physical Science. This project furthers VPW program
objectives which are (1) to provide opportunities for women to advance their
careers in engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and
(2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering by providing
greater visibility for women scientists and engineers employed in industry,
government, and academic institutions. By encouraging the participation of women
in science, it is a valuable investment in the Nation's future scientific
vitality.
