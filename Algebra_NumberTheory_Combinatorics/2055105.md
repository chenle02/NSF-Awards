The notion of symmetries plays a key role in our understanding of various
physical theories. A basic example can be seen in the undergraduate classroom,
where symmetries of a system are used to solve difficult flux integrals.
Classically the symmetries of a physical system are described by a mathematical
object known as a group. One of the major advances of modern physics has been
the revelation that groups are not sufficient to capture the symmetries of a
quantum system. It is now understood that the symmetries of a quantum system can
be captured on its algebra of observables (a von Neumann algebra). The
mathematical tool which describes these generalized symmetries is known as a
tensor category. This award will support the proposer's plans to use the theory
of tensor categories to answer several long-standing questions in mathematical
physics and von Neumann algebras. The award also will contribute to US workforce
development through the training of undergraduate students via undergraduate
research projects.

This project has two main goals. The first is to classify type II quantum
subgroups for many of the low rank Lie algebras. This question is motivated by
mathematical physics, where it is equivalent to extending the Wess-Zumino-Witten
conformal field theories. This work builds on recent progress made by Terry
Gannon. The second is to construct and classify many new examples of bi-finite
bimodules of von Neumann algebras. This question is inspired by the
classification of small index subfactors. As in the subfactor classification, PI
will uncover exotic examples.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
