Multi-core processors provide the only way to continue improving peak
performance without much increase in the power consumption. However, there are
serious challenges not only in expressing all the parallelism in the
application, but also in exploiting the available parallelism by efficient
application management on modern multi-core architectures. These challenges are
only compounded by the trend of the absence of memory virtualization in the
hardware, that is observed in futuristic processors, like the IBM Cell, and the
Intel experimental 80-core processor. Memory management cannot be supported in
hardware, because cache coherency protocols do not scale to 100s or 1000s of
cores, and also because memory management in hardware consumes significant
energy. Memory management in software can exploit application and data
characteristics to reduce the overhead, however, it increases the burden of the
application programmer. This project aims to develop tools and techniques to
automatically manage the limited local memories present in each of the cores of
a multi-core processor. In addition to power-efficient execution, the main
objective of the project is to relieve the application programmer of the burden
of carefully crafting the application, dividing and mapping it onto the cores to
ensure its correct execution and portability.
