This proposal concerns the synthesis and characterization of solid-state ternary
chalcogenides (a chalcogenide being a compound that contains S, Se, or Te). The
discovery of new physical properties cannot progress if new compounds are not
synthesized. While current emphasis is on the oxides, owing to the discovery of
high superconducting temperatures in some oxides, this proposal addresses what
they perceive to be an imbalance and is concerned with chalcogenides. Among the
systems proposed for study are (a) structural chemistry in the Nb,Ta/Pd,Pt/S,Se
systems; (b) intercalation chemistry of some layered ternary chalcogenides; (c)
synthesis and physical properties of some f-electron ternary chalcogenides; (d)
preparation and properties of new ternary tellurides; (e) chemistry of
polychalcogenides of the transition metals; and (f) some searches for new
materials in areas that have not been studied. The ultimate goal of such studies
is a sufficient correlation of composition, structure, and physical properties
so that new materials with desired properties may be custom designed.
