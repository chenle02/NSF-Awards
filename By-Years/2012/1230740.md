Migration of health organization software services to a cloud environment posses
special security and confidentiality risks. The proposed work seeks to design
and evaluate security mechanisms for cloud computing environments as well as a
new security architecture for cloud-based health services. New mechanisms will
be developed in the areas of utility-based encryption, data fragmentation, and
redactable signatures and tested in several deployed cloud environments. The
effort would establish the first integrated cloud security architecture
combining protected memory, secure distributed storage, and utility-based
encryption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcomes of the proposed work have the
potential for significant impact the use of cloud computing in the health care
sector. This adoption hinges critically on the fact that the safety, security
and integrity of the data be maintained. The proposed work has the potential to
achieve an architecture that can preserve these characteristics in a cloud
environment. The work is supported by the Industry Advisory Board as well as
individual industry members of the center and has the potential to extend the
centers portfolio through expansion into the cloud-based health informatics
area. The center will involve graduate students in the work and disseminate
results both through publication and the involvement of the PI in the Georgia
Health Information Exchange (HIE) project.&lt;br/&gt;
