High fabrication costs coupled with decreasing time-to-market for products
require an increase of the programmable component of integrated circuits. Core
processors embedded in a gate array provide programmability. This changes
circuit design from just gates in an array, to a combination of instructions
running on a core processor coupled with a gate array. Gates, as basic units of
computation on silicon, are well understood. This research is focused on
understanding embedded instructions as basic units of computation on silicon.
Initial work is on finding methodologies for synthesizing embedded software.
Problems being examined are: worst case timing analysis; power modeling and
analysis; and high- quality retargetable code synthesis. Approaches include:
developing timing models capable of handling features such as caches and
pipelines, and determining worst-case paths; analyzing system power consumption;
and formal architectural specification of specialized architectures, as well as
code-generation algorithms that can take advantage of special architectures.
