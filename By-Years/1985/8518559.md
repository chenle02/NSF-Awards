The dynamics of growth and change in heart, lung, and blood vessels will be
studied in response to variations in blood pressure and flow. The aim is to
understand the relationship between growth and stress to control health problems
and possibly to develop new manufacturing methods for artificial tissues. The
study is based on previous results concerning residual stress in tissues and the
mechanisms by which these stresses arise. The research is likely to give
fundamentally important information about the way in which imposed stress
determines the rate of tissue growth.
