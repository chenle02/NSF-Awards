In this project, investigators will deploy deep, current-following RAFOS floats
over a four-year period in the Deep Western Boundary Current off Cape Hatteras
in the vicinity of the Blake Plateau in the western North Atlantic Ocean. Recent
direct current measurements suggest that there are several components to this
"current", whereas tracer studies suggest a single broad thermohaline current
driven by the formation of deep water in the Northern North Atlantic. Deployment
of RAFOS floats in three separate components of this deep recirculation, and
tracking them over a three-year period, will allow the P.I. to more accurately
describe this current regime, and to better calculate the heat, salt, and
momentum balances in a region that is a key to the circulation and transport of
the entire North Atlantic Ocean.
