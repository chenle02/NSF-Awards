This project is a collaborative effort to study thin film ferroelectrics. The
team is composed of a synthetic solid state inorganic chemist (academic), an
electron microscopist/materials scientist (academic), and a solid state
physicist and characterizations laboratory (industrial). The purpose of this
project is to gain a thorough understanding of how synthetic methods modify the
properties of thin film barium titanate and lead zircornium titanate. The thin
films will be prepared using two substantially different processes: chemical
vapor deposition and organo-metallic decomposition (sol-gel type chemistry).
Different experimental approaches will be examined within these two general
synthetic methods. Careful structural and chemical characterization of the films
will be performed to determine the effects of the synthetic process. Detailed
physical methods will determine the ferroelectric properties of these films and
there resistance to failure. It is the goal of this project to correlate the
processing method with the ferroelectric properties and to optimize the
synthetic plan. This project is being supported jointly by the Division of
Materials Research and Division of Electrical and Communication Systems.
