This award provides funds to aid in the purchase of a state-of-the-art nutrient
autoanalyzer for use by researchers at the Baruch Marine Field Laboratory (BMFL)
in the measurement of nutrients such as ammonium, nitrate, nitrite, phosphate,
silicate, urea and other chemical compounds found in the sea and in freshwater.
Low nutrient concentrations often limit plant growth and productivity - the
reason for adding fertilizers to crops - while elevated concentrations are often
harmful to the environment and subsequently to humans. At BMFL, several ongoing
research projects are examining how some nutrients cycle naturally within an
ecosystem, and how changes in the types and quantities of nutrients influences
primary (plant) and secondary (animal) production. Other projects are evaluating
how various human activities affect nutrient concentrations in the environment.
Nutrient analysis is also an integral component of a long-term ecosystem
monitoring program at BFML, a program that allows investigators to evaluate the
impact of climatic events such as the current drought, storms or El Nino. In
addition, the importance of nutrient cycling to the health of the environment
makes nutrient analysis an important emphasis in BMFL-sponsored educational
activities that include undergraduates, graduate students and decision makers
(e.g., natural resource managers and public officials). The purchase of a state-
of-the-art nutrient autoanalyzer will the commitment of the BMFL to support the
monitoring and experimental research of nutrient status and trends in coastal
ecosystems while expanding research and education capabilities for visiting
investigators and students.
