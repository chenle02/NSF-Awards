9420604 Muller This supplement provides funding for a Small Grants for
Exploratory Research (SBER) award for the University of California, Berkeley's
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Sensors and Actuators. The
funds will augment the research of an ongoing Center project entitled "Silicon
Integrated Optical Systems for Robotic Sensor Applications," to enable
preliminary work on untested and novel ideas in microoptomechanical systems.
This research addresses the integration of micro optical systems on silicon, for
potential applications in robotic sensing, automatic optical alignment, tunable
filters and lenses for fiber-optic communication systems nd holographic
displays. This advance is now made possible by advances in
microelectromechanical systems and binary optics. This award, In the SGER mode,
supports initial exploration of optimal technologies, and methods for design and
layout of microactuated optical elements. Prototype designs will be fabricated
and tested These funds are being cost-shared by the Robotics and Machine
Intelligence Program, Division of Information, Robotics and Intelligent Systems
and the Solid State and Microstructures Engineering Program of the Division of
Electrical and Communications Systems. The Program Manager recommends the
University of California, Berkeley be awarded $40,000 for one year for this SBER
award.
