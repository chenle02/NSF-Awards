A center for the development of new instrumentation and the facilitation of its
application for biological research has been established. Its objective is to
provide for the systematic invention and development of improved electro-optical
microscopic imaging quantitation technologies, and to facilitate the application
of these new physical instrumentation capabilities through collaborative
research in molecular cell biology. The needs of biological research push
relentlessly at instrumental limitations even as they advance. The molecular
dynamics of vital processes in living cells can be revealed and measured by
appropriate electro-optical microscopic image acquisition, photon counting
quantitation of weak molecular fluorescence, and computerized digital image
processing with spatial and temporal transform analysis. The Center will aim to
optimize instrumentation capability for quantitation of receptor dynamics, cell
motion, structural fluctuations, spatial evolution of calcium ion activity,
membrane potential, pH and receptor distributions, and molecular motions of
individual fluorescence micro-image acquisition at faint light levels (photon
counting) and fast (millisecond) acquisition of brighter transient images with
efficient digital image processing, time resolved fluorescence imaging,
utilization of chemical indicators, 3D image construction, quantitative confocal
microscopy, image processing and laser interference imaging. Collaborative
interdisciplinary research to be accommodated by the center provides for new
cell biology research and focuses the instrumentation developments on
practicable technologies that can be adopted by other laboratories.
