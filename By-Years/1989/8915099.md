This project will identify and document model state approaches which have proved
successful in increasing the number of women and minorities receiving
undergraduate engineering degrees. Based on an analysis of these approaches, the
project staff, working with state education and science and technology
officials, will identify state policy options and develop recommendations for
state and Federal initiatives aimed at increasing female and minority
participation in engineering education. Specific activities of the project
include: the preparation of a background paper synthesizing current research and
cataloging current state initiatives; the preparation of approximately five
papers by people responsible for administering model programs focused on lessons
learned from their initiatives; and a final report containing recommendations
for consideration of the Governors and the National Science Foundation.
