Through this equipment grant project, the Graduate Program of Building Science
at the School of Architecture, University of Southern California, will procure
computer and testing equipment, dedicated to support earthquake research in
building science. The equipment will be for research projects in various stages
of development, including: 1) Lateral Design Graphs (LDG); 2) Vibration
Reduction Using Prestress in Wood Floor Framing; 3) Computer Simulation
Comparing Lateral Drift of Framing Systems; 4) Suspended High-rise Structures:
Methods to Reduce Drift; and 5) Orthogonal Grid Shell: Static Model Test
Comparing Deflections to Forms. All projects are related and of importance to
earthquake hazard mitigation activity. This equipment grant action will greatly
elevate the University's experimental research capability in support of its
excellent building science research and education program.
