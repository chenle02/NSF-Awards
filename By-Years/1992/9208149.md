Dispersal is a major life history characteristic composed of many interacting
traits. Most arguments about the evolution of dispersal patterns assume that
there is significant genetic variation for these traits and that they covary
genetically with other traits influenced by natural selection. A major
difficulty in understanding the evolution of dispersal patterns has been the
inability to quantify individual differences in those biological parameters
contributing to dispersal potential. In the marine slipper snail, Crepidula
fornicata, the principal biological trait governing dispersal capacity is the
duration of a free-swimming larval stage. Larval of Crepidula must develop in
the plankton for one to several weeks before becoming capable of metamorphosing
to the sedentary juvenile stage. This period of obligatory dispersal can now be
quantified for individual larvae. The study will determine the quantitative
genetic covariance with other larval and post-metamorphic traits that have been
previously proposed to influence the development of metamorphic competence and
fitness variation, and will specifically test the hypothesis that dispersal
capacity may evolve through its genetic correlation with other traits that are
subject to natural selection. The study will contribute to the increased
understanding of the biology of marine shellfish populations, and populations of
other intertidal and estuarine species.
