This is a study of small business success. The small business arena, a growing
sector of the economy which women have been entering in record numbers, provides
an important context in which to examine fundamental theoretical issues of
gender, work and family. This project combines a survey and intensive interviews
with small business owners in upstate New York. The study is organized around
two interrelated questions: 1) Through what mechanisms do structural and
individual variables contribute to inequality between men and women owners? 2)
How does family intersect with work to shape the economic and personal lives of
these women and men? %%% This project charts new territory in four major ways.
First, it traces the specific ways in which a broad range of structural and
individual variables combine to affect both economic and personal outcomes such
as emotional well-being. Particular attention is paid to the direct and indirect
paths through which personal and family characteristics affect both economic and
personal success. Second, this study brings together such seemingly disparate
areas of inquiry as the economics of small business, work-family linkages,
gender and reasoning, and emotional well-being. Such integration should enhance
understanding not only of gender and small business ownership, but of the
dynamics of gender, work and family more generally. Third, key work and family
issues are examined from the perspective of women and men who have more control
than most over all aspects of their work, including the boundaries between work
and family. Finally, the use of both quantitative and qualitative research
techniques will enhance the quality of the data and the strength of the
conclusions.
