This award will enable collaborative research between Professor Takumi Tsuchiya
of Colorado State University and Professor Kozo Nishikawa of Gifu University,
Japan. They will use chromosome manipulation techniques to study the genetic
architecture of chromosomes in wheat, barley and rye. Comparative observations
on the DNA content of individual chromosomes will be made and the genes
controlling morphological and isozymic traits will be mapped. This research will
provide basic information on chromosome evolution in cereals. The research teams
headed by Drs. Tsuchiya and Nishikawa will provide expertise in the cytogenetics
of all species to be studied. Colorado State University has excellent plant
growth facilities and equipment for cytological and genetic studies for all
plant species involved. Gifu University is specially equipped for biochemical
and molecular studies with a highly sophisticated microspectrophotometer set-up.
