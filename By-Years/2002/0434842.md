This award supports construction of a new building with space and AV equipment
for meetings and classes at a field station located on the Central Plains
Experimental Range in northeastern Colorado. Research at the site has been
conducted since 1938. The Shortgrass Steppe (SGS) Field Station has been in
existence at the site since the 1960's. Research at the Station has been
recognized worldwide as a source of important findings in grassland ecology. SGS
research has also provided important knowledge useful for land management in the
region. The new classroom/meeting facility will contain a large room for groups
of up to 60 individuals, a smaller conference room for 15-30 individuals, and an
office. The building will support the multi-disciplinary needs of students,
faculty and other researchers from Colorado State University, the University of
Northern Colorado, and the Agricultural Research Service, and will facilitate
use of the Station by visiting faculty and students from other institutions. The
new facility will also support the needs of educators and natural resource
interpreters in ongoing efforts to explain the biology and management of the
shortgrass steppe to students at all levels from elementary school through
college, individual ranchers, grazing associations, conservation groups, and the
general public. The need for the new building was identified through a strategic
planning process initiated over five years ago. Construction of this building
and of others identified in the strategic plan will be aided by substantial
financial support from Colorado State University and the University of Northern
Colorado.
