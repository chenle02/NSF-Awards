This proposal continues a program of basic research in nuclear physics. It is
known that `nucleons` (protons and neutrons) are composed of subunits called
`quarks`. In low energy nuclear physics a property called `charge symmetry` is
well preserved. It is assumed (with little experimental evidence) to be equally
valid at high energies. This project investigates whether charge symmetry is
broken at high energies. We suggest precise experiments to improve our
understanding of charge symmetry. We also relate charge symmetry to another
property called flavor symmetry, which states that different `types` of quarks
should contribute equally in protons and neutrons. We also study the motion of
particles in very narrow two dimensional systems. All particles possess
`wavelike` properties. When system dimensions are commensurate with a particle's
wavelength, dramatic results occur. We were the first to demonstrate that a
particle in a bent tube possesses bound states. We study both theory and
experiment for such states, in both tubes and wave guides. We also study the
onset of `turbulence` when particles move through bent tubes.
