A conference entitled "Braids, links, and mapping class groups" will be held on
March 15-20, 2005, at Barnard College/Columbia University. The mathematics
surrounding braid groups and mapping class groups has long been important in low
dimensional topology and geometry. Studying actions of these groups on
appropriate spaces is yielding essential insights on deformation and rigidity of
geometric structure and elsewhere. The representation theory of these groups, as
initiated by Jones, has become a separate field with deep connections to
operator algebras. Braid group representations coming from solutions to the
Yang-Baxter equation are fundamental to the theory of quantum groups, and
provide many connections with physics. Algorithmic questions, such as the word
and conjugacy problems in braid groups, serve as important examples in geometric
group theory, and have been applied to public-key cryptography.

Although these subjects have been widely studied since the 1975 publication of
Birman's book of the same name, research on these topics has been proceeding at
an accelerating pace, in a multitude of directions, and using diverse methods of
study and application. The conference's confirmed main speakers are some of the
world's leading researchers in the field, including the pioneers of these
approaches. The conference will provide a single forum for a comprehensive
meeting, which will promote cross-fertilization of research directions and
methods across diverse disciplines. An important goal is to provide graduate
students and young researchers with a coherent view of this wide-ranging
research area. The first two days of the conference will be dedicated to
introductory seminars and workshops for graduate students and researchers who
are new to this area. A proceedings volume based on the conference will be a
continuing resource for researchers.
