The subpolar open seas are under scrutiny for the role they may play in the
global carbon dioxide (CO2) cycle. While the level of biological production and
the fate of that production are central issues in the inquiry, the mechanisms
controlling even the level of biological production in the subpolar open seas
are not understood. This project will reformulate an ecosystem process model
integrating a biological model of lower trophic level interactions, including
phytoplankton production, grazing, and nutrient regeneration, into a one-
dimensional physical model of the upper ocean. The model will be developed and
first tested against the extensive physical and biological observations from
Ocean Station P (50 Degrees N 145 Degrees W) in the open subarctic Pacific
Ocean. Effects of physical-biological interactions and trophic complexity will
be assessed. The model will then be applied to the other two subpolar open seas,
the subarctic Atlantic and the subantarctic circumpolar ocean which, because of
biological and physical processes favorable to removal of CO2 from the surface
layer and its sequestration in the deep ocean, are thought to play a major role
in the global CO2 cycle.
