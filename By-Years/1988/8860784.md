The design of incinerators involves a conflict between two important goals:
completely destroying the toxic organic materials which are fed to the
incinerator and avoiding the emission of heavy metals which will also be present
in the waste material. If the incinerator temperature is excessive, the organics
will be completely destroyed but heavy metals can be vaporized, subsequently
condensing to form submicron particulates which are discharged to the
atmosphere. Decreasing the incinerator temperature can solve this problem but
can also cause less than complete destruction of the toxic organics. The
research program will demonstrate a solution to this dilemma which is created by
a threshold for oxidation resulting from the fact that the last remaining traces
of the toxic organics oxidize much more slowly than one would expect from their
measured oxidation rates at higher concentrations. Accordingly, to restore a
high oxidation rate, small amounts of a clean fuel such as natural gas are
injected during the final stages of the incineration process. The research will
demonstrate that the oxidation of toxic organics at trace levels is more
difficult than previously believed but that a simple inexpensive means can
overcome this difficulty. This will make incinerations both easier to run and
reduce their local environmental impact, translating into lower costs and easier
siting.
