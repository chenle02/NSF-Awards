The Engineering, Engineering Technology, and Computer Science Recruitment and
Retention Program addresses issues of both financial need and marginalization of
underrepresented students which can lead to high attrition. Three cohorts of
nine incoming students each in the Department of Engineering, Engineering
Technology and Computer Science, are provided two years of S-STEM scholarship
support up to $10,000/year; a three-week college-credit summer program prior to
the start of the Freshman year; monthly cohort meetings with guest speakers and
hands-on projects; and mentoring by college advisory board members. The summer
program is modeled after the successful Pre-College Minority Engineering Program
funded by NASA grants at the College from 1992-2006. The objective is to provide
a supportive environment that encourages student bonding and good study skills.
After students reach the milestone third year, the College provides continuing
financial support for the remaining two years, internship opportunities and
career-planning assistance.
