9451961 Szmyd The circuits laboratory developed serves as an integral part of a
restructured sequence of electrical circuits courses that includes a freshman
lecture and laboratory course taken by all engineering majors. This course
provides an introduction to electrical engineering that includes applications in
each of the engineering disciplines, modern laboratory instrumentation and test
methods, computer aided data acquisition and processing, interactive
computer/instrument based tutorials, individual and team activities, design
projects, and technical communications. The laboratory serves as a learning
center and a resource to support recruitment and retention efforts aimed at a
significant population of Native American students. The project also includes
development of curricular materials, instrumentation systems, and software to
serve as resources for other universities seeking innovation in their freshman
engineering programs.
