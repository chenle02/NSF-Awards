0-1 Semidefinite Programming (0-1 SDP) is a new optimization model that covers
several classes of challenging nonlinear integer programming problems. 0-1 SDPs
arise frequently from numerous applications in various domains such as learning,
communications and facility location. However, in spite of its broad range of
applications and the computational challenge it poses, little is known with
respect to the new optimization model except few results scattered in the
literature. In this project, the PI and his research group will study the
theoretical foundations of the 0-1 SDP model including identifying polynomially
solvable cases of the model and exploring its theoretical limitations from an
optimization perspective, develop resolution techniques for this new class of
problems such as effective exact algorithms and scalable approximation
algorithms that can deal with large size problems, and apply the new modeling
and resolution techniques to problems from various disciplines.

The primary goal of the project is to study a new optimization model that can be
applied to a broad range of domains such as learning and engineering design, and
to develop reliable and scalable resolution tools for such a model. Creative
modeling techniques are crucial for capturing the problem semantics in many
applications. For example, in multi-agent learning, every agent might have a
different objective and solution to the same problem. It is important to
integrate various opinions and solutions from the agents to have a more
comprehensive understanding and achieve a global objective. The new optimization
model in this project provides a powerful approach for multi-agent learning.
Reliable and scalable computational methods are essential for learning from
massive and noisy data set.
