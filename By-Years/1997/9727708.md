9727708 Fisch The overall goal of this research is to obtain a better
understanding of the physical and chemical properties of several unique self-
assembled systems in the dilute, semidilute, and concentrated solution regime.
Mixtures of both anionic and cationic surfactants will be studied as a function
of temperature, solvent salinity, and relative concentration of the two
surfactants. Surfactant-alcohol mixtures will also be studied to understand the
effects of structural isomers on the physico-chemical properties. These research
goals will be achieved by application of a wide variety of optical and physical
chemical techniques such as light scattering, viscosity and surface tension
techniques to colloidal and micellar systems. %%% Surfactants and mixtures of
surfactants are used extensively in industrial processing, biological and
pharmaceutical preparations, and drug delivery systems. Students studying the
physics and chemistry of self-organization in these systems, and the
manipulation of their properties, will acquire skills and knowledge in an area
of considerable technological importance. ***
