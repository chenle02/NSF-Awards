The objective of this project is to analyze operations involving aircraft
fuselage subassemblies, frames and doors. Alternative methods to optimize
production operations will be investigated. Computer models using available
software packages will be developed. Computer models will be used to optimize
the performance of fuselage manufacturing operations. Opportunities to optimize
existing work methods through setup time reductions and process improvements
will also be investigated. The internship is expected to lead to several
manufacturing projects and generate cooperative opportunities for students.
