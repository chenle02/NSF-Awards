Computational techniques have greatly extended the range of problems that can be
solved by numerical analysis. However, few tools support the combined practice
of collaborative learning and discovery in the computational sciences. This
project draws on recent work in embodied cognition, which suggests that the
process of building models--particularly models with dynamic visualizations--can
aid conceptual understanding in complex problem domains. The researchers will
develop a system to support and enhance collaborative discovery by re-
representing abstract scientific problems in an embodied way. The proposed
system will allow researchers to couple visuo-spatial skills with computational
techniques to develop understanding and collaborate in the modeling of complex
biological systems. Simultaneously, the project will develop techniques to
support collaborative modeling in science and engineering. The project will thus
test how theories from embodied cognition can inform interaction design and
create explicit knowledge about how collaborative discovery happens in the
sciences.

By changing the way abstract scientific problems and techniques are represented,
the proposed system will make these scientific problem easier for researchers to
understand and manipulate through embodied experience. This re-representation of
complex problems may have several benefits: 1) help researchers find solutions
to problems that would otherwise take too long or seem too difficult to solve;
2) enhance problem-driven learning approaches in science and engineering
disciplines; 3) enable interdisciplinary groups of learners or researchers to
come together and work on (and develop a shared representation of) complex
problems in a hands-on manner; and 4) make complex science and engineering
problems more accessible to everyday citizens. The project may also have
significant impacts on emerging interactive technologies by establishing
embodied cognition as a framework for interaction design.
