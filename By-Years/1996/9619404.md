This award provides funds to continue a Research Experiences for Undergraduates
Site in Psychology at Skidmore College. The eight week program will permit ten
students to participate in many phases of research, such as designing studies,
testing, analyzing data, and writing results. The projects providing the focus
for the research experience will include the study of children's memory
confusions, factors influencing face recognition, memory for nonverbal aspects
of communication, effects on memory of information overload, physiological
effects of stress, and mortality salience. The research interns will also
participate in several workshops designed to enhance their ability to pursue
more independent research experiences, such as the use of statistical packages
and software packages for experimental control, and workshops focused on
graduate school. This award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts
to attract talented students into careers in science through active
undergraduate research experiences.
