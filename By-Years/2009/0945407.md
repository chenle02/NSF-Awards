The requested funding will be used to continue providing guidance on major
ocean-related science, engineering, and policy issues to the federal ocean
agencies, including the National Science Foundation. The Ocean Studies Board
(OSB) is the focal point within the NRC for ocean-related science, engineering,
and policy issues. The board explores the science, policies, and infrastructure
needed to understand, manage, protect, and restore coastal and marine
environments and resources. The board exercises leadership within the ocean
community by helping identify and communicate the needs of the field, responds
to specific requests from government agencies and Congress, and oversees a
variety a study projects related to ocean science and engineering and their
impacts on policy. The operations of OSB are funded by a number of federal
agencies, including the U.S. Navy, NOAA, USGS, MMS, and NASA.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The OSB strives to
increase public awareness of ocean issues, to support ocean science education,
and to enhance the dissemination and impact of OSB reports. The OSB also
supports the recruitment of minorities into the earth sciences through
participation in mentoring and fellowship programs. To further outreach and
dissemination, the OSB prepares a 2-4 page nontechnical overview of each new
report that is broadly distributed in print and electronically. In addition, the
booklets that comprise the Ocean Science Series are intended to help readers
interpret information about the state of our oceans and to better understand the
role of ocean science.
