In software engineering, dynamic analysis is the checking of correct program
behavior during program executions. Dynamic analysis is advancing beyond
traditional capabilities such as profiling, trace traversing, and simple
property verification. The broader ramifications of dynamic analysis hinge on
meeting a key challenge called dynamic reasoning, which asks what
transformations on a program execution would lead to logical satisfaction of the
properties. For example, in data race detection, deciding whether a data race is
benign can be translated into deciding if changing the order of the two
conflicting memory accesses affects the output. Automatically patching faulty
code is equivalent to looking for changes so that the desired output can be
produced.

This research targets a number of key challenges for dynamic reasoning. Novel
canonical representations facilitate aligning executions, particularly the
original execution and its transformed version, so that execution comparison can
be performed at compatible places. Efficient transformation techniques include
checkpointing long executions and selectively perturbing execution state to
observe satisfiability. A reasoning engine based on constraint solving aims to
translate an arbitrary execution region into symbolic constraints and then use a
solver to reason about satisfiability. Using dynamic slicing to delimit the
execution region is the key to scalability. Among the broader impacts will be
certifiably more correct software.
