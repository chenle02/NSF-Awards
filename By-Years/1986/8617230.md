The international meeting ISOLDE IV (International Symposium on Locational
Decisions) will be held in Namur, Belgium during the period of June 11-16, 1987.
Location theories, methodologies and applications have been of interest to
researchers in numerous disciplines for many years. Locational decisions,
involving spacial positioning or area designations, are spatially-dependent
allocations of resources within an operating system. ISOLDE IV will be attended
by a mix of well-established researchers and young scientists interested in
locational problems. This grant will help support the travel of US attendees,
especially the younger ones. Professors Lowe and Wong have been leaders in this
field for some time now, and are well qualified to administer the award. Purdue
University has the resources necessary to carry out this activity. An award is
highly recommended.
