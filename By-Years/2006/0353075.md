People working collaboratively must establish and maintain awareness of one
another's intentions, actions, and results. Understanding the role of awareness
in computer-supported collaborative work (CSCW) and developing effective
software tools to support awareness are keys to the future success of CSCW
systems. This project will develop and evaluate a suite of awareness tools to
support coordinated planning, action, and outcome analysis in collaborative
science learning. Classroom-based field studies will be coordinated with a
series of laboratory investigations, to benefit from both the scope and
ecological validity of a field study and the analytical focus and control of
laboratory studies. Laboratory studies will adapt task simulation methods,
including the use of confederate participants, from the social psychology of
communication. A key scientific objective is to investigate and develop the
notion of activity awareness, the awareness of project work that supports group
performance in complex and long-term tasks. Activity awareness builds upon prior
research on social awareness (of the presence of one's collaborators) and action
awareness (of what collaborators are doing or what they have recently done).
Developing a concept of activity awareness can further integrate awareness
research and tool support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
