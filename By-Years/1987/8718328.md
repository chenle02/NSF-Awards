This proposal on "Electronic Transport in Amorphous Silicon Multilayers,"
between Dr. Hellmut Fritzsche of the University of Chicago and Professor CHEN
Kunji of Nanjing University, is jointly sponsored by NSF and the State
Educational Commission (SEDC) of China. The investigators point out that with
amorphous semiconductors, it is possible to make ultrathin multilayers
(superlattices) cheaper and out of many more materials than it is with
crystalline semiconductors (microchips), as well as to extend the device
possibilities to large sized applications inappropriate for small, fragile
crystals. These amorphous semiconductors, consisting of hundreds of ultra thin
layers of hydrogenated amorphous silicon and other materials, each layer either
a few atomic layers thick to hundreds of atoms thick, possess several useful new
transport properties which cannot be obtained in unlayered semiconductors,
namely metastable conductance states which are produced by a short light pulse
or by a high bias voltage. The quasi two dimensional nature of these multilayers
allows new material properties to be designed. The investigators will explore
the relation of these metastable and bistable conductance processes with the
structure, defect concentration, and the hydrogen content of the multilayers.
