9312916 Coleman This research is concerned with the study of formation,
characterization, optical properties and theoretical models of a new wide-gap
semiconductor intercalation compound. This involves new host systems of layer
structure heavy metal iodides. Preliminary data indicate unique large unexpected
shifts of the optical band edges and the lack of charge transfer upon
intercalation of lead iodide and bismuth iodide with hydrazine and
methylhydrazines. A large increase in optical absorption above the band edge and
a decrease in absorption below the band edge for the intercalated material
produce sharp optical band edges which would have potential uses in modulation
spectroscopic optical switching devices. Because this new intercalation system
does not appear to follow the usual rigid band model, the proposed work intends
to distinguish among the possible bonding models for the process which include
polarization, hydrogen bonding, charge transfer, and donor/acceptor bonding.
Determining the controlling factors in the bonding mechanism will allow
optimization and tailoring of this system's unique optical properties.
Specifically, intercalates will be varied to test for effects of polarizability,
donor strength, number of hydrogen bonds, and intercalate size. Hosts will be
varied to test for ionicity and structure dependence. Physical parameters tested
will be the optical transmission and reflection to determine possible changes in
the electronic band structure; modulation spectroscopy to determine band
structure critical points and optical switching efficiency; weight gain to find
the amount of intercalate per formula unit; x-ray analysis for lattice structure
changes; magnetic resonance for intercalate mobility and vibrational spectra for
phonon contributions. These goals are appropriate for research at an
undergraduate institution. ***
