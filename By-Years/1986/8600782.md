The reliability of a network (the probability that the network remains connected
when some of its links fail) is of importance in the design of any system. The
synthesis problem involves the design of an optimal network given certain design
parameters and constraints. While most synthesis procedures are heuristic,
Professor Boesch will investigate algorithms for exactly determining optimal
networks.
