The project will measure public support for foreign economic assistance programs
directed toward humanitarian concerns, contrast this support with public support
for domestic humanitarian aid, and to build a framework modeling the public's
foreign policy beliefs in the Post-Cold War era. This is the first study to
directly assess differences in public attitudes toward domestic and foreign
assistance program. This study will move us toward a more solid understanding of
how Americans think about foreign policy. A computer-assisted telephone survey
of a representative cross section of 500 American adults will be conducted to
empirically measure and test preliminary hypotheses. The survey will measure a
range of specific values and beliefs including humanitarianism, ethnocentrism,
and support for cooperative internationalism. * * *
