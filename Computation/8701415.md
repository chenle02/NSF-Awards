Mathematical tomography, or the application of Radon transforms and integral
geometry, is in the forefront of scientific investigation. For example, one may
cite Cormack's Nobel prize work in medical imaging. Image reconstruction is a
major scientific and engineering frontier for X-ray tomography, emission
tomography, electron microscopy, radio astronomy, and nuclear magnetic
resonance. Its mathematical foundation in the Radon transform and its
computational execution via algorithms form the subject matter of this proposal.
Professor Quinto is an expert in theoretical analysis of the Radon transform,
who holds to the scientific perspectve that theoretical progress must go hand in
hand with computational implemention. As Professor Quinto has made noteworthy
contributions in both areas he commands a perspective of the entire field. Thus,
the project has a dual thrust. On the theoretical side, Professor Quinto will
continue his investigation of support theorems for generalized Radon transforms.
He will consider such problems for transforms with real analytic measures on
real analytic submanifolds, including limited data theorems for X-ray and
k-plane transforms as well as transforms coming from a double fibration and
subgroup invariant transforms. In computational work, Professor Quinto will
complete the implementation of his algorithm to invert the exterior Radon
transform. Solution to this problem could allow good computer tomographic
imaging of the organs around the beating heart, of metal in bone, as well as
nondestructive evaluation of rings or cones such as rocket nozzles.
