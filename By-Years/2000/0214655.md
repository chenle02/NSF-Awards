This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a new
method for fabricating lensed fibers used in optical interconnects. An inkjet
printing technique will be used to print optical polymers onto the tips of
optical fibers, directly or via collets, to form microlenses. The output beam
characteristics of these monolithic devices will be collimated or focused,
depending on the specific designs. &lt;br/&gt; The low material/part cost and
the self-aligning feature will result in lower cost than current
collimation/focusing methods that use ball lens and GRIN lens assemblies. The
performance will be similar. Inkjet printing is precise, data-driven, and
direct-write. This technique will be suitable for low cost/high volume
production.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
