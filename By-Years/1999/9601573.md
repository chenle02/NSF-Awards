9601573 Evans This Academic Research Infrastructure (ARI) Program award is made
to partially fund the acquisition of a full field inelastic strain and
temperature measurement of complex material specimens when subjected to cyclic
loads. It will be possible to have both high hand low scale spatial resolutions
of the measurements. This will allow one to study stress concentrations and
their changes during cyclic inelastic deformations. These measurements can be
correlated with mechanics models and by iterating between the models and
measurements obtain accurate data for both. Such integration requires the
ability to measure parameters that provide the critical linkages. ***
