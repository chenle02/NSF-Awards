Experimental study of deformation characteristics of anisotropic solids such as
rocks, timbers, concretes, and composite materials under three- dimensional
loading has special significance to many engineering disciplines. Because of
some inherent limitation, conventional laboratory devices may be inadequate for
determining material constants for desired constitutive laws. The main objective
of this project is to design and fabricate a High Capacity (30,000 psig) Cubical
Device for three-dimensional testing of aforementioned and other solids. The
device will consist of four major components: (1) a rigid cubical space frame
with six end plates ("pressure chamber"), (2) a deformation measuring system,
(3) a (hydraulic) loading system, and (4) a data acquisition system. The cubical
frame and the end plates will be fabricated locally, while the other components
will be procured from vendors. Tests along any desired stress path in the three-
dimensional stress space, with any number of loading, unloading, and reloading
sequences, can be performed by the device. An electronically controlled and
fully automated loading mechanism, as well as a deformation measuring and data
acquisition system, would allow testing under slow cyclic compressive loading.
