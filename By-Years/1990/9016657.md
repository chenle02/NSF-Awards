This project is concerned with the response of topical glaciers to climatic
forcing and comprises evaluation of satellite data, analysis of glaciological
mappings and measurement, modelling and prediction. It is focused on a few
regional targets in accordance with suitable information. A "topical satellite
glaciology" may become a reality thanks to the fine spatial resolution of SPOT.
Mount Kenya is an obvious early target of opportunity because here a calibration
is possible with our 1:5,000 map of the ice status in September 1987. For
Kilimanjaro satellite sensing shall be used to assess cryosphere changes since
the early 1970's. The forcing of the observed ice recession by direct solar
radiation and greenhouse effects is to be studied for these two glaciated
mountains in East Africa, where the changing ice extent can be documented for
various epochs over the past century and where the topography is well resolved
by maps at appropriate scales. Modelling of a causality chain involving the ice
dynamics is intended for the only two tropical glaciers with a suitable
documentation of field observations. For the Lewis Glacier on Mount Kenya, field
observations shall be evaluated to verify modelling-based predictions and to
ascertain effects of climatic change. For the Yanamarey Glacier in Peru's
Cordillera Blanca, field observations and modelling are to be combined to
predict future developments, as well as to reconstruct the past net balance
conditions and the climatic forcing responsible for the ice retreat over the
past century. In conjunction with similar earlier studies for New Guinea and
East Africa, this would indicate the diversity in the beginning of the ice
recession across the global tropics.
