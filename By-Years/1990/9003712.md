A detailed petrogenetic study of two major intrusive complexes within the Bays-
of-Maine igneous complex: the Pleasant bay layered gabbro and the Mt Desert
Island igneous complex of gabbroic, dioritic and granitic rocks. In both areas
layers of chilled to fine-grained gabbro and medium-grained diorite to granite
occur intercalated with gabbroic cumulates. Although these unusual layers have
in the past been interpreted as dikes or sills, field relations appear to be
more consistent with their interpretation as conformable layers deposited on a
magma chamber floor. Field, petrographic, and geochemical studies will be
directed toward testing that thesis.
