Numerous unsolved problems plague astrophysics as we approach the end of the
20th century. Two of them are the observation of fewer neutrinos coming from the
sun than theory predicts and the probable existence of more matter in the
universe than revealed by the visible stars and galaxies. Both problems could be
resolved if there exist certain as of yet undetected elementary particles known
as "weakly interacting massive particles" (WIMPs). The Principal Investigator
was the originator of the hypothesis that WIMPS inhabit the cores of the sun and
other stars, and that they are significant contributors to the universe's
"missing" mass. He proposes to continue his investigation of the effects of
WIMPs on the sun's structure, on the evolution of stars in general, and on the
presence of dark matter in the universe. It should be added, that even if the
WIMP hypothesis turns out to be wrong, it has already stimulated -- and promises
to continue to do so -- much new research in a variety of fields in physics.
