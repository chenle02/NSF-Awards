Skeletal muscle is a syncytium ensuing from the fusion of myoblasts. Myoblast
fusion is a complex process, involving differentiation, myoblast-myoblast
adhesion, and cell union. Adhesion precedes and is necessary, but not
sufficient, for fusion, indicating separate mechanisms mediate the two events.
The molecules mediating adhesion are being elucidated and two cell surface
glycoproteins, N-CAM and N-cadherin, have been shown by us to cooperate in
promoting myoblast contact during membrane union. N-cadherin seems to play the
dominant role, perhaps reflecting its intracellular linkage to the cytoskeleton
via proteins currently being identified by us. Little is known about membrane
union, except that it involves proteins, calcium, and a metalloendoprotease. One
of our goals is to identify a putative myoblast "fusion protein". Our long-term
goal is to develop a comprehensive molecular description of myoblast fusion,
which will enhance our understanding of skeletal myogenesis. It may also
optimize the potential success of myoblast transplantation as an approach to
gene therapy, since long-term survival of donor myoblasts carrying new genes
depends upon their fusion with recipient muscle. Our past approach has relied
heavily on antibodies, but we now need to apply molecular biology methodologies
to our research. The proposal is designed to re-tool our lab for this purpose.
