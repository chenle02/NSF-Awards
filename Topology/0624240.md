DMS 0624240. Martin Bridgeman (PI). Noel Brady (co-PI)

The award supports junior US participants attending the second William Rowan
Hamilton Geometry and Topology Workshop to be held at the Hamilton Mathematics
Institute in Dublin, Ireland in September 2006. Participants at the workshop
include leading researchers, junior researchers and graduate students from the
fields of mapping class groups, 3-manifolds and geometric group theory. This
will be a 3-day, directed workshop focused on the question of the ubiquity of
surface subgroups in low-dimensional topology and geometric group theory.
Specific topics include the existence of purely pseudo-Anosov surfaces in
mapping class groups, and the existence of closed hyperbolic surface groups in
one-ended Gromov hyperbolic groups and in 3-manifold groups. There is already a
growing tendency for researchers in each of these three areas to use techniques
from the other two areas. This workshop should increase this cross-pollination
of techniques, and will focus collective energies on common themes.

Mathematicians who study group theory are concerned about the nature of
symmetry. Examples include the symmetries of a snowflake, frieze patterns in
architecture, wallpaper and tiling patterns, and symmetries of crystal or
lattice structures in chemistry. This award will enable graduate students and
junior researchers from the US to gather together with leading researchers from
around the world in order to investigate the ubiquity of hyperbolic surface
groups (symmetries associated to the Escher "circle limit" drawings) inside
other symmetry groups that arise in mathematics. This activity will help focus
the research programs of the next generation of geometric group theorists, and
will deepen our understanding of the nature of symmetry. This activity is one of
the first steps towards forging bonds between the US mathematics community and
an emerging mathematics institute (the Hamilton Mathematics Institute) in the
European community.
