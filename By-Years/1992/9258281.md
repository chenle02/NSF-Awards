In this NSF Young Investigator project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Philip Anfinrud will study the dynamics of transient
intermediates formed on time scales between tens of femtoseconds to microseconds
during various chemical transformations. A transient infrared absorption
spectroscopic technique under development will offer broad spectral coverage,
from 450 nm to mid-infrared wavelengths, with better than 10 wavenumber spectral
resolution and sub-picosecond time resolution. These capabilities will be used
to investigate the relation between structure and function in ligand binding
heme proteins, the dynamics of ligand motion in heme proteins, the pathway of
photoisomerizations, and the dynamics of charge carrier relaxation in
semiconductors. %%% The events that constitute chemical change occur on time
scales ranging from trillionths to millionths of a second. An understanding of
the pathways for such transformations requires detailed knowledge of the very
short-lived intermediates involved. The experiments in this project will aid in
elucidating the structure of these transient intermediate species as well as the
dynamic pathways by which the chemical transformations take place. With such
knowledge the relation between structure, dynamics, and function of processes,
such as the cooperative binding of oxygen by myoglobin, will be made clearer,
and models for protein dynamics can be put forward and tested.
