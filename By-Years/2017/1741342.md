In the Internet Age, information entities and objects are interconnected,
thereby forming gigantic information networks. Recently, network embedding
methods, that create low-dimensional feature representations that preserve the
structure of data points in their original space, have been shown to be greatly
beneficial for many data mining and machine learning problems over networks.
Despite significant research progress, we are still lacking powerful network
embedding techniques with theoretical guarantees to effectively deal with
massive, heterogeneous, complex and dynamic networks. The PIs aim to develop a
new generation of network embedding methods for analyzing massive networks. The
research project has the potential to significantly transform graph mining and
network analysis. The PIs also plan to develop open course materials and open
source software tools that integrate information network analysis and machine
learning.

This project consists of four synergistic research thrusts. First, it develops
model-based network embedding to leverage the first-order and second-order
proximity of networks. Second, it devises a family of inductive network
embedding methods that are able to leverage both linkage information and side
information. Third, it develops both local clustering and deep learning based
network embedding methods to attack the complex structure of networks such as
locality and non-linearity. Fourth, it develops online and stochastic
optimization algorithms for different network embedding methods to tackle the
fast growth and evolution of modern massive networks. The new methods developed
in this project enjoy faster rates of convergence in optimization, lower
computational complexities, and statistical learning guarantees. The targeted
applications include but are not limited to semantic search and information
retrieval in social/information network analysis, expert finding in
bibliographical database, and recommendation systems.
