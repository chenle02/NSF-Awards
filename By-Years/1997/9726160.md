This Interagency Agreement is related to the U.S. Navy nuclear submarine yearly
science cruise. It will cover Arctic Submarine Laboratory's anticipated expenses
in support of Special Data Acquisition. This funding is being requested to cover
the following: a) Support for non-baseline Temporary Alternations (TEMPALTs).
These are the Gravimeter System (including the Data Acquisition System), the
Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP), the Zero Angle Photometer System
(ZAPS), the Concentrator/Filtration System, and the In-line Sample Manifold
modification to the Torpedo Room Sampling System. The Arctic Submarine
Laboratory will perform the following tasks: 1) Interface with investigators to
determine the scope and details of their TEMPALTs. 2) Prepare and /or modify
TEMPALT drawings and other supporting documentation for submission to Naval Sea
Systems Command for approval to install these systems. 3) Fabricate a locking
ring for mounting of the ADCP window. 4) Fabricate the In-Line Sample Manifold.
b) Purchase the expendable conductivity-temperature-depth (U/I SSXCTD) probes.
The current planning calls for the expenditure of 139 probes during pre-
deployment testing and scientific data collection. The Navy is providing 59 of
these probes. Therefore, the budget calls for the purchase of 80 probes. The
participating scientists have expressed a desire for the submarine to carry
additional probes to increase the potential for denser sampling in certain areas
of special interest. As many as 95 probes can be provided at the same per-probe
cost.
