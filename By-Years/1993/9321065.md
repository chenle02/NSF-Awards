9321065 Krugman This research will develop models on the spatial structure of
urban systems, with the emphasis on the forces leading to uneven development;
and the role of the geographic clustering of industries in trade. The
theoretical work builds on models of imperfectly competitive markets to draw out
the tensions between the set of attractive forces that lead to the clustering of
particular industries at regional centers, and the repulsive forces that limit
the size of such concentrations. It is expected that the modeling would explain
the hierarchial structure of cities with higher- order cities engaged in the
production of goods and services that reflect greater economies of scale or
lower transport costs. The empirical research will use data on Mexican
manufacturing to test the effects of, for example, NAFTA on Mexican urban
systems. The models on industry clustering are used to study whether regional
economic integration in Europe will promote a greater degree of industrial
concentration. This project is of significant interest because it attempts to
link international trade and interregional development patterns. The results
from the study promise to give us a better understanding of the internal
geography of major urban areas as well as the adjustment issues raised by
economic integration prospects in Europe. ***
