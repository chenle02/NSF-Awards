The POLARBEAR experiment measures polarized fluctuations in the Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB) to search for the signature of gravitational waves from
inflation, potentially opening a window on the universe a fraction of a second
after the Big Bang. This is a major quest of current physics and astronomy and
has broad implications for our understanding of the origin and history of the
universe. AST has previously funded the construction, commissioning, and initial
operations of the first POLARBEAR 3.5m-diameter telescope at the Atacama desert
site near ALMA in Chile. The current award will support commissioning and
operations of a second telesope under partnership with the Simons foundation and
other collaborating institutions in the US, Japan, Canada, and the UK. The award
will support advanced traning for students in instrumentation and facility
development. Other broader impacts include educational programs for K-12
students and the general public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Science goals in addition
to B-mode gravitational waves include a search for massive neutrinos, a map of
large scale structure in the universe via gravitational lensing, and constraints
on the primordial helium abundance and the effective number of relativistic
species.
