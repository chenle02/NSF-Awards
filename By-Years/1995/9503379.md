9503379 McCreary Five cells of the meridional circulation (the tropical cell,
the subtropical cell, the pacific interocean cell, the intermediate convective
cell, and the deep thermohaline cell) of the general ocean circulation will be
simulated with suite of numerical models to understand their dynamics and
thermodynamics and to determine their effect on the tropical ocean heat budget.
