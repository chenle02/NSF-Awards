Algorithmic-based advice, a.k.a robo-advice, is disrupting the access to and
delivery of advice regarding industries ranging from medical services to
personal-shopping to financial advising and wealth management. Understanding the
processes through which robo-advising affects individual decision-making is
critical if we are to design advisors to benefit investors through better and
tailored advice and to appropriately shape public policy with respect to the use
of robo-advising. This project aims to study the effects of adopting robo-advice
on the quality of decisions individuals make. The project will further the
scientific knowledge about the cognitive and social impact of new technologies
in the realm of professional advice to non-experts.

This project aims to study the following aspects of the relationship between
robo-advising and decision-making under risk: (i) the extent to which robo-
advising might correct well-documented behavioral biases in decision-making
under risk; (ii) the extent to which robo-advising can improve over that
provided by human financial advisers; and (iii) how individual investors'
algorithm aversion makes human and robo-advice complementary, in which case
robo-advising may increase rather than decrease the scope for human financial
advice. To address the first question, the authors will employ several empirical
techniques that range from linear regression to machine learning and artificial
intelligence semi-parametric methods like boosted regression trees (BRT). For
the second question, the authors will analyze the results of a randomized
control trial involving the introduction of a tool to relax the attention
constraints of financial advisers at a brokerage house. To address the third
question, the authors will assess (i) whether, once given the option to access
robo-advice, investors access it autonomously or reach out to human advisers for
guidance; and (ii) whether, once investors start to use robo-advice, they reduce
their reliance on human advisers.
