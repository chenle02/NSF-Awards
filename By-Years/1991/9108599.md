The symposium "Structure, Development and Phylogeny of Cranial Nerves" is highly
focused on innervation patterns and embryonic origins of the various functional
components of the cranial nerves. There is considerable research in this area,
and there has not been a major symposium bringing the diversity of findings
together. This will be accomplished by bringing various comparative vertebrate
biologists together to provide a forum for the presentation of new findings and
to be able to compare differences in cranial nerves among the various lineages.
This should lead to a better interpretation of homology. The results of the
symposium will be published and widely distributed---this may be even more
important than the discussion at the symposium itself. The program does include
two graduate students and their support is worthwhile.
