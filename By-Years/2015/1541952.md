The field of Adaptive Optics has made tremendous advances in the last decade.
For many years it was exclusively used for real-time correction of the effects
of atmospheric turbulence in images produced by telescopes. Over the past few
years, however, the application of Adaptive Optics has broadened with the
technology. Nowadays, Adaptive Optics is not only employed in astronomical and
vision science applications; but it is also used in microscopy, X-ray beam
control, and line-of-site communication. The future generation of giant
telescopes will rely on advanced Adaptive Optics, making this technology even
more essential to the scientific enterprise. It is therefore particularly
important to support interdisciplinary research in this promising
area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides partial support for the 2015
Adaptive Optics Topical Meeting, to be held in Arlington, VA, between 7-11 June,
2015. The meeting will bring together experts working in the many disciplines
that develop adaptive optics, including both academia and industry. The workshop
is designed to encourage interdisciplinary thinking and collaboration, and to
serve as an effective platform to educate students, future scientists and
engineers in multidisciplinary fields. The meeting will permit the dissemination
of recent technological developments and novel applications in the field,
exchange and stimulate ideas, advance innovation in adaptive optics, and provide
a showcase on control algorithms.
