The University of New Mexico continues operation of a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) Site. The Site supports twelve undergraduates every year
for a 10-week summer research experience. This is an interdisciplinary research
program that recruits students in their sophomore and junior years majoring in
Chemical Engineering, Materials Science, Chemistry and Ceramics. The program
brings together faculty from diverse scientific backgrounds along with staff
scientists from Sandia and Los Alamos National Laboratories. The emphasis is on
fundamental research that has potential impact on industrial applications.
Research projects are grouped into three trust areas: Microsystems and Nano-Bio
Interfaces, Nanostructured Materials, and Synthesis of Engineered Materials Via
Self Assembly. Students also participate in ethics seminars, and in field trips
to Sandia and Los Alamos National Laboratories and to local
industries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The REU Site is supported by the Department of
Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
