The specific objective of the project is to strengthen the laboratory part of
the curriculum in the thermodynamics and combustion engines areas. The
improvement will be achieved by adding modern instrumentation as well as
conventional instrumentation that allows design and implementation of new
laboratory experiments to cover and complement a broad spectrum of topics
covered in classes in applied thermodynamics and combustion engines. The
implementation of the laboratory upgrading program will significantly improve
preparation of undergraduates to understand and analyze complex problems faced
by industry, research laboratories, and in postgraduate research in
thermodynamics and combustion engines. The laboratory will also be used in a
Saturday program for local high school students.
