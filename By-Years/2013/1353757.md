An award is made to the University of Colorado to do deep brain imaging using a
novel miniature nonlinear microscope. Optical imaging methods combined with
fluorescent markers offer the unprecedented ability to study functioning of the
complex neural networks in the brain down to the resolution of individual
neurons. However, due to light scattering in tissue, over 75% of the brain
cannot be studied. Technology that offers the path for high resolution deep
brain functional imaging is urgently needed in order to further advance the
fundamental understanding of how the brain works. This project will investigate
a fiber-optic imaging instrument incorporating adaptable optics. The miniature
fiber-optic imaging system implanted minimally-invasively will enable
visualization of thousands of neurons deep in the brain. The large volume of
imaging is important for understanding the complex interconnections involved in
neural networks while access to new regions of the brain will open up study in
important areas of the brain that are currently not accessible with other
techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work is interdisciplinary in nature,
combining aspects of biology, materials science, physics, and engineering and
will provide excellent opportunities for students to broaden their scientific
knowledge outside of a specific discipline. The PI's will disseminate the
results of their work through teaching and education outreach that includes
student groups, undergraduate research opportunity programs and summer programs
for under-represented undergraduates. Beyond basic research, results from this
project will be used to further the understanding of brain function, advance
artificial intelligence, and treat neurological disorders.
