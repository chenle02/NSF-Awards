9633586 Berelson In order to understand the chemistry of the ocean one must
somehow measure the rates that substances enter and leave the ocean at its
boundaries. In this study the principal investigator will design, construct, and
test a "test-series lander" (TSL) - a device that directly measures the flux of
dissolved substances across the sediment-water interface by taking a series of
overlying water samples in sequence. The TSL will use each of its eight 'spider
arms' to implace an upside-down chamber on the sediment surface at preset times.
By sampling the seawater inside the chambers over time (up to five programmable
times, spaced over sampling periods of minutes to months) one can collect data
to calculate the flux of solutes of interest across the sediment-water
interface. An important time-and money-saving feature of the TSL to be developed
in this study is its ability to operate as an unattended 'free vehicle' that can
be programmed, deployed from shipboard, and retrieved weeks or months later.
