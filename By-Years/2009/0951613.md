The experimental and computational analysis of EDC impact on cellular signaling
and behavior is an innovative approach to address this challenging problem. The
iterative experiment model experiment design will enable the discovery of
mechanisms that are specifically impacted by EDC treatment. Additionally, the
proposed methods to generate signaling data sets in silico will lead to the
development of new modeling techniques and refinement of the original model to
handle the complicated and multivariate problem of exposure to EDC combinations.
The ultimate goal is to develop models that can interpret the complicated role
of ER signaling in both normal and disease states, which is an essential
component of addressing women's health concerns. The effects of EDCs are a
global concern and the proposed systems biology methods are essential to contend
with the complexity of the problem. Development of in silico models to identify
cellular mechanisms that EDCs impact and predict the result of exposure to
combinations is an essential step towards preventing harmful effects from EDCs.
Additionally, the outlined framework of experimental data collection and model
development and analysis can be applied to essentially any biological network,
providing the basis for future studies of the impact of estrogenic signaling on
cellular behavior. The outlined proposal to incorporate students from non-PhD
granting institutions into the research laboratory and to perform outreach to
K-12 students will help to develop the next generation of students trained at
the math-biology interface, and will equip students and fellows trained in the
laboratory to be effective interdisciplinary researchers and teachers.
