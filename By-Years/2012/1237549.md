Abstract&lt;br/&gt;#1237549&lt;br/&gt;Stegemann&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of
this 1-year Scholar-in-Residence project is to develop enhanced in vitro testing
methods to rigorously evaluate the safety of nanoparticles, which are
increasingly being used as components of medical devices. In response to this
emerging need, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has initiated efforts
to characterize the biological effects of nanoparticles. In particular, the
Office of Science and Engineering Laboratories (OSEL) in the Center for Devices
and Radiological Health (CDRH) has a strong interest in nanotechnology and
evaluating nanotoxicity. The PI's lab at the University of Michigan (UMich) has
a longstanding interest in characterizing cell function in well defined and
consistent engineered tissues composed of cells embedded directly in a 3D
protein matrix, and also has been working on cell-nanoparticle interactions in
these systems. Such engineered tissues mimic important aspects of the 3D
environment of native tissues, and therefore have the potential to provide
information on nanoparticle biocompatibility that is not available from
conventional 2D cultures or animal studies.
