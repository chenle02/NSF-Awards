Large sparse unstructured matrices arising from various computer simulation and
modeling are commonly solved by preconditioned iterative methods. This research
project will study and design robust high performance preconditioners for
parallel solution of large sparse linear systems, based on a class of multistep
successive sparse approximate inverse preconditioning
techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We will develop new concept and parallel
algorithms of multistep successive preconditioning for enhancing the robustness
of standard sparse approximate inverse preconditioning techniques, and
generalize this concept to the context of other preconditioning techniques.
Study will be conducted to show the advantages of such approach to enhance both
preconditioning accuracy and factorization stability. We will build portable
software packages to implement new preconditioning strategies for solving
unstructured general sparse linear systems on high performance parallel
computers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The general purpose high performance
preconditioned iterative solvers from this research project are expected to make
significant impact in the field of applied scientific computing. Our experience
and existing strength will ensure that the&lt;br/&gt;project be carried out
fully as proposed. As U.S. industry is more and more relying on computer aided
design and manufacturing, large scale computer simulation and modeling will be a
vital component in new products research and development. The outcome of this
research will benefit U.S. industry as well as scientific research community by
providing more efficient kernel software for&lt;br/&gt;large scale computer
simulations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
