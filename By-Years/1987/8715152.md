Modelling complex large facilities such as manufacturing and assembly plants,
hospitals, airports, and other building types is a difficult task because of the
great volume and complexity of mixing traffic streams, the contention for finite
resources, and the corresponding difficulty of analytically solving this model
representation. A new technique, called the Generalized Expansion method, which
models open finite queuing networks with general service times, finite waiting
room, and multiple classes (chains) of customer types will be developed for the
design and modelling of large complex facilities. Analytic state dependent flow
models for capturing customer and occupant movement within the circulation
system of building as a function of congestion in the circulation system has
been recently developed. The main goal of this research is to integrate these
state dependent flow models with the Generalized Expansion methodology in order
to model large scale facility planning and design problems. Techniques such as
the Generalized Expansion method are very effective and powerful tools for
analytically modelling large scale facilities as queuing networks because of the
complexity of the network, the large number of servers within the network, and
the resultant mixing and superposition of traffic streams.
