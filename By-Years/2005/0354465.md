ABSTRACT for FRG award DMS-035472, DMS-0354465 and DMS-0354554 of Thomas,
Seymour and Robertson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We propose to study the four-colour
problem and its extensions. The four-colour problem&lt;br/&gt;itself was
proposed as a conjecture in the the mid-19th century, and remained open
for&lt;br/&gt;over 120 years, until it was settled by Appel and Haken in 1977.
That period coincided&lt;br/&gt;with the birth of graph theory as a serious
subject, and graph theory grew up around&lt;br/&gt;the various attempts to
settle the four-colour problem. The problem lives right at the&lt;br/&gt;heart
of modern graph theory, and still is not properly
understood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In particular, the proof by Appel and Haken
used a computer, and for a mathematician&lt;br/&gt;trying to understand what
makes a result true, this is not acceptable; it may be&lt;br/&gt;convincing
evidence that the result is true, but it is not helpful for
understanding.&lt;br/&gt;We already found our own proof (joint with Sanders),
and our proof is simpler and more &lt;br/&gt;easily checked than the Appel-Haken
proof, but it too uses a computer. We plan to &lt;br/&gt;redesign the proof to
reduce the dependence on computers as far as we can.&lt;br/&gt;There are a
number of proposed extensions of the four-colour theorem, mostly still
open.&lt;br/&gt;For instance, there is Hadwiger's conjecture of 1943 that every
graph that cannot be &lt;br/&gt;coloured with k colours can be contracted to a
complete graph on k+1 vertices. For k = 1,2,3&lt;br/&gt;this is easy, and when k
= 4 this is equivalent to the four-colour problem; and we proved
that&lt;br/&gt;it is also true for k = 5. We would like to extend this to higher
values of k.&lt;br/&gt;There are a number of other extensions of the four-colour
problem, detailed in the proposal &lt;br/&gt;itself; for instance Tutte's 4-flow
conjecture, the odd minor conjecture, and Grotsch's
conjecture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
