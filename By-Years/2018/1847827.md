In July 2018, IceCube announced compelling evidence of the first astronomical
high-energy neutrino source. Through this multi-messenger effort, one learns
that in order to become a true partner in multi-messenger astronomy, neutrinos
need to resolve more than a handful of sources to understand which source types
are dominant, and neutrinos must be sensitive enough on their own to make
statements about these sources. With those goals in mind, this award develops a
new channel of source localization analysis using IceCube data, namely cascade
events, that is completely independent of the ones used in traditional source
searches. This has the potential of doubling IceCube's source search capacity. A
planned upgrade of the detector will further enhance the sensitivities of
cascade analyses, making the development of this analysis channel an urgent
priority. Establishing the first catalog of high-energy neutrino sources will
make neutrinos a powerful and integral part of multi-messenger
astronomy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The IceCube experiment provides diverse, yet
accessible science topics suitable for undergraduate and post-bac research. The
PI has a long record of public outreach that will continue with this program.
The PI recognizes that the practice of inclusion in a research environment, such
as a large collaboration, will ultimately result in better science. She
understands the impact she can have, particularly on young women and girls, by
simply being a visible face of a physicist. She is committed to carrying out an
effective and meaningful science program as well as an impactful broader impacts
program through IceCube.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
