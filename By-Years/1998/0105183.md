&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;0105183&lt;br/&gt;Walker&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
Americas Program award will support Dr. Robert T. Walker of Michigan State
University in collaboration with Marcellus Caldas and Joaquin Bento de Souza
Ferreira, both of the University of Sao Paulo. The purpose of this proposal is
to organize a social science workshop to address our collective understanding of
the processes driving tropical deforestation, and to identify potential policy
responses. Three subjects will be addressed: (1) research methodology, (2) the
drivers of deforestation, (3) and policy responses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
objective of the conference is to bring together researchers of various
disciplines, working at different geographical levels in the Brazilian Amazon,
to facilitate the integration of their work into more universal theories about
the social dimensions of tropical deforestation. The workshop by its very
structure will facilitate international collaboration on key research questions
and will establish generational continuity in the social science research
community studying the Amazon.&lt;br/&gt;
