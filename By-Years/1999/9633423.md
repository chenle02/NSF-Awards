OCE 96-33423 Jessup The project will determine the role of microscale wave
breaking as a forcing mechanism in air-sea gas transfer. The breaking of very
short surface gravity waves without air entrainment, known as microscale
breaking, disrupts the diffusive sublayer which governs the flux of gas across
the air-sea interface. Thus, microscale breaking has been proposed as a dominant
mechanism for gas transfer. This proposal will establish a new approach for the
prediction of air-sea gas transfer velocity based on quantitative measures of
microscale breaking derived from infrared (IR) imaging techniques in the
laboratory.
