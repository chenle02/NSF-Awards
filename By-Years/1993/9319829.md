9319829 Petropulu It has been shown, through theory and observations, that
conditions at the site of a constructed facility can amplify the seismic ground
motions significantly, as compared to those recorded on bedrock. This
amplification increases the potential damage and collapse of engineered
structures. The objective of this research is to examine the feasibility of
applying a blind deconvolution algorithm to site response analysis; and to
investigate whether the approach can lead to a better understanding of the
complex phenomena underlying this problem. The approach utilizes the blind
deconvolution algorithm and the recordings of ground motions at two stations on
a sediment site in order to reconstruct the seismic input at the bedrock-layer
interface and to recover the characteristics of the site through impulse
responses (reflectivities) between the input location and the recording
stations. The site characteristics are estimated by combining higher-order
statistics of the seismograms and the theory of signal reconstruction from
higher-order spectral phase only. Potential advantages of this approach over
existing techniques are that (i) it does not require recordings at nearby rock
sites or downhole recordings for the site- specific analysis, but reconstructs
the seismic input motion at the base of the sediments from two surface records;
(ii) it identifies the reflectivities between the bedrock-layer interface and
each recording station rather than one one- dimensional site response function
from the downhole (or nearby rock) station and one station on the surface of the
sediment site; and (iii) it remains robust even in the presence of additive
white Gaussian noise in the observations and in the input seismic motion at the
base of the sediments. This exploratory study concentrates on well documented
earthquakes recorded by the SMART-1 accelerograph array in Taiwan. ***
