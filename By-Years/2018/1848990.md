The funds will partially support student, post-doc, and early-career
participants related to the IUTAM Symposium entitled "Stochastic approaches to
transitions in fluid flows" to be held at Cornell University during September
12-14 2018. Stochastic flows and flow regime transitions are central to
dynamical phenomena broadly important across engineering, geophysics and climate
contexts. Approaches to understanding stochastic systems have tended to develop
independently in the various communities. Various communities have begun to use
models of stochastic flow transitions, often resulting in differing approaches.
The aim is to bring together the different groups, those working on method
development as well as on applications. These groups are spread over (applied)
mathematics, engineering and physics departments.

Community benefits of cross pollination of ideas/approaches/techniques. Early
careers support will focus on PhD students, post-docs and early-career
participants, to the extent possible. Societal benefits from jump in progress
that is known to come from cross-community pollination of ideas and techniques.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
