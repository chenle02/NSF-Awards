This project will investigate the structure, energetics and dynamics of Gulf
Stream variability by deploying an array of current meters and inverted echo
sounders for two }ears. The instrumentation is designed to obtain data to
interpret the energy exchanges occuring in the Gulf Stream. The project is part
of a larger study, SYNOP, which will utilize data from this and other
experiments to address fundamental questions concerning the predictability of
Western Boundary Current systems. This is a five year study with deployments in
spring '88, redeploy in '89, and recovery in '90 in conjunction with Watts, URI
(8717144).
