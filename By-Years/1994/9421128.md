This project involves the construction of a data base of the cross cultural
results of placebo studies of medicinal and surgical treatments of diseases.
There are tantalizing hints of consistent cultural differences in the strength
of placebos (inert substances used in place of pharmacologically active
substances in the treatment of disease). The proposal demonstrates that in
Germany, for example, placebo studies show far higher rates of effectiveness
than in other similar European countries. The project involves a professor of
Cultural anthropology at the University of Michigan-Dearborn who will construct
a data-base of such studies to analyze the cross cultural differences, and
attempt to derive hypotheses about the cultural influences on placebo
effectiveness from this information. This information will be important because
the treatment of illness has always had two aspects: the physical-
pharmacological and the social-cultural-emotional. US culture over-values the
former and tends to ignore the latter, yet the goal of relieving illness
symptoms and improving health status requires both. This project is a first step
towards a potentially significant advance in our understanding of why people
react differently to medical treatment.
