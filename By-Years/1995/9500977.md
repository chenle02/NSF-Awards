9500977 Higson This project deals with the Baum-Connes conjecture. The emphasis
of the project is not so much on proving new cases of the conjecture as on
trying to understand more clearly the connections between the conjecture and the
presumably related topics in geometry and representation theory. The long term
goal is to use points of view suggested by the conjecture to give new insights
into these subjects. Taking advantage of the extremely broad scope of the
conjecture (which reaches from the Novikov conjecture to p-adic group
representation theory) one might hope to forge new links between apparently
dissimilar areas. The work proposed represents some very modest first steps in
this direction. The general area of mathematics of this project has its basis in
the theory of algebras of operators on Hilbert space. Operators can be thought
of as finite or infinite matrices of complex numbers. Special types of operators
are often put together in an algebra, naturally called an operator algebra.
These seemingly abstract objects have a surprising variety of applications. For
example, they play a key role in knot theory, which in turn is currently being
used to study the structure of DNA. ***
