The Concord Consortium, the Maine Mathematics and Science Alliance, the Jackson
Laboratory and several other partners are determining the feasibility of
engaging students in experimentally-oriented bioinformatics and DNA science
cyberlearning modules by developing and studying 17 computer-based instructional
modules that can be used in high school biology courses. Students are working in
virtual laboratories to conduct genetics research on populations of mythical
dragons by manipulating models and simulations based on well-known genetic
disorders. The modules require students to work collaboratively and publish
their findings for peer review by the NextBio user community. The NextBio
Project is also providing teachers with professional development in cutting-edge
science content and cyberlearning environments. The project is answering
important research questions pertaining to the impact of cyber-based learning
materials on student learning with comparisons to traditional materials. The
project will further educators' understanding of how biology teachers integrate
cyberlearning into their classrooms and measure the effectiveness of virtual
laboratories in teaching science to high school biology students.
