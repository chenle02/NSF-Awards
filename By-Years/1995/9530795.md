ABSTRACT OPP-9530795 SCHLOSSER, PETER LDEO-COLUMBIA UNIV. The investigator
proposes to conduct a research project on a cruise aboard the German research
vessel Polarstern as a part of the international initiative ACSYS planned by the
World Meteorological Organization. He will make tritium, helium, and oxygen
isotope measurements in the eastern Arctic Ocean to determine the extent of
Atlantic water that has recently been found to extend much farther into the
basin than previously known. The expansion of Atlantic water into the Arctic
could be the result of global change in response to a warming climate or a
temporary change in circulation due to factors not associated with climate. The
data collected on this cruise will fill in an important gap in the Arctic Ocean
so that future studies may observe the persistence of the change in circulation
within a global change context.
