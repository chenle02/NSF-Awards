Economic and political agencies use information to manage their relationships
with oversight committees, other agencies, and the general public. Information
releases are timed and crafted to manage expectations about current and future
developments within the agency. This proposal studies how information management
policies can be and are used to shape incentives of counterparties to further
the interests of the agency. The key consideration is in how the timing and
content of releases trades off good and bad news. As a general theme it is in
the interest of the agency to release minimally good news whenever possible and
maximally bad news as infrequently as possible. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is
modeled formally as a principal agent relationship in which a principal is
continuously monitoring a stochastic process and strategically releasing
information about the process to an agent who takes actions that affect the
principal. The agent knows the law of the process but relies on the principal
for specific information. Absent any information the agent will eventually
evolve beliefs inducing actions against the interest of the principal. The
proposal studies how information is managed over time in order to minimize the
frequency of these events and maximize the duration of cooperative behavior by
the agent.
