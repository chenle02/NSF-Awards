This award will partially support students to participate in a workshop aimed at
scaling belowground processes to larger spatial and temporal realms. The
workshop is primarily supported by the Department of Energy and will include
approximately 25 speakers from as far away as Australia, China and Europe.
Speakers will address both empirical studies and modeling of roots and
belowground processes and part of the goal is to bring these two groups together
to improve terrestrial carbon cycle models in the context of climatic change.
Moreover, the influence of climatic change on soil carbon fluxes, on which roots
have a major influence, is one of the greatest uncertainties in terrestrial
ecosystem models. Students will participate in several ways. In most sessions,
slots are reserved for a graduate student to speak; invitations will result from
a competition of abstract submissions. Strong abstracts not chosen for oral
presentation and that help balance workshop subject areas will be chosen for
posters. This proposal leverages other support by providing an opportunity for
10 graduate students to participate either in oral or poster presentations.
Students also will be included in small breakout groups that will enable them to
interact closely with leaders in the field and provide fresh perspectives to
perplexing areas in ecosystem ecology. The workshop opportunities will be
advertised openly on listserves and also at the participating universities.

This workshop will provide opportunities for 10 students to interact with
leaders in the fields of ecosystem, landscape and global modeling science, along
with root, microbial and soil ecologists. Students will experience firsthand how
interdisciplinary science is conducted and play key roles in discussions of new
directions for scientific inquiry.
