Rapid advances in computer architecture are necessitated by the growing demand
for computing speed and also energy efficiency. Unfortunately, these advances
require significant adaptations of existing software and their recompilation,
and when applied to software in scientific simulations and engineering domains,
the numeric outputs of these software can change. This issue is of significant
concern, as the whole scientific and engineering enterprise rests on
reproducible results building on top of prior contributions. This research
project develops methods to detect and isolate those software components
responsible for changing answers, and produces actionable evidence in terms of
the software routines that need to be rewritten. This ensures that scientific
software can truly become an asset that serves generations of research, and not
be obviated every three or so years when hardware
changes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project develops methods to compile a users'
software application or library using different compilers and executing on
different platforms. Given a collection of acceptance tests, the tools developed
in this work (collectively called "Indy", connoting "Fast and Safe Compiler
Flags") help detect those components that produce unacceptably deviant answers.
Then, employing code bisection methods, the Indy tools root-cause the source of
variability to the level of single file or even to a single function symbol.
Given that the methods used by Indy can be computationally intensive, the
project also explores machine-learning methods and other static analysis methods
to avoid wholesale recompilation and re-execution. The Indy tools are maintained
on public repositories, and the investigative team maintains strong connections
with user-groups to ensure tool adoption, feedback, and refinement. The project
will release Indy as open source and build a user community around Indy by
ensuring that interested researchers are able to contribute to the code-base.
This will allow a wider growth of the project. This aspect is of special
interest to the software cluster in the NSF Office of Advanced
Cyberinfrastructure, which is co-funding this award.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
