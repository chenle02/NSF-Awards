9414088 Farell The project will study the effects of turbulence and its scales
on the flow and the pressure loading on simple building models, in particular,
the effect of the length scales of turbulence in relation to the size of the
model. The effect of large scale and transverse velocity fluctuations,
fluctuations in the inertial subrange of the spectrum and of scales distortions
will be part of the work. Several boundary layer simulations will be produced in
both tunnel test sections by using different vortex generator and barrier
heights for each roughness configuration selected. The effects of small scale
turbulence will be studied by using spires, grids and jets to change the small-
scale spectral energy content while keeping the low frequency spectral energy
essentially unaltered. The results from this project will help clear some of the
confusion in statements, results and correlations between wind tunnel and full-
scale data especially in regard to the effect of large and small scale
fluctuations on the fluctuating pressures on a bluff body, in particular under
vortex structures formed off the body surfaces. ***
