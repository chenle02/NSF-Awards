This project is concerned with research in commutative algebra related to
geometric invariant theory. The principal investigator plans to find the
equations of nilpotent orbits for classical groups. In the area of binary forms,
he plans to further investigate the stratification by root multiplicities. In
the area of hyperdiscriminants, he plans to describe the Whitney stratifications
induced by them. This project involves research on the interface of commutative
algebra and algebraic geometry. Given a curve, a commutative algebra can be
associated with it. Information derived from studying the commutative algebra
supplies information about the curve. This is a rapidly developing area which
impacts many areas of mathematics.
