NSF Postdoctoral Fellowships in Biology combine research and training components
to prepare young scientists for careers in biology; those in the International
track provide them an opportunity to establish international collaborations and
take advantage of research facilities and opportunities abroad. Forging strong
international collaborations is mutually beneficial to the U.S. and the foreign
hosts. The Fellows are expected to be leaders of the nation's scientific
workforce of the future. This fellowship to Mehrnoosh Arrar supports a research
and training plan entitled "Structural basis of signal sensing and transmission
in bacteria." The host institutions for this fellowship are the University of
Buenos Aires and the Leloir Research Institute, and the sponsoring scientists
are Professors Dario Estrin, Marcelo Marti, and Fernando Goldbaum.

The goal of the proposed research is to understand, mechanistically, how a
stimulus that binds to one terminus of a biomolecular sensor induces the
necessary conformational changes in the opposite and distant terminus,
consequentially activating a signal cascade within the cell. The motivation for
understanding the physical basis of the sensing machinery is two-fold: (1) to
guide the discovery of novel antibiotics through the inhibition of bacterial
sensors, and (2) to promote the innovation of engineered molecular sensors by
tweaking those already found in nature. The two sensors at the focus of the
proposed research are critical in the survival of the bacterium Brucella
abortus. B. abortus is the causative agent of a zoonosis called brucellosis, a
disease transmitted from cattle to humans through the consumption of infected
dairy products. Understanding the molecular machinery that promotes pathogenesis
of B. abortus will be critical in the design of effective antibiotics for
brucellosis. Novel therapeutics against brucellosis are also of broader interest
in terms of national security due to the potential, and historical, use of B.
abortus as an agent of biological warfare since it is a bacterium easily
transmitted in aerosols.
