This program will attempt, purportedly for the first time, to fabricate thin
film heterostructures of electroactive polymers in which the structure and
architecture of the films are manipulated at the molecular level. The new
materials formed from these complex molecular assemblies will be studied for the
determination of their optical properties, electrical properties, which will
provide new insights into the fundamental behavior of electroactive polymers and
reveal new opportunities for thin film devices and microelectronic sensors. The
overall objectives of the research is to fabricate, characterize, and evaluate
novel, highly ordered, molecular assemblies of electroactive polymers.
Specifically, .e monolayer forming systems based on electroactive polymers will
be developed and utilized in conjunction with previously developed electroactive
monolayers to fabricate complex heterostructures comprised of functionally
distinct layers arranged at the molecular level to achieve specific electrical,
optical, or chemical response. Particular attention will be paid to monolayer
forming systems that provide the highest level of order and orientation of the
electroactive polymer component and a high degree of processing flexibility.
