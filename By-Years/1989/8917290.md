This renewal proposal deals with the enzymes involved in providing and
incorporating D-alanine (D-ala) and the dipeptide D-Ala-D-Ala into the
peptoglycan layer of cell walls in bacteria. Three enzymes comprise the
D-Alanine branch, alanine racemase, D-Ala-D-Ala ligase and the D-Ala-D-Ala
adding enzyme. In the past grant period (s) all three enzymes from E.coli and
Salmonella typhimurium were purified to homogeneity for the first time. In the
new grant period will be devoted to the study of the mechanism,
structure/function of each of the genes and the encolded enzymes. In addition,
the first enzyme in the peptoglycan pathway, the UDP-Nacetylglucosamine
enolpyruvyltransferase will be purified and characterized. The results will
greatly enchance our understanding of hw bacteria grow and build their cell
walls. They may also lead to new strategies for designing effective
chemotherapeutic agents against bacterial infections.
