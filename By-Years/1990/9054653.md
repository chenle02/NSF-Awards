PLANTS IN EVOLUTION: The Fossil Record Plants in Evolution: The Fossil Record
involves the development of a wall chart and ancillary materials which depicts
plant development over geological time. This material fills a void in the
available material designed to tell the story of organic evolution. Prior
attention among paleontologists has been largely devoted to the evolutionary
development of animals. With the synthesis and use of the project materials, a
more complete view of the changing array of life will be available. A teachers
guide will be developed to aid secondary school teachers in the proper use of
the chart, provide background material, and coordinate the chart content with
textbooks which are usually available for high school biology.
