ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Proposal #0113633&lt;br/&gt;U of Arizona&lt;br/&gt;Andrews,
Gregory&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A binary rewriting system is a software system that
transforms a binary (executable) program into a different but functionally
equivalent binary program. This project is developing binary rewriting
techniques for flexible link-time and run-time code optimizations. The aim is to
develop a unified binary rewriting infrastructure that is able to handle a wide
variety of applications---sequential, parallel, distributed,&lt;br/&gt;and
mobile---hardware architectures---from RISC to CISC---and optimization criteria
---including execution time, power consumption, and communication
bandwidth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Existing techniques for compile-time code
optimization suffer from several limitations: they are unable to cross the
dividing line between application code and libraries; they cannot take advantage
of commonly encountered values along the critical path if such values cannot be
guaranteed to be compile-time constants;&lt;br/&gt;and they typically focus only
on improving execution time. To overcome these limitations, this project is
investigating the following topics: (1) low-level cost models that can be used
for cost-benefit analyses of different optimization metrics; (2) efficient
computation of value profiles and their use for&lt;br/&gt;low-level code
specialization; and (3) techniques that reduce the overheads associated with
communication libraries used by parallel and mobile applications.&lt;br/&gt;
