9353359 Schreck This project is for teachers of science in grades 6 - 9. The
participants will attend two, four week summer workshops in order to gain an
understanding of basic chemistry and physics concepts, develop effective methods
of teaching these concepts in an integrated manner, and learn safe and
appropriate methods of operating science apparatus, as well as proper handling
of substances in classroom activities. The workshops will features content
presentations, discussions, laboratory activities, demonstrations, safety
sessions, teaching practice, planning outreach sessions and attention to
interrelationships of these sciences and technology. Emphasis will be placed on
core topics common to most middle school curricula along with effective methods
for concept-based teaching using the teaching/learning cycle, cooperative
learning, and improved integration of these sciences with other sciences and
mathematics. There will be support offered for key physical science concepts
supplemented by specially prepared background briefs, featuring applications and
extensions of the topic. The teachers will also get a chance to practice with a
group of students in the UNC science camp during the summer. The cost share is
11% of the NSF grant. ***
