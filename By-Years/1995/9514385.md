Although considerable attention has been given to democratic processes in
former communist and totalitarian states, a variety of processes also have been
transforming attitudes toward and support for governments in nations that have
long democratic traditions. Political scientists and researchers in related
field have used two theoretical perspectives to examine the sources of public
support for democratic forms of government. One is a `political culture`
perspective, which emphasizes socio-cultural and political identities and public
conceptions of democratic norms and values. The other theoretical perspective is
that of `political economy,` which focuses on national and personal economic
conditions, the redistribution of wealth among individuals and groups, and
judgments about the effectiveness and fairness of the political system in
delivering a range of products and services. These perspectives are used to
examine the stresses currently affecting Canada through analyses of data
gathered through a longitudinal series of surveys taken before and immediately
after a referendum that will be held in late October 1995 to determine whether
the province of Quebec should become an independent nation. More than 1,000
Quebec residents and more than 1,150 residents of the rest of Canada will be
interviewed over the phone and asked to complete a post-referendum survey. The
data gathered through these interviews and surveys will be compared with
information gathered in Canada and other nations to assess the study the ways
that different factors affect public support for political institutions in a
mature democracy. The results of this project will provide an excellent
opportunity to explore the influence of socio-cultural and political economic
factors on the form and stability of democratic governments. Although focusing
on the Quebec independence referendum, the data will complement a long-standing
series of information gathered in other nations, thereby contributing to more
generalizable knowledge. Because the data collected through this study will be
deposited in a number of public archives, they will be available to other
investigators to use in testing other hypotheses regarding democratic processes
and behavior.
