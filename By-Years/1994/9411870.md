This proposed project on engineering ethics education is a collaborative effort
among educators from the Russian Academy of Sciences, the Moscow Aviation
Institute, three engineering ethics academic programs in the U.S., and three
U.S. professional engineering and science associations. It is a planning effort
that will enable three Russian educators to visit the U.S. in the fall of 1994
to meet with American engineers, educators, and others in order to design a
project that will (1) develop and evaluate options for teaching engineering
ethics in Russia, and (2) organize and conduct workshops in Russia for teachers
of engineering ethics. Currently Russian engineers have greater autonomy and new
opportunities for exercising descretion in their work; but they are confronting
what are for them new issues of professional ethics and social responsibillity.
They remain uncertain about what their role and responsibilities should be in
the context of on-going political, economic and social reforms. This planning
phase will enable American and Russian participants to begin to design an
educational program in engineering ethics appropriate for Russia. It will allow
the engineering ethics community in the U.S. to lend credibility to those
efforts and draw from that experience insights that could bring improved
understanding of how social, political and cultural contexts shape engineering
practice.
