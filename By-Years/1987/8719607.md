Numerical simulation of the physical conditions in gas exposed to ionizing
radiation will be carried out. The results will be applied to several current
problems in understanding the spectra of active galactic nuclei and novae. The
improvements to the photoionization code named "CLOUDY" will largely be in the
following categories: a) the improvement in the atomic data base will be
continued; b) the treatment of physical processes will continue to be enhanced
and made more complete; and c) the line transfer methods and assumptions will be
improved. These continued enhancements to the of validity of the calculations
are important since "CLOUDY" has been employed by a wide community of users to
study a variety of physical situations; a) the broad line region of active
nuclei, where an alternative model of emitting gas will be investigated; b) the
extended x-ray emitting gas in the Seyfert galaxy NGC 4151, a region which may
be an example of Compton heated wind; and c) the nebula around the old nova DQ
Hercules, unique because of the very low temperature (approximately 500k) and
moderate level of ionization. Such confrontation between theory and observation
is an important ingredient in the continued development of numerical simulations
of ionized gas.
