This proposal is to acquire a state-of-the-art Siemens type X-Ray Diffraction
System to be used to improve the capabilities and quality of 1) diffraction
based materials research, particularly X-ray stress work, 2) diffraction and
structure courses offered in the Materials Science Program, and 3) structural
characterization for investigators doing other types of materials research.
