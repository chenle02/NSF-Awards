Eclipse| is a one-hour program within the prime-time series NOVA, to be
broadcast nationally during the 1991-92 season on the Public Broadcasting
Service (PBS). The program will document the total eclipse of the sun that takes
place on July 11, 1991, and the research performed at the observatories located
atop Mauna Kea on the Big Island of Hawaii. The program will trace three
narrative lines. The first will be that of the eclipse itself and its importance
for ongoing scientific investigation of the solar corona and solar physics. The
second will be that of ongoing problems in understanding the sun, especially the
issue of solar variability. The third will place this eclipse within the history
of eclipse science. The passage of an eclipse over a major observatory complex
is a unique occurrence -- it has never happened before, and will not happen
again for several generations. The four minutes of totality will allow solar
astronomers to turn deep space instruments on the sun for the first time. At the
same moment, however, this eclipse marks what many observers feel is the end of
a 130 year research program. Eclipse| will provide its audience with a portrait
of a spectacular natural phenomenon and of scientists attempting in real-time to
tease new knowledge out of the sun. In addition to its broadcast, Eclipse| will
be seen in an estimated 70-90,000 classrooms over a seven year period.
