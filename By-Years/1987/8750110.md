This project will support five communications courses with an updated
communications laboratory. The intent is to give the students hands-on
experience with actual equipment so that they can solidify their theoretical
knowledge by means of experimental observations. Analog and digital signalling
techniques will be covered, including baseband, FSK, PSK, and PCM, matched
filtering, and linear and angle analog modulation. In addition, special topics
will be covered in the areas of phase lock loops and antenna gain, radiation
pattern and impedance matching.
