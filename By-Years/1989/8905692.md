The Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships are awards to
recent recipients of doctoral degrees. The fellowship is designed to provide 24
months of support divided into 18 academic months and 3 periods of two summer
months. The recipient has the option of a Research Instructorship which allows
the 18 months of academic support to be taken as 9 months of full-time support
and 18 months of half-time support. Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research
Fellowship awards allow fellows to choose research environments that will have
maximal impact on their future scientific development. Terence Napier will
receive his doctoral degree from the University of Chicago, and will pursue
research in the area of pure mathematics, specifically, conditions for covering
of a smooth complex projective surface to be holomorphically convex, under the
guidance of Victor Guillemin at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
