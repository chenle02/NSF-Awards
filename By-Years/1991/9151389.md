The objective of this project is to significantly upgrade the laboratory
experience of engineering undergraduates in the area of composites manufacture
and testing. The core of the Composites Engineering Multidisciplinary
Certificate Program is a four course sequence culminating with the integrating,
hands- on experience of the laboratory course. The equipment provides students
experience in three crucial technologies used in industry. A resin transfer
molding experiment allows students to study reaction kinetics and the effect of
flow dynamics on final part quality. The multi-axis, computer-controlled
filament winding machine allows the students to design, analyze, and fabricate
complex parts in a paperless, automated environment. An upgrade to an ultrasonic
testing device, consisting of a computerized data acquisition and analysis
system, allows the students to more accurately detect flaws in the parts that
they have fabricated during the term. The laboratory provides a quality, state-
of-the-art experience for approximately 200 students. Implementation has a
substantial long-term effect on the students' laboratory experience and better
equips them to assume leadership roles in the field of advanced materials design
and manufacturing.
