Two signal generators and a signal analyzer will be used in order to study
wideband digital signal and information processing devices. The devices will be
used in a computer controlled network testbed in order to replicate theoretical
results indicating a possible 4 order of magnitude improvement in the ability to
detect signals in the wideband signalling environment. %%% New hardware devices
capable of transmitting data at high rates require conversions from analog
signals to digital signals. Recent theoretical work by the PIs indicate that
substantial improvements in signal detection in these environments is possible.
The signal generators and analyzers are needed to experimentally validate the
theoretical studies.
