This project supports travel by U.S. scholars to an international research
conference on homotopy theory to be held in Japan during the summer of 1988.
Japan is one of the world centers, along with the U.S., in the study of homotopy
theory. This conference will deal with unstable and rational homotopy theory,
pseudo-isotopy theory, and the algebraic K-theory of spaces.
