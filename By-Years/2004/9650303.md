Computers located at student stations within freshman chemistry laboratories
are being used in three ways: sophisticated data acquisition and analysis,
distribution of locally produced digital video clips of faculty research related
to each experiment being done by the students, and electronic distribution of
locally produced instructions for each experiment (text, diagrams, photos, and
digital video clips). The overall goal is to make freshman chemistry students
believe that they are doing chemistry the way professional chemists do and not
just learning material that many of the students have already seen in high
schools. The introduction of the digital video clips of research not only shows
that the freshman chemistry experiments are important and relevant to `genuine
chemistry,` but it also gives the department an opportunity to show how the same
techniques that are taught in freshman chemistry laboratory courses are an
essential part of extremely important chemical research.
