In this project in the Theoretical and Computational Physical Chemistry Program
of the Chemistry Division, Professor Kouri will develop, test, and apply new
methods for solving quantum mechanical equations describing molecular dynamics.
Methods of interest are (a) variational algebraic methods for treating time
independent (integral equation) description of molecular collisions, including
inelastic and reactive processes; and (b) wavepacket methods for solving the
time dependent Schrodinger equation describing molecular collisions (including
gas phase inelastic and reactive collisions and molecule-surface collisions).
The efficiency of time independent variational algebraic methods will be
improved by studying ways of constructing optimum basis functions. These
objectives represent a major contribution toward understanding of reactive
collision processes.
