This award provides funds that will aid in the purchase of equipment to be used
for research and training by a group of outstanding faculty at the University of
Vermont. The faculty's research centers on studies of the evolutionary ecology
of structured populations. The general classes of questions addressed by the
group include: 1) the ecological causes of population structure; 2) the effect
of the structure on microevolutionary dynamics; 3) the (population) patterns to
be expected in nature as a result of these dynamics. The interrelation of
environment and evolution has been of interest since the earliest theories of
evolution were proposed. The role of population structure, as opposed to the
simple size of populations, has a relatively poorly understood role in the
dynamics of evolution. Studies of such structure require the analysis of
characteristics of the DNA and protein of individual members of animal and plant
populations at the molecular level. The equipment purchased with the aid of this
award will be of benefit to faculty and student research in defining such
characteristics.
