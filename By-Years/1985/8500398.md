In this project, it is intended to study the theoretical basis of strain-
softening plasticity in modeling deformational and failure behaviors of concrete
materials in the post-fracture range; to develop a comprehensive three-
dimensional stress-strain relation for concrete based on the theoretical studies
covering a wide range of stress conditions including the post-fracture softening
behavior; to implement the model into a three-dimensional nonlinear finite
element analysis program, and to verify the program by solving some boundary
value problems of practical significance. In this study, special emphasis will
be placed on strain-softening modeling of concrete material in the post-fracture
range, within the general framework of strain-space formulation of plasticity
based on Ilyushin's postulate and the fracture theory. A more general strain-
space formulation, which accounts for both plastic and fracturing of concrete,
will be developed.
