9709876 Hansen This project contributes to our understanding of risk, robustness
and volatility. There are three distinct parts: 1. Risk Sensitivity and
Robustness in Decentralized Economies. Models of dynamic economies are built in
which consumers/investors can make decisions based in part upon robustness
consideration. The investigation draws upon ideas from recursive utility theory,
robust control theory and decentralization under Knightian uncertainty. Of
particular interest is how a preference for robustness becomes reflected in
equilibrium prices including the market price of risk. 2. Empirical Foundations
of Calibration. Alternative ways of integrating estimates from micro data sets
into dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models are studied. The project
assesses and extends current microeconometric methods to account for agent
heterogeneity and credit constraints. It obtains new estimates of the
uncertainty surround microeconomic decision making. It investigates the general
equilibrium implications of the new microeconometric inputs. 3. Flexible
Estimation of Diffusion Models. Diffusion models as models of nonlinear time
series are attractive because of the simple manner in which they encode
information such as hitting time probabilities and long run stationary
distributions. Particular attention is devoted to characterizing the manner in
which the diffusion coefficient or local variance depends on the Markov state.
In nonlinear diffusion models, this dependence alone can be sufficient to pull
the process back to the center of its distribution. Time series versions of
sieve methods are employed to provide the volatility characterization of
interest. ??
