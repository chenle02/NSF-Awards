The goal of Project VTC is to introduce and explore the use of pedagogical
"cases" in teacher education in mathematics and science. These cases are
realistic scenarios which raise contextualized issues of theoretical and
practical concern for discussion and analysis. Pedagogical cases are beginning
to be used in teacher education to teach such generic aspects as problem solving
and classroom management, but this approach has rarely been tried in the subject
matter areas, including mathematics and science. Project VTC will produce
approximately one hour of videotape representing several pedagogically
interesting cases in secondary-level quantitative science. These cases will
integrate issues of school children's mathematical understanding and expression
with their developing sense of fundamental scientific concepts. Project VTC will
also produce a short manual to accompany the videotaped cases. This manual will
provide a brief introduction to the use of pedagogical cases in general, as well
as suggestions for using the cases presented on the tape. The Project will
disseminate these materials to mathematics and science educators and to
researchers in the use of case studies in teacher education.
