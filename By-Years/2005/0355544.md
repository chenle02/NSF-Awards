This collaborative project from Louisiana State University (LSU) and University
of Wisconsin (UW) proposes a hybrid approach to further advance the technology
of high temperature metal micromolding. By combining elements of LiGA,
microscale electrical discharge machining, high density plasma etching and
smoothing, and high temperature nanostructured ceramic coatings, we aim to
achieve high temperature micromolding of Ni-Fe alloys and build Ni-Fe based
electromagnetic microactuators.

Intellectual merit: Pushing the technology of metal micromolding to much higher
temperatures (~800 oC) entails undertaking significant research in a number of
areas: 1) Developing new means of efficient fabrication of complex, high-aspect-
ratio, microscale patterns out of high temperature materials 2) Understanding
critical factors controlling high temperature structural and chemical stability
of nanostructured ceramic coatings 3) Understanding high temperature
tribochemistry of sliding contacts between ceramic nanocomposites and Ni-Fe
alloys 4) Understanding mechanics of the high temperature micromolding process
5) Improving design of microelectromagnetic devices for manufacturing by
micromolding Completion and integration of these research elements lay the
scientific foundation of high temperature micromanufacturing of metal-based
HARMs devices.

Broader impact: The ability to inexpensively replicate metal and alloy based
HARMs by molding offers the potential for commercialization of numerous
microelectromagnetic, micromechanical, and microchemical devices. Through joint
LSU-WU workshops, interactions between students from both institutions will be
promoted. The planned research exposes graduate students to diverse disciplines.
Through ongoing interactions between LSU and Southern University (SU), we will
interest minority students in micromanufacturing research, and recruit them into
graduate programs at LSU and SU.
