The NSF/CBMS Regional Conference in the Mathematical Sciences on "Convex Duality
Method in Mathematical Finance", will be held June 22 - 27, 2008 on the
University of California at Santa Barbara (UCSB) campus. The purpose of the
meeting is to bring together eminent researchers and promising young specialists
working in the area of mathematical finance. The program will focus on
optimization problems; in particular, on applications of the convex duality
method to finance. The principle lecturer, Dr. Marco Frittelli (Milano, Italy),
is a major contributor to the field. The conference will give high visibility to
the field, encourage graduate students to choose research topics in this area,
and allow more senior mathematicians to learn the subject which draws on tools
from optimization, stochastic analysis, simulation, measure theory, control, and
other areas of mathematics, with applications to finance and insurance.

In drawing the list of additional invited peakers, a special effort will be made
to give visibility to women, minority, and younger scientists as well as more
distinguished and more established researchers. Abstracts of the talks will be
published on the conference web site and will be available to the wide
international scientific community. An expository monograph, based on the
invited lectures, will be published as a part of a regional conference series.
