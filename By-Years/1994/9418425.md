9418425 Hillis and Crandall This award will support the travel expenses for
three months of Dr. Keith A. Crandall to Australia. Dr. Crandall, along with Dr.
David M. Hillis of the Department of Zoology at the University of Texas, Austin,
are conducting collaborative research with Dr. Chris Austin of the School of
Aquatic Science and Natural Resource Management at Deakin University in
Warrnambool, Victoria, Australia. The study will provide information to assist
in understanding the systematics and evolutionary biology of a family of
freshwater crayfishes. The purpose of the travel is to collect a series of
parastacid crayfish in preparation for a morphological/molecular study of their
phylogeny. Once the phylogeny has been developed it will be used to test earlier
hypotheses on phylogenetic relationships and biogeography. The study will also
yield data that should be useful in conservation activities directed at these
animals. Dr. Austin brings to the collaboration his expertise on the morphology
of Australian crayfish and their geographic distribution. The American
investigators have considerable contributions in molecular systematic
techniques.
