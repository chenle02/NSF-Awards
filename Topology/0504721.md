Weinberger plans to develop both quantitative versions of known theorems of
algebraic and geometric topology, extending the basic ideas of controlled
topology into directions of both more and less smoothness. In part, this
interacts with logic and computer science, as in the analysis of Dehn functions,
and applications of Kolmogorov complexity arguments to variational problems, but
the goal is to get more realistic upper and lower bounds on specific (solvable)
topological problems. A subsidiary task is to understand the "information based
complexity" of geometric problems, and understand the rates of growth of various
sets arising in classification problems via the philosophy of the Goodwillie
calculus.

The motivation for this comes from a number of directions, both applied and
theoretical. In applications of topology to experimental sciences, one rarely
has as explicit space to study: one has large data sets, and the investigator
must infer an underlying space. The features that often arise as hypotheses in
mathematical theorems cannot simply be seen: they must be detected. One problem
to be studied is how to determine, say, the dimension of such an underlying
space. After that come problems of implementing software and understanding how
much data one needs to make reliable estimates. Another sort of problem comes
from the existence of singularities in many equations of applied mathematics and
geometry. As topology usually confines itself to the study of continuous maps,
the implication of discontinuities of various sorts could potentially be of use.
Finally, in many problems of pure geometry, the detailed structure of solutions
which have only been proved to exist, but which have never been "seen" would be
of great value. Reproving their existence with quantitative estimates should
lead to a better understanding of their nature.
