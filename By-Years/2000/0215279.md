This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will test the
feasibility of new drug delivery applications arising from Advanced
Encapsulation's patented method of lipid membrane encapsulation. This passive
method has demonstrated the ability to encapsulate nearly any object of
colloidal dimensions at relatively high yield under gentle conditions.
Specifically, no other technique has been reported which encapsulates interior
vesicles intact and having a composition distinct from the outer membrane.
Cationic vesicles and iron oxide nanoparticles are all known to have poor
compatibility with blood environments resulting in rapid aggregation and/or
clearance. However, these materials have shown great promise in vitro for
various biomedical applications including medical imaging, controlled release,
and localized delivery via magnetic fields. This project will test the
encapsulation and separation efficiency as well as the stability of these
materials in bovine serum and/or plasma. Based on the successes of liposomes in
intravenous drug delivery, and on the physics of macromolecular interactions,
liposomal encapsulation should engender biocompatibility to both classes of
materials in question.

The commercial applications of this project are in the area of pharmaceutical
drug delivery.
