With this award the principal investigator will continue his studies into the
numerical analysis of phase transitions and free boundary problems that arise in
fluid dynamics and elasticity. In particular, he will analyze, design and
implement adaptive finite element methods for the solution of the Phase Field
Model and the Cahn-Hilliard equation. Special emphasis will be placed upon
stability and error analyses in nonenergy norms, such as the maximum norm, and
upon the efficiency and reliability of the resulting algorithms. Many phenomena
in nature involve what are called free boundary problems, wherein a large part
of the solution process is devoted to determining the location of a moving
boundary between two or more different media. A good example is a weather
forecast or the weather map in your newspaper. Here meteorologists try to
predict the speed and location of fronts; in this context fronts are the words
used for moving boundaries between warm and cold air, for example. With this the
principal investigator will design numerical methods for finding the solution of
some free boundary problems that come from the theory of elasticity. **
