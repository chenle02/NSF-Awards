9600215 Brillinger This U.S.-Brazil collaborative research project between David
Brillinger of the University of California Berkeley and Pedro Morretin of the
University of Sao Paulo in Brazil will develop statistical aspects of wavelet
techniques for different stochastic models with application to some new and
practical situations using economic, biological, and physical data.
Autoregressive processes, state space models, linear systems, seasonal effect
schemes, Markov chains, point processes and generalized linear models will be
studied. The proposed research will create a new collaborative link between
statisticians in Berkeley and Sao Paulo, including the active participation of
graduate students on both sides. The Brazilian side will be funded by CNPq, the
Brazilian federal science funding organization. ***
