This NSF CAREER project aims to develop algorithms for optimizing the planning
and operation of electric power systems in the context of extreme events such as
wildfires, hurricanes, evacuations, etc. The project focuses on three key
computational challenges: nonlinearities associated with the physical models of
electric grids, uncertainties from wind and solar generators and failures of
system components, and discrete choices such as where to upgrade infrastructure.
The project will bring transformative change by providing operators with the
computational tools needed to accurately model heavily stressed power grids.
This will be achieved by combining new machine learning techniques with advanced
nonlinear optimization algorithms and novel power system modeling methods. The
projectâ€™s intellectual merits include the development of new solution algorithms
for the optimization problems encountered in power systems during extreme
events. The broader impacts of the project include mitigating the impacts of
climate change as well as educational efforts to develop video game style
simulations focused on power system resiliency. In the spirit of citizen
science, the players' solutions to these simulations will form a crowdsourced
dataset that will be used to train the machine learning models in the project's
research efforts, closing the loop between research and
education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to develop the
fundamental theory and algorithms for addressing the heavily stressed conditions
inherent to power systems during extreme events. Accurately modeling these
heavily stressed conditions yields stochastic mixed-integer nonlinear
optimization problems that are intractable with existing theory and algorithms.
Existing approaches address these challenges using assumptions that are
inapplicable for the atypical conditions inherent to extreme events, resulting
in large errors and resiliency plans that fail to adequately reduce the impacts
of extreme events. This project will develop new algorithms that can accurately
model power flow nonlinearities, uncertainties, and discrete decisions without
sacrificing computational speed and reliability. To accomplish this, the project
will improve and combine alternative power flow models, mixed-integer
programming solvers, machine learning techniques, and nonlinear optimization to
create tailored theory and algorithms for resiliency
applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
