This is a Presidential Young Investigator Award initiated in FY 88. The
research to be carried out deals with a general class of problems in which the
typical periods of oscillation of the structure are small compared to the time
over which inelastic volumetric strains build up, or the time required for pore
pressure changes. Separately numerical simulation will be used to evaluate the
analysis results obtained from using newly devised on-line pseudodynamic testing
approach. An existing finite element code (ABAQUS) will be used to model local
buckling phenomena in cross bracing members. These are fundamental research
which would enhance the understanding of structural dynamics problems often
encountered in earthquake engineering practice.
