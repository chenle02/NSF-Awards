Building on previous projects funded by NSF and the State of Tennessee, this
1.5-year project addresses the problem of improving mathematics instruction in
secondary schools, especially middle schools. During the academic year, fifty
teachers (including ten alternates) of grades 5 through 8 will deepen their
mathematics backgrounds by taking specially designed courses in algebra and
trigonometry. During the summer, forty of these teachers will join twenty high
school teachers in a five-week workshop that includes instruction in discrete
mathematics and basic computer science, as well as discussion of appropriate
teaching strategies. Teams consisting of two middle school teachers and one high
school teacher will collaborate on the development of lesson plans. Participants
will be drawn primarily from inner-city schools in Memphis, Tennessee. The
project also includes a five-day workshop in probability and statistics
sponsored by the Memphis Urban Mathematics Collaborative and a two-day
curriculum review workshop. LeMoyne-Owen College and the Memphis Urban
Mathematics Collaborative are contributing as cost-sharing an amount equal to 8%
of the NSF award.
