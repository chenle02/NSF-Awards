This workshop considers the application of the emerging philosophical ideas of
"plasticity" to the socio-legal analyses of rapidly changing social orders.
Current approaches have proven theoretically insufficient in capturing the forms
that law, legality, and legitimacy take in light of rapid changes in society,
governance, technology and identity. Within the current approaches, law is
treated as dynamic and the activities that engage law successfully are often
posited as contingent upon the circumstances in each case. Although theoretical
advancement has been made using such models to understand the configuration of
social forces and the influence of social practice, much of the value in such
theorizing is lost in the inability of current models to simultaneously account
for dynamic and contingent sets of practices while remaining generalizable over
time and across cases; a situation that is further complicated when considering
rapidly changing material conditions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current workshop
tests the application of a new approach that incorporates these elements. It,
therefore, holds strong promise for fundamentally advancing current theorizing
by initiating new lines of research in socio-legal studies.
