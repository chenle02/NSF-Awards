Research will be conducted on the deterioration of marble when subjected to
sulfurous and nitrogenous atmospheric pollutants, both categories of which are
produced by combustion of fossil fuels. This research is likely to lead to a
better understanding than now exists of the role played by air pollutants in
accelerating the deterioration of structures and may also lead to approaches
which may be used in engineering design for minimizing the effects of pollutants
on environmental quality.
