This is a Presidential Young Investigator Award, to support an extraordinarily
talented young maize geneticist. Her research interests are in the area of
mitochondrial gene expression in higher plants, and she will be using mutants of
maize (corn) which are affected in mitochondrial functions as materials for the
genetic analysis of higher plant mitochondria. She is also interested in the
interrelationship between nuclear and mitochondrial genomes, and will use
interspecific hybrids to study this (e.g., hybrid corn plants carrying domestic
corn (maize) nuclei and wild maize (teosintes) cytoplasms (mitochondrial
genomes) to determine how these genomes affect each others' expression in the
intact plant cell.
