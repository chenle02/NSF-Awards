This award provides partial support for the 6th NSF Large Facilities Workshop,
which will be hosted by the Associated Universities Inc./National Radio
Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) at the Array Operations Center in Socorro, New
Mexico on April 23-25, 2013. The NSF Large Facilities Workshop has been held
annually since 2008 and provides a forum for discussing best practices and
sharing lessons learned from operational experiences at the NSF-funded large
facilities. The workshop will highlight performance measurements for scientific
facilities and establishing measurement processes; experiences with competition
of awards for facility management and operations; and various approaches to data
management including the curation and distribution of scientific data generated
by the facility for legacy use. The workshop will also emphasize fostering close
interactions and making new contacts to facilitate continuous improvement in
operational aspects of NSF large facilities.
