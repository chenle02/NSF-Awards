This project is a study of a two level interconnection networks, called dBcubes,
in which hypercube subgraphs are interconnected by a de Bruijn graph. The
purported advantage of this scheme is scalability. The hypercubes provide high
local connectivity, while the de Bruijn graph allows a combination of fixed
degree and low diameter. The goal of this project is to determine whether the
study of interconnection networks of this type is relevant to practical computer
architectures. Topics to be investigated include replacement of either the
hypercubes or the de Bruijn graph with simpler graphs, a study of wormhole
routing, algorithm embedding, and several implementation issues.
