Funds are provided for a high-resolution analysis of the nature and volume of
gas hydrates and carbonate mineralization across the Oregon accretionary
complex. The research will define spatial and volumetric carbonate gas-hydrate
and carbonate presence in a corridor spanning a hydrate province of the Oregon
margin. Side scan sonar and high-resolution seismic reflection work will map the
surface and subsurface hydrates, centered on ODP site 892. These data will allow
to assess the distribution of fluid venting. In addition, drilling of up to 100
m cores are planned in depths of 2000 m to obtain samples for elemental and
isotopic analyses of the gas phase, pore waters, solid hydrate and carbonates.
The cores will be obtained by a newly developed portable remotely operated drill
(PROD).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
