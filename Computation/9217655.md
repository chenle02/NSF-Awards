The research program focuses on mathematical aspects of object recognition.
There are two classes of problems. The first is the recognition of rigid objects
positioned in a scene at arbitrary rotations, locations, and scales. A large
repertoire of shapes is assumed known in advance, and the problem is to then
devise computationally efficient algorithms for recognizing which, if any, of
these objects are present in a given scene. Sequential and adaptive strategies
will be explored, in which a sequence of image-based observations is made, with
the choice of an observation depending upon the results of previous
observations. There are close connections to coding theory, sequential design of
experiments, multi-armed bandit problems, the game of "twenty questions," and,
of course, previous work in machine vision. The second class of problems is the
recognition of nonrigid, or deformable, objects. Examples include handwritten
numerals and various biological shapes, such as leaves, hands, organelles, etc.
Here the issue of shape modeling appears to be central. An approach through
deformable templates is proposed. Templates are prototypes which capture global
characteristics, whereas deformations are random transformations, satisfying
certain regularity constraints, that act upon templates to produce the possible
presentations of an object. The proposed shape models suggest certain
recognition algorithms, and these will be explored in a variety of application
areas.
