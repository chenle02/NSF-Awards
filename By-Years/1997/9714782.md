The Department of Earth Sciences at Millersville University requests matching
funds to enhance the existing configuration of Unix workstations, expand the
memory capacity on the primary meteorology server, and replace existing
X-terminals with Unix workstations. This request is driven by increased demands
on current system because of upgrades in Unidata software and "intensive and
escalating student and faculty use" of Unidata provided software.
