This project will investigate the application of microwave heating for the
treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Two applications are planned: ablation of
cardiac tissue responsible for tachycardia, and removal of coronary plague
(angioplasty). The microwave energy will be delivered through miniature antennas
introduced through catheters. Initial efforts will concentrate on antenna
design; the design will be then tested in a small number of animal experiments.
If successful, the project will result in the development of new minimally
invasive surgical techniques.
