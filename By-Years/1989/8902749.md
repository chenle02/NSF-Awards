Quasiconformal mappings evolved from studies of plane mappings whose
infinitesimal distortions remained bounded within fixed limits. Such
transformations were considered as the natural mathematical generalization of a
conformal map (which infinitesimally maps circles onto circles). The theory has
grown in several directions and dimensions, making important contact with
nonlinear potential theory and Teichmuller theory of Riemann surfaces. This
project is concerned with problems relating quasiconformal maps and the
geometric behavior of solutions to degenerate elliptic partial differential
equations. The work derives from a recent discovery that quasiconformal
homeomorphisms mapping onto a ball have a stability property: in certain subsets
of the domain, their distortion is globally controlled without regard to the
geometry of the domain. Little is understood concerning domains which may be
mapped onto a ball; work will be done to characterize such domains. This
phenomenon was first observed in conformal maps where several deep results has
subsequently been produced. A second line of investigation concerns the
properties of supersolutions of the p-Laplace equation. These functions form the
basis for a nonlinear potential theory. Two particular goals the study of
possible fine topologies available which yield the best continuity results for
such functions and to seek a boundary Harnack principle for domains other than a
ball.
