Because white dwarfs cool and fade very slowly, some of the oldest stars in the
galaxy can still be observed. Such objects can be used to determine the age of
the galactic disk and perhaps the halo. However, this depends on the physical
laws which are used to calculate the cooling times. A new set of models with
improved input physics will be constructed and applied to determine the star
formation history of the local disk population. These models will also find
application in the analysis of the period spectrum of white dwarfs.
