This prototype project includes, in the first year of operation, several
activities to strengthen minority education at the precollege level. It was
cooperatively developed by Norfolk State University, Hampton University, Old
Dominion University, and the Cooperative Hampton Roads Organizations for
Minorities in Engineering (CHROME), a non-profit planning, coordinating, and
advocacy organization of higher education institutions, government agencies,
public school systems, business and industry, and civic and professional
associations. During the first year, a set of activities, based on science and
mathematics experiences, and designed to nurture, encourage and motivate
minority students are being implemented. These include Saturday Academies of
Science, held at Norfolk State University, Hampton University, and Old Dominion
University, for seventh and eighth grade students conducted on six successive
Saturdays in the fall and repeated again in the spring. Forty students are
involved in each Academy, for a total enrollment of 240. Parents are especially
urged to attend the orientation session at each Academy. Topics in mathematics,
physical sciences and the life sciences are covered and activities are designed
in a participatory mode. The culmination of Academy activities will be a region-
wide science fair to be held at Norfolk State University. A series of three
colloquia designed for precollege teachers, to complement the Saturday
Academies, are being held- one on each campus for 40-60 precollege teachers. The
colloquia are sequential in nature with themes of: Sensitizing Educators to
Phobias in Science; Innovative Concepts to Promote Interest in Science; and,
Future Implications for Science. Plans for the second year and beyond will
expand the activities to include the undergraduate level.
