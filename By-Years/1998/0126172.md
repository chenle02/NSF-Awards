This award is to the University of Florida to support the activity described
below for 36 months. The proposal was submitted in response to the Partnerships
for Innovation Program Solicitation (NSF 0179).

Partners The partners for this award include the University of Florida (Lead
Institution), Florida A&M University, the University of Miami, Alachua County
Environmental Protection Department, Florida Department of Environmental
Protection, NASA Kennedy Space Center, Bionetice, Camp Dressen & McKee, Inc.,
Dynamac Corporation, Jones Edmunds & Associates, Koppers Industries, and Post,
Buckley, Shuh, and Jernigan (PBS&J).

Proposed Activities The proposed partnership will establish the Florida
Interdisciplinary Center for Environmentally Sound Solutions. The center will
create a forum for effective communication and collaboration among all
synergistic university researchers while serving as a focal point for
establishing an interface with the private sector and government. The center
will identify and respond to important environmental problems and develop
innovative solutions.

Proposed Innovation The partnership will provide science and engineering
solutions for environmental problems, improve understanding of complex
relationships involving public policy, economic issues, risk assessments, and
public education.

Potential Economic Impact The potential impact will depend upon the perceived
economic value the public places on environmental issues and the cost the
private sector places on abatement and cleanup.

Potential Societal Impact The societal goal of economic growth compatible with
preservation of the environment using renewable resources can be achieved by a
judicious marriage of technology with public policy. The center will contribute
to this. The potential societal impact of environmental protection is limitless.
