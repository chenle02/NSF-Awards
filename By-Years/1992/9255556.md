This project is designed to educate and train undergraduate faculty on the
advances in computer-assisted techniques for Finite Elements (FE) analysis of
electromagnetic fields. Through the proposed workshop, Finite Elements for the
Instruction of Electromagnetic Fields, undergraduate faculty will become
knowledgeable and skilled in FE analysis, and will be able to use this advanced
analysis method in the instruction of electromagnetic fields. Therefore,the
project will allow participants to develop the strategies and techniques that
are necessary to use FE analysis in the instruction of undergraduate
electromagnetic courses. The FE materials and software that will be utilized in
the workshop will allow undergraduate students to approach and solve real-world
problems of electromagnetic fields.
