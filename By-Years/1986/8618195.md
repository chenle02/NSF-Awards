The most widely used media for information storage are magnetic tapes and disks
which are manufactured by applying a slurry of magnetic particles as a thin film
coating on a substrate. Disk- shaped particles of barium ferrite hold out the
promise of greatly increased bit density through the emerging technology of
perpendicular recording (where the magnetic dipole is oriented normal to instead
of parallel to the surface of the disk or tape). Besides increased bit density,
barium ferrite recording media have improved resistance to wear and corrosion.
Despite considerable commercial interest, development of barium ferrtie media
has been hampered by the difficulty of preventing agglomeration. The inital
rates of flocculation will be measured using small-angle laser scattering to
monitor the extent of flocculation as a function of time.
