This project will examine microbial diversity and ecology on a portion of the
Colorado Plateau in Utah. First, it will expand and characterize an existing
culture collection, which will serve as a resource to the research community
interested in bacterial taxonomy and natural products. Data obtained from the
characterization of this culture collection will allow the distribution of novel
microbes found in this study to be examined. Second, a survey of community
complexity will be conducted using molecular techniques to obtain qualitative
and quantitative data about the structure of these microbial communities.
Finally, the role of these microbial communities in stabilizing the friable
sandstones of the region will be investigated. Experiments measuring the
strength of the microbial communities when grown in a sand and sandstone
environment will provide an estimate of the mechanical strength provided by the
microbial community to the sandstone.

Microbes impact our environment in multiple and quite often subtle ways. These
subtle impacts are seen throughout our National Parks and Monuments located on
the Colorado Plateau of Utah, Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico. Microbial
communities found in this region live within the pore spaces of the sandstones
that dominate the area (cryptoendolithic communities). These organisms exert a
nearly imperceptible influence on the rate of erosion through their growth. It
is this change in erosion rate that results in the various land forms found on
the Colorado Plateau. Studies have been conducted to examine the microbial
diversity within these communities, but these studies have focused on the
photosynthetic components while this study focuses on the organisms that use
carbon compounds for energy (chemoheterotrophs). Results from this project can
be used for a variety of purposes, including the design of better management
practices for the National Park Service, better methods to control beach
erosion, and advances in natural products discovery.
