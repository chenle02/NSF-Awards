This project continues mathematical investigations in the field of ordinary
differential equations. The object is to study the formal power series solutions
of algebraic differential equations. Specifically, the work will concentrate on
power series of Gevrey type in which the coefficients are not greater than
certain bounds depending only on the index of the coefficient and a single
parameter. The source of the questions undertaken here is a paper of 1903 which
gives conditions on a equation which ensure that a solution may be expressed by
such a power series. Every subsequent proof of this result requires recurrence
formulas of exceptional complexity in which the best value of the parameter is
all but impossible to estimate. A new approach to the problem has recently been
uncovered which provides good results in the linear setting. Work to be done
will now focus on nonlinear equations and singular perturbations of regular
equations in which the coefficient estimates are expected to be sharp.
