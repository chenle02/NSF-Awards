This SGER proposal seeks to design and prototype a system and service for
measuring and reporting grid usage. The system, called GUSS, will track,
archive, and make available for reporting and display usage and performance data
in a grid environment. Specifically, the work will provide visibility into file
transfers in Globus Toolkit enabled grid environments. The work is motivated in
large part by the need for better visibility into exceptions, such as
unsuccessful and successful restarts, and a more accurate assessment of fault
tolerance in grids. Access to GUSS services is proposed to occur through the
framework of the Grid Portal architecture. Implementation plans target server-
side GridFTP, the main file transfer engine in use in grid environments today.
Plans will leverage existing work in grid instrumentation, logging, and
archiving by adopting Netlogger for data transmission and archiving. Development
will be tightly integrated with ongoing NMI activities, including potential
contributions of GUSS portlets into the NMI Grid Portal repository of portal
software. Near-term deployment of the prototype GUSS system, including a GUSS-
enabled GridFTP, is targeted for Teragrid and PPDG. One part of the SGER
explores what the proposal calls sociological issues relating to the monitoring
and reporting of user activities in the presence of privacy and security
concerns.&lt;br/&gt;
