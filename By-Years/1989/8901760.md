The purpose of this conference is to provide a forum for an exchange of ideas
between researchers in the Manufacturing Systems Program, Manufacturing Machines
and Systems Program, and the Automation and Systems Integration Program mainly,
to assure that these individual researchers are informed about the present
ongoing activities of their colleagues. Thus an elimination of duplication of
their efforts may be achieved and a degree of cooperation may result. An overall
improvement of efficiency of the programs would be expected. In addition, the
conference program organization allows for ample time to discuss manufacturing
research in detail with the collective research community at the meeting with
feedback and input from the National Science Foundation. Finally, personal
contacts with researchers in the programs should contribute to clarifying many
current problems in their work. Principal Investigator's will have one to two
years advanced information as it often takes that much time between the report
of the work presented at the grantees conference and the publication of papers
about this work in the literature.
