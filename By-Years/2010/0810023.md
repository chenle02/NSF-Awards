This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project develops new algorithms
and data representations to streamline the development and dissemination of
computer animation products. High risk for this project lies in extending
prototype software for temporal anti-aliasing on crisp mathematical examples to
realistically complex cases. The innovation, if successful, will be a
comprehensive commercial solution and provide basic improvements to temporal
anti-aliasing during the conceptual design stage, portability across display
devices (inclusive of emerging 3-D options) and compact representation for more
efficient data storage and transmission.

The business focus of the effort is to facilitate the creation, storage and
delivery of digital visual effects. If successful, a new market (similar to
traditional visual effects) will be developed. Once established, this market
will offer significant commercial opportunity. As the technology matures,
current partners will be developing instructional animation content for
undergraduate biology students. This effort will offer feedback to assist in
contributing to ongoing educational projects in other areas as well.
