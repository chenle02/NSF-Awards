Cost Allocation in Communication Networks In hub networks there are a fixed
number of interconnected facilities - the hubs. Each hub provides access to the
network to a given number of non-hub clients, locations or users. Hub and spoke
type arrangements by airlines are an example of such networks. They are also
commonly found in communications. Hub networks are advantageous when there are
economies of scale in provision of services as, when such economies exist, costs
to each user of the network can be reduced through their participation and
cooperation in the operation of the network. For this to occur, however, users
must receive their `fair share` of the cost reductions resulting from the
exploitation of economies of scale. In this proposal, the PI intends to develop
computationally tractable means for determining fair cost allocations among
users of hub or hub-like networks. Both game theoretic and heuristic approaches
will be employed in the development of these allocation procedures.
