Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are enabling new services and
applications including voice-enabled digital assistants, machine translation,
personalized medicine, fraud detection, and autonomous vehicles. This new class
of intelligent services and applications are critical to the economy and
transforming century-old industries ranging from commerce and banking to
transportation and healthcare. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this research, the
problem of deploying advanced machine learning models and prediction pipelines
is studied. A holistic approach is taken for the design of the computer systems
needed to render predictions and the models and algorithms that they run. Models
are developed that can scale their complexity to avoid overthinking and thereby
reduce the energy required to make predictions along with algorithms and systems
to automatically configure complex prediction pipelines to simplify model
deployment while also improving efficiency and reliability. This research will
also produce and promote open-source software systems that can be used across
industries. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Building these new AI-powered applications
will also require new skills and education. A key part of this proposal is open-
source course development. A new Data Science major is being designed and this
grant will fund new open modules in the data science courses. These courses are
taken by students in engineering as well as across the entire campus and provide
the fundamental skills needed to understand how machine learning can be used to
solve real-world problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
