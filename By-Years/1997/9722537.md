9722537 Willis A Toroidal Large Aperture Spectrometer (ATLAS) is a general-
purpose detector that will exploit the full potential of the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC) proton-proton collision program. The LHC will provide 10 times
higher center-of-mass energy and 1000 times higher proton-proton collision rates
than previous colliders. This opens up new frontiers of physics which ATLAS will
explore. The Standard Model, which is the established theoretical description of
the basic building blocks of matter and of the fundamental interactions, has
several unexplored aspects, all well within the reach of ATLAS. ATLAS will
greatly increase the resolving power with which the size of the building blocks
of matter, the quarks and leptons, can be measured.

The discovery of the Z and W particles was a large step forward in the
understanding of fundamental interactions. ATLAS will be able to discover and
measure particles with similar properties but with masses up to 50 times larger
than those of the W and Z. ATLAS is designed for a large discovery potential and
for precision measurements.

The detector designs are based on extensive R&D within the collaboration and
display many innovative features. Over a period of six years, prototypes of
progressively increasing scale, together with simulations, have been used to
optimize the performance to meet the ATLAS requirements.

An international collaboration of 1500 scientists, from 145 institutes in 31
countries, including 250 physicists from 28 US institutions, will construct and
use the ATLAS detector.

ATLAS has, in addition to detector coordinators, an education coordinator who,
with an ATLAS education task group, intends to develop a significant program
integrating research and education.
