9511923 Clark The Nuclear Theory Group at The Ohio State University, supported
in part by the National Science Foundation, studies a broad range of problems
involving the strong interaction which is responsible for matter as we know it.
Most of this research involves either the direct study of quantum chromodynamics
(QCD), the relativistic field theory of quarks and gluons, or its connection to
effective theories of the strong interaction at low energies. QCD remains
unsolved at energy scales relevant for describing nuclei and their constituents.
The challenge for nuclear theorists is to develop methods for directly solving
QCD in the strong-interaction regime, to discover connections between successful
nuclear phenomenology and QCD, and to develop effective descriptions of QCD in
terms of low-energy degrees of freedom (hadrons). Research in the Nuclear Theory
Group is progressing in each of these areas. ***
