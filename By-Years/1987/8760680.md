Scientific and regulatory considerations dictate that many vaccines and
genetically engineered proteins for use in humans are best prouced in mammalian
cell lines derived from non- malignant sources. These cells usually require a
surface upon which to grow, and several bioreactor configurations have been
developed which have large surface areas compressed into small volumes, thereby
improving the efficiency of the system. Currently, however, the internal
surfaces are not adequate for long-term cell culture; the greatest problem is
that cells typically die or detach after four to six weeks, thus greatly
limiting the useful life of such bioreactors. Phase I will seek to covalently
immobilize naturally occurring cell adhesion proteins onto surfaces suitable for
large-scale cell culture, and then test their effectiveness in improving initial
cell attachment, cell growth, and long-term viability using three representative
cell lines. Phase II will seek to conduct more extensive long-term evaluations,
test various cell lines, and investigate cell growth in serum-free media. Proof
of concept of this technology should greatly improve the usefulness of
bioreactors in producing certain proteins for pharmaceutical use.
