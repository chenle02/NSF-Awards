Techniques have been developed for mass spectrometric determination of 234U and
230TH at the level of - 10 9 atoms to about 0.5% precision. The time range over
which useful age data on corals can be obtained now ranges from 50 to about
500,000 years. This methods will be applied to dating of corals and marine
carbonates. This method will be applied to dating of corals ad marine
carbonates. The main objectives are to determine the precise timing of the last
interglacial period and study neotectonics. The investigators will also continue
to study the marine chemistry of rare earth elements (REE), actinide elements
(ACE) and lead. The results of these studies will improve our knowledge of the
transport of these elements from the continent to the ocean and to the oceanic
crust and the usefulness of these nuclides for the study of time scales of time
important geological processes.
