This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is a feasibility study
of developing a terabyte size database server using advanced software technology
developed for supercomputer cluster and scientific computation. With today.s
rapid proliferation of information, organizations are facing the challenge of
storing and managing the ever-growing company.s data. Today.s infrastructure
solutions are complex and expensive. Besides an economical enterprise class
database server, other potential applications are for any information intensive
job such as data warehousing and data mining. The innovation will enhance
scientific understanding by providing a powerful but affordable computing and
data storage platform to conduct research in the areas such as bioinformatic,
data mining and text mining. It provides a scientific research tool for small
research institutes and educational institutes. The innovation will enhance
technological understanding since this is the very first project to study data
management and storage using openMosix Linux, PVFS2 and MySQL. The software
technologies developed will be freely distributed as Open Source code. Other
developers are expected to follow Open Solutions initiative to further develop
the technology.
