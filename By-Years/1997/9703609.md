9703609 Reagan In this project, Micro-Pulse Lidar (MPL) measurements of aerosols
will be carried out as part of the North Atlantic Regional Aerosol
Characterization Experiment (ACE-2). ACE-2 will be conducted in June and July,
1997, over the subtropical Northeastern Atlantic Ocean as an international
collaborative effort. The main objectives of ACE-2 are to study the properties
of atmospheric aerosols relevant to radiative forcing and climate using
aircraft, ship-board, and ground-based measurements. The principal objective of
this work is to provide quantitative retrievals of aerosol spatial backscatter
and extinction. Coupling MPL measurements with the comprehensive ACE-2 and
AEROCE experiments represents an opportunity to enhance the aerosol information
that will be derived at the Tenerife site. The MPL measurements will include
standard vertical profililg plus horizontal and slant-path measurements, which
are feasible since this system is eye-safe. The understanding of the
temporal/spatial distributions of aerosols in the North Atlantic region that MPL
measurements will provide is important to the development of a more accurate
aerosol climatology. In addition to characterizing the aerosol spatial
structure, the MPL extinction and backscatter retrievals provide optical
coefficients that are a direct measure of aerosol radiative properties. Coupled
with ground-based aerosol sampling and column direct solar/sky scan
measurements, these retrievals will provide critical data for closure
experiments to establish valid aerosol radiative models necessary to assess
aerosol climate forcing effects.
