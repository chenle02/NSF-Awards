Funding from the prestigious five-year Presidential Young Investigator award
will be used to support research on the population biology of bacteria and their
plasmids. Their large populations and short generations permit an experimental,
not merely correlative, approach to the study of evolutionary processes.
Research efforts will fall into four major areas: genetic basis of fitness in
evolving populations of Escherichia coli, fitness consequences associated with
alternative modes of regulation of tetracycline resistance genes in E. coli,
evolution and genetics of an association between E. coli and plasmid pACYC184,
and effects of recombinant functions (particularly chlorobenzoate degradation)
on plasmid stability and host fitness in Pseudomonas species. Precise
measurements of the effects of particular genetic variants, both chromosomal and
extrachromosomal, on bacterial net growth, or relative fitness, are required for
these projects.
