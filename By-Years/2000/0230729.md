PROPOSAL NO.: 0230729 PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Johnson, George INSTITUTION NAME:
University of California-Berkeley TITLE: Developing a Modern Mechanical
Engineering Curriculum

ABSTRACT

Computation is now regarded as an equal and indispensable partner with theory,
synthesis, experimentation and product realization in the engineering workplace
as well as in the advance of cutting-edge research. While computers have begun
to play a role in engineering education, their effective use is far behind their
potential. In this proposal we seek to use computational tools to improve the
capacity of our graduates to design, analyze and realize complex physical
systems, while retaining the strength of the program in the engineering
sciences. Indeed, we believe that through appropriate utilization of computation
throughout the curriculum, students can graduate with a richer understanding of
the fundamental concepts of the field than is possible now. We intend to use
computation as a bridge across the traditional divide between theory and
application with a view to the future. Working with our industry partners,
disciplinary professional societies, and the National Academy of Engineering's
Engineer 2020 initiative, we will consider the impact of new emerging
disciplines, transformational changes in industrial practice and projected
societal needs into our curricular reform efforts.
