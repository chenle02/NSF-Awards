The University of Florida proposes to provide 51 teachers and over 3600 students
with an interesting experience and opportunities for biotechnology learning.
This project will create a computer-based game and supporting curriculum for
promoting workforce development in the area of biotechnology; prepare teachers
to implement the game and supporting curriculum through a summer professional
development program; and determine how the game and supporting curriculum
affects student disposition towards careers in biotechnology and understanding
of biotechnology content. The project team (consisting of science educators,
educational technologists, scientists, curriculum writers, and professional
development providers) will collaborate with a professional game design company
to design the computer game. The project will use a mixed-methods research
design that makes use of case studies, pre/post test data, and comparison group
to determine the efficacy of the game and supporting curriculum as a platform
for improving student dispositions towards careers in
biotechnology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
