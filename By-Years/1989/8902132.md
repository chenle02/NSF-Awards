Professor Price's project involves mathematical research that is motivated by
quantum mechanics. The quantum mechanical point of view is to represent
observable quantities by linear operators on Hilbert space rather than by
scalars. In some models, the observables give rise to an algebra of operators.
Time evolution is given by a coherent rule specifying a transformation of the
algebra at each moment. Mathematical manipulations allow one to read off
properties of the system being modeled from the way it evolves over time. In the
present undertaking, a rather general sort of time evolution, called a semigroup
of endomorphisms, is to be studied with the goal of obtaining a scheme of
classification. This project is funded under the Research in Undergraduate
Institutions activity; there is a component of the research that will be carried
out by undergraduate students. Cocycle conjugacy invariants finer than the
recently discovered quantized Fredholm index of Arveson and Powers for these
semigroups will be investigated. Professor Price will also consider the
representation theory of operator algebras generated by pairs of isometric flows
on Hilbert space that satisfy a certain commutation relation. The undergraduate
component involves work on shift register sequences, a piece of cryptanalytic
technology that seems to be related to shift endomorphisms of the hyperfinite
factor.
