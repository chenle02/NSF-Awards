Collective action is fraught with difficulty. The difficulties of coordinating
the actions of individuals exists in all segments of society. Though scholars
have reported on general problems confronting communities - - largely dilemmas
resulting from an incompatibility between the individuals' incentives and the
collective goal - - relatively little attention has been directed toward
understanding the principles by which communities solve these problems. For
example, why do communities solve some problems via a decentralized system of
individual property rights while other problems require hierarchical
organizations? Why are some organizational arrangements, for example firms and
committees, successful at mitigating collective difficulties for their
communities, while other organizational structures, for example communes, are
not successful? The failure of communities to accomplish their collective goals
is a failure of institutional design. This project focuses on the institutional
structure of legislatures and parties. It is common in studies of party-
dominated legislatures, such as the British House of Commons, to see changes in
the rules of procedure as intimately linked to changes and developments in the
party system. In the U.S. House of Representatives, however, with its relatively
weak parties, legislative structure is more often linked to the electoral
concerns of individual legislators, rather than to any collective electoral
concerns. This is especially true of research that is in or influenced by the
rational choice perspective. In this research investigation the researchers
explore the degree to which specifically partisan factors enter into, and have
historically entered into, the structure of the House of Representatives. The
investigators focus on the committee system and articulate a view of committees
as agents of political parties. This necessitates answering a number of broader
questions: What is a party and how can it control any agents that it might
appoint, committees or not? What are agency relationships like when they involve
collective principals, such as a party? What is the role of the party
leadership? How do the specifics of committee appointment affect their
responsiveness to partisan demands? What is the relationship between committees
and the floor? Employing an approach that is consistent with rational choice
premises, the investigators develop and test this model of committee behavior,
based on principal agent theory.
