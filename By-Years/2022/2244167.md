This award supports the renewal of the Research Experiences for Undergraduates
(REU) and Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) site in physics at the
University of Texas Rio Grande Valley. The site will support twelve
undergraduates and one teacher per year in research projects in gravitational
wave detection, lasers and optics, radio and optical astronomy, blue energy, or
materials science. The projects can be theoretical, computational, experimental,
observational and/or oriented towards applied physics. As the students' research
experience grows they will come closer to being independent, self-reliant
scientists. The site will incorporate one high school teacher from the Rio
Grande Valley area who will develop smaller subprojects to be carried on with
their students during the school year. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research
projects in this REU and RET site will focus on research in frontier areas of
phenomenological, experimental and applied physics at state-of-the-art
facilities. The topics offered cover data analysis and gravitational wave
detection projects, laser and optics projects from the area of gravitational
wave detector instrumentation, radio, optical and X-ray astronomy projects,
sustainable energy generation projects and nanoscience and advanced materials
science projects. The program will have a close mentoring and guidance system
from the faculty in place during the entire duration, fostering interaction and
active participation by students and teachers through seminars, lunch meetings,
colloquia and presentations. This REU site has research topics for the
undergraduates that advance topics that fall within the goals of the Windows on
the Universe Big Idea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
