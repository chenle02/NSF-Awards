Charm physics is an important component of the field of flavor physics. This
field is currently in a renaissance with significant results coming from
measurements at a number of experimental facilities worldwide, including
B-factories, Hadron Colliders, and Charm factories. An important objective in
flavor physics is the determination of all of the elements of the Cabibbo
Kobayashi Maskawa (CKM) mixing matrix, which is a matrix of complex numbers that
relates the electroweak interactions of the six known flavors (or types) of
quarks. The Wayne State University group has made significant contributions to
the study of the mixing of neutral charm D mesons at CLEO-c. Notable among their
measurements is the extraction of an important parameter known as the strong
phase in decays of neutral D mesons into final states containing charged Kaons
and Pions. This measurement has impact on the determination of one of the CKM
mixing angles called gamma. The group plans to continue the study of D decays
with BELLE-II at KEK in Japan and is exploring a new test of CP violation in D
decays. Additionally at BELLE-II, the group intends to study rare decays of D
mesons, looking for 4 quark content, and building upon earlier expertise gained
at CLEO-c. The broader impacts efforts of the group are considerable through
REU/RET programs, reaching students from underrepresented groups who participate
directly in the research program.
