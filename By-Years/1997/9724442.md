Development of a Single Molecule Laser Optical Trap/Fluorescence Detection
System This proposal describes the development of a state-of- the-art instrument
that has the capacity to measure molecular forces and the ability to detect the
emission of light from single fluorescent molecule. The instrument is a
microscope that contains a laser optical trap and a ultra- sensitive, low light
detection system. This novel instrument is intended to serve both the research
needs for a significant number of investigators at the University of Vermont and
as a unique teaching tool to introduce undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral
students to molecular biophysics.
