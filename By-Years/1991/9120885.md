This award covers Experimental Elementary Particle Physics research by a group
at the University of Rochester in collaboration with other NSF and DOE supported
scientists. The group will conclude its studies of energetic photons produced at
large angles in high-energy pion and proton- nucleus collisions. They will
compare the observed photon yields with Quantum Chromodynamic calculations
within the standard picture of interacting quarks and leptons. The group also
will study proton-antiproton collisions at the highest accessible energies to
test extrapolations of Standard Model predictions. The expertise of this group
in calorimetry and detector construction will contribute to preparations for
experiments at the Superconducting Super Collider (SSC).
