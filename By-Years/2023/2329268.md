Machine learning has recently attracted renewed attention following the release
of highly versatile large language models such as Chat-GPT and Bard. As concerns
about the social and economic impact of technical advances mount, many of
machine learning's most successful tools remain poorly understood and their
inner working obscure even to their creators. We believe that a healthy and
durable society must be built on well-understood, responsible, and interpretable
principles. This conference is dedicated to the mathematical foundations of
machine learning and its application in analytically tractable settings with the
aim of building the tools to better understand the powerful, but inscrutable
emerging tools and to discuss interpretable alternative approaches.

Texas A&M University is a historical stronghold of approximation theory, which
itself underlies learning theory. Indeed, the question 'how well can a function
be approximated in general?' arguably precedes the question 'how well can a
function be approximated from point values?'. It is an objective of this
conference (https://sites.google.com/tamu.edu/camda-conference/) to place
rigorous mathematical analysis at the center of future developments in data
science in order to guide socially and environmentally responsible progress.
Four plenary speakers from Departments of Mathematics, Electrical and Computer
Engineering and Computer Science will address an interdisciplinary audience in
this effort. An 'open problems' session is planned for the discussion and
dissemination of important open problems in this effort, with the specific goal
of attracting junior researchers.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
