The Texas A.&amp; M. University Engineering Experiment Station will initiate a
three-week, residential Young Scholars project in Engineering which will provide
science enrichment activities for 32 precollege students entering grades 8 and
9. This summer program will emphasize research participation in 13 different
engineering fields. The research experience for each Young Scholar will consist
of assignment to an undergraduate research project that has been started but not
yet completed. Each project involves data collection, analysis, theoretical
results and a write-up of experimental procedures.
