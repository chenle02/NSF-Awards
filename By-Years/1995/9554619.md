9554619 Smith Three school districts in rural, north-central Mississippi will
cooperate in a twelve-month planning project to solidify/expand partnerships and
implement a strategic planning process leading to a Local Systemic Change
proposal for K-8 mathematics. The project expects to serve 140 K-8 mathematics
teachers from Winona Public Schools, 75 from Montgomery County Schools, and
approximately 80 other teachers of mathematics from a third neighboring
district. The planning project emphasizes exemplary instructional materials,
strong support for teachers, involvement of parents and the business community,
and the creation of alternative schedules that provide weekly released half days
for teacher professional development.
