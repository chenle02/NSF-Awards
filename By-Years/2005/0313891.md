This project maximizes the scholarship program's impact, by promoting
information assurance (IA) awareness at the secondary education and community
college levels, and by increasing the national capability for the education of
IA professionals. The project revises an existing course, IT463 (Information
Assurance), and incorporates it into the university's Master of Science Teaching
(MST) curriculum as a graduate course. In summer 2004, a Workshop on Information
Security Education (WISE'04) at NMT campus is planned along with the recruitment
of 15 science/math/computer teachers from high schools and community colleges to
participate. In addition, appropriate materials from a newly developed course,
IT263 (Information Protection and Security), is adapted and incorporated into
future summer mini courses held on NMT campus on Information Technology.
