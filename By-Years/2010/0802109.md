Abstract&lt;br/&gt;ECCS-0802109&lt;br/&gt;M. Raymer, University of Oregon
Eugene&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective: To advance the field of quantum-optical
information technology, this program explores methods for creating entangled
photons pairs by spontaneous four-wave mixing in small-core optical fibers. This
offers advantages, including creating photons that are well mode matched for
low-loss fiber transmission. The work will be carried out by a collaboration of
the Raymer group at the University of Oregon, the McKinstrie group at Bell Labs,
and the Radic group at UC San Diego. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:
They will use parametric interactions in highly nonlinear fibers and photonic-
crystal fiber to enable several basic capabilities: 1) pair-photon generation in
fiber with controlled degree of spectral correlation or entanglement, 2)
frequency conversion (translation) of quantum states of photons and modes in
fiber while maintaining spectral or entanglement properties, 3) generation of
amplitude-entangled fields of modes in fiber, and 4) linear coupling of signals
at different carrier frequencies through nonlinear Bragg
scattering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: Wavelength agility of optical
signals plays an important role in modern communication systems. Quantum
frequency conversion would have at least two uses: 1) to enable wavelength-
division multiplexing of quantum signals, including those used for quantum
cryptographic key distribution, and 2) to provide a means to manipulate
entangled photons between many channels for the purpose of quantum computation.
The project brings together quantum opticians with optical device scientists at
other institutions, providing the opportunity for PhD students to spend time
interacting with diverse scientists and benefiting from their facilities and
expertise. Nonlinear optics offers excellent opportunities to integrate research
with science education.
