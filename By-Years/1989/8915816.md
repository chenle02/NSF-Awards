This award provides partial support for participants at the first Northeast
Topology Seminar, mainly drawn from New York, New England, Ontario, New Jersey,
and Pennsylvania. Principal speakers include D. R. Anderson (Syracuse), F. R.
Cohen (Rochester), M. J. Hopkins (M.I.T.), W.-c. Hsiang (Princeton), E. K.
Pedersen (McMaster), and M. G. Rothenberg (Chicago), emphasizing high
dimensional topology and homotopy theory.
