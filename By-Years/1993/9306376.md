Johnson and Pisier will investigate problems in the isomorphic theory of Banach
spaces and operator spaces. The problems to be considered involve: local theory
of Lp and of operator spaces, weak Hilbert spaces, probabilistic inequalities,
function algebras over the ball of a Banach space, polynomially bounded
operators, bounded homomorphisms on C*algebras, infinite dimensional geometry of
Banach spaces and operator spaces.
