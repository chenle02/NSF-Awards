9313076 Chen Concrete materials exhibit both extremes of behavior: that is,
ductile flow and brittle fracture. Under certain conditions, a transition
between brittle and ductile behavior occurs, yet no distinction between the two
modes has been made in any of the present failure criteria and related theories.
Ideally constitutive equations should reflect both the modes of deformation and
the possibility of a brittle-ductile transition. Also, because concrete
materials are highly non-homogeneous, especially in the softening regime where
cracking is widespread, macroscopic observations are not sufficient. Therefore,
a unified elastic- plastic-damage theory is proposed, which is based on recent
fundamental understanding of concrete micro-mechanics. New software development
systems are thus necessary for adequate development and testing of new material
models. A software development environment for structural engineering focused on
software reusability.
