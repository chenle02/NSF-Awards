Funds are requested to support students to attend the second IEEE Conference on
Communications and Network Security (CNS), which is sponsored by IEEE ComSoc and
will be held in San Francisco, CA, USA, October 29 - 31, 2014. IEEE CNS
conference is a spin-off of IEEE INFOCOM, and is positioned to be a core ComSoc
conference that serves as a premier forum for communications and network
researchers, practitioners, policy makers, and users to exchange ideas,
techniques and tools, raise awareness, and share experience related to security
and privacy. It provides a unique bridge for the communications and networking
community and the security community. The technical scope of this conference
encompasses a large number of areas in communications and network security,
which facilitates gathering of prominent scientists from academia, governments
and industries from around the world to discuss the emerging and
multidisciplinary frontiers of networking security technology. The travel grant
tends to benefit a wider demographic of graduate students, which will help to
broaden participation in the research area of communications and network
security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will contribute to the attendance of
approximately 10-15 US-based graduate students. The selection process for the
travel award will involve a sub-committee of the CNS 2014 Executive Committee,
chaired by the PI. The travel award will target graduate students, in
particular, women and under-represented minority students, since attending
conferences is an important part of their educational experience, and they often
have limited travel funds.
