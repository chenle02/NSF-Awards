Clifford Dykstra of Indiana University-Purdue University at Indianapolis is
supported by the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program for research
that aims to provide new and more detailed understanding of molecular electrical
response, both for isolated molecules and for extended assemblies of molecules.
This effort includes a series of high-level ab initio evaluations of properties,
and the modeling or representing of these properties through transferable tensor
quantities associated with specific atoms in specific bonding environments.
Applications will include learning how external electrical environments can
control or affect nucleation and conformational changes in molecules, the
alignment of aggregating molecules, and electrically operated molecular
switches. Other applications involve the affects of the surrounding molecular
medium on response properties of molecules, in particular on nonlinear response
to applied fields. The outcomes of this research are expected to enable a
generalized response analysis of interactions necessary for a variety of useful
predictions, yet be simple enough for large-scale molecular simulations. Useful
applications to nanoscale data storage technology are anticipated.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will enable better models of intermolecular
interaction to be built, including those systems that are amenable to both
quantum and classical description. Research outcomes are expected to enable
useful applications to nanoscale data storage technology via electronic control
of molecular orientation and conformation.
