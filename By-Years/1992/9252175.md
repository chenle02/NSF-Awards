A workstation based Creativity Center for interdisciplinary student design
projects is being developed. Students in computer science, electrical
engineering and mechanical engineering join together to assist each other in a
project environment emulating the industrial setting. The equipment includes
RISC/6000 and Macintosh/IIci networked workstations, peripheral devices and
software. The center provides students with tools for obtaining a modern design
experience relevant to current industrial practice.
