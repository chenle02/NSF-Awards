Resource Description Framework (RDF) has, in recent years, become an
increasingly important data and knowledge representation formalism for a broad
range of applications, including the World Wide Web. With rapidly growth in the
size of RDF datasets, there is growing need for scalable and efficient
technologies for storing, indexing, and querying RDF datasets that are trillions
of triples in size. This project, led by Dr. Praveen Rao of University of
Missouri-Kansas City, aims to address this need by developing: (1) A novel
approach to storing, indexing, and querying of RDF data that treats graphs as
first-class citizens to reduce the cost and number of joins required for graph
pattern matching using RDF signatures, RDF signature indexes and line graphs;
(2) A new approach for parallel SPARQL query processing on cloud platforms using
data distribution schemes based on RDF signatures, location index for quickly
finding RDF graphs of interest across computing nodes, and a gossip-driven query
execution model and (3) A new approach for selectivity estimation of RDF graph
patterns for query optimization based on new gossip algorithms for cardinality
estimation of RDF graph patterns and a divide-andconquer method for effective
load balancing and improved accuracy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
broader impacts of this project include new courses covering topics in RDF data
management and cloud computing, a scalable RDF reasoning tool over cancer data
for oncologists, new cloud services for very large RDF data stores, increased
opportunities for research-based advanced training of undergraduate and graduate
students, including women. The results of this research, including publications,
software, and data sets will be freely shared with the broader community.
