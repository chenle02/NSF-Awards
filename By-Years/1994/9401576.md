9401576 Doty This award supports work on the study of representations of
reductive groups in zero and non-zero characteristics. Reductive monoids will be
investigated for possible applications to the groups. The general linear groups
will play a central role in this investigation. The research supported concerns
the representation theory of reductive groups. A group is an algebraic object
used to study transformations. Because of this, groups are a fundamental tool in
physics, chemistry and computer science as well as mathematics. Representation
theory is an important method for determining the structure of groups.
