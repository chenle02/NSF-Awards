9322386 Nigg This award is made under the Small Grants for Exploratory Research
program to conduct a twelve-month study of the economic consequences of flooding
in the mid-central states that occurred during the summer of 1993. The
investigation will focus on disruption of the economic sector of Des Moines and
Polk County, Iowa due to the multiple failure of lifeline systems. Greater Des
Moines was selected for intensive study because of the massive lifeline failures
across the community, a condition which is likely to reflect the conditions
arising from a large earthquake in a metropolitan area. The project is related
to NSF's Civil Infrastructure Systems Research initiative. By investigating
multiple infrastructural failures in one community due to a disaster, we will
gain a perspective on the relative importance of these systems for the economic
well-being of a community. A complementary project focusing on lifeline
engineering will be carried out by the Technical Council on Lifeline Earthquake
Engineering. ***
