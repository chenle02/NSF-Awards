9529707 Phipps Moran This project is a pilot teleseismic surface wave study with
the goal of mapping the source of the Hawaiian swell. During a 9- month
deployment an array of eight ocean-bottom seismometers will collect Rayleigh
wave dispersion data from circum-Pacific plate bourdary earthquakes. A 3-D
interpretation of these data will give constraints on the lithosphere and upper
asthenosphere shear- velocity structure beneath the Hawaiian swell. If this
pilot experiment is successful a larger experiment would be proposed to
determine which of the three hypotheses for the formation of the swell is
correct.
