Engineering Practice Introducing Course Sequence, an Interdisciplinary Program
at the university, uses bona-fide projects from industry or government agencies
to teach students problem-solving skills. The students work in teams on these
open-ended problems; the industrial engineer is their client; the professors are
their mentors. Funds are supplied to enable experimentation with using projects
from remote industrial or government engineers--clients who because of distance
cannot meet face-to-face with the students. The university uses computer-
telephone technology for communciations between these remote clients and their
project teams. If successful, the experiment will expand the project client pool
and it will get the student more deeply into computer use. The experiment will
use the Telewriter II-PC System developed by Optel Communications, Inc., and the
AT&T Alliance conferencing system. This system allows interactive computer use
between stations along with voice-over conferencing.
