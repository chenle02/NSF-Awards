Maciej Wojtkowski will use dynamical system theory to study geodesic flow on
manifolds. This research forms part of a growing trend towards the use of
dynamics in differential geometry. He will focus his attention on the geodesic
flow of the Atiyah-Hitchin metric. The objectives are the refining of the
Kolmogorv-Arnol'd-Moser theory, constructing the Smale horseshoe at infinity and
finding new closed geodesics. He will also carry out research into Markov
partitions for discontinuous uniformly hyperbolic systems and hyperbolicity of
billiards on surfaces of constant curvature.
