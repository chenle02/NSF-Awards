The immunology laboratory experience will be improved by utilizing a process-
oriented approach. This will be accomplished by introducing equipment for modern
protein microanalysis, specifically for the analysis of antibodies and antigens.
This equipment includes an enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) reader
coupled to a Macintosh computer, and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis units
(mini-PAGE) with drop-in electroblotting cassettes. This equipment will be used
to duplicate several important immunological discoveries, and then be used for
independent work. Experiments will include quantification of the immune
response, characterization of the physical properties of antibodies, and
determination of cell cooperation in the immune response. The equipment will
also be available for student research projects and will introduced to students
in the freshman biology course. The college will provide 50% matching funds.
