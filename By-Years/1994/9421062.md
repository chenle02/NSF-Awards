9421062 Allen This Americas Program award will fund travel and related expenses
for ten U.S. scientists to participate in a workshop on numerical particle
transport theory. Organizers are Dr. G. Donald Allen, of Texas A&amp;M
University, and Dr. Jean-Pierre Hennart, of the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de
Mexico. Topics to be discussed will range from inverse problems, theoretical and
numerical approximation of solutions, to results of newly developed computer
codes in one, two and three dimensions. A significant feature of the workshop
will be the inclusion of graduate students of both the U.S. and Mexican faculty
participants. Numerical transport theory is very demanding of computational
resources because of the large number of independent variables that occur. In
the past, it has been closely associated with applications of transport theory
to nuclear energy. However, it is likely that other applications, e.g.,
radiative transfer in planetary atmospheres, will assume increased importance in
the coming years, especially as the demand for computational accuracy increases
in such fields. ***
