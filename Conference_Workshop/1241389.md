This award will support an NSF/CMBS regional conference to be held at Michigan
State University in the summer of 2013 on the topic of analysis of stochastic
partial differential equations (SPDEs). The principal speaker will be Professor
Davar Khoshnevisan from the University of Utah. The goals of the conference are
to systematically study the fundamental notions, existing techniques and
applications around SPDEs, to develop powerful new methods for investigating
local behavior and intermittency of nonlinear SPDEs, and to reformulate and
investigate problems which are significant for future development of SPDEs.

In addition to the 10 main lectures by Dr. Khoshnevisan, six lectures will be
presented by other experts in these fields. This award will support
approximately 25 participants at different stages of their careers, and a
monograph will be produced.
