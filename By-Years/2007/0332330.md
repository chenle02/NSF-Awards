East Carolina University is establishing an international collaboration with the
Center for Process Analytics and Control Technology (CPACT) on a currently
funded Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Measurement
and Control Engineering. This project, "Experimental Batch Optimization",
research software being developed at Oklahoma State University will be
implemented at East Carolina University where it will receive in-situ
spectroscopic measurement and process measurements from up to four micro-scale
(50 mL) laboratory batch reactor. Funds will be used to support one
undergraduate student to spend an extended stay of 2 months per year at
Strathclyde University in Glasgow, Scotland.
