Basic theoretical studies of fluid membranes will be undertaken. Besides their
intrinsic scientific challenge, membranes are also important in biology and in
the development of advanced materials. Fluid membranes also provide unique
opportunities to study fundamental properties of two-dimensional ordering and
phase transitions in flat and curved geometries.
