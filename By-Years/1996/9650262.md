The goal of this project is to give chemistry students laboratory and research
experiences in modern biochemical techniques as part of a major initiative in
biochemistry at the institution. A principal objective is the upgrading of
instrumentation and experiments performed in the introductory biochemistry
laboratory. A second objective is the improvement of physical chemistry and
instrumental analysis. Courses are made more attractive as electives for
students in the biochemistry track of our program by introducing experiments
that use biochemical systems to explore chemical principles. Project equipment
is also shared and by undergraduate students and faculty engaged in
collaborative research. Overall, students receive unique experiences through
this project and are expected publish as well as present results at scientific
meetings.
