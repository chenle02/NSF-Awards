New Mexico State University and El Paso Community College are collaborating to
create a new introductory course that fully integrates instruction in biology
and mathematics. The idea grew from a successful Undergraduate Biology and
Mathematics project in which teams of faculty and students worked together on
common research questions. Now that effort is being broadened and tested on a
larger and less experienced student population. Targeted to students beginning
their studies of STEM disciplines, the course is offered at both institutions in
parallel with more traditional courses and the effectiveness of the two
instructional models are compared using common assessment tools. If the combined
approach is as successful at influencing student learning and conceptual mastery
as expected, it will replace traditional instruction at both institutions. Not
only does this innovative interdisciplinary approach provide a solid foundation
for future studies in quantitative STEM subjects, it also allows development of
strategies to encourage participation of more underrepresented minority
students, a large part of the population in Southern New Mexico and Western
Texas.
