This document proposes the development of a permanent Summer Institute in the
Department of Information and Computer Science at the University of California,
Irvine. The main objective of this Institute will be to increase the
participation of underrepresented minority students in Computer Science. The
Institute, which is based on a pilot project organized for the Summer of 1992,
will target specifically students at 2 year institutions and encourage them to
continue their Computer Science education at a 4-year institution, such as UCI.
The Institute will offer a comprehensive 6-week program consisting of the
following major components: (1) a set of three courses - an introductory
computer science course, a study skills course, and a career development curse;
(2) a corporate internship with one of Southern California's major computer-
related firms; a variety of inter-and cross-cultural experiences, structured
into three main chapters of the Institute - Native American, African American,
and Chicano/Latino Chapters. The target population will be 60 students each year
Chapter. The Institute will be co-sponsored by the ICS Department, the Corporate
partners, and the UCI-based CAMP project. The Institute will complement the
broad overall objectives of CAMP by providing a focused and highly-structured
program for the Computer Science discipline.
