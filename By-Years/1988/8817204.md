The investigator, Herman Chernoff, will continue his work in sequential
analysis. One problem is that of deciding the sign of m, the drift of Brownian
motion. Assuming the cost of a wrong decision to be independent of m and the
sampling cost to be proportional to time multiplied by the square of the drift
for bounded sampling time. Chernoff will examine the effect of normal priors and
mixtures of normal and point mass priors form. Another problem to be
investigated is that of serial dependence in quality control. Chernoff will also
examine a robust method for the problem of missing explanatory variables in a
regression model. In the area of simulation the Chernoff will study the
asymptotic validity of the "bootstrap" method as well as a two- stage
approximation of a posterior distribution. It is hoped that these and other
statistical methods will prove useful in problems in astronomy. He will also
study the possibility of applying data analytic and pattern recognition
techniques to the identification of common subsequences in long strings that
occur in biological problems.
