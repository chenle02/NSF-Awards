The proposed research involves the study of instability and illposedness for
systems of equations that govern plastic flow in two and three space dimensions
and the study of nonstrictly hyperbolic systems in one space dimension that
model the evolution of undercompressive shock waves. Solution techniques will be
drawn from the theory of dynamical systems and bifurcation theory, and there are
plans to attack some of the problems numerically. Many important physical
phenomena are modelled by systems of equations in which dissapative effects such
as viscosity can be safely neglected. The proposer will study such "hyperbolic"
systems using a panoply of analytical and numerical techniques in order to
investigate problems in the flows of plastics and in the dynamics of certain
types of shock waves.
