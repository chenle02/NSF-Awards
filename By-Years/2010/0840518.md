ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With support
from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities: Multiuser program
(CRIF:MU), the Department of Chemistry at the University of North Texas will
acquire a 400 MHz spectrometer for the study of liquids and solids and upgrade a
500 MHz spectrometer for the study of solids. These improvements will support a
range of research projects, including: 1) the study of stacking interactions in
metal-organic and organic molecules and their optoelectronic properties; 2)
investigations of the mechanism of formation of silicon-oxygen molecular
electronic materials; 3) research on metal cluster chemistry of transition metal
complexes and homogeneous catalysts; and 4) the study of polymers intercalated
into clay matrices to form nanocomposites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Multinuclear NMR
spectroscopy is a powerful analytical tool widely used in synthetic chemistry
and materials science. The spectra enable researchers to identify and
characterize unknown substances. They provide information on the arrangement and
connectivity of atoms in molecules and materials, i.e., their structures by
detecting transitions between energy levels arising from the nuclear spin
properties of atoms. These spectrometers will promote teaching and training of
students (high school through doctoral students) via hands-on research with
modern instrumentation at North Texas University and at the neighboring Texas
Woman's University and Austin College. Students will be able to remotely access
their data. Materials and exercises using remotely accessed NMR data will be
developed for use in an online instrumental analysis course.
