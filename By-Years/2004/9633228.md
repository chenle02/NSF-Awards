9633228 Wilhelmson The Principal Investigator will use existing observational
data and a state of the art three-dimensional mesoscale numerical model to
investigate a range of convective phenomena such as squall lines, severe storms,
tornadoes, and gust fronts. Specific research objectives include: furthering the
understanding of non-supercell tornadoes that form along low level air mass
boundaries; investigating the role of boundary layer convergence/shear lines on
the genesis of waterspouts; studying the influence of horizontal shearing
instability on initiation of deep convection; examining fine-scale supercell
structure and evolution; studying the factors that control convective
development along colliding outflow boundaries; exploring the turret scale
dynamics and entrainment within cumuli and the role of boundary layer
circulations in determining horizontal convective scales. Successful completion
of this research will provide basic insights into atmospheric flows and guidance
to those responsible for forecasting severe weather events. ***
