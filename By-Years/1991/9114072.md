The proposed studies will continue research undertaken for the China and
America Air/Sea Experiments. Aerosol particles collected through ground-based
sampling are analyzed (1) to determine the natural and anthropogenic components
of the airborne particulate material, (2) to investigate the temporal
variability in atmospheric dust concentrations and the meteorological conditions
responsible for the concentration differences, and (3) to estimate the
atmospheric deposition rates of mineral aerosol and selected trace elements to
the waters bordering eastern Asia. New initiatives will focus on the atmospheric
transport of soils as it relates to global climatic change, and the chemistry
off contemporary aerosol particles will be to compared and contrasted with that
of loess from China. The morphology and chemistry of individual aerosol
particles will be investigated through the use of a scanning electron microscope
equipped with a microanalyzer, and these data will be compared with the mass-
particle size distributions obtained with cascade impactors. Selected loess and
aerosol samples will be analyzed using x-ray diffractometry for confirmation of
the individual particle analyses and for comparative mineralogical studies.
Finally, the chemical data for the individual particles will be used to evaluate
certain chemical reactions between the mineral dust and anthropogenic
substances.
