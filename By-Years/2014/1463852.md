People encounter symmetry in daily life: it appears in human faces, butterflies,
snowflakes, etc. In mathematics and natural science, symmetry is abundant and
takes many forms as well. A fascinating area of current mathematical study
concerns Weyl groups, which are certain collections of symmetries obtained by
compositions of reflexive symmetries that satisfy braid relations. The study of
the structure of the Weyl groups plays a fundamental role in understanding
representations of the much larger groups that describe the symmetries of
physical systems and in the geometry of Shimura varieties, two central themes in
modern mathematics. In this research, PI will study the symmetries of Weyl
groups and their applications in representation theory and arithmetic
geometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator will use recent
discoveries about Weyl groups to study the representations of affine Hecke
algebras and the geometry of affine Deligne-Lusztig varieties and Shimura
varieties. Recently, the PI established a connection between the affine Hecke
algebras and the affine Deligne-Lusztig varieties that provides a new bridge
between representation theory and arithmetic geometry. In this project, the PI
will systematically develop this idea and will apply it to the study of modular
representations of affine Hecke algebras and the study of special fibers of
Shimura varieties.
