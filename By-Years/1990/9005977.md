This research is concerned with problems in algebraic geometry. The principal
investigator will continue his study of motivic cohomology and establishing
connections with algebraic K-theory and the values of Dedekind zeta functions.
There are possible applications to the Soule-Beilinson conjecture and related
topics which will also be explored. This is research in the field of algebraic
geometry, one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had a
revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century. In its origins, it treated
figures that could be defined in the plane by the simplest equations, namely
polynomials. Nowadays the field makes use of methods not only from algebra, but
from analysis and topology, and conversely is finding application in those
fields as well as in theoretical computer science and robotics.
