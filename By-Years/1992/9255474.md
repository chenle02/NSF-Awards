A comprehensive course in polymer chemistry is offered for college faculty who
may wish to include this subject in the undergradaute curriculum. The three-week
workshop consists of lectures, demonstrations, and laboratory activities.
Polymer synthesis and modification, molecular level characterization, and
properties of macromolecules are emphasized. Particular attention is given to
how polymer concepts can be incorporated into the undergraduate cuuriculum and
laboratory activities that do not require specialized equipment.
