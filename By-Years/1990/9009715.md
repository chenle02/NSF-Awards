This project develops and analyzes a longitudinal data set on the political
geography of Nazi Party membership in Weimar Germany. Names of more than 31,000
early Nazi members will constitute the data set when completed. The data will
permit test of hypotheses derived from rational choice models of behavior, to
assess the adequacy of that type of explanaiton for political extremism. The
storage, cleaning and checking, restructuring, maintenance, and analysis of data
will make a valuable resource for secondary analyses of Nazi membership records.
