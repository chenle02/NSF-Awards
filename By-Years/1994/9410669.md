9410669 Clough This Career Advancement Grant Award was designed to develop
additional collaboration with other researchers in the field, as well extend the
principal investigator's current knowledge of functional imaging and
biomathematical modeling techniques. To effect this, a research-oriented
sabbatical leave to the Center for Bioengineering's National Simulation Resource
for Circulatory Mass Transport and Exchange at the University of Washington is
funded. The laboratory has expertise in modeling and simulation of biological
transport processes, multiple indicator dilution techniques, metabolic
transformation processes and functional imaging. ***
