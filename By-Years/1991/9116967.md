This is a three-year project to study included fluids, fluid- rock
interactions, and fluid-transport processes associated with rocks of the
Continental Deep-Drilling Program (KTB) in the Bavarian Oberpfalz region. The
three specific aspects of the drilling project to be addressed are: 1)
Characterization of volatile-bearing fluid inclusions (by quantitative laser
Raman microspectroscopy and conventional microthermometry); 2) structural
characterization and petrologic interpretation of graphite (by laser Raman
microspectroscopy and petrographic analysis); and 3) investigation of the
chemical evolution of the C-0-H-N fluids, which in come cases culminated in
graphite precipitation. The principal investigator's research group is
particularly suited to this project because of many previous and ongoing
studies, including developing methodologies for: the quantitative Raman analysis
of fluid inclusions in the C-O-H-N system; quantifying internal volatile
pressures from Raman peak parameters in multi- component C-O-H-N gas/fluid
mixtures; and characterizing graphite structures and their associated
metamorphic grades from Raman spectral parameters. In addition, evaluations of
fluid evolution will be aided by ongoing studies of stable and metastable
equilibria in synthetic fluids in the C-O-H system, and by studies of fluid-rock
interactions in parts of the Duluth mafic intrusive complex wherein both fluids
and lithologies bear strong compositional similarities to those of the KTB.
