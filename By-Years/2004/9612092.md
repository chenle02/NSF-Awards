This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in knowledge-
based, information systems between Shlomo Zilberstein of the University of
Massachusetts and Jean-Paul Haton of the French National Institute for Research
in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics (INRIA) in Nancy, France. The
project involves an exchange of graduate students. The objective of the research
is to build knowledge-based systems that would operate robustly in real-time
domains such as process control, automated navigation, and medical diagnosis.
The American and French investigators bring to this collaboration complementary
expertise and approaches to the problem.
