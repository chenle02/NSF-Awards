This award is made in the Organic Dynamics Program is support of Dr. J. Kerry
Thomas' continuing research on radiation-induced reactions in organized and
constrained media. Reactive intermediates will be generated by photochemical or
radiation excitation of pyrene or other adsorbed species trapped in zeolites,
silica, or a host of polymers such as polystyrene, polyethylene, polymethyl
methacrylate, polyacrylonitrile, polyvinyl chloride and polyvinyl alcohol.
Depending on the system selected, electrons (e-), holes (h+), cations, cation-
radicals, anions, and/or free radicals will be generated, and their reactivity,
motion, and energy-transfer properties monitored by their fluorescence,
phosphorescence, and absorption spectra. These techniques will reveal unique
trapping sites for ions in solid media and will monitor migration of energy and
charge in excited polymers, to soluble probe molecules. The behavior of reactive
intermediates in constrained media is relevant to heterogeneous catalysis in the
case of zeolites and silica, and to understanding the mechanism of light and
radiation- induced degradation of polymers. The action of high-energy radiation
on polymers relates to the use of polymers in microelectronics and the use of
radiation processing in nanolithography.
