97-31282 Jones This project builds on earlier work funded by NSF to document
evidence of student learning in primary science. Documentation enhances
teachers' observations and understanding of young children's learning, evaluates
instruction and assesses children's progress. This project addresses the
following research questions: * How does the process of documentation broaden
educators' awareness of the range of assessment options? * How does the process
of documentation enhance teachers' understanding of young children's learning?
How does it heighten teachers' understanding of the science in children's talk
and work samples? * How does the process of documentation enhance teachers'
reflection on their instructional practice? * What are effective classroom-based
strategies to document young children's science understandings? Specifically,
the project will develop multimedia documentation materials, create professional
development study groups, and conduct working conferences for participants to
explore ways in which documentation broadens educators' range of assessment
options.
