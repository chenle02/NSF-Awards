This catalyst project lays the foundation for a future NSF Science of Learning
Center that will focus on the interrelationships among mathematics, language,
and cognition in the learning process. It will examine how deaf and hard-of-
hearing students (K-12 through post-secondary education) learn mathematics as
compared to hearing peers. The operational definition of mathematics for this
project is the target learners' abilities for conceptual understanding,
procedural knowledge, and problem solving, as well as their powers to reason,
make connections, and communicate mathematical knowledge. The three primary
tasks of this catalyst project are:&lt;br/&gt;1. Proof-of-concept research.
Conduct an initial series of integrative multidisciplinary studies for a new
program of research on mathematics, language, and cognition. This effort
includes researchers from mathematics education, cognitive psychology,
linguistics, language acquisition, American Sign Language studies,
psychometrics, and ethnography, as well as mathematics
practitioners.&lt;br/&gt;2. Partnership building. Additional national and
international collaborators (researchers, practitioners, parents) will be
recruited for their expertise and breadth of perspective.&lt;br/&gt;3. Planning
for educational outreach. This task will focus primarily on bridging research to
practice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project integrates multiple research
traditions to extend current knowledge of the role of language and cognition in
mathematics learning. By studying deaf and hard-of-hearing learners'
mathematical abilities and reasoning powers, this project expects to reveal more
in-depth understanding of the relationships among language, cognition, and
mathematics learning. Findings should apply to other learner populations
including students with learning disabilities or developmental needs, second
language learners, and the general hearing student
population.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
