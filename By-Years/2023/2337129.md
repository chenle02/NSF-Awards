Microplastics, which are plastic particles less than 5 millimeters in size, are
a common pollutant that have seen widespread accumulation in the environment
since World War II. Because microplastics are solid, they represent a distinct
surface that microorganisms can colonize. In marine environments, studies have
shown that these plastic-associated microbial communities are distinct from
those that inhabit the water column. However, plastic-associated microbial
communities in freshwater environments are ubiquitous but have received
considerably less attention even though microorganisms are essential players in
nutrient cycles in all ecosystems. This study will be the first of its kind to
investigate what role microplastic accumulation may play in altering microbial
communities and, by extension, essential metabolic processes, in freshwater
environments. This project will support summer field research experiences for
three undergraduate students per summer for two summers. These field experiences
will take place at the Lacawac Sanctuary Biological Field Station and
Environmental Education Center in Pennsylvania â€” a globally recognized location
for freshwater research. In addition, students will gain experience with state-
of-the-art software programs for analyzing microbial communities as well as
learn critical programming languages used for statistical analyses.

Quantities of two microplastics (polystyrene and polyethylene terephthalate)
along with natural leaf litter will be placed within bioreactors fed with
surface water from Lake Lacawac, Pennsylvania. Undergraduate researchers will
monitor dissolved oxygen, pH, temperature, and conductivity in the bioreactors
on a weekly basis for 24 weeks. To investigate how the composition of plastic-
associated microbial communities differs from those found on natural debris,
students will collect samples of microplastics, leaf litter, and water from each
bioreactor every three weeks for 24 weeks. DNA will be extracted from each of
these samples and the investigators will amplify the 16S rRNA gene sequences
using universal (bacterial/archaeal) primers. These amplicons will be sequenced
and the phylogenetic composition of each community will be determined using
advanced statistical software. Students will produce reports from their data and
make research presentations at regional and national conferences, which will
inspire them to consider graduate studies in the future.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
