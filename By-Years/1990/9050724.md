Molecular genetics is being introduced into the laboratory component of the
undergraduate course in Genetics. Acquisition of new equipment, including a high
speed centrifuge, rotors, analytical balance, freezer, incubator,
spectrophotometer, sterilizer, shaker, and transilluminator, alleviates a major
deficiency in the curriculum. As a result of these improvements, students will
increase their reasoning skills and their understanding of modern biotechnology.
This should have a major impact on this Historically Black College. The college
is contributing an amount equal to the award.
