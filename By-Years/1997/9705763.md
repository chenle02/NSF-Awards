This research project, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
Program, focuses on the study of the coordination chemistry of odd-electron
organometallic systems and metal-olefin complexes. Professor Weber and his
students at the University Vermont will use a variety of electrochemical and
spectroelectrochemical methods together with electron paramagnetic resonance
spectroscopy in this work. The organometallic systems to be studied include
cyclopentdienyl and tris-(pyrazolyl)borate ligand complexes and these compounds
have relevance to applications involving electronic devices. Metal-olefin
complexes will be studied to better understand Ziegler-Natta catalysis and to
search for ways to enhance the reactivities of these materials. The electron
transfer properties of organometallic complexes, while extensively studied,
remain poorly correlated with the ability of these compounds to catalyze
selective molecular transformations. Odd-electron metal complexes will be the
focus of this work in order to further understanding of these reactions so that
they can be better exploited as catalysts and electronic devices.
Electrochemical and spectroscopic methods will be used in this work.
