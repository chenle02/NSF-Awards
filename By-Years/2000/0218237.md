This grant provides funding for research aiming to advance the understanding and
knowledge of wire-sawn wafer grinding on soft pads and to promote the widespread
application of the technology. Finite element simulation will be carried out to
develop a fundamental understanding of the soft-pad grinding and its
effectiveness in removing the wire-sawing induced waviness, and to generate
knowledge of the effects of pad materials and process parameters on waviness
removal. Experiments will be performed to validate the finite element model. The
understanding and knowledge acquired will provide guidance to overcome the
technical barriers that have hindered the widespread application of soft-pad
grinding. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Success of this project will substantially
enhance U.S. companies' competitiveness. Soft-pad grinding is more benign to the
environment and more cost-effective than lapping. Achieving the project's goal
will benefit not only the U.S. silicon wafer industry and semiconductor
industry, but also society at large. Investigators with complementary experience
and research skills are joining forces to conduct this research. Unique
facilities at Kansas State University, University of South Florida, MEMC, Norton
and Strasbaugh are integrated. Such collaboration provides excellent synergy for
project resources, ensures the relevance of research to industry, and expedites
technology transfer and commercialization. It also provides excellent
opportunities for faculty and students to interact with industry, and will have
highly positive impact to engineering education.&lt;br/&gt;
