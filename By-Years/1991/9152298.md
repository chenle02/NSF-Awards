The University has recently established a concentration in modern optics within
the B.S Program in Physics. Some of the basic equipment for this laboratory has
been acquired as donations from local high tech companies. At present, the major
lab equipment includes a Zygo Interferometer and Genesee Optical Design Software
for use by students. This project has as its goal a high quality education in
optics for those students going on to the Ph.D. In addition, it is benefitting
students who go directly to work for some of the local employers in Silicon
Valley. Experiments are being done in 6 areas: lens systems, fiber optics,
interferometry, holography, diffraction and Fourier optics, and polarization.
The equipment continues the modernization and improvement of the Optics
Laboratory.
