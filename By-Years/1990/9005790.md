The problems in gravitational physics to be studied can be presented under six
headings: classical gravity and cosmology, quantum cosmology, technical issues
relevant to quantization of gravity, spin and statistics of quantum particles,
dynamical change of spacetime topology, and a discrete model for spacetime.
These address very fundamental aspects of gravitation theory. More specifically,
the investigators will study: gravitational conservation laws, "topological
cosmic censorship," properties of exponentially expanding universes;
consequences of using elapsed 4-volume as a time-parameter for quantum
cosmology; the implications of coordinate and gauge invariance for different
quantization schemes, formulation of the Einstein equations on light-like hyper-
surfaces as well as at large spatial distances; a possible topological proof of
the spin-statistics correlation, and its implications for quantum gravity; field
fluctuations in spacetimes whose topology changes, the splitting off from our
universe of regions of non- trivial topology; and the possibility of adopting a
discrete model for spacetime in which the basic relation is a partial order, the
reformulation of topological and metrical notions in this framework, and the
subsequent search for a classical limit.
