The objective of this project is basic research in combinatorial mathematics
covering such topics as latin squares, quasigroups, block designs, graph
decomposition problems and related combinatorial structures. Heavy emphasis will
be placed on the conjugate invariant subgroup problem for both orthogonal and
perpendicular arrays, Mendelsohn and Steiner pentagon systems, and various types
of graph decomposition problems. Combinatorial mathematics is the study of
various problems concerning finite sets. These problems have become very
important because of their great applicability to computer research and in the
design of statistical experiments.
