9354091 Bybee BSCS will complete this project in three phases. The first phase
involves commissioning short papers on the general theme of curriculum
development. The papers will consider different questions and provide a
provocative and creative, yet scholarly, basis for the conference. Each author
will present his or her ideas in a short, editorial-length paper. The authors
for these editorials will not be from major curriculum-development groups. The
papers will be distributed prior to the conference and included in the
monograph. Figure 1 displays potential topics and authors for these commissioned
papers. Representatives from both national and local curriculum- development
groups also will prepare short editorials on their respective organizations and
the priorities, changes, and projections for the next decade. In particular,
they will address (1) their long-range organizational plans, (2) their responses
to the standards-based reform, (3) the factors that facilitate and inhibit
curriculum development, and the issues and problems they expect in the next
decade. Figures 2 and 3 display the proposed authors and organizations. ***
