This project proposes funding for SmartCloud 2017 (The 2nd IEEE International
Conference on SmartCloud 2017, http://smartcloud2017.smart-com.org) to support
undergraduate/graduate students, especially under-represented students, who are
interested in cloud computing research and pursuing cloud-related research work.
Student presenters/attendees learn a great deal by participating in this type of
academic event. SmartCoud 2017 has multiple parallel sessions with different
foci where professional presentations on recent research will be presented by
senior researchers.

There is a serious plan to recruit minority students and underrepresented
groups, engage them in the activities provided by the conference, such as panels
and workshops, and give them priority to participate when opportunities are
limited. The conference provides a valuable forum for introducing new
techniques, sharing new tools, and reviewing upcoming publications to future
potential researchers, allowing for opportunities to advance their education and
explore career development by building professional and academic social
networks.
