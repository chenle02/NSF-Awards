0216762&lt;br/&gt;Ross&lt;br/&gt;This project studies the interaction between
culture, activity-related expertise about the natural world, and the structure,
content and intra-community distribution of folk biological knowledge. The study
community is the Tzotzil Maya township of Zinacantan, Chiapas, Mexico. The
research will explore the effects of the many economic and social changes that
have occurred in the community in recent times on the distribution and content
of folk biological knowledge. Several sets of formal tasks will be accomplished
exploring the content, organization and distribution of knowledge about plants
and animals as well as local religious rituals. In addition the PI will engage
in ethnographic studies of daily life, informal interviews and surveys. The
results will be compared with data from previous studies, to assess the changes
(any observed loss of factual knowledge about the environment will be compared
to any observed loss of religious knowledge). This research will contribute to
our understanding of the nature of cognitive models in human populations, their
stability and sources of variability. The wider impacts will include the
training of local students in social science research methods.&lt;br/&gt;
