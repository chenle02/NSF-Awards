9600217 Lipschutz This proposal requests travel funds to support a joint
research project concerning computation in finitely presented groups between
Seymour Lipschutz, Temple University, and Shi Wujie, Southwest China Normal
University. Plans include participation of US students in the research visits to
China. This research is aimed at improving the computational infrastructure for
science and engineering. China has emphasized computational algebra and it is
expected that this joint research will advance US interests in an important area
of computation research.
