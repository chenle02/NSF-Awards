Direct evidence has been obtained for significant refraction of Rayleigh waves
of periods 10-100 sec propagating in the thermally mature western Pacific.
Measurements of the frequency- dependent polarization states of Rayleigh Airy
phases and early and late coda indicate that the refracted waves are
characterized by a banded spectral structure, with different signal
polarizations in each band. This banded structure may correspond to the
similarly banded frequency dependence of the sensitivity of the fundamental mode
to heterogeneity in the asthenosphere, lithosphere, crust, and perturbations to
the bathymety. If so, measurement of the frequency dependence of such
quantitites as back azimuth and the phase difference between vertical and quasi-
longitudinal components may provide discriminants for resolving the distribution
of heterogeneity, and possible anisotropy, in the crust, lid, and low-velocity
zone.
