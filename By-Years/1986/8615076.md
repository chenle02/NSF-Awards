The University of California at Irvine has several researchers who would
benefit from access to supercomputing. They will be connected by a medium speed
(56,000 baud per second) communication line to the San Diego Supercomputing
Center, which connects to the National Science Foundation Network (NSFnet). Six
federally-funded supercomputing centers can be accessed through NSFnet. This
two-year grant covers one-time charges for line installation and interface
boards in the first year, and line lease charges in both years.
