This project involves experimental studies of the effects of chemical
environments on crack propagation in geological materials. The project will
extend previous studies on quartz crystals and will initiate new experiments on
other minerals (including potassium feldspar, amphibole, muscovite mica, and
gypsum) and on polycrystalline rock samples (granite, sandstone, and marble).
Crack propagation experiments will use a constant- moment double cantilever beam
apparatus and will involve a variety of chemical surfactants chosen specifically
to elucidate the mechanisms of hydrolytic weakening. The results of these
experiments will increase our understanding of the processes of crack
propagation in natural materials and of the important role of aqueous fluids in
these processes.
