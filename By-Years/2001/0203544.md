0203544&lt;br/&gt;Hynes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This three-year award for US-UK
cooperative research in atmospheric chemistry involves Anthony J. Hynes and his
students at the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine and
Atmospheric Science and Michael J. Pilling at the University of Leeds' School of
Chemistry. The project will focus on the role of complex intermediates in
reactions of the hyroxyl radical (OH) in the atmosphere. The objective is to use
theory to examine important OH reactions in the atmosphere and use the results
to guide experimental procedures. Chemical reactions of OH and NO2 to form
nitric acid will be studied along with the role of intermediates in
recombination and impact in the troposphere and stratosphere. These reactions
are of importance to understanding ozone production and causes of air pollution.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each group brings unique complementary expertise to the
project. The US investigator is an experimentalist and the British are expert
theorists in atmospheric chemical kinetics. The project will advance doctoral
research of US students and provide research training in an international
environment. &lt;br/&gt;
