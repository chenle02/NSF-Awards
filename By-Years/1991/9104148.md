This award provides funds to cover half the cost of a CHNS-O Analyzer System
(including peripherals such as additional sample drums, organic and carbonate
carbon kit,laboratory start-up materials such as gas regulator valves for gas
tanks,gas lines,a Compu Add 3165 computer and a printer). The University of
Michigan is committed to provide funds for the other half of the cost. This
equipment will enable a large number of faculty and students to analyze
thousands of samples per year for organic and inorganic C, oxidized and reduced
S,N,H, and O. Acquisition of the CHNS-O analyzer will permit rapid, accurate
analyses of all these elements in a variety of sample types and on small, 5-10
mg samples, benefitting projects ranging from Precambrian crustal genesis to
alteration of the modern sea floor, from carbonate geochemistry to
paleooceanographic reconstructions.
