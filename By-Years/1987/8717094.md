The primary objective of the project is to develop a competitive research
proposal on "Adolescent Political Attitude Development and Engagement: A Social
Cognitive Perspective". Support of this project will assist a well trained,
Black psychologist to improve her research capability and to complete the
planning and development of a regular research proposal. The planning
activities, if successful, will significantly enhance the potential of the
investigator to compete for MRI and other research support.
