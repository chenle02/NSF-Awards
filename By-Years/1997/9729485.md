This project will study the information that chimpanzees can recall and
transmit about the nature and location of objects in outdoor environments. Four
chimpanzees will be tested. The animals are uniquely well-suited for studies of
recall memory. Three have learned visual symbols that refer to objects and
places. An experimenter will show an animal an object in an outdoor location.
The location will vary across trials. Later, in its indoor cage, the animal can
indicate to an uninformed person the location and type of object. Memory tasks
that animals solve in real-life situations will be modeled for presentation to
animals in a digital format. Animals will manipulate a joystick to make a cursor
hit targets on a monitor screen. Targets will disappear as soon as the animal
begins to move. Research questions to be addressed by these experiments are 1)
how much detail each animal retains about the relative positions of targets and
landmarks, and 2) how efficient its path is to the target. The ability to recall
and report environmental features not present to the senses is important in
human thinking and communication, but to date there are almost no data on recall
memory capabilities in nonverbal animals.
