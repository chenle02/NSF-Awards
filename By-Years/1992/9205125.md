Theoretical research will be undertaken on preroughening and reconstruction
transitions in crystal surfaces, and the connection between this and valence
bond phases in quantum spin systems. The emergence of the first experimental
evidence for preroughening opens up an array of important theoretical questions.
For instance, what is the influence of the interplay between preroughening and
reconstruction in certain facets of face centered cubic crystals; what about the
roughness of disordered flat phases during growth. Roughening induced
deconstruction transitions have a chiral character and are governed by a new
discrete invariance related to super symmetry. %%% The study of surfaces, and
the transitions which take place on them, is of fundamental importance and has
many technological applications. The proposed research deals with studies of
novel phase transitions on surfaces and their relationship to more exotic types
of interacting systems.
