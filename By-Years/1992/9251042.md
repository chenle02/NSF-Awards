Statistical Computing Laboratory Mathematics, engineering, and computer science
majors at Tri- State University are analyzing real-life statistical data
relating to environmental concerns of the area's surrounding lakes. By using
networked IBM compatible microcomputers and statistical software, students in
the calculus-based probability and statistics sequence are better understanding
statistical principles and methods. The project involves several individual
experiments and one group project for each course. Each group is presenting
their results orally in class and also completing a written report. While all
groups within the course are working on the same project, individual groups are
presenting different approaches to the problem. This experience of analyzing the
problem, followed by analyzing the data, and then applying this procedure to
actual environmental situations is good preparation for college graduates who
will face problem-solving as young professional scientists and engineers.
