9416321 Wells The Puente Hills, in the eastern Los Angeles Basin, are the
surface expression of the Santa Monica Mountains - Elysian Park anticlinorium
which is forming the response to movement on blind thrust ramps. This study will
address the likelihood of the entire fault rupturing simultaneously, in one very
large earthquake event, or in several smaller events of Northridge- type, or in
numerous small events of Whittier-Narrows-type. By analysis of Quaternary
sediments in three meandering rivers that cross the structure and that contain
alternating coarse sand and organic-rich beds, it will be possible to determine
and compare the timing of past deformation events on the Puente Hills thrust
ramp. The research will involve analyses at two distinct scales using oil and
water well logs and fluvial and marine terrace deposits, and high- precision
radiocarbon dating and logging of boreholes excavated specifically for this
project. The results will provide constraints on the timing and magnitude of
past earthquakes connected with the Santa Monica Mountains - Elysian Park
anticlinorium.
