This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program
provides continued support for research on metal-metal interactions by Dr.
Dennis L. Lichtenberger of the Chemistry Department, University of Arizona.
Systems under investigation contain quadruple and triple metal-metal bonds,
metal-metal configurations beyond occupation of the anti-bonding delta orbital,
and non-bonding and weakly-associated through-space and through-ligand metal-
metal interactions. The metal-metal complexes contain a variety of bridging and
non-bridging ligands and represent a broad range of electron-donating and
electron-withdrawing effects associated with key structural perturbations.
Complexes with both weak and strong ligands coordinated to the axial position
are also included. High-resolution HeI/HeII valence and high precision X-ray
core photoelectron spectroscopy will be used to study both gas phase and
condensed species. The project includes further development of instrumental
capabilities. Metal-metal interactions contribute to the structure, stability,
and reactivity of many species and influence important chemical, catalytic, and
materials processes. Unique instrumentation will be developed to provide
detailed electronic structure information on these interactions
