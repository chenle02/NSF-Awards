This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project focuses on the need to
measure the thickness of thin films accurately and rapidly in the semiconductor
industry. Currently, this is accomplished only in specialized laboratories using
attachments to general purpose x-ray diffractometers. This approach requires
highly skilled personnel and extremely lengthy experimental times. The objective
of this research is to examine the feasibility and design of an Angular
Dispersive X-Ray system to allow for rapid, routine measurement of the thickness
of thin films. The research will consist of fixturing components into an angular
dispersive configuration, measuring and evaluating data referenced to standards,
and ascertaining accuracy and precision. The results of this process will be to
finalize a design consistent with ease of operation, clean room compatibility
and Sematech standards.
