In this project, TERC and the American Geological Institute have distilled the
Earth science curriculum down to the essential knowledge and skills by focusing
on the core ideas of the discipline, which they call the "big ideas of science."
The approach is based on "Understanding by Design" and aims to help teachers
cover less material but do so more thoroughly and with the learning goals
clearly in mind. It includes two-week summer institutes in content and pedagogy,
trial teaching with peer observations and two mini conferences. Materials are
developed to help middle school teachers use the freely-available scientific
visualizations from NASA, NOAA, USGS and others. Two years of middle school
field tests for the materials will be done in New England. In the third year,
staff developers will work with ten districts to field test a handbook and
launch "Earth Science by Design" in their districts.

The deliverables include the Handbook, the website and at least 120 hours of
inservice experiences for 250 teachers. The materials will be disseminated by
print and on the World Wide Web. They will be complete, containing everything
needed by school districts, museums and others to institute professional
development programs for middle school science teachers to be entitled "Earth
Science by Design."
