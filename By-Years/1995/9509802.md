9509802 One of the outstanding problems in ecological and evolutionary
physiology is understanding the mechanisms by which major new features evolve.
In particular, when we see the same adaptation in two or more unrelated species,
we may ask the fundamental question "Do those species utilize the same
physiological and genetic mechanisms to solve their adaptive problem, or do they
use different mechanistic solutions to achieve the same adaptive solution?". An
answer to this question is needed if we are to understand how organisms adapt to
changing environments. To address this question, this research will use a model
group of salamander species from Mexico and the US that have altered their
physiological pathway to metamorphosis: some species go through a normal
metamorphosis, while others forego metamorphosis and complete their lives as
sexually mature, aquatic larval animals. Several strategies, ranging from
molecular analyses of the genes responsible for metamorphosis, to administering
hormones that regulate metamorphic completion, will be used to determine the
mechanism used to achieve this ecologically important life-history shift in six
different species of salamander. If the mechanism is the same in all species,
this will indicate that there is essentially only one physiological and genetic
mechanism by which this life-history shift can evolve, and all species have
independently evolved the same solution. Alternatively, if different mechanisms
are involved, there will be compelling evidence that truly independent solutions
to the same adaptive problem can and do occur during evolution of closely
related species. The research will introduce a novel approach for studying key
adaptations, where both phylogenetic and molecular perspectives are
simultaneously treated within a comparative, mechanistic framework. It will
establish a case study linking ecological, physiological, and genetic levels of
causation. The data will increase our understanding of the processes of
evolution and the origin of biological diversity.
