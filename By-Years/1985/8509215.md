A biaxial material testing system will be purchased for performing experimental
research in plasticity and fracture of materials. The equipment system is
essential for the completion of the thermal relaxation testing in polymeric and
metallic materials. The biaxial testing system will enhance the experimental
verification capability for material relaxation analysis.
