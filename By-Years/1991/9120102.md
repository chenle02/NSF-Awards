Research centers on bound states in QED and QCD through the study of spectra,
decays and production. Major effort will be on the Lamb shift in hydrogen with
the goal of extracting the .2(Z.)5m contribution thus completing the calculation
to about 1 kHz accuracy. Work will also be initiated on heavy quark/anti-quark
systems including relativistic and coupled channel effects. Leptonic widths and
production processes for charmonium will be calculated and finally, QCD
corrections to the production of > states examined.
