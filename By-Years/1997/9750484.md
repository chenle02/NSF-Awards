This project is designing and implementing a student laboratory to accompany a
theme-oriented sophomore-level modern physics course. The curriculum is based on
topics associated with four major developments in modern physics: relativity,
statistical physics, chaos and quantum mechanics. These developments share two
features that provide a conceptual and organizational theme for the course: (1)
they are characterized by the fact that they introduce fundamental limitations
on people's ability to acquire knowledge of the physical world, and (2) these
limitations have necessitated the development of new mathematical and conceptual
tools for evaluating knowledge and describing observations. While the laboratory
emphasizes the use of measurement instrumentation, a variety of computers and
software is also being used for simulations, data analysis, and problemsolving.
The experiments described herein are interdisciplinary and are intended to
foster creativity as well as impart information and develop experimental
technique. The modern physics course serves the role as a bridge between the
introductory courses and the more advanced physics courses. The laboratory is
intended to serve similarly as a link between the instruction-driven
introductory laboratory and the less structured research laboratory.
