Maintaining user privacy in a computerized world is a difficult challenge.
Private Information Retrieval (PIR) schemes allow a user to retrieve a piece of
information replicated among several servers without disclosing the precise
nature of that information to each individual server. The aim of this project is
to develop new techniques for constructing such protocols with improved
efficiency. In a recent breakthrough, the PI introduced a new technique that
dramatically reduced the cost of the best PIR protocols. The main goals of the
projects are to develop this technique further and to understand better the
underlying mathematics that make it work. Pursuing the research goals of the
project will require integration of research and education and training of
gradate and undergraduate students. The PI will also contribute to education of
high school students, including those from under-represented groups, by
participating in a computer science summer school program.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PIR protocols guarantee information theoretic privacy in
the setting where the same database is replicated among several non-
communicating servers. The most interesting case is that of two servers (the
smallest possible). The current state of the art (obtained in a recent work by
the PI) gives sub-polynomial communication cost, improving the two-decades long
record requiring communication proportional to the cube root of the database
size. The improvement comes from leveraging the connection between PIR and
Locally Decodable Codes (LDCs) which are error correcting codes that allow for
quick correction of a single codeword position by querying the code in only a
few places. The main goals of this project are to further study these two
objects (PIR and LDCs) and to improve their known constructions. On the other
hand, the project will aim to understand the limitation of PIR and LDCs in the
form of provable lower bounds on their efficiency.
