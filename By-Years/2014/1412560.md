This project is aimed at a mathematical and computational investigation of how
waves, particularly optical and electronic waves, propagate through novel and
complex media. This work connects directly with recent intense activity in the
fundamental and applied and engineering physics communities in the field of
metamaterials. Metamaterials are composite media whose emergent macroscopic
properties (refractive index, conductivity, and others) are very unusual and are
not achievable in individual microscopic constituents of the composite. For
example, a straw in a glass filled with a negative refractive index fluid will
appear bending backwards. The recently designed metamaterials with negative
refractive index may have a broad variety of applications from super-lenses to
cloaking covers that make objects covered by the cloak "invisible." The ability
to fabricate such micro- and nano-structured media with great precision has
inspired the theoretical community to help predict the properties of this new
class of materials. The goal of the principal investigator is, building on his
previous work in linear and nonlinear wave phenomena, to further develop hybrid
mathematical and computational analysis that will predict the properties of and
give insight into optimization of complex microstructures.

In his study of complex media and metamaterials, the principal investigator will
focus on the following mathematical problems at the nexus of applied Partial
Differential Equations, Mathematical Analysis, Spectral Theory, Asymptotic
Analysis and Optimization: (A) Linear and nonlinear waves in honeycomb and other
novel structures (B) Waves in periodic structures perturbed by localized defects
and randomness, and bifurcation from the continuum of localized defect modes
into spectral gaps (C) Dynamics of coherent structures in discrete and
continuous nonlinear wave systems and (D) Control of wave phenomena with
microstructure and metamaterials
