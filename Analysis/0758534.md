This project addresses fundamental questions at the intersection of several
complex variables and partial differential equations. Two thrusts concern global
regularity and compactness of the d-bar-Neumann operator in a domain. The
principal investigator has recently developed a theory that unifies the known
positive results concerning global regularity that is expected to provide an
important step towards a desired characterization of this property in terms of
properties of the boundary of the domain. It is not known how far the known
potential theoretic sufficient conditions for compactness of the d-bar-Neumann
operator are from being necessary. Building on his recent work with a graduate
student (S. Munasinghe) that provides a different approach, the investigator
will seek to characterize compactness. A third thrust of the project initiates a
new direction of research: the available evidence suggests that regularity
properties of the d-bar-Neumann operator in a domain should have positive
implications for the existence of a Stein neighborhood basis of the closure of
the domain. The fourth thrust results from a collaboration of the investigator
with the postdoctoral researcher A. Raich, in which he and the principal
investigator showed that the classical sufficient conditions for compactness of
the operators in the interior of a domain (with a necessary modification) also
yield compactness of the operators on the boundary. The goal is to combine their
methods with earlier methods of the investigator to show that finite type
implies subellipticity on the boundary.

The study of analysis in several complex variables is motivated both by the
centrality of the subject to mathematics and by its usefulness. For example, one
of the central laws of nature, causality, when transcribed via a mathematical
device called the Fourier transform, leads immediately to analytic functions of
several (in this case four) complex variables. Partial differential equations,
on the other hand, arise in all areas of science that deal with systems that
change over time: physics, engineering, economics, biology, meteorology,
environmental sciences, and others. This project is thus located on the basic
research end at the intersection of two areas of mathematics that are central to
the scientific and technological enterprise. It will impact human resources
development directly through funding for graduate students and through the
investigator's supervision of postdoctoral researchers, and indirectly through
the investigator's organization of and participation in workshops/conferences
and through his expository writing.
