Arizona State University The objective of this investigation is to examine the
downstream impacts of large dams on the nation's rivers. In particular the PI
wishes to develop new knowledge about how dam installation and operation have
affected the characteristics of river channels and riparian environments.
Specific questions include the temporal and spatial distributions of stream
power downstream in relation to scale and engineering characteristics of dams,
as well as, operating rules. In addition the geographic effects of distributions
of stream power will be assessed from the perspectives of channel width, flood
plain dimensions, channel patterns and near channel landforms, and spatial
distributions of riparian ecosystems. The strategy is to compare present
conditions on experimental river reaches that have been impacted by dams with
nearby similar control reaches that are without such structures for up to 42 of
the largest dams in the country. Methods of investigation focus on hydrologic
analyses of streamflow data using statistical techniques, geographic analyses of
aerial photographic images using GIS, and field investigations to collect
sediment and vegetation data. The project will advance present fluvial theory
for impounded rivers for such theory is in its infancy and does not include
generalizations about the range of hydrologic and geomorphic impacts of dams.
From an applied perspective the work will provide new information on the effect
of rivers on critical habitat.
