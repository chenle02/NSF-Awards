Photovoltaics is a broad field that spans materials to systems and includes
mature technologies like crystalline silicon, new ones like organic solar cells,
and exploratory, third generation concepts. Success requires contributions from
chemistry and materials science, to device design and characterization, to
manufacturing and system level considerations. Theory, modeling, and simulation
is well-established in photovoltaics, but the field is fragmented according to
the interests and disciplines of researchers and the technologies being explored
and lacks the critical mass to be effective. The workshop, Challenges in
Photovoltaic Science, Technology, and Manufacturing: A workshop on the role of
theory, modeling, and simulation will provide an opportunity for researchers
from academia, industry, and the national laboratories to identify ways to
advance the field of photovoltaics. Multiscale modeling and simulation is a
pervasive challenge in science and engineering. Addressing this challenge for
photovoltaics, will contribute to success in other disciplines. The workshop
will identify models for universities to collaborate across disciplines and for
universities and companies to pursue collaborative research that will have broad
impact beyond photovoltaics.
