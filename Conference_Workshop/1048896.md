This project funds travel awards to support six U.S. based researchers to
participate in the Special Session on Algebra and Model Theory at the First
International Meeting of the American Mathematical Society and the Sociedad de
Matematica de Chile in Pucon, Chile, December 15-18, 2010. Preference will be
given to participants who are Ph.D. students or are researchers who earned their
Ph.D.'s within the last 8-10 years and have limited or no other means of travel
support. It is hoped that the Special Session and a possible satellite meeting
will provide for extensive interaction between U.S. and South American logicians
beyond already well-established research contacts and display the vitality of
logic in South America to the broader South American mathematical community.

The Association for Symbolic Logic, which will administer the project, is the
leading international professional society for logicians, whose membership
includes researchers in computer science, cognitive science, linguistics,
mathematics, and philosophy. It organizes and sponsors a number of important
meetings throughout the world. Increasing the visibility and presence of logic
outside North America and Europe, particularly in Latin America and Asia, is one
of the Association's highest long-term priorities. The Association, through its
activities and publications, also actively seeks to embrace new and emerging
fields in which logic has come to play an important role, including computer
science, linguistics, and cognitive science. Further information on the
Association may be found on its web site: http://www.aslonline.org.
