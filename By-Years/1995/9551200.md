Like many other professions, landscape architecture and horticulture require a
great amount of attribute collection, data inventory, analysis, and design. In
the past few years, major emphasis has been placed on the integration of
computer aided design (CAD) and geographic information system (GIS) into the
university's undergraduate teaching curriculum. Our students are able to use
these technological advances to build site inventories and implement their
design solutions. Four innovative experiments in the university's undergraduate
basic curriculum are investigating the real-time experience of gathering
information on-site and collaborating site data with hands-on experience in
computer software. Global positioning system (GPS) satellites provide digital
coordinates and elevation information for any location on the earth. Along with
a data-logger, this system is an efficient tool for data collection and data
input in the field. Students perform on-site design scenario presentations to
clients. The university's landscape architecture and horticulture program is
utilizing GPS technology in conjunction with GIS and CAD in undergraduate
teaching. This project is also improving the current practice of teaching by
introducing an innovative mobile lab concept with on-site data collection,
terrain model construction, design emulation, and client communication.
