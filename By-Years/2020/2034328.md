The next-generation Very Large Array (ngVLA) is a potential future large-scale
radio astronomy project, envisioned to be an interferometer for wavelengths from
2.5 to 250mm. The National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) is developing
plans for the design, construction, and operations of the ngVLA 18-m antenna as
the building block of next generation centimeter (cm) and millimeter (mm) radio
astronomy. The prototype antenna will provide cost information and insight into
modern designs and materials for precise cm-mm antennae. This award supports the
design, construction, commissioning and performance testing of the ngVLA
prototype antenna in New Mexico.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NRAO will leverage a large
body of documentation already created for the management of ngVLA, as well as
provide appropriate oversight. To allow the ngVLA to deliver an order of
magnitude improvement in both sensitivity and angular resolution requires
developing the next-generation antenna through this award. The creation and
detailed testing of this antenna also helps to transfer technical advancements
in other industries into radio astronomy facilities and research infrastructure.
Because ngVLA needs 244 antennae, the antenna and its electronics must be
optimized for manufacturability, volume production, and low maintenance, in
order to minimize the total lifecycle cost. This low-cost, high-performance
cm/mm antenna platform enables more than future radio telescopes, including
potentially significant improvements in spacecraft downlink capabilities and
southern-hemisphere extensions of celestial and terrestrial reference frame
measurements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
