ABSTRACT

An important aspect of complex analysis concerns inequalities on absolute values
of holomorphic functions or, more generally, on norms of holomorphic mappings.
In recent work the proposer has developed a systematic approach to this subject.
He has given a complex variables analogue of Hilbert's 17th problem, applied the
techniques to proper holomorphic mappings, and (with Catlin) proved an isometric
imbedding theorem for holomorphic vector bundles. Also he has recently written a
Carus Monograph entitled "Inequalities from Complex Analysis", thereby laying a
foundation for more work in this area. The current proposal describes how to
expand these research directions and discusses possible mathematical
applications.

Although the proposal focuses on pure mathematics, one can imagine the
application to the sciences of some of this work. For example, in Quantum
Mechanics, an observable is a self-adjoint (Hermitian) operator on a Hilbert
space. The proposal allows for a more general approach, by describing a notion
of self-adjointness for non-linear mappings. One of the main ideas of the
proposer's work has been to describe various notions of positivity for such
mappings. Several new conditions arise; these conditions are equivalent in the
linear case from Quantum Mechanics, but distinct in general, and therefore may
lead to applications in physics. In particular the proposer hopes to develop
applications of the non-linear analogue of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.
