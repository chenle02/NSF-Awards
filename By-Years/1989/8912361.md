The goal of this project is to investigate a concept for increasing the
transfer speed for parts, tooling, raw material, etc. in manufacturing systems
by more than an order of magnitude. The basis of the high speed transfer is a
continuous, closed structural loop transfer system with a number of high-speed,
direct-drive, linear induction motor (LIM) transfer vehicles which continuously
circulate in a guideway. The vehicles would accelerate at up to 4 g and travel
at speeds of 60 to 120 Km/hr, compared to the 1 to 8 manufacturing processing
equipment via access ports which use direct, non-contact, electromagnetic
steering to divert vehicles from the loop. The investigation includes a
demonstration of feasibility for a limited scale transfer system. The impact of
the transfer system concept on factory layout, production scheduling, and
production costs would be significant. Furthermore, the results will be directly
applicable in future research and development in the area of high-performance
electromagnetic actuators for manufacturing and robotics. It will also advance
the state of the art of high-performance control of extremely highly distributed
actuators and systems.
