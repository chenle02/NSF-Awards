This action will provide continued support to a group from Michigan State
University consisting of three senior members, two post-docs, four graduate
students and two technical associates working in elementary particle physics.
Later in the grant period the group is expected to complete a Fermilab fixed-
target experiment (E706) testing the currently accepted theory of the strong
interactions, quantum-chromo-dynamics. They will embark on a new program, "The
Collider Detector Facility (CDF)", at Fermilab. The E706 experimental program
involves a continuation of the analysis of the data from its 1989-88 run and
preparation for two additional runs, the first to begin in early 1990. Three
graduate students are expected to receive their Ph.D degrees based on the
analysis of the E706 data. The CDF experimental program will phase-in as the
E706 results mature.
