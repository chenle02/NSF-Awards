Applied Computer Security Associates, Inc. (ACSA), the sponsor of the Annual
Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC) requested funding to support
undergraduate and graduate students attendance at the 25th ACSAC, to be held
December 7-11 2009.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ACSAC conference, currently
celebrating its 25th anniversary, is a top-tier academic security conference
which averages about 200 highly skilled security professional attendees per
year. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ACSAC regularly brings together the foremost minds
in academic, governmental and commercial computer security to both address the
most pressing problems in applied computer security, as well discuss seminal
works in Computer Security. Besides our keynotes (the "Invited Essayist" and
"Distinguished Practitioner"), in 2000, ACSAC introduced the "Classic Papers"
series, in which two or three authors of seminal papers in computer security are
invited to update those papers and present lessons learned. These papers,
available free on the ACSAC web site, familiarize a new generation of students
with key security research developments of the past, and provide a valuable
resource for undergraduate and graduate instruction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSF
funding will provide worthy students with an opportunity to meet and interact
with notable figures at the conference, whose past attendees have included
luminaries such as Whitfield Diffie (Sun), Stephanie Forrest (U of New Mexico),
Brian Snow (NSA), Steve Lipner (Microsoft), Gene Spafford (Purdue), Peter
Neumann (SRI), and Steve Bellovin (Columbia). There have been many examples
where speakers at ACSAC have been seen "holding class" with attendees after the
formal session has ended.
