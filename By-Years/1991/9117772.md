Comprehensive petrological studies of regionally metamorphosed rocks from the
Grenville orogen will provide detailed P-T-t paths for the different tectonic
units in the orogen. New petrological techniques for the analysis of single-
grain, zoned, refractory phases will be refined and calibrated during this
study. The results will aid the tectonic reconstruction of the middle crustal
section of the Grenville orogen, and will have wide applicability to metamorphic
terranes in other orogenic belts.
