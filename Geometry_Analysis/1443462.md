The award provides support for participants to the Current Developments in
Mathematics Conference series that will take place at the Science Center of
Harvard University on the following dates: November 21-22, 2014 November 20-21,
2015 November 18-19, 2016. The Current Developments in Mathematics conference
has been taking place yearly since 1995 at Harvard University and brings
together mathematicians from all over the world during the weekend preceding
Thanksgiving.

The speakers of the Current Developments in Mathematics conference are invited
to report on recent breakthroughs in various fields of mathematics and closely
related disciplines, which are expected to impact mathematical research. The
timeliness and importance of the conference is particularly manifest this year,
2014, since two of the confirmed invited speakers have very recently been
awarded the Fields Medal, the most prestigious distinction in mathematics. This
conference provides an opportunity for a large audience of young students,
researchers and specialists to get familiar with recent mathematical
achievements, to obtain new ideas, to interact with each other and forge new
collaborations. The conference has been further very successful in hosting the
participants in the Boston mathematics community; allowing them to further their
careers, get to know experts in their fields and foster new collaborations in an
informal atmosphere. The conference provides the participants with a broader
research overview, which should be of significance for their own mathematical
work.

The conference is advertised widely so that many students and young researchers
can attend it. The format of the conference has been very successful. The
speakers are usually asked to divide their lectures into two parts, one of which
is intended to be accessible to a broader audience and giving a general idea of
the recent work and the other part containing more details. This endeavor is a
challenge that the speakers have mastered very well in the past. In a time where
research in mathematics and other fields becomes more and more specialized it is
of great importance to make the effort to maintain an overview of the grand
scheme of things. The conference can be thus regarded as an intensive two-day
colloquium style overview of many exciting developments. The results presented
at the conference are collected in manuscripts beforehand and are distributed to
the participants during the conference. The proceedings are later published.
