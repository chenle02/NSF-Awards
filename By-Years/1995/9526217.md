9526217 Pocanic Research will be carried out in experimental nuclear physics.
The central activity is a high precision pion beta-decay experiment which will
be performed at the Paul Scherer Institute in Switzerland. This measurement will
provide new limits on possible other generations of quarks and leptons. Research
will also be carried out at LAMPF, studying pion-pion interactions needed as
critical input in tests of chiral perturbation theory, at SLAC, in the area of
spin structure function measurements, and at CEBAF, including work on nucleon
structure and phi-meson physics. Development work will be carried out for the
purpose of producing a fast, high-resolution detector system suitable for the
pion beta decay experiment's high data rates. Research in the above areas will
advance our understanding of the underlying quark model of nucleons and mesons.
These topics are among the most exciting in nuclear physics. Education of
graduate students and postdocs is integral to this activity, as is development
and construction of major state-of-the-art equipment ***
