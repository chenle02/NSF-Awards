DMI-9628984 Sutherland This effort is focused on research related to
environmental issues associated with machining processes. The research
emphasizes characterizing the role of cutting fluids in machining with the goal
of fluid reduction/elimination. In order to eliminate, or in the short term
reduce the environmental impact of cutting fluids, a better understanding of the
role and function of cutting fluids is required, including the effects of fluid
concentration, flow rate, pressure, and point of application. One negative
aspect of cutting fluid use is mist formation. Research to characterize the
mechanisms associated with mist formation is being undertaken. The effects of
cutting fluids in terms of heat transfer and lubrication are also being
examined. A teaching effort is also underway that includes the development of
courses in environmentally conscious manufacturing.
