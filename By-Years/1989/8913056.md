The proposed research will extend the optical technique of generating and
detecting coherent ultrahigh frequency ultrasonics from the 100 GHz range to the
THz range. The generation of THz waves will be accomplished by using
specifically engineered quantum-well structures of alternating AlGaAs and GaAs
layers. This quantum-well structure will be designed to be a static image of a
sound field. Subpicosecond optical excitation of hot electron and hole carriers
and subsequent non-radiative relaxation of the carriers in the pattern
prescribed by the quantum well structure will lead to selective excitation of
coherent acoustic waves with the same wavelength as the well period. The
structures will be designed to provide acoustic wavelengths corresponding to THz
frequencies. The detection of the acoustic wave amplitude will be accomplished
by using a specifically designed single quantum well layer (optical detector
layer) to follow the acoustic strain amplitude through the modulation of the
exciton resonance. Theoretical modelling of the optically driven strain fields,
through both non-radiative relaxation and photostriction effects, will be
carried out in parallel with the experimental studies. The propagation and
transmission of these high frequency acoustics at interfaces and within the
periodic well structure will also be treated. This work will provide an all
optical acoustic transducer, compatible with diode pumped micro laser sources,
as a future generation of acoustic devices for imaging.
