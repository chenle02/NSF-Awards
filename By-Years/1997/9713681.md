This starter grant award of the Chemistry Division to the University of Houston
supports the research of Professor Eric R. Bittner. The theme of the research is
simulation of quantum energy transfer dynamics in disordered systems and
glasses. Using a mixed quantum/classical molecular dynamical approach, the
details of quantum energy transfer between individual chromophoric sites
imbedded in a cold inert supporting matrix are probed. The simulations allow
investigation of various quantum energy transfer phenomena in a disordered
system while maintaining an explicit description of the molecular motions of the
system. Computational methods based upon quantum surface hopping dynamics are
extended to include necessarily large numbers of mobile quantum sites needed to
simulate these systems. This research advances the fundamental understanding of
energy transport and relaxation dynamics of disordered materials. Simulations
using methods developed in this work provide an accurate molecular level
description of disordered systems.
