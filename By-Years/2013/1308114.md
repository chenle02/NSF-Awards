With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging (CMI) program in the
Division of Chemistry, Professor Yu Xia and her group at Purdue University
expand the capability of mass spectrometry to study radical ions derived from
biomolecules, which are significantly under-explored as compared to even
electron ions. New methods and instrumentation will be developed to form diverse
types of peptide radical ions in gas-phase and extract their chemical property
information including structures and intrinsic reactivity. New analytical
approaches based on peptide radical ion chemistry will be explored for protein
structural characterization.

Professor Xia proposes to study how radicals and ions interact with each other.
The gained knowledge will provide insight on the fate of protein radical
intermediates resulted from oxidative stress, which has been shown to be related
to various biological processes, including aging and neurodegeneration. The
proposed research and education activities will also establish fertile training
ground for both graduate and undergraduate students with exposure to scientific
instrumentation, reaction mechanisms, and bio-analysis. Broadening participation
of female students and students from underrepresented groups will be one of the
focuses of the proposed educational component.
