The objective of this research project is to experimentally demonstrate a
mechanically-controllable single-electron transistor which is resolved by
Coulomb blockade. The approach consists of a set of activities involving: (1)
developing a nanoscale AlGaAs/InGaAs beam resonator with an electrically
isolated metallic quantum dot at the end and a two dimensional electron gas
embedded in the beam by utilizing a series of processing technologies including
electron beam lithography, wet and dry etching, metallization and deposition;
(2) investigating the beam resonant excitation capacitively coupled by high
frequency AC signals and enhanced by piezoelectric effects; (3) demonstrating
Coulomb blockade on the fabricated electromechanical single electron transistors
at the GHz frequency range using improved RF testing technologies. The proposed
nanomechanical electron shuttle devices promise to be extremely fast and
ultrahighly sensitive devices for sensor and communication applications and are
ideal candidates for fundamental research in electron-phonon coupling in
nanoelectromechnical systems. This new class of nanoelectromechanical devices
will allow quantum limited displacement sensing, as well as charge and mass
detection. The devices will provide a revolution in applications in future
communications, quantum computers, precision measurement and standard, and DNA
decoding. Moreover, the interdisciplinary nature of the proposed research offers
graduate and undergraduate students a great training opportunity in
nanostructure processing, device testing at RF and microwave frequencies, and
quantum mechanics-based theoretical modeling and simulation. Research findings
and discoveries will be incorporated into the principle investigator's course,
"Nano-scale Structures and Devices" to improve and enrich the course.
