Several approaches to making automated reasoning systems more effective will be
investigated. The Prolog Technology Theorem Prover (PTTP) has been developed as
a logically and search-space complete extension of Prolog with an exceptionally
high inference rate that permits it to solve shallow theorem-proving problems
very rapidly. The use of PTTP in a subordinate role in conventional resolution
theorem provers will be explored. PTTP can be used to implement the theory
resolution or linked inference principle procedures, fast refutation checks for
newly derived clauses, E-unification, and sort reasoning. A Prolog-like
abductive reasoning system has been developed in PTTP and has been used for
pragmatic processing of sentences in a system for text understanding. More
abstract formulations of the PTTP's abductive reasoning method will be developed
and studied with the objective of improving the performance of the system and
enabling it to make better choices about which abductive explanation is best.
Ohlbach's approach to modal reasoning is compatible with conventional resolution
theorem provers, since it transforms modal formulas to classical formulas with
extra world-path arguments that denote the modal prefix. Special unification
algorithms for world paths, which depend on the modal accessibility relation,
are then used. A partial implementation of this approach has been developed and
will be refined and investigated. The approach promises to preserve the
investment of developing resolution systems while proving theorems in modal
logic. A case-splitting rule for resolution will be developed. For non- Horn
problems with some derived ground literals, it will combine the generality of
the resolution procedure and the case-splitting behavior and performance of the
Davis-Putnam procedure on propositional problems.
