ECS-9705839 Ying Liu A three year activity is being undertaken during which
time, Professors Liu and Schlom will study epitaxial La-doped SrTiO3 and related
films deposited on YBCO, with the goal of fabricating reproducible Josephson
junction devices using a novel double ramp design. The PIs focus their proposal
on growing and characterising the material, and have teamed with a researcher at
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (Kleinsasser) who will provide the device
expertise necessary to impact high Tc electronic device applications.
