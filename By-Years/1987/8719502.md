The Principal Investigators' will perform a set of benchmarks of high-
performance advanced-architecture computers on a total of nine scientific
programs spanning many fields and algorithms. The Principal Investigators' use
the CRAY-XMP as a yardstick and compare this to the leading commercially
available parallel machines including the hypercube, and other distributed
memory, VLIW and Shared Memory architectures. The study will involve leading
computational scientists in each field and experts in specific machine
architectures. These will be interfaced by groups at Caltech and at the San
Diego Supercomputer Center, San Diego, experienced on using and optimizing
implementations on vector and parallel computers. This will be a one-year pilot
project that will develop methodology for larger scale performance evaluation
for advanced architecture computers and begin to gather the data needed to
compare the price-performance of emerging supercomputer architectures with that
of current supercomputers. The Program Director for Computational Science and
Engineering recommends support in the sum of $195,700 for a period of one year.
