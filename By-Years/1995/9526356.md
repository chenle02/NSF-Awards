9526356 Altabet The authors propose to explore the potential of stable nitrogen
isotopes in marine sediments as tracers of past nitrate utilization, and hence
of primary production. They will examine the difference between water-column and
surface sediment ratios, explore the feasibility of analyzing organic material
in the matrices of individual microfossils, and will examine a typical sediment
record from the equatorial Pacific to determine whether the changes seen from
glacial to interglacial periods might be only an artifact of differential
preservation.
