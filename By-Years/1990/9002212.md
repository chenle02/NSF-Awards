This is a SGER project to collect and to study the perishable earthquake and
structural response/damage data due to the October 17, 1989 Loma Prieta
earthquake. Perishable site soil data by in-situ borehole/geophone experiments
and dynamic property data of reinforced concrete members by laboratory tests of
field samples will be collected, and evaluated. Soil damping, shear modules, and
nonlinear soil stress-strain relationship will be determined. Using the basic
data of soil and concrete, a dynamic analysis of the double deck bridge
structures will be carried out. The California Department of Transportation will
provide design blue prints and soil log charts of the bridge-sites to assist the
study. The effort will lead to better understanding the effect of local soil to
the structural response and improved understanding of failure causes of the
bridge structures of the I-880 viaduct.
