Dr. Popp proposes to acquire a gas chromatography-combustion interface through
this grant. This unit will be part of a mass spectrometer system requested
through a proposal (91-17610) to the Division of Earth Sciences (EAR). The
equipment requested will provide the ability to analyze carbon, oxygen,
nitrogen, sulfur, and hydrogen isotopic compounds. To-date, this type of
equipment has not been widely applied for oceanographic research. Matching funds
from the University of Hawaii will be provided to purchase the entire system.
This proposal offers a chance to apply a new technology and opens the technology
for shared-use among many oceanographers. As one reviewer stated "This is a
modest request of Ocean Sciences and one which will pay many returns".
