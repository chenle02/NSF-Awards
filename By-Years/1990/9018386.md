The time is ripe for a review of the progress in marine chemistry. Ths is
particularly true with the advent of global change issues. Such issues like the
exchange of greenhoue gases with ocean or availability of trace micro nutrients
in limiting primary productivity depend fundamentally on the physical chemistry
of sea water. The American Chemical Society has long been a champion of the
bright of marine chemistry as a new field of applied chemistry. At its 200th
annual meeting, the ACS has chosen to recognize marine chemistry by holding a
symposium on Progress in Marine Chemistry. The symposium will be sponsored by
the Geochemistry Division of ACS and will be held August 27 and 28 in
Washington, DC. The Geochemistry Division will also take the opportunity of
honoring the contribution of Professor Edward D. Goldberg to marine chemistry
during his long and productive career.
