9320974 Wedel This project involves a cultural anthropologist from George
Washington University in a study of the process of foreign aid in five
democratizing countries of Eastern Europe. The investigators will study three
state factories in Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, and two state farms
in Romania and Albania as they deal with foreign advisers and aid institutions
in their effort to get help in privatizing their production. The anthropologists
will focus on the ideology, politics and bureaucratic organization of aid in
donor societies as well as the dynamic relations involved as donors and
recipients negotiate their way towards large-scale technical assistance. Using
ethnographic techniques of in-depth interviews and participant observation,
fieldwork in factories and farms in Eastern Europe will be coupled with
interviews and observations at U.S., E.C., and joint East-West meetings where
aid policies are formulated. This research is important because the
democratizing process taking place in the former Communist countries of Eastern
Europe is one of the major events of our time, and its success is critically
important to world peace and prosperity. The actual implementation of
international aid programs is not a one-way street of expertise flowing out of
the First World into the ex- Second World, but a complex process of negotiation.
Increased understanding of the actual behavior involved in foreign aid, and how
different perceptions and understandings of each other, different goals and
political agendas, and different practices all influence aid outcomes, will be
important in structuring future relations between First and ex-Second Worlds.
