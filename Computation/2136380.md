Partial differential equations (PDEs) are an important mathematical tool for
modeling many scientific problems and the most common approach for solving these
equations usually involves numerical methods. The goal of this project is to
extend the theory and develop novel numerical methods of one such method known
as the PD-WG algorithm. The resulting computational codes will be made publicly
available. In addition, the PI will apply the new methods to several problems in
biology and physical sciences. One exciting application is the mathematical
modeling of ion channels which are proteins with a hole down their middle, and
which serve an important function as gatekeepers for cells. The project also has
an educational component that integrates the PI's research activities with
training of students at all levels, from K-12, undergraduate, to graduate
students, with a focus on serving underrepresented minorities.

The goal of this project is to develop novel numerical methods through a
coupling of the original/primal governing equations and their dual. The
resulting numerical methods are known as "Primal-Dual Weak Galerkin (PD-WG)
finite element methods". The main research of this CAREER project will be
focused on five primary areas: (1) developing robust numerical schemes by using
PD-WG techniques for various PDE problems including the elliptic Cauchy problem,
convection dominated convection-diffusion equations, and general linear or
nonlinear PDEs; (2) establishing stability and mathematical convergence
(including superconvergence) theory for the newly developed PD-WG methods by
developing new mathematical tools; (3) numerical simulations for biological
problems modeled by the nonlinear Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) equations; (4)
devising new concepts in numerical PDEs by integrating key ideas of optimization
with WG methods; and (5) developing application-oriented software packages using
the PD-WG methods.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
