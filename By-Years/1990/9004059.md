This work will carry out systematic analyses of (p, 2p) reactions using the
Dirac distorted wave impulse approximation. In contrast with previous work, the
formalism is completely relativistic and preserves the full finite range
character of the reaction processes. Subsequently the (p,np) and (e,e'p)
reactions will be examined. The results will provide a better understanding of
nucleon knockout reactions and the nature of the strong interaction in a nuclear
medium.
