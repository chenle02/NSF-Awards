The newest hydrate structure, Structure H, which has three cavities (one of
which is large enough to contain petroleum components) will be studied, and
higher-order hydrates will be explored with molecular-dynamics simulations.
Phase equilibria for two systems will be measured to lay the foundation for
statistical-thermodynamics modelling: methane+adamantane and methane+1methyl-
pentane. Exploration for new hydrate cavities will be done by computationally
growing a dissolved apolar molecule surrounded by discrete clusters of water
molecules. This is an exploratory, high-risk, high-gain project to attempt to
define a framework for future gas-hydrate research. The analogy between such
hydrate structures and carbon structures known as Buckminsterfullerenes
("Buckyballs") will be used.
