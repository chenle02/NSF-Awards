Designing large, complex systems that demand certain functional and quality of
service (QoS) objectives remains a significant engineering problem. Design space
exploration and tradeoff analysis can play a pivotal role by revealing designs
that human designers might miss, illuminating sensible and nonsensical
tradeoffs, and helping decision-makers to balance tradeoffs that design
decisions impose on diverse stakeholders. Despite its importance, systematic
tradeoff design space analysis is perhaps one of the most elusive activities in
the design of complex systems, as the cost, effort, and discipline needed to
conduct tradespace analysis can be extremely high. This research devises a suite
of fully automated techniques to foster systematic analysis of design tradeoff
spaces of software systems. By making tradespace analysis of complex software
designs less expensive to conduct and more scalable, this project enables the
vibrant software industry to improve the quality of its
products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research project contains both analytical and
empirical components. The analytical approaches involve developing models and
algorithms that can discover design alternatives via automatically synthesizing
spaces of design solutions from designers' high-level inputs, comparatively
analyze such design spaces via automatically subjecting each design alternative
to the execution of diverse evaluation operations, and facilitate support for
design space evolution through leveraging a variety of optimization mechanisms.
The empirical evaluation component contains conducting experiments in multiple
steps: controlled experiments by means of test beds and experiments in the
context of real-world systems. The project advances the state-of-the-art by
making synthesis-driven software design more scalable and cost effective. The
principles resulting from this research will help expand our understanding of
the application domains and settings in which synthesis-based approach to design
tradeoff space analysis can be practically used.
