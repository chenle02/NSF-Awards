This study will examine the physiology of natriuretic peptides (NPs) in fish.
NPs are a family of peptide hormones that decrease blood volume and lower blood
pressure in virtually all vertebrates. NPs were first identified in mammals in
1981and although their genetic code was determined a few months later, their
physiological function remains unknown to the present time. This proposal
questions the applicability of mammalian models in NP research because mammals
continually lose water through evaporation and renal excretion and thus are
never naturally volume or pressure over-loaded. However, freshwater fish (trout)
are chronically volume over-loaded and as the earliest vertebrates that contain
all members of the NP family of proteins, they form the basis for the present
study. Initially, specific assays will be developed for each trout NP (ANP, CNP,
VNP). These assays will be used to determine how NP secretion is affected by
independently manipulating water and salt balance via adapting trout to
freshwater (volume overload, salt depletion), saltwater (volume depletion, salt
overload), and freshwater plus high salt diet (volume and salt overload). Only
euryhaline fish, such as trout, thrive in all these conditions and they are the
only vertebrates in which these parameters can be controlled independently, non-
invasively, and without stress. This information will then be used to examine
the effects of physiological doses of NPs on trout fluid balance, in vivo and in
vitro cardiovascular and renal function, and identify tissue-specific NP
secretory processes. These studies will provide the first comprehensive picture
of NP physiology from the vertebrates in which they initially evolved. This
project is part of an international collaboration with laboratories in Canada
and Japan and it will provide domestic and foreign training for graduate
students and domestic training for undergraduates, teachers in secondary
education, and high school students.
