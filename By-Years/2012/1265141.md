Researchers plan to further develop a biosensor prototype device in order to
prepare it for possible future use in medical and research fields. This
prototype is an Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay based biosensor that is
capable of simultaneously detecting very low concentrations of various
biomarkers with minimal false positives and false negatives. If successful, this
will lay the foundation for early detection and monitoring of colorectal cancer
that can potentially save lives and improve healthcare.

Further development of the biosensor could lead to impacts in the pharmaceutical
and biotechnological fields through advanced technologies of drug development
and therapeutics. Additionally, if successful, the biosensor will demonstrate
the effectiveness of nanotechnology approaches to overcome diagnostic
challenges. This technology could aid medical professionals by furthering their
knowledge on how to address low sensitivity and high specificity detection of
diseases in their early stages.
