Instructional simulation software for undergraduate quantum or modern physics
will be developed. It will introduce the time-dependent Schrodinger equation in
a simple discrete form to do many intuition-building real-time simulations. The
software will allow students to see directly that the Schrodinger equation
governs real-world phenomena such as resonant absorption of electromagnetic
waves. This intuitive background will make it much easier for a student to
understand the formal theory of the Schrodinger equation as a partial
differential equation. The software will be a general-purpose one- and two-
dimensional time-dependent Schrodinger solver, based on a new fast and accurate
algorithm. This software will be of immediate use in upper-level physics
courses.
