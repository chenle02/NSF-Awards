&lt;br/&gt;A fundamental component of judgment and decision making is hypothesis
evaluation, a process that is embedded in many real-world tasks. For example,
physicians presumably consider the likelihood of various diseases prior to
issuing a diagnosis, mechanics presumably assess the likelihood of various
causes of automobile failure before investing time and money in repairs, and
auditors presumably evaluate the likelihood of various sources of accounting
errors prior to pursuing the sources of errors. Tied to the process of
hypothesis evaluation is the process of hypothesis generation. Hypothesis
generation involves the generation, or recall, of the to-be-evaluated
hypotheses. Hypothesis generation is an equally important component of judgment,
as the outcome of the generation process determines which alternative hypotheses
ultimately are evaluated by the decision maker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose
of the present research is to examine both the hypothesis evaluation and
hypothesis generation aspects of judgment within the context of mainstream
memory theory. In particular, this research will focus on testing and extending
a memory model (Minerva-DM) to account for how people make judgments of
probability and how they generate hypotheses. The overall goal of this research
is to provide an integrative theory of likelihood judgment and hypothesis
generation while accounting for most of the likelihood judgment phenomena in the
judgment-under-uncertainty literature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
