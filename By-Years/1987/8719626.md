The principle investigator (PI) proposes to investigate topics concerned with
the recent application of algebraic geometry to error-correcting codes--work
that showed the existence of a sequence of error-correcting codes that have
performance exceeding the previously known Gilbert-Varshamov bound. Specifically
the PI will attempt to construct codes using varieties of higher dimension such
as surfaces, explicitly describe codes on modular curves, investigate methods of
constructing codes having prescribed symmetries using the automorphism group of
the underlying curve, and explore efficient decoding algorithms for codes on
curves of genus greater than zero.
