Abstract&lt;br/&gt;CHE-
0415421&lt;br/&gt;Dowben/Nebraska&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Dowben at
Nebraska and Professor Zhang at Florida International University, along with
their coworkers, are investigating the interaction of small molecular species
with the surfaces of crystalline polymer materials. With the support of the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, they are using a combination of angle
resolved thermal desorption, photoelectron diffraction, scanned probe
microscopy, and calculational approaches to develop a fundamental understanding
of the interaction of molecular species with characterizable polymer surfaces.
This information is relevant to technologies ranging from electronic device
packaging to sensor systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The interaction of water and
polymer precursor molecules with the surface of semiconducting polymer materials
is of fundamental importance to the technologies of electronic materials
processing and polymer material growth. With the support of the Analytical and
Surface Chemistry Program, Professors Dowben and Zhang are carrying out basic
studies of the interaction of these small molecules with the surfaces of well-
characterized polymer materials, using a combination of experimental and
theoretical probes. &lt;br/&gt;
