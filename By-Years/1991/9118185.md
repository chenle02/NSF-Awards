The goal of this research is to determine how local regions in DNA undergo
conformational transitions during specific interactions with proteins.
Fluorescence and absorption spectroscopy will detect both local and global
conformational changes. The method measures DNA which may be a minor component
and senses conformational changes in both DNA and protein induced by complex
formation. Dr. Norlund aims to determine: 1. Thermodynamics of DNA structural
motions and binding in the Eco RI-DNA complex. 2. Time-dependent conformation in
the recognition sequence duringcleavage. 3. The binding constant of Eco RI to
DNA using a direct fluorometric method. 4. Contributions of ribose, base
stacking and local charge to fluorescence changes. 5. Whether kinks exist in the
Eco RI recognition sequence before binding? 6. Whether Eco RI interaction with
GAA bases are stronger than with TTC. 7. Whether melting "bubbles" form around
less stable bases as suggested? 8. Whether partially-stacked bases are first
recognized by the Eco RI Endonuclease. 9. Amplitudes and rates of DNA base
transient excursions. 10. Whether distribution models explain lifetimes better
than discrete exponentials.
