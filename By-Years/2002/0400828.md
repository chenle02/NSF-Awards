This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial biology for
FY2004. The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of
protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are
not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides
opportunities for recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in
microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of
established scientists, and to broaden their scientific horizons beyond the
research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These
fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their
research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves
of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign
locations.

The research and training plan is entitled "How microbial community diversity
affects carbon cycling in Brazilian Terra Preta Dark Earth soils." The research
objective is to understand how soil microorganisms affect carbon sequestration
and mineralization in anthropogenic Terra Preta soils in the humid tropics of
Brazil. FISH, T-RFLP, and PLFA analysis are being used to assess Terra Preta
soil microbial abundance and diversity, while Stable Isotope Probing is being
used to investigate carbon fate in microcosms containing isotopically-labeled
plant material.
