This grant will partially support the Field of Dreams Conferences that will run
November 4-6, 2022 and will be held on the Minneapolis campus of the University
of Minnesota. The Field of Dreams Conference is organized by the Math Alliance,
an organization whose goal is to increase the number of doctoral students from
backgrounds underrepresented in the mathematical sciences, and the Institute for
Mathematics and its Applications. Approximately 100 undergraduate and Master's
degree students will attend the conference, about 80% of whom will be
underrepresented minorities, along with 200 additional participants. All funds
from this award will be used to pay the cost of attendance for some of these
students. The conference coordinates with the Math Alliance's Facilitated
Graduate Admissions Process (F-GAP), which has helped place an average of about
80 Math Alliance Scholars per year in graduate programs the last six years with
very good retention to this point. The conference is an essential part of a
program to produce a more diverse professional mathematical workforce. In
addition, there are events at the conference that assist faculty in mentoring
practices and help academic departments transform their cultures to be more
inclusive and supportive of student success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Field of
Dreams conference has several purposes, including: providing information about
all aspects of the mathematical sciences professions to students wishing to
pursue doctoral studies; providing information about summer research programs
and opportunities at the NSF-funded Mathematical Sciences Institutes;
facilitating appropriate placement of Math Alliance students in graduate
programs; providing professional development in mentoring and cultural
competence for our Math Alliance faculty; and serving as a clearinghouse for
employment opportunities for new (and recent) Math Alliance doctoral recipients.

and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
