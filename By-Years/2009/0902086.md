&lt;br/&gt;The functioning of modern magnetic devices requires knowing their
switching characteristics, i.e. critical curve. The proposed SGER research
represents a new approach to locally measure the switching critical curve of
coupled nanomagnetic systems. This is a very challenging project because a novel
idea for critical curve measurement of coupled magnetic systems will be tested
while macroscopic measurement devices will be interfaced with nanosized magnetic
objects. &lt;br/&gt; The findings gained from this project will contribute to
the basic understanding of the nanoscale physical phenomena, specifically
nanomagnetism, providing insights into the dynamic properties of mesoscopic
magnetic structures. The immediate benefit for the society comes from the big
impact of the proposed activity on magnetic recording technology. Also, the
success of this project could have broad impacts on nanotechnology education in
the Louisiana by exposing undergraduates students, especially minorities, to the
latest research developments.&lt;br/&gt;
