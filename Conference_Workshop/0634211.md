Support is being provided for a conference on the representation theory of
p-adic groups that will take place at the University of Iowa from October 19,
2006 to October, 22, 2006. Professor David Manderscheid, Principal Investigator
on this grant and Chair of the Department of Mathematics at the University of
Iowa, is the local organizer for the conference. The Scientific Committee for
the conference consists of Prof. Colin Bushnell (Kings College, University of
London), Prof. Guy Henniart (University of Paris - Orsay), Prof. Freydoon
Shahidi (Purdue University) and Prof. Manderscheid. The conference will focus on
the recent developments in the representation theory of p-adic groups that are
arithmetic in nature. In particular the conference will focus on the use of the
theory of types and covers due to Bushnell and Kutzko.

The conference is particularly timely as the study of the representation theory
of p-adic groups has proved critical in the solution of important problems in
number theory through what is called the Langlands Program. These results
included the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem and, more recently, the proof of the
Local Langlands Conjecture for the general linear group. In awarding support for
conference attendance, preference will be given to graduate students and recent
Ph.D.'s. Approximately seventy mathematicians will attend the conference. The
conference will attract national and international attention and it will help
set the research agenda for the field.
