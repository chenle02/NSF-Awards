The Otterbein University group of Nathaniel Tagg and his team of undergraduate
students will conduct research on neutrino oscillations and interactions using
experiments in the Fermilab NuMI and Booster neutrino beams. The research
program includes the study of neutrino oscillations (in the MINOS+ experiment),
measuring neutrino nucleus cross sections (in the MINERvA experiment), measuring
neutrino velocity (MINOS+), and searching for anomalous events that might
indicate physics beyond the Standard Model (the MicroBooNE experiment). A
special contribution of the group and an exciting broader impact of their
research program is the development and implementation of 3D visualization tools
to guide the physics analyses of the experiments and to render visible to
students and the public the nature of neutrino interactions as recorded and
studied by the scientists.
