With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of California in
Santa Barbara will acquire a Beowulf cluster. This equipment will enhance
research in a number of areas including a) simulation of biomaterial
microstructures; b) simulation and interpretation of single molecule
spectroscopy experiments; c) field-theoretic computer simulations of polymers
and complex fluids; and d) modeling and computation of flow-structure
interaction in multi-phase and complex fluids. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A cluster
of fast, modern computer workstations is vital to serving the computing needs of
active research departments. Such a "computer network" also serves as a
development environment for new theoretical codes and algorithms, provides
state-of-the-art graphics and visualization facilities, and supports research in
state-of-the-art applications of parallel processing. These studies will have a
significant impact in a wide number of areas, including materials science and
physics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
