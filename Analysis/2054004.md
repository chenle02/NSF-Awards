Classical calculus studies smoothly changing functions, curves, and surfaces
inside the Euclidean space. In this project, the principal investigator will
study calculus in arenas where the classical tools do not always apply. This
includes non-smooth functions or sets, abstract geometries outside of the usual,
Euclidean, geometry, and fractal spaces admitting complex behavior at many
scales. The project aims to understand these objects by decomposing them into
simpler pieces, embedding them into classical geometries, or approximating them
by linear objects. Non-smooth analysis and geometry are important in many areas
of pure and applied mathematics and computer science, since non-smooth problems
arise in studying large data sets, in computational questions, and as limiting
cases of smooth problems. The project will also emphasize results that are
"quantitative": providing guaranteed estimates independent of the particular
function or geometry being studied.

More precisely, the project focuses on Lipschitz (and related) mappings.
Building on his recent collaborative work, the principal investigator will study
when Lipschitz mappings into metric spaces can be decomposed into or well-
approximated by simpler mappings, like linear maps or maps that factor through
trees. The principal investigator then plans to apply these techniques to
provide new structural results on geometric objects defined through Lipschitz
maps, like distance spheres or medial axes. The principal investigator will also
investigate similar questions related to curves in metric spaces, continuing
work on extensions of the so-called ?Analyst?s Traveling Salesman Theorem? that
links lengths of curves to quantitative flatness conditions. In addition, the
principal investigator will investigate notions of differentiability of
Lipschitz functions on non-smooth spaces, and how they constrain geometry. This
is connected to the bi-Lipschitz embedding problem (?which spaces can be
embedded in Euclidean space with bounded distortion??), which is of major
importance in geometry and computer science, and which will also be studied
during the project. All these linked investigations will combine to improve our
understanding of the analysis and geometry of non-smooth objects.
