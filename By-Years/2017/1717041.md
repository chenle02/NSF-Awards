With the emergence of cyber-physical systems, real-time status updates have
become an important and ubiquitous form of communication. Applications that
employ vehicular status messages, security reports from computers, homes, and
offices, and surveillance video from remote-controlled systems need status
updates to be as timely as possible; however, this is typically constrained by
limited network resources. This tension has led to the introduction of new
performance metrics based on the Age of Information (AoI) that capture how
timely is one's knowledge of a system or process. AoI-based optimization of both
the network service facility and the senders' updating policies has yielded new
and even surprising results that ultimately will increase the reliability of
vehicular safety warning systems, reduce the bandwidth needed for video
monitoring, and increase the energy efficiency of sensor
networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Much of this recent work has been directed toward
an analytic understanding of AoI using mathematical models. While the analysis
of basic models and methods needs to continue, the merits of AoI also need to be
studied in the context of specific applications. Thus, this project has four
components: (1) State Dependent Updating: the update submission process will be
optimized for a source that is subject to energy and power constraints in
sending updates through a time-varying service facility. (2) Status Update
Multiple Access: new protocols will be designed for wireless sensors sending
updates through a shared random access channel. (3) Real-time Universal Data
Compression: for a discrete random source with unknown statistics, the AoI
performance of universal streaming source coding systems will be characterized.
(4) Remote Video Updating: the AoI metric will be used to study how H.264 video
frames should be delivered for machine-based surveillance. The first three
project components will aim for new mathematical insights, methods and
algorithms in fundamental problem areas. The fourth component, video updating,
represents an application area to which these methods and algorithms will be
applied.
