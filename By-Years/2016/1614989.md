High performance plastics are made of expensive ingredients and in large
quantities. Plastics companies, such as tire rubber and polymer compounders,
have struggled to find a filler that provides the desired improved properties
without great expense or prohibitive technological barriers. If an inexpensive,
compatible filler could be found, high performance commodity plastics could have
better properties and a lower, more consistent cost that is less dependent on
volatile petroleum prices. Traditional fillers are dropped in "top down" and
mixed requiring lots of energy, heat, or chemical aids. This project
investigates the commercial opportunity for a filler that is assembled "bottom
up" from within the mixture. The filler is based on previous research on
engineered low-cost agricultural proteins. If the filler is commercially viable,
high performance plastics will achieve improved properties and be produced at
lower cost allowing a traditionally petroleum dependent industry to save money
and become more sustainable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to
communicate and cooperate with the polymers market to determine the area of
greatest need for this filler. The technology has been shown in lab scale as a
proof-of-principle, and further development would benefit from guidance toward
promising application areas. The project scope will be to first meet with tire
rubber companies and large plastics compounders that currently use fillers.
These global companies use complex recipes and through cooperation will provide
direction for a technology demonstration. This project will experimentally
articulate the commercialization potential of this technology. By receiving
direct feedback from future business partners, a viable business model and value
proposition can be articulated. A demand-driven course for commercial success
will be planned by considering feedback on technology licensure, in-house
development and manufacturing, or contract manufacturing.
