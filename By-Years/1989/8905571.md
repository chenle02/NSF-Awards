Professor Fine is examining issues relating to the general topics of theories,
explanation and interpretation--issues central to our understanding of how
science develops--as they arise in the context of quantum theory. The studies
will examine how these topics are conceptualized in the quantum domain by
examining the different conceptions employed in treating a number of concrete
philosophical and scientific problems there. The object is to get a profile of
the conceptions in the context of reflexive scientific practice, so as to
further our understandings of the concepts and of that practice. The background
for the studies is the movement toward a more piecemeal approach in the
philosophy of science. In particular, these studies should help assess the
orientation developed by Professor Fine (which he calls "the natural ontological
attitude"); for that assessment requires a repertoire of detailed context-
sensitive studies as a basis for reasoned judgments regarding the prospects and
limitations of this approach to science.
