This research program constitutes a continuation of previous NSF Grant
ATM-8515310. This program concerns the coupling of atmospheric radiation models
with climate models in order to estimate terrestrial climatic change. Specific
areas of research concerning the present and proposed programs are: (1)
improving infrared radiative transfer models; (2) understanding the impact of
anthropogenic aerosols upon Arctic climate; (3) understanding the dependence of
planetary albedo upon solar zenith angle for deserts and vegetated surfaces; (4)
exploring the role of clouds upon climate and climate change; (5) understanding
diurnal variability of the solar radiation budget for deserts. This work may
lead to fundamental improvements in numerical modeling of the climate system.
