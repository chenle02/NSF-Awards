EAR-0126428&lt;br/&gt;David Feary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An ad hoc committee under
the auspices of the National Research Council (NAS) - Board on Earth Sciences
and Resources (BESR) will be charged with the review of the science objectives
and implementation planning of the three components of NSF's EarthScope
initiative. They are: United States Seismic Array (USArray), the San Andreas
Fault Observatory at Depth (SAFOD), and the Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO).
EarthScope is an NSF-led initiative designed to apply modern observational,
analytical, and telecommunications technologies to investigate the structure,
dynamics and evolution of the North American continent, and the physical
processes controlling earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. It is anticipated that
the results of the EarthScope initiative will provide a foundation for
fundamental and applied geoscience research throughout the United
States.&lt;br/&gt;
