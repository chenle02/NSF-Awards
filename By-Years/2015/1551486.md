This award supports the Stochastic Networks Conference to be held June 20-24,
2016 at the University of California, San Diego. Information about the
conference is available through the conference website at &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
http://stochasticnetworks2016.ucsd.edu/ &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2016
Stochastic Networks Conference will provide a key forum for researchers from
different quantitative disciplines, including mathematics, probability,
operations research, computer science, electrical, mechanical and industrial
engineering, to come together to hear and discuss the latest research
developments related to stochastic networks. The program includes a broad
spectrum of leading researchers amongst the invited speakers, including some
speakers who are junior researchers, underrepresented minorities or women, as
well as senior researchers. Participant support will help early career
researchers, underrepresented minorities and women attend the conference to
discuss and present their work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stochastic networks is a
multifaceted area of research concerned with the modeling, stability, control,
performance, approximation, and design of networks which are subject to the
effects of stochastic variability. Research in this area is strongly motivated
by applications in diverse domains of science and engineering. Examples of
application areas include telecommunications, computer networks, high-tech
manufacturing systems, service networks, social and biological networks, and
health care management. The study of stochastic networks gives rise to
challenging and subtle mathematical problems, whose solution often requires an
innovative combination of ideas and techniques from several branches of
mathematics. Many of the above aspects will be discussed at the conference.
