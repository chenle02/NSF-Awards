This project addresses controller design for nonlinear electromagnetic
levitation devices. These devices are used in a variety of applications
including non-contact bearings, suspensions, and high speed position actuators.
They are critical to the performance and efficiency of a broad class of systems
including transportation and robotic systems. The dynamic equations of motion
for these devices are highly nonlinear and the open loop system is inherently
unstable. This project focuses on two problems comprising (1) the synthesis of
nonadaptive continuous control laws for nonlinear electromagnetic levitation
devices, and (2) the design of controllers for the case where some states must
be estimated. It is expected that this research will provide more effective
methods for controlling electromagnetic levitation devices which must operate at
high speeds and have large air gap variations.
