Innovative materials are needed to encourage women to consider careers in
science. A comprehensive, multimedia database with text, graphics, photographs
and audio could highlight women's achievements in science and provide an
exciting tool for student research and a source of entertaining, interactive
presentations. While CD-ROM (Compact Disc - Read-Only Memory) technology can
theoretically deliver multimedia databases, almost no research has been
conducted to date on how to design such programs. Phase I will examine the
feasibility of an interactive multimedia database on the topic of women in
science. The study will analyze the appropriate content, audience needs,
delivery system and design options for a program aimed at students in grades
4-8. A prototype example will then be designed and created using HyperCard
software and a hard disk drive to model a CD-ROM delivery system. The
anticipated results of Phase I are a prototype that demonstrates the feasibility
of producing a CD-ROM multimedia database on women in science and a set of
design guidelines for the Phase II product. Phase II will result in a well
designed, audiovisual, historical record of the achievements of women scientists
that will be of interest to students, educators and career counselors.
