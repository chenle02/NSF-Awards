ITR: A Compiler-Hardware Co-Design Approach to Software
Protection&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI's: Rahul Simha, Bhagi Narahari, Alok
Choudhary, Nasir Memon&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
growing area of software protection aims to address the problems of code
understanding and code tampering along with related problems such as
authorization. This project will combine novel techniques in the areas of
compilers, architecture, and software security to provide a new, efficient, and
tunable approach to some problems in software protection. The goal is to address
a broad array of research issues that will ultimately enable design tools such
as compilers to assist system designers in managing the tradeoffs between
security and performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main idea behind the proposed
approach is to hide code sequences (keys) within instructions in executables
that are then interpreted by supporting FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array)
hardware to provide both a "language" (the code sequences) and a "virtual
machine within a machine" (the FPGA) that will allow designers considerable
flexibility in providing software protection. Thus, by using long sequences and
PKI to exchange a secret key with the FPGA while also encrypting the executable
with that secret key, a system can be positioned at the high-security (but low-
performance) end of the spectrum. Similarly, as will be explained in the
proposal, by using shorter sequences and selective encryption, one can achieve
high-performance with higher security than is possible with systems that rely
only on obscurity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
