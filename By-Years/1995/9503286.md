This project will help to prepare, and make available to the scientific
community, a complete, worldwide systematic catalog of spiders. The project
includes two phases. The first phase involves the publication of a third volume
in the Advances in Spider Taxonomy series; that volume will update and
supplement existing, published systematic catalogs of spider biodiversity by
detailing the illustrated redescriptions of previously described species that
were published form 1940 through 1980, and by providing full coverage of the new
literature published form 1992 through 1995. The second phase involves the
production of a complete catalog through the capture, and merging with all the
post-1940 information, of relevant data from earlier published catalogs. The
complete bibliographic and taxonomic files will be made available on Internet
and CD-ROM (in both text and database formats, for various computer platforms,
with annual updates to follow). The results will serve as authority lists for
all biodiversity projects involving spiders, and should eventually promote a
stable nomencla torial base for all biological studies of spiders and for use by
scientists in agriculture and forest management fields.
