This award will support the participation of younger scientists (postdocs,
graduate students and possibly undergraduates) at the 10th Conference on the
Intersection of Particle and Nuclear Physics (CIPANP 2009). This triennial
conference covers all areas of particle and nuclear physics, as well as particle
and nuclear astrophysics and cosmology. CIPANP 2009 will be held at the Torrey
Pines Hilton in San Diego CA on May 26-31, 2009.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the
Broader Impacts, the Conference will address the fields of particle and nuclear
physics, as well as particle/nuclear astrophysics. The Proceedings of this
conference will be published so that many others can take advantage of the
talks. The conference is particularly interested in those topics that overlap
more than one area, particularly topics of interest to physicists in all three
areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
