This work will investigate the deburring process as an independent machining
process with special regard to its application by industrial robot manipulators
when impedance control is used to control the process. With impedance control,
the compliance of the robot end-effector is modulated electronically by means of
online microcomputer control. The end-effector behaves dynamically as if it has
mechanical springs with adjustable stiffness; however, the end-effector does not
have srpings and develops its compliance electronically by feedback on two
miniature actuators. This research will apply this concept to robotic deburring.
In the deburring process, it is necessary to control the contact force to chieve
the required surface finish and profile and to prevent overloading. To achieve
this, the design objective is to control the closed-loop system such that the
ratio of the system position to the contact force is maintained constant.
