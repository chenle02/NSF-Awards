9526763 Hemley The goal of this project is to study the fundamental chemical
properties of minerals at pressures and temperatures of the Earth's deep
interior in order to obtain direct experimental constraints on the chemical
composition, formation, and evolution of the mantle and core. Deep mantle phases
will be examined under high pressure and temperature conditions using a variety
of new x-ray diffraction and spectroscopic techniques. In particular, high-
pressure transitions in SiO2, AlO3, (Mg, Fe)SiO3 perovskite, the unusual high-
pressure behavior of Fe-bearing oxides, and the stability of garnet in the lower
mantle will be examined. High pressure and temperature experiments on whole rock
samples of appropriate mantle chemistries (e.g., peridotite, chondrite, basalt)
will be performed at deep earth conditions and synchrotron x-ray diffraction,
Raman spectroscopy, and infrared spectroscopy will be used for phase
identification. Also, deep mantle mineral inclusions in diamond will be examined
with the new micro-analytical techniques. phase relations of iron and iron
alloys at core conditions will be performed using new in situ high pressure and
temperature x-ray diffraction techniques. Core-mantle boundary reactions will be
explored both in situ and in quenched samples.
