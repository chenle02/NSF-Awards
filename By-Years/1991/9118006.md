The principal investigators will investigate mass transfer and veining processes
associated with regional metamorphism of both pelitic and basic rocks. They will
focus specifically on the processes and length scales of mass transport during
prograde metamorphism and subsequent uplift-related hydrothermal activity. The
PI's will attempt to establish the genetic links between metasomatism and
mineral reactions, fluid and heat fluxes, volume strains, and the thermal and
baric evolution of orogenic belts during metamorphism.
