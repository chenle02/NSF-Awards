9612162 GangaRao The major objectives of this research are: 1) to establish the
enhancement of static bending and shear strength, and stiffness of steel
reinforced concrete members wrapped and resin (adhesively) bonded with several
layers of FRP fabrics referred herin as HYBRIDS including failure modes, and 2)
to evaluate long term strength and stiffness degradation rates of these hybrids
under harsh environments such as moisture and temperature fluctuation, sustained
stresses, and chemical reactions. A fundamental understanding of degradation and
failure mechanisms is essential for core concrete, skin with FRP fabric, and the
adhesives before implementing the proposed repair techniques for the existing
infrastructure that is in disarray. The degradation rates of adhesives and other
materials will be established through accelerated testing in a weatherometer.
The test results will be evaluated through a parallel research effort to
establish the expected service- life performance of hybrids. This research will
be coordinated with another parallel effort to be funded by the West Virginia
Department of Transportation-Division of Highways, The Composite Institute- SPI,
and the Tonen Corporation of Japan. ***
