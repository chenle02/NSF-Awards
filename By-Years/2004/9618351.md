Kraft, Robert 96-18351 Dr. Kraft will conduct an observational program using the
Keck telescope and the Lick 3-m telescope to study the surface abundance of
certain light metals for stars within globular clusters. One of the many studies
to be conducted with the abundance data is in stellar evolution and will provide
constraints on the cause of deep- mixing and whether it is driven by stellar
rotation. Abundance data will also allow an investigation of the degree to which
primordial abundance inhomogeneities are present in globular clusters. ***
