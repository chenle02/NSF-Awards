The Iceland Database Project Two is an expansion of a PC-machine- readable
database using the Icelandic National Archives. To previous files of vital
events and census records will be added farm registers, tax, probate and
mortgage data. The goal is to reconstruct histories before 1871 based on the
linkage of records of individuals, households, families, famine survivorship and
women's reproductive histories. These findings will be correlated with
population, climate change, the technology of food production and the beginnings
of modernization in mid-nineteenth century Iceland. The project will contribute
in a major way to our understanding of population and economic dynamics under
arctic conditions.
