The project continues partial support for an instrumentation repair and
maintenance service for small colleges in Appalachia and surrounding regions in
Kentucky, Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, and Tennessee. These small
academic institutions must buy and use modern scientific instruments so their
mostly rural students are not at a disadvantage compared to those at major
universities. Factory service for these instruments is, however, prohibitively
expensive, and they are often idle when in need of repair due to this high cost.
This program addresses this need by utilizing the service infrastructure at the
University of Kentucky College of Engineering as a support base of technical
expertise to keep these instruments operational at affordable costs to the small
colleges. Partial funding is being provided by the grant, and through user fees
the colleges are contributing an increasing share of the costs as the program
becomes self-supporting.
