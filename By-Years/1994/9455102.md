A 3.5 day summer workshop in molecular modeling for 12 college faculty in New
England and eastern New York will be conducted. No prior knowledge of molecular
modeling is assumed and assistance will be provided to participants in
establishing a molecular modeling program at their home institutions.
Participants will be introduced to molecular mechanics, semi-empirical
computation and ab initio methods, with the emphasis on how to use these
techniques to teach undergraduate chemistry. The strengths and limitations of
each method will be discussed and participants will have hands-on experience
with a variety of software packages. In addition, a symposium for workshop
participants and local educators will be held in January 1996 to facilitate
discussion of experiences with computational chemistry in undergraduate courses.
Participants will reside at the Campus Center and will share lunch and dinner
with workshop presenters. The cost of food and lodging will be covered by the
workshop budget. Educators from resource-poor institutions will be provided
stipend of $150. Women and minority candidates are encouraged to apply.
