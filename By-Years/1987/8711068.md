The proposed work will result in the characterization of the bovine nuclear
gene that specifies subunit IV of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase (COX IV).
Bachman's previous work led to the isolation of a cDNA corresponding to the COX
IV mRNA. This will be used in a straightforward way to isolate genomic clones.
She has evidence for at least two genes, one of which appears to be a
pseudogene. Using these clones, it should be possible to develop gene-specific
probes which Bachman will then use to study a variety of aspects of the
regulation of the gene(s). The cytochrome oxidase (COX) of the mitochondrion is
a large complex of different proteins, three of which are encoded by the
mitochondrial DNA while the remainder are specified by the nuclear genome. The
number of such nuclear subunits varies: in yeast there are 5; in mammals, about
10. Several interesting regulatory problems are presented by this enzyme. These
include the mechanism that coordinates expression of the nuclear and
mitochondrial genes, and the mechanism, possibly the same, that regulates
expression in different tissues. As yet, virtually nothing is known about the
structure and regulation of these nuclear genes in mammals. The work proposed by
Dr. Bachman will lead to the isolation and characterization of gene(s) for the
largest of the mammalian nuclear subunits, COX IV, and should provide some
insight into the mechanisms which regulate its expression.
