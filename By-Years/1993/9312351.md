9312351 Lin Dr. Lin will utilize the recently determined proper motion of the
Large Magellanic Cloud and the radial velocities along the Magellanic Stream to
investigate the history of the dynamical interaction between our Galaxy and the
Magellanic Clouds. The mass distribution in the halo of our Galaxy can be
determined, as well as the present proper motion of the Magellanic Stream.
