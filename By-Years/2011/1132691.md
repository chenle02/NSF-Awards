This project focuses on 'Teaching Science as Inquiry' in this 'Pathway to
Inquiry-Based Science Teaching: An International Partnership' undertaken by
Shodor Education Foundation. It is based on three main axes that could
facilitate the uptake of IBSE (Inquiry-Based Science Education). It (a) proposes
a standard-based approach to teaching science by inquiry that outlines
instructional models to help teachers organize effectively their instruction,
(b) deploys a series of methods to motivate teachers to adopt inquiry-based
techniques and activities and (c) offers access to a unique collection of open
educational resources and teaching practices (linked with science curricula)
that have proven efficiency and efficacy in promoting inquiry-based education
while expanding the limitations of classroom instruction. Such an approach
enables all stakeholders (teachers, teachers' trainers, and curriculum
developers, policy-makers) to examine their own practices in the light of the
best performing approaches that set the standards on what can be achieved and
provides them with a unique tool to bring about improvements in their everyday
practice. Broad Impacts are based in all three objectives. They depend largely
on Shodor being an active 'train the trainers' partner to ensure that National
Science Digital Library (NSDL) materials form the core of the new materials
effort and new efforts to change how teachers are prepared to teach while both
extending their evaluation in an inquiry mode and leveraging the workshops to
directly benefit a number of American (in-service and pre-service) teachers and
teacher preparation faculty. This provides a broader evaluation of the
effectiveness of the content and design of NSDL. Also the American participants
will have a substantial international experience in culture and comparative
education.
