9414786 Ayorinde This project is to provide the theoretical analysis of the
role of vibration assistance in the liquid molding of composites manufacturing
process. It is complementary to a new experimental program being funded by the
Automotive Composites Consortium. Vibration assistance has the potential to
improve a basis for optimization. This project should assist in providing a
better understanding of the role of vibration assisted manufacturing in general
and the liquid molding composite fabrication process in particular. ***
