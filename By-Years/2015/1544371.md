This Antarctic Artists and Writers project supports the creation of a 200+ page
graphic novel that highlights four major disciplines studied in Antarctica:
Organisms and Ecosystems, Integrated System Science, Earth Sciences, and
Astrophysics and Geospace Sciences. Within each of these disciplines, the artist
will engage with the research teams, and will directly observe and document
their research. The researchers in the named science areas have stated their
willingness, indeed eagerness, to participate in her efforts. The artist's aim
is to give an overview of each discipline, and to emphasize the importance and
significance of each field's research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The experiences of
the artist in Antarctica will serve as a connecting narrative for the book,
allowing readers to witness the science from a first-person perspective. The
book is designed to engage a broad audience, especially young readers, in the
wide array of unique and important research being conducted in Antarctica as
well as in the human experience of living and working there. The book will
target 4-8th grade readers, but will be written to be entertaining for adults as
well. The artist has the commitment of First Second Books, a division of
Macmillan, to publish the proposed book.
