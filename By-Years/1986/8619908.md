Three research tasks are proposed to investigate issues of concern in the
earthquake behavior of concrete dams: opening and closing of contraction joints
in arch dams, nonuniform seismic input, and cracking in gravity dams. The first
two tasks are computer studies and will result in significant enhancement of the
computational capabilities available to practicing engineers. The shaking table
tests on model gravity dam monoliths will provide insight into the crack
propagation mechanism as well as the dynamic stability in the presence of
cracks. These tests will be conducted on a small, high-frequency shaking table
which was recently donated to Caltech. An additional research task for the
future, the reservoir sediment experiments will be conducted in actual
reservoirs and are designed to provide information on dynamic water-sediment
interaction about which little is presently known.
