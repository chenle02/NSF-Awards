Cell-to-cell variation is an important property of cell populations that has
implications for the understanding of embryonic development, the immune system,
the sense of smell, and many other normal and abnormal processes. The role of
cell-to-cell variability in these processes is currently not well understood,
and in this project the activity of an important signaling protein will be
measured in individual cells of a single-celled, but social, organism. This will
provide, cell-by-cell, the resolution needed to understand in this system the
significance of cell variability. Undergraduate students will have an
opportunity to engage in interdisciplinary research involving biochemistry,
microfluidics, computer simulations and the development of new analytical
tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cyclic AMP (cAMP) is a signal (acting through
Protein Kinase B, PKB) that induces cell aggregation and the onset of the social
phase of the life cycle of the amoeba, Dictyostelium discoideum. Microfluidic
single-cell assays of PKB will be carried out on single cells of Dictyostelium,
enabling quantitative measurement of variability and a greater understanding of
the significance of this variability as the organism responds to signaling with
cAMP.
