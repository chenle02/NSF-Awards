Texas A &amp; M University will organize, conduct, and evaluate the Academic
Career Mentoring Workshops for Underrepresented Participants annually in
2013-2015. During years 2014 and 2015, partial support will come from the
institutions of the junior faculty. The Academic Career Mentoring Workshop
series targets mid-level faculty, junior faculty and senior graduate students
from the following underrepresented groups: African American, Hispanic, Native
American, and People with Disabilities. The goals of this workshop series are to
mentor underrepresented junior faculty about the tenure and promotion processes,
launching a successful research program, writing solid research proposals, and
encouraging senior graduate students to enter the professoriate. The proposed
Mentoring Workshops will include cultural issues with respect to topics such as
Starting a Research Program, Networking, and Navigating the Tenure Process.
Further, the panelists will be asked to address issues such as "Maintaining
One's Identity &amp; Culture" and "Overcoming Misconceptions." The series
includes such discussions to address frustrations unique to faculty and graduate
students from underrepresented groups. The Academic Career Workshops for
Underrepresented Participants complement the existing CRA-W Workshops, which
focus on gender, and CRA Workshops, which do not target particular issues faced
by women or ethnic minorities.
