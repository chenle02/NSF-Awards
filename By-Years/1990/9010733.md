An analytical and numerical study of longitudinal vortices along heated walls
will be carried out under a Research Initiation Award. These vortices, generated
by concave wall curvature, are known as Gortler vortices, and they can enhance
wall transfer. The study will explore details related to instability and wall
transfer under strongly non-isothermal conditions. Enhanced effectiveness of
transport into the wall, both of heat and mass, from the flow over a surface
even in laminar flow conditions is of potential utility in reducing the size and
weight of heat exchangers and chemical systems.
