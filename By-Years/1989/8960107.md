A key step in the fabrication of free-standing micromechanical devices is often
the removal of a sacrificial oxide layer with hydrofluoric acid. As a result,
this powerful technique is limited to use on polysilicon and a few HF-resistant
metals. The goal of this work is to demonstrate that microdevices can be
fashioned from common metals such as aluminum by replacing the oxide layer with
a thermally stable polymer. The P.I. recently developed a new family of
polyimide materials which have all the requisite properties to serve as
sacrificial layers. These include high glass transition temperature, good
planarization, excellent thermal stability ( 400 C), good chemical and plasma
resistance, and most importantly, rapid solubility in mild, noncorrosive media.
In Phase I, the P.I. will use standard IC processing techniques to make simple,
free-standing aluminum devices with the aid of these new polyimide materials.
Phase II will extend these efforts to include other metals as well as the
production of more sophisticated devices. During this same time, he will
determine how polymer structure and processing conditions can be altered to
improve film adhesion, thermal stability, thermal expansion properties, and wet
etch rate.
