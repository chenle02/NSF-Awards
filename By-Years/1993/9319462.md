9319462 Hebert The response of turbulent mixing in the upper tropical ocean to
strong surface forcing, namely westerly wind bursts and rain squalls, will be
studied through a hierarchy of numerical simulations and model comparisons to
observations. This study is a contribution to TOGA COARE (Tropical Ocean Global
Atmosphere Coupled Ocean Atmosphere Response Experiment).
