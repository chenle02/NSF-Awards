With the exceptional growth of data generated from social and economic networks
and from wide-scale scientific experiments in physics, biology and astronomy,
the problem of efficient and durable data storage has become of paramount
importance. To address this challenge, various new solutions for ultra-high
density storage media have been considered, including macromolecular (DNA)
recording systems. DNA-based systems are inherently nonvolatile, they retain
information under standard environmental conditions for thousands of years, and
they offer unprecedented information densities and fast data replication/copying
rates. This project is concerned with developing new error control coding
solutions for DNA-based storage systems and various DNA synthesis (writing) and
DNA sequencing (reading) models and technologies. The project includes plans for
curriculum development as well as outreach to industry partners and
interdisciplinary collaborators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Error control coding is a
critical aspect of all storage systems. The research in this project introduces
and develops error control coding techniques for DNA storage including DNA
Profile Codes, Asymmetric Lee Distance Codes, and Weakly Mutually Uncorrelated
Codes. All of these techniques are expected to improve the accuracy of DNA
storage systems by adapting the stored sequences to the media, avoiding common
sequencing errors, and simplifying the process of DNA synthesis. These coding
methods are expected to allow for random access and reduce the implementation
cost of the technology. In turn, this will enable miniaturization of the write
system, minimize sequencing error rates, and significantly speed up the process
of DNA assembly.
