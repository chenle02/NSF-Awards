Peters 9618287 The data analysis of three microstructure experiments in the
Hudson Estuary will be focused on three major topics: (1) the variability of
turbulent mixing under different flow conditions and external forcing; (2) the
relations between mixing and flow properties such as shear, stratification and
internal wave trains; and (3) a test of turbulent parameterizations used in
numerical models.
