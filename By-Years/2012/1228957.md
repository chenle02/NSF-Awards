This award to the University of Maryland College Park is for the acquisition of
a Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) system for the characterization of
nanoscale structures in materials. Nanoscale characterization is a critical step
in the design of new materials for applications in areas as diverse as energy,
microelectronics, civil infrastructure, defense and health and for the
understanding of the basic science underlying these applications. The SAXS
instrumentation will allow the determination of the relationship between
structure and function in a very broad range of nanostructured materials, a
partial list includes: (i) nanoparticle systems for a broad range of
applications; (ii) RNA folding, multi-domain protein and DNA/protein complexes,
(iii) novel block copolymer architectures and chemistries and block copolymer
templated structures, (iv) nanostructured electrodes for advanced batteries and
fuel cells and (v) plasmonic structures for high sensitivity sensors.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new SAXS instrument will allow the creation of a
multi-user campus and regional state-of-the-art SAXS facility for research and
education in the nano- and bio-sciences. This facility will help to catalyze
interactions among physical scientists, biologists, and engineers in the
Washington, DC metropolitan area. The facility will further enhance the
education and outreach efforts by attracting highly qualified students and
faculty to work on interdisciplinary research projects involving nanoscience and
technology.
