9321461 Caporael Most behavioral, social and biological science theories use
individuals as the basic unit of analysis and assume these units to be more or
less rationally self-interested. The objective of Dr. Caporael in this research
is to challenge the adequacy of that focus and assumption. She is developing an
hypothesis that humans are adapted for small group living, resulting in adaptive
specializations for sociality that can be and have been extended for
constructing, identifying and solving problems in novel domains. These domains
include those associated with large-scale social organization and nonsocial
objects. This perspective predicts a tension between social construction of
knowledge, which facilitates coordination within groups, and the negotiation of
the habitat, which requires some correspondence with reality. In this research,
Dr. Caporael is synthesizing theory and data in evolutionary biology,
psychology, and anthropology to develop a general theory of sociality drawing on
evidence for correspondences between group configuration and psychological
functioning. Sociality theory provides a plausible reinterpretation of
traditional topics in human evolution, as well as a plausible interpretation for
folk psychology and evolutionary folk psychology. Dr. Caporael is also applying
the theory to familiar topics (the Turing test, technological innovation, and
scientific organization) in Science, Technology and Society (STS) research. The
results of this study should be of great interest to psychologists, evolutionary
scientists and STS researchers. ***
