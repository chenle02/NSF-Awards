9416530 Tajirian The objectives of this project are to study the response of
base- isolated structures using computer simulation and to evaluate their
current design code provisions in light of the strong-motion data obtained
during the Northridge earthquake. The response of four isolated structures
located in Los Angeles area instrumented by the California Strong Motion
Instrumentation Program SMIP) will be estimated using simplified techniques and
recorded ground-motion data, and compared with the recorded structural
responses. In addition, a detailed analysis of the University of Southern
California Hospital structure will be carried out. A three- dimensional, non-
linear model of this building with a simplified soil-structure interaction model
will be created and used to the assessment of the predictability of the response
of base-isolated structures subjected to moderate ground motions, and the
effects of soil-structure interaction in the response of base-isolated
structures. This is a Northridge Earthquake Project.
