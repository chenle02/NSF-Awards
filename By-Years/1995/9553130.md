9553130 Johnson The research is primarily in the areas of reliability and
environmental hydraulic engineering, involving problems of stream channel
erosion around bridge foundations, including erosion due to local scour, channel
restorations and modifications, and lateral migration of streams, and the
reliability of the bridges as these erosional processes occur around the
foundations. Additional studies will develop a better understanding of the
erosional process, as well as develop criteria for the design and preventive
maintenance of pier foundations. Studies will examine the effect of the duration
of the peak storm discharge on the scour depth. ***
