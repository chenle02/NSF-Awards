Superconducting thin film coatings on optical fibers could offer exciting
technological possibilities. In this proposal the principal investigator will
set out to demonstrate the feasibility of coating a non-silica fiber with a high
temperature superconducting film using a pulsed laser deposition process
developed by him. Once the feasibility is demonstrated he would then like to
develop techniques to coat silica based optical fibers utilizing appropriate
buffer layers. The idea is unique for novel opto- and electronic applications.
