9317479 Stone Strengthening mechanisms in molybdenum and tantalum/nitrogen thin
films are explored using unique indentation apparatus. The film compositions are
selected as model systems to examine solid solution strengthening and the Hall-
Petch effect. Film thicknesses on the order of 2 to 5 microns are deposited on
hard substrates. Emphasis is placed on determining the effects of indentation
rate and temperature on the hardness, as a function of grain size, alloy
content, and structure form. The kinetics of plastic deformation are
characterized by load and depth sensing techniques and wafer curvature stress
measurements. Results should permit a determination of how well laws governing
the kinetics of deformation in bulk materials relate to behavior in thin films.
%%% The research will provide an improved understanding of deformation phenomena
in hard coatings. This knowledge can lead to new strategies for depositing thin
films to achieve improved properties. ***
