A general-purpose tool for computing and visualizing solutions to systems of
algebraic equations shall be built. Diverse algorithms exist for this problem
and related sub-problems. The goal of this project is also to develop a new set
of solution techniques based on multi-polynomial resultants. Our designed tool
shall be portable and allow rapid prototyping of new and existing algorithms, in
an intelligent blend of algebraic and numeric methods and real solutions.
Complex solutions can also be computed, but visualizing them is difficult. The
software shall also take advantage of any parallel hardware that is present. In
all, a substantial improvement is anticipated in the state of the art of
algebraic equation solving. Overall, the approach is to devise novel algorithmic
techniques, blend with existing methods as well as compare the relative efficacy
of the various methods. A prototype system implementing some of these goals is
built and evolving. It is written in Common Lisp and C, and runs under the
version 11 of the X window system. The system is portable to any machine that
runs vanilla Common Lisp, supports the X window system, and has at least a
rudimentary Lisp/C interface. At the present time it can solve systems of up to
two equations in any number of variables. Example applications of this are curve
and surface display, curve-curve intersections, or surface surface
intersections. A graphical user interface allows the display and manipulation of
OD (points), 1D (curves) or 2D (surface) solutions. //
