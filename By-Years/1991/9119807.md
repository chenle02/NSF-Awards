This grant will provide funds to build and fly a balloon borne solar vector
magnetograph from McMurdo, Antarctica. The instrument will have an unprecedented
spatial resolution of better than 0.2 arcseconds and is expected to make
continuous observations of the sun for a period of 1-3 weeks. The purpose of the
investigation will be to elucidate how the fibrous magnetic fields at the solar
surface emerge, coalesce, unravel and blow up in solar flares. This is important
because magnetic fields must be the root cause of flares and all other solar
activity, yet the mechanism for converting magnetic energy into heat and motion
is not understood. The grant will be jointly supported at NSF by the Polar
Aeronomy and Astrophysics Program in the Division of Polar Programs and by the
Solar-Terrestrial Program in the Division of Atmospheric Sciences and at NASA by
the Solar Physics Branch in the Space Physics Division. Logistical support will
be provided by NSF and the balloon and launch services will be provided by NASA.
