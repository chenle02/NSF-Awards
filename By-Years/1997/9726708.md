This three-year award provides support for US-France cooperative research on
fundamental problems in geometric and symbolic dynamics. The collaboration
involves research teams from University of Southern California, Rice University,
University of Northern Texas, the Mathematics Institute of Luminy and
Theoretical Physics Institute in Marseille, France. The US and French teams are
led by Luca Zamboni of the University of North Texas and Pierre Arnoux of the
Mathematics Institute of Luminy. The proposed project is an interdisciplinary
study of various geometric and symbolic dynamic problems, which arise in
mathematics, physics, and computer science. Problems to be studied include
rational mappings on the Julia set, parabolic maps, and Anosov flows on compact
manifolds. The US investigators bring to this collaboration expertise in ergodic
theory and dynamical systems. This is complemented by French expertise in
discrete mathematics, number theory, mathematical physics, and computer
sciences. The project will advance fundamental understanding of dynamical
systems.
