9629575 Wiersma The Maine Science and Technology Foundation (MSTF) will
undertake to: (1) effect positive and permanent changes in methods of supporting
research (i.e., facilities, equipment, resource allocation, etc.) and (2) reward
faculty for productivity in the University of Maine System within the context of
Maine's S&T Plan. The University of Maine (UMaine) will also undertake to effect
positive and permanent changes in how the institution supports research
competitiveness. These include: increasing available resources from both state
allocations and federal funding; redistributing University resources to provide
better support for research; focusing resources, either through new investment
or reallocation, to strengthen research areas that are critical to the state and
consistent with the goals of UMaine; enhancing personnel and facilities;
building public and private-sector support for UMaine; and increasing awareness
of S&T activities at UMaine through education and outreach. The project also:
(1) focuses investments in two S&T areas at UMaine with state-wide importance
and economic potential (fiber-reinforced polymer-wood hybrid and aquaculture);
(2) strengthens the partnerships between UMaine, MSTF, NSF, the business
community, and the legislature; and (4) identifies principal barriers to
research competitiveness at multiple levels and outlines a multi-pronged
strategy for overcoming them.
