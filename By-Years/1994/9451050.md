9451050 Breen The following proposal requests funds to purchase a high
performance capillary electrophoresis (CE) system. Such a system would permit
this exciting new development in separation science and chemical analysis to be
incorporated into our undergraduate chemistry curriculum through a defined set
of laboratory experiments. As designed, these experiments will impact our
Analytical and Biological chemistry laboratories in a way likely to provide a
model used by other institutions. Our plan of development includes: an
introduction to CE principles and methodologies in both laboratory experiences;
the development of experiments which demonstrate the micellar electrokinetic
chromatographic mode for the separation of neutral molecules and the effects of
chiral selectors for the separation of enantiomers in our Analytical
Laboratories; an emphasis in the Biological Chemistry Laboratory on capillary
gel electrophoresis as applied to the separation of proteins and nucleic acids
and as a biophysical tool to assist in measuring the interactions between
biological macromolecules. The requested instrument will have a significant
impact on the training of our students and will provide cutting-edge educational
opportunities that do not currently exist in our undergraduate curriculum.
