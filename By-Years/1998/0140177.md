The proposes a two-fold research plan for the purpose of producing the first
generation of self-biased ferrite circulator devices. In the first research plan
he develops techniques to prepare composite ferrite/dielectric materials
consisting of dielectric paste filling material and oriented hexaferrite
particles. In the second phase of the research plan, he will utilize the special
properties of the composites to design and test circulation devices from 1 to 20
GHz. He anticipates that the performance of the self-biased circulators to
behave similarly to circulators using spinel and garnet ferrites in terms of
frequency bandwidth of operation, insertion loss and isolation. Whereas the
traditional circulator devices is characterized by the so-called "puck" design,
his design will integrate the circulator devices into a semiconductor/dielectric
substrate utilizing the well known thick film glass on screen print
technolagies. In addition, the self-biased hexaferrite circulators proposed here
will do away with permanent magnets which in most cases occupy considerable
space in a microwave circuit board. Reduction in circulator size translates into
reduction of fabrication costs and increased efficiency in the performance of
the overall microwave circuit board. The research program comprises of
preparation of composites of hexaferrites and dielectric paste on glass,
characterization of the oriented ferrite composite materials, fabrication of
stripline/microstrip circulators, testing of the circulators and modeling of the
microwave and static properties of the composite materials.
