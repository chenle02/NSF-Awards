9705440 Gibson This FRG/GOALI proposal addresses basic materials science and
engineering issues in a collaborative program between the University of Illinois
and Hewlett-Packard Laboratories to understand fundamental phenomena and
interactions associated with naturally nanostructured epitaxial semiconductors.
Goals of the project are to obtain semiconductor epitaxial nanostructures
smaller than feasible via lithography, and to examine their applications to
novel devices; strain-induced self organization and kinetically driven pattern
formation are two approaches being taken to achieve naturally nanostructured
materials. The joint activities include staff exchange with graduate students
spending time at H-P, and with additional staff exchange between U. IL and H-P
personnel. The proposed research emphasizes understanding of fundamental
mechanisms and processes along with exploration of advanced device technology.
%%% The project addresses forefront materials science research issues in a
topical area of materials science having high technological relevance. The
research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a fundamental
level to important aspects of electronic/photonic devices and integrated
circuitry, in general. Additionally, the fundamental knowledge and understanding
gained from the research is expected to contribute to improving the performance
of advanced devices and circuits by providing a fundamental understanding and a
basis for designing and producing improved materials and structures for the
quantum mechanical devices of the future. An important feature of the program is
the integration of research and education through the training of students in a
fundamentally and technologically significant area, and with the benefit of
teaming with industrial research staff, and exposure to industrial facilities,
equipment and approaches. ***
