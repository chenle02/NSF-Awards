With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at Grinnell College will acquire an upgrade of a 400 MHz
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) Spectrometer. This equipment will enable
researchers to carry out studies on a) the characterization, structure and
investigation of new reactivity of novel organotungsten-tin complexes; and b)
ion transport in conducting siloxane polymers important for the development of
novel lithium battery materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic
Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to
chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to
identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms
within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in
solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists
who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will
have an impact in synthetic inorganic chemistry and materials chemistry.
