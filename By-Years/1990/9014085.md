Analog tape records of the electric fields of lightning flashes, which occurred
during seventeen Florida thunderstorms, will be analyzed for statistical
properties of various lightning processes. We will digitize data from our analog
tape records; particular attention will be paid to: (1) microsecond-scale pulses
associated with continuing current, K-processes, M- components, preliminary
breakdown, and leaders in negative ground flashes, (2) the shapes of M-component
field changes in negative ground flashes, (3) the characteristics of ground
flashes that can be used to predict the presence of continuing current, (4)
positive flashes to earth, and (5) microsecond-scale pulses in cloud flashes.
Lightning models will be derived or modified based on the results of the
analyses.
