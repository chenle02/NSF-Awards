This proposal focuses on the study of geometric, analytic and
&lt;br/&gt;information-theoretic aspects of high dimensional
phenomena&lt;br/&gt;on the border of probability, convex geometry and analysis.
&lt;br/&gt;One part of the project concerns the problem of rates
of&lt;br/&gt;convergence in the entropic central limit theorem, and is devoted
&lt;br/&gt;to obtaining new asymptotic expansions for the relative entropy
&lt;br/&gt;with respect to the growing dimension. In other part, &lt;br/&gt;it
is proposed to perform a systematic study of the &lt;br/&gt;dimensional behavior
of the entropy and information for &lt;br/&gt;different classes of probability
distributions, satisfying &lt;br/&gt;convexity conditions. In particular, new
concentration properties &lt;br/&gt;of the information content will be
considered for dependent &lt;br/&gt;high-dimensional data. It is planned to
introduce and explore &lt;br/&gt;special positions of probability measures,
responsible for &lt;br/&gt;correct behaviour of sums of independent
summands&lt;br/&gt;(when the entropy power inequality can be
reversed).&lt;br/&gt;Another part addresses the stability problem, raised by Kac
&lt;br/&gt;and McKean, in the entropic variant of
Cramer's&lt;br/&gt;characterization of the normal
law.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main theme of the proposal is the
development of the &lt;br/&gt;information-theoretic approach to high dimensional
phenomena,&lt;br/&gt;with focus on obtaining new asymptotic bounds on the
entropy and &lt;br/&gt;information. The study of entropy is dictated by various
&lt;br/&gt;applications within and beyond pure mathematics. Entropy plays
&lt;br/&gt;a key role in statistical physics (in order to capture&lt;br/&gt;the
amount of disorder in a system), in statistics&lt;br/&gt;(to measure the
performance of statistical estimators),&lt;br/&gt;in engineering and
mathematical theory of communication.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research also aims
to provide new connections between &lt;br/&gt;probability, geometric functional
analysis and information theory,&lt;br/&gt;and to demonstrate an increasing role
of entropy&lt;br/&gt;bounds in purely mathematical
fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An integral component of the project is the
involvement and &lt;br/&gt;training of the graduate and undergraduate students.
