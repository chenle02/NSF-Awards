Sonia Ryang, professor of anthropology in the University of Iowa, will undertake
research on how culture and personality are developed and maintained in
totalitarian contexts. Dr. Ryang explores this in the context of North Korea,
one of the most reclusive totalitarian regimes in the world. Three specific aims
are pursued in this research: (1) to place North Korea in the context of
currently existing anthropological knowledge; (2) to render the mechanism that
secures the connection between the people and the leader in North Korea
intelligible; (3) to explore the concept of agency, with the focus on the
concept of self, in North Korea. The research involves multi-lingual, multi-
media, and mixed-method approach by comprehensively surveying and analyzing
written and audio-visual materials in three languages of Korean, Japanese and
English, combined with interviews with North Korean refugees.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will contribute to anthropological and broader
social scientific understandings of totalitarianism by exploring the cultural
logics that are used to rationalize and sustain it within these societies.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In contributing to our understanding of a part of the
world that we know very little about, a nuclear-armed nation with whom the
United States has had over a half-century of hostilities, the project
contributes significantly to improving national security. The most famous of the
early culture and personality studies in anthropology were watershed studies of
Japan during World War II, which were enormously influential to the U.S.
Government both during and after the war.
