The National Research Council is preparing a study of the intellectual frontiers
now developing in chemical engineering and the opportunities the frontiers
present for responding to societal needs. The study is conducted by a Committee
on Chemical Engineering Frontiers, which will produce a document outlining
research needs and opportunities that will be useful to program officers and
administrators at the National Science Foundation and other sources of funds for
chemical engineering research. The Committee is composed of about 25
distinguished chemical and process engineers from universities and industry. The
Committee is sub-divided into seven sub-panels as follows: Energy and Natural
Resources Processing; Biochemical and Biomedical Engineering; Advanced
Materials; Chemical Engineering Aspects of Electronic, Photonic, and Recording
Materials and Devices; Environmental Protection, Safety, and Hazardous
Materials; Computer-Assisted Process and Control Engineering; and Surface and
Interfacial Engineering.
