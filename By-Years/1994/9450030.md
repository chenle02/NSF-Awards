9450030 Whitney This project, Advocates for Women in Science, Engineering, and
Mathematics (AWSEM), is designed to create and support a regional network of
science and technology practitioners, educator, parents, and community
organizations committed to the enrichment of opportunities in science,
engineering, and mathematics for young women. The project's structure will
support the development of materials and resources to deliver activities and
career information on science and technology to intermediate and high school
girls, and will lay the foundation for long-term continuation of these efforts.
Strategies for implementation include the expansion and maintenance of a
comprehensive database of science practitioners, students, parents, and
educators. The Project will act as a central reference center offering resources
to assist local communities in encouraging young women to study science and
mathematics. A cadre of advocates will disseminate career information, organize
hands-on experiences, promote mentorships, facilitate tutoring, and showcase
practitioners in science and technical fields. ***
