9355706 Meisner University of North Carolina at Greensboro Technology Tools for
Science and Mathematics Learning The UNC Greensboro, in cooperation with nine
other universities, provides summer workshops on the uses of technology and
follow up support for teachers from twenty school systems in the state. In
collaboration with universities, other education agencies, and all state school
systems, 230 inservice and 170 preservice teachers are trained to use the
current technologies that are available as tools to enhance science and
mathematics learning. Teachers from 135 schools each participate in a two-year
enhancement program, meeting for two weeks each of the two summers and 12
additional days during the school year. Topics include computer software, data
probes, data storage, and telecomputing. E-mail and database support are
provided through the state system for teachers known as NEWTON. The summer
workshops are organized with the mornings dedicated to the teachers learning the
tools and the afternoon to hands-on work with the technology. The staggered
plan, the multiple settings, and the supporting communications technologies
enable teachers to work with their peers throughout the school year. Cost
sharing is estimated at 109%. ***
