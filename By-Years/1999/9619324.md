9619324 Horwitz Summary: The project works with 200 teachers over two years to
develop a scripting tool that teachers could use in conjunction with a
previously NSF funded product, GenScope. Participating teachers are drawn from
Boston Public Schools and the seventeen neighboring districts. In the first
year, the project explores how teachers can use scripts and what parameters
would make a scripting tool most useful for them. In the second year, a full
prototype is tested with the teachers. Teachers are offered workshops, in-class
assistance, and internetworked support services. Through this project they can
create their own computer-based activities running in conjunction with GenScope.
