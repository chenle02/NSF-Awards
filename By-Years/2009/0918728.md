This proposal, from the University of Notre Dame, requests funds to develop a
Preliminary Design for a two-accelerator facility underground at DUSEL. The goal
for the Dakota Ion Accelerators for Nuclear Astrophysics (DIANA) facility is to
address three long standing fundamental problems in nuclear astrophysics: Solar
neutrino sources and the core metallicity of the sun, carbon-based
nucleosynthesis, and neutron sources for the production of trans-Fe elements in
stars.

The award, through a Cooperative Agreement with the University of Notre Dame,
will fund the design of this facility intended to provide the identification of
new observational signatures such as neutrinos from the sun and distant
supernovae and is closely interwoven with underground neutrino physics. The use
of underground low-energy accelerator facilities, as demonstrated by the
Laboratory for Underground Nuclear Astrophysics (LUNA) at the Gran Sasso
underground laboratory in Italy, has pioneered the field, but at the same time
has demonstrated enormous deficiencies in our knowledge of low-energy stellar
reactions. The facility will host a large number of graduate student and
postdoctoral researchers and users. Small-scale facilities such as DIANA are
ideal to train future generations in many aspects of nuclear physics such as
nuclear reaction physics, radiation shielding, detector techniques, data
analysis, and material analysis. Training professionals in these areas is
essential for the national needs in medicine, energy production, defense,
industry, and government.
