The efficient use of bandwidth for multimedia information transmission depends
on the efficient use of imperfect channels, such as coaxial cables and optical
fibers. This means redundant information must be removed and what remains must
be coded for reliable transmission. This research is addressing the problems of
redundancy removal (source coding) from the point of view of multichannel
filterbanks; it is also addressing the problem of efficiently implementing
filterbanks in digital electronics. Specifically, we are studying applications
of undersampling operators, oversampling operators, and tight frames to source
coding, channel coding and halftoning. The aim of this research is to develop
efficient state variable realizations for tight frames and related maps, and to
determine the computational complexity and performance characteristics of these
realizations. Of particular interest are sum of all-pass realizations for
multichannel filterbanks. The results will produce insights and design rules for
implementing source coders and channel coders in state variable filterbanks that
have good numerical properties.
