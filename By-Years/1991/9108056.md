The goal of this project is to produce an extensive grammar of West-Greenlandic
Eskimo. The grammar will contain technical and non-technical descriptions to
suit the needs of both linguists and Native speakers. This research will serve
as a basis for the production of manuals for related languages in Greenland,
Canada, Alaska and Siberia and contribute to the preservation and revitalization
of Native languages and cultures throughout the Arctic.
