To complete her doctoral dissertation research Ms. Rani Alexander, under the
direction of Dr. Robert Santley, will conduct archaeological and ethnohistoric
research in the region of Yaxuna, Yucatan, Mexico. She will focus on the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries A.D., the period during which the local
rural economy of this region became increasingly incorporated into the broader
Spanish colonial economy. Through examination of abundant documentary resources
she will be able to trace this process in some detail. Excavation of several
sites will allow on-the-ground reconstruction of patterns of consumption,
settlement and houselot organization. Comparison of these two bodies of data
will then permit elucidation of the material correlates of economic change.
While archaeologists who study the development of complex societies have long
been interested in the mechanisms through which such entities expand, their
focus has been on core or central areas to the detriment of outlying regions. In
fact methodologies to determine how such areas were economically changed have
not been developed. Robust techniques do not exist to ask such questions of
archaeological data. Because documentary evidence in the Yaxuna region is
excellent and recent development has not obscured most archaeological sites,
this part of Yucatan provides an excellent controlled context to conduct such
research. This research is important not only for the light it will shed on
Mexican history but also for the analytic techniques which will be developed.
These should be useful to archaeologists in many parts of the world. Because Ms.
Alexander will employ and help train a Mexican field assistant, she will make a
direct contribution to developing the archaeological infrastructure in Mexico.
