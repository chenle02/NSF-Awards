This experimental research program focuses on the continuation of recent
advances in a variety of experiments utilizing transitions between atomic states
with long coherence times. These experiments use atoms to address the most
fundamental issues in elementary particle physics, such as time-reversal
symmetry and possible variation of fundamental constants. A major effort is to
continue the search for a permanent atomic electric dipole moment (EDM), which
can exist only if time-reversal symmetry is violated. A second major project,
with optically cooled and trapped ytterbium atoms, builds on the group's recent
demonstration of Sisyphus cooling in the odd isotopes of ytterbium to explore
the extraordinarily sharp optical interval between the ground state and the
metastable state. The long-range goal is to develop optical clocks of sufficient
stability to measure time variations of fundamental quantities such as the fine
structure constant alpha at the level of one part in 10 to the 18 per year. In
terms of human resources, it is noteworthy that in the previous grant period,
one postdoc, two of the graduate students and six of the undergraduate
participants have been women, a strong argument for the diversity within the
program.
