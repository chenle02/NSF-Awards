This award supports cooperative research in molecular biophysics to be
conducted by Prof. John J. Hopfield at the California Institute of Technology
and Dr. David Beratan of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (Caltech) and Prof. Jose
Nelson Onuchic of the Sao Carlos Institute of Physics and Chemistry, University
of Sao Paulo, Brazil. They will construct a microscopic predictive model for
biological charge (electron) transfer reactions in proteins. Specifically,
predictions for the relative rates (and distance and temperature dependence) of
electron transfer in isomers of heme proteins will be developed. These electron
tranfer reactions are basic to nearly all energetic processes in biological
systems and therefore are of great interest at the present time. Both Prof.
Hopfield and Dr. Beratan will visit San Carlos. Only Dr. Beratan's travel will
be supported by this grant. They will work with Prof. Onuchic to calculate
matrix elements for different isomers in myoglobin derivatives after myoglobin
crystal structures have been examined in different ways in both Brazil and the
U.S. During visits to Caltech by Prof. Onuchic, transport temperature dependence
will be calculated and new methods of calculation will be considered. Finally
the molecular parameters of electron transfer will be worked out. The advanced
computing facilities (Cray) at JPL will be used along with a VAX in Brazil as
well as EPR and optical techniques in use by Brazilian experimental groups
studying protein dynamics. Important scientific contributions will be made that
could not be done so well by these groups working alone.
