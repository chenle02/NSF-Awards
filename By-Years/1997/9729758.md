ABSTRACT This proposal is to fund innovative exploratory research on producing
polymer optical fibers with specified optical index profiles. By controlling the
optical index profile, modal dispersion of the signal can be minimized and the
speed of transmission can be increased from several Mbit/sec to the Gbit/sec
range. The goal of the project is to develop a continuous drawing method that
can be used to fabricate graded-index fibers efficiently. The Principal
Investigator proposes to use photobleaching to control the optical index. As
fibers are draw, oxygen or air is allowed to diffuse into them. The fibers is
then irradiated by UV light. Because the concentration of oxygen at the outer
region of the fiber is higher, photobleaching occurs at a higher rate, resulting
in a spatially varying optical index. Experiments will be conducted to explore
this concept of fabrication.
