Aschbacher and S. Smith recently completed the classification of the
finite&lt;br/&gt;simple quasithin groups. This work fills a significant gap in
the&lt;br/&gt; classification of the finite simple groups. Aschbacher and Smith
are&lt;br/&gt; editing their manuscript to make it ready for publication.
Aschbacher&lt;br/&gt; is continuing his project to produce a unified,
accessible, and&lt;br/&gt;complete treatment of the existence, uniqueness, and
structure of the&lt;br/&gt;sporadic groups. He is writing up his work on
recognition theorems&lt;br/&gt; for small groups with one class of involutions.
He is working with&lt;br/&gt; R. Guralnick and K. Magaard on lower bounds on the
genus of coverings&lt;br/&gt; with a classical monodromy group. He is
investigating the p-radical&lt;br/&gt;subgroups of the sporadic
groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Groups are algebraic objects of crucial importance
in mathematics; for&lt;br/&gt;example they are the basis for the study of
symmetry. Finite groups can&lt;br/&gt; be decomposed into building blocks know
as ``simple groups"; the&lt;br/&gt; classification theorem lists the simple
groups explicitly.&lt;br/&gt; Together with descriptions of the structure and
representations of the&lt;br/&gt;simple groups, the classification theorem forms
the foundation for the modern&lt;br/&gt;theory of finite groups. Several years
ago it was discovered that an&lt;br/&gt; important case in the classification
had not been completely treated.&lt;br/&gt; Aschbacher and his collaborator S.
Smith have now dealt with this case and&lt;br/&gt;are readying their manuscript
for publication, in order to place the&lt;br/&gt;classification theorem on solid
ground. The completion of this work,&lt;br/&gt; together with efforts to answer
certain questions about the structure&lt;br/&gt; and representations of the
simple groups, make up the project.&lt;br/&gt;
