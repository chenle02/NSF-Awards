The Institute for Mechanics and Materials promotes research and education
activities at the interface of materials engineering and solid mechanics. A
number of workshops are conducted to bring forth major challenges in these
areas. A number of pre-doctoral fellowships are supported that promote
interaction of researchers with the industrial community. Several national and
international visitors are invited to the Institute to bring new ideas together
and to promote collaborative work.
