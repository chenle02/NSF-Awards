This research is on a unified way to consider both timing and geometric
constraints during the placement process. The approach is to convert timing
constraints to geometric shapes using "defined windows". A window represents a
region in which all the modules along a given path can be placed without
degrading the circuit performance. Then, based on the window information, a
constructive placement process is used to select an unplaced module and to find
an appropriate position for the module. Algorithms for the following issues are
being studied: path elimination, window and region construction, module
selection, module placement and path breaking, and slack distribution.
