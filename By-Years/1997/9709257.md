*** 9709257 DUNLAP This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and
Facilities (CRIF) Program will assist the Department of Chemistry at the
University of South Carolina to acquire an upgrade of the data acquisition and
analysis system of an existing mass spectrometer. This equipment will enhance
research in a number of areas including the following: (1) amino acids modified
by carbohydrate and lipid, (2) polythio- and polyselenoether macrocycles of
varying sizes useful as ligands for heavy metals, (3) unique
poly(pyrazolyl)borate coordination complexes, and (4) electrically conducting
polymers of precise length and composition. Mass spectrometry (MS) is a
technique used to probe intimate structural details and to obtain the molecular
compositions of a vast array of organic, bioorganic, and organometallic
molecules. The addition of the technique of electrospray extends the range of MS
to protein and nucleic acid molecular weights far beyond any other technique.
The use of electrospray ionization in combination with high resolution provides
the latest technique available in mass spectrometry. It affords the chemist one
of the most powerful tools available for the characterization of compounds. The
acquisition of this capability in mass spectrometry is essential for the
prosecution of frontier research in many fields of chemistry. ***
