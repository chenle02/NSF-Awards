Jenkins&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0228975&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will examine the
crystal structure, pressure-temperature stability, and thermochemical properties
of several members of a new class of silicate minerals known as the triple-chain
silicates. Research will begin with the most readily made triple-chain silicate,
Na4Mg8Si12O32(OH)4 = Na-Cjt, which is the sodium-bearing analogue of the
naturally occurring mineral clino-jimthompsonite. The experimental investigation
of the pressure-temperature stability of Na-Cjt breaking down to a Na-Mg-bearing
double chain silicate (amphibole) will provide a valuable foundation for
studying other triple-chain silicates. An important aspect of this study is the
measurement of the third-law entropy and enthalpy of formation of Na-Cjt, which
will be made in the labs operated by Prof. J. Boerio-Goates at Brigham Young
University and by Prof. A. Navrotsky at the University of California, Davis,
respectively. The thermodynamic properties of Ca-clinojimthompsonite
(Ca2Mg8Si12O32(OH)4) will be determined, to a first approximation, by
experimentally investigating the shift of the Na-Cjt stability curve as Ca is
added to both the triple- and double-chain phases and using simple ideal-
activity expressions to estimate the activities of the end-member phases. The
broader scientific contribution of this study is that it is the first attempt to
provide experimental and calorimetric data for a class of silicate minerals that
is becoming increasingly recognized in nature but for which there is no solid
information on their pressure-temperature-composition field of stability. This
study may also draw attention of Earth scientists to the role that Na-Cjt may
play in storing Na in the oceanic lithosphere. &lt;br/&gt;
