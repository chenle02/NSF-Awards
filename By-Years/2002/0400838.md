This MPS Distinguished International Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (MPS-DRF)
award supports a 24-month research project in the area of quantum information
theory, a field that brings together various disciplines such as engineering,
computer science, mathematics, and physics. The power of quantum information
processing lies in the unique properties of superposition states and
entanglement. Decoherence destroys the fragile superposition states and
entanglement properties of the quantum bits of information. Sonja Daffer will
work with Prof. Peter L. Knight, FRS and his group at Imperial College in
London, England to study implementation and decoherence in quantum information
processing.

Funding for this award is provided by the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary
Activities.
