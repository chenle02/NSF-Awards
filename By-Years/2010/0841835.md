Understanding the deployment of cognitive, affective, metacognitive, and
motivation (CAMM) processes in the context of hypermedia learning is key to
understanding the linear, iterative, and dynamic unfolding of these processes
during self-regulated learning (SRL) among successful and unsuccessful learners.
However, this is a very difficult problem. The goal of this exploratory project
is to use cutting-edge sensors (i.e., physiological devices (e.g., EMG sensors),
video capturing and recording devices, eye-tracking equipment, and voice
recording to attempt to systematically capture, identify, and analyze the
deployment of these processes during complex learning. This project will extend
current theoretical,methodological, and analytical methods and tools by: (1)
studying how students accomplish learning goals during SRL with hypermedia by
experimentally inducing specific SRL processes through the deliberate design of
a hypermedia environment; (2) examining the fluctuations in the CAMM processes
and how they are related to learning outcomes; and (3) establishing research
protocols that maximize researchers? ability to converge and concurrently
collect the temporal deployment of CAMM states during SRL with hypermedia via
the use of several physiological sensors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader
impact of this research includes the design and development of learning
interventions for adaptive computer-based learning environments designed to
detect, model, trace, and foster students? self-regulated learning. More
specifically, instructional prescriptions will be derived focusing on key
learning issues such as adaptivity, the role of metacognitive monitoring and
control, and the regulation of motivation and affect during hypermedia
learning.&lt;br/&gt;
