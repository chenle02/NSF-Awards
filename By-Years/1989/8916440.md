Ample evidence from petrographic and geochemical studies supports the
hypothesis that fluid movement in sedimentary basins has a significant control
on chemical diagenetic processes. Computer models allow reconstruction of basin
paleohydrology and allow prediction of chemical reactions and mass transfer, but
computational requirements of integrated models of chemical reaction-fluid flow
normally result in one or other part of the calculations being overly
simplistic. The proposed research involves integrating the results of separate
paleohydrologic and chemical predictions to constrain diagenetic pathways in
sedimentary basins. The approach is to use results from a completed study of the
paleohydrologic evolution of the Gulf of Mexico basin to constrain temperatures,
pressures, gas fugacities, and fluid:rock ratios in calculations of mineral-pore
water interactions, which will be made using the EQ3/6 software package.
Preliminary results show that predicted diagenetic sequences for Lower Tertiary
Gulf of Mexico sandstones are in close agreement with sequences determined
petrographically. Calculations of volumes of minerals precipitating and
dissolving show that most modifications occur during early diagensis or
immediately after a change in paleohydrologic regime. Proposed research will
involve the further investigation of these preliminary results, including
construction of hypothetical diagenetic pathways in several common hydrologic
settings and will include a thermodynamic evaluation of the role of organic
acids in enhancing mineral solubilities and the prediction of isotopic
compositions of minerals and pore waters in each diagenetic pathway. Results
from this research will improve our understanding of chemical diagenesis in
sedimentary basins in general, and the Gulf of Mexico basin in particular, and
will provide important guidelines for the development of combined chemical
reaction- fluid flow computer algorithms and the interpretation of results from
such calculations.
