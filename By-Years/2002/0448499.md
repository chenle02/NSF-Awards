Increasingly important social processes are migrating to an increasingly
decentralized, inter-organizational information infrastructure. This work
investigates the resulting trust issues. Are there grounds for one entity,
Alice, to trust a remote entity Bob, with a particular task? When such grounds
exist, how can this information be securely transmitted across the boundaries
that separate Bob from Alice? Do Alice's applications and tools enable her to
make the appropriate trust judgment?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research begins
with the technology of public key infrastructure (PKI), because it can
communicate assertions without sharing secrets, and trusted computing platforms,
because of they can potentially create islands of trust within a distributed
infrastructure. The research will catalog archetypical examples of mismatches
between current technology and human trust requirements, designe a series of
experimental systems that seek to eliminate these mismatches, build the
strongest design candidates, validate these designs in real pilot systems, and
formalize the resulting design criteria. By creating a framework that ties PKI
and trusted computing to the core problem of human trust, this project will
advance understanding of the technology necessary to support trust and hasten
the realization of that trustworthiness in our society's information
infrastructure.
