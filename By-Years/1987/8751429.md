Gottfried Walt Gillette The New Mexico Museum of Natural History in Albuquerque
will design and construct a 6,250 square foot permanent exhibit on the geology
and biology of the intracontinental Cretaceous Period seacoast environment of
New Mexico. Using more than 20 interactive exhibits as well as modern and
extinct plant and animal species, visitors will experience and explore this
ancient, yet familiar world and develop a sense of the relationships between
past and present, living and dead, extinction and survival as well as the
continuity of natural processes. The Museum will also construct related
traveling exhibits for statewide display and install semi-permanent satellite
exhibits in four communities that have relevant geologic and paleontologic
resources. Exhibition designs will be based on formal and informal studies of
exhibit effectiveness, systematic study of learning styles of visitors to the
New Mexico Museum of Natural History, and interaction with schools throughout
New Mexico. This new natural history museum has an impressive staff, a record of
institutional development and of state-wide community service, and a clear plan
for carrying out informal science education with regional themes that serve the
varied populations of New Mexico. The museum presently receives about 375,000
visits a year, of which 70,000 are in organized school groups with 45% Hispanic
and/or Native American children. There is a substantial outreach program and
extensive relationships with teachers and schools throughout the region. This
$1.6-million exhibit project is supported by $840,000 of state funds and
$500,000 in private contributions. A National Science Foundation award of
$298,886 for FY87 is recommended.
