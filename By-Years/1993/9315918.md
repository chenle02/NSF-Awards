9315918 Zhang This project proposes to explore further the potential of applying
homogenous reaction kinetics to geospeedometry. The kinetics of different
homogeneous reactions for various thermal histories will be examined
systematically and quantitatively with theoretical analysis and numerical
simulations. The effect of parameters such as activation energies of forward and
backward reactions, pre-exponential factors, cooling rates, and diffusion on the
kinetics of different reactions during cooling will be quantitatively evaluated.
The kinetics of the interconversion of hydrous species in rhyolitic glasses will
be characterized experimentally. The variation of speciation with time will be
used to extract reaction rate coefficients and reaction mechanisms, which will
enable scientists to constrain the thermal history of volcanic glasses and
understand more completely volcanic processes.
