This document proposes a 12-month qualitative evaluation-with-research study of
the Significant Opportunities in Atmospheric Research and Science (SOARS)
program, a multi-year undergraduate and graduate research and mentoring program
for groups that are underrepresented in the sciences. Through its multi-faceted
program of summer research projects, explicit attention to development of
scientific skills, and multiple mentoring of every student, SOARS seeks to
promote these students' interest in the sciences, to encourage and facilitate
their success in undergraduate and graduate science programs, and to enable them
to become professional scientists.
