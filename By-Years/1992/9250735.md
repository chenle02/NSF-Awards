A computer laboratory is being developed which will integrate symbolic,
numerical, and graphical tools into the elementary calculus course in the form
of a laboratory-workshop setting. This approach enables students to explore the
fundamental concepts and applications of calculus in an atmosphere conducive to
peer collaboration. In addition, the upper- division mathematics modeling course
is being restructured to include Mathematica as a tool for problem solving.
