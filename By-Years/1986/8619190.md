Mechanical face seals are used in many industrial applications such as
turbopumps, rocket engines, and chemical processing equipments to protect
against loss of fluids in rotating equipment. The non-contact operation in these
seals is achieved by permitting the sealed fluid to penetrate between the mating
surfaces to provide means of lubrication. The purpose of the proposed
investigation is to study the dynamic characteristics of face seals to provide a
computer model for performance prediction. The project is a combined theoretical
and experimental program. Once the theoretical model is verified by experiments,
a computer model will be developed. This research and development will advance
the state of knowledge in seal design.
