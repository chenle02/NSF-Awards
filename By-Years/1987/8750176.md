Using the scanning electron microscope (SEM), a critical point dryer and a
sputter coater, the College is bringing to its Biology curriculum a new upper-
division course on the Principles and Methods of Scanning Electron Microscopy.
Students enrolling in this course gain enhanced understanding of the methods of
scientific investigation, greater ability to interpret biological structure, and
improved technical skills. An important additional benefit of the facility is
the increased opportunity for student research it affords. A substantial
fraction of the Department's graduating group of 15 majors annually will have
done independent work in ultrastructure. Pre-service Biology teachers, plus
upperclassmen from chemistry, geology and physics, also will have access to the
SEM and ancillary specimen preparation equipment. Topics include election optics
(theory, lenses, resolution), SEM design and operation, specimen preparative
techniques (fixation, dehydration, coating), interpretation of images
(measurement and shrinkage), surface labelling, elemental analysis, SEM
applications to a wide range of organisms and questions, and laboratory safety.
The SEM capability is having a valuable secondary impact on the Department's
work in Developmental Biology, Plant Anatomy, Systemmatic Botany and Entomology,
among others. Since SEM preparation does not require time-consuming thin
sectioning, it is superior to transmission electromicroscopy in this wide
variety of undergraduate applications.
