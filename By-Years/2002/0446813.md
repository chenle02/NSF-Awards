Response time, the elapsed time in a laboratory experiment between the
presentation of a signal to respond and an action that stops the clock is among
the oldest and most widely used ways to gauge cognitive performance. The
response times from these basic cognitive acts provide a wealth of information
that may inform scientists about the principals that govern cognitive
performance. It was recently recognized that the patterns of intrinsic
variability that emerge in response times, as a person repeatedly engages in a
wide range of cognitive acts, suggests a link to a recently formalized class of
physical systems, called self-organizing systems. Self-organizing systems
display emergent properties-ordered temporal and spatial patterns that do not
reduce to the properties of the fundamental components from which the system is
comprised. It is the flexibility and exquisite contextual sensitivity of self-
organizing systems that implies they may supply promising metaphors for
understanding the complexity and diversity of human thought and action. With the
help of National Science Foundation support, Dr. Holden's research is aimed at
formally testing the degree to which research hypotheses derived from the
principals of self-organization and complex systems theory are able account for
empirical patterns of response time, across a host of cognitive activities. This
work has the potential to allow a better understanding of skill acquisition and
skilled performance. More generally, it may better inform scientists about how
the human body, nervous system, and mind coordinate the myriad processes that
support and constrain human thought and action, and enhance the links between
cognitive science and complex systems science. Furthermore, this research
entails training and mentoring opportunities for groups not historically
represented in the sciences, and is being conducted at a DOE-certified Hispanic
serving institution that emphasizes undergraduate education.
