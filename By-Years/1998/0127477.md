Computer Science (31)&lt;br/&gt;Bioinformatics brings together the fields of
biology, computer science, and information technology to analyze, among other
things, the gigabytes of genome data that have been collected over the past
fifteen years. The work that will be done by bioinformaticists in the 21st
century will dramatically change the practice of medicine much like the
discovery of the transistor altered the course of information technology in the
20th century. The national need for bioinformaticists, estimated by one study to
be 20,000 by the year 2005, with the education and training to speak the complex
languages of biology and computer science will not be met by one institution
alone. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to develop courseware
for general use in diverse contexts at other institutions, even those without a
degree program in Bioinformatics. This project provides a packet of lecture
presentations and laboratory manuals that can be widely disseminated and used by
teams of biologists and computer scientists outside of RIT to support
instruction in Bioinformatics. These instructional materials are being developed
by an interdisciplinary team of biologists and computer scientists with input
from academic partners from outside institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work
includes supporting material, prepared by computer scientists, written for
biologists so that a biologist can understand the computational processes being
utilized to analyze the biological data. Likewise supporting material, prepared
by biologists, written for computer scientists will be developed so that a
computer scientist can understand the basic biological processes being analyzed.
