This proposal requests funds to obtain an ultracentrifuge, a UV.VIS
spectrophotometer, a liquid scintillation counter and an HPLC system. All items
will be used in several research programs that involve undergraduate students in
the research. The projects include: (a) the regulation of genes involved in cell
differentiation in cyanobacteria, (b) evolution of flavoniods in the plant
family Onagracieae, (c) biochemistry and molecular biology of pine wilt
nematode, (d) the role of nutritional components of saliva in social evolution
of wasps, (e) ecology and physiology of tropical understory plants and (f)
carbohydrate and energy metabolism in intestinal parasites.
