This project investigates the speculative possibility of storing energy in
turbulent fluid-like eddies, compressing these eddies so as to further increase
the turbulent energy. The significance of this possibility is that energy in
eddies acts differently than random energy because neighboring molecules tend to
move in the same direction. This possibility can be particularly important in an
ionized gas, a plasma. First, plasma can be inviscid on the time scales of
compression, such as occurs naturally in certain molecular clouds or, in the
laboratory, in Z-pinches, thereby enabling the increase of turbulent energy.
Second, there are important processes in plasma, such as radiation or nuclear
fusion, whose efficiency is highly dependent on this relative motion. A case in
point is the Z-pinch, which is a cylindrical plasma device where current running
in the axial direction produces a magnetic field that compresses plasma
radially. Recent spectroscopic data taken at the Weizmann Institute of Science
suggests that the energy in a Z-pinch can be dominated by the motion of
hydrodynamic turbulent eddies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has been previously shown
that self-consistent accounting for the turbulent eddy energy leads to greater
consistency in the stagnation Z-pinch data. One aspect of the present project is
to use this approach to develop a quasi equation of state for compressing
turbulence. It was also predicted that, under compression, plasma abruptly
becomes viscous, so that there can be a sudden catastrophic release of the
turbulent energy into random ion energy, thereby suddenly enabling processes
that rely on thermal motion. Thus, a second aspect of the project is to explore
both the ramifications of this curious effect, which occurs in plasma but not
neutral gas, as well as to explore how this effect may be affected under a
variety of experimental conditions. This work will involve collaboration between
Princeton University and the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, and will
be performed under the umbrella of the Memorandum of Understanding on Research
Cooperation between NSF and the US-Israel Binational Science
Foundation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
