The Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Undergraduate Program (HBCU-
UP) funds conferences as a means of discussing and disseminating best practices
in science, technology, engineering and mathematics education at HBCUs. The goal
of the conference at Virginia State University is to review successful programs
at selected HBCUs that help retain students from groups underrepresented in STEM
majors with a focus on mathematics preparation. The conference allows for the
sharing of information about student skill development programs and to discuss
replication by other institutions.

The programs to be reviewed at the conferences include: the K-12 Algebra Project
pedagogy for college-level mathematics courses; Project Knowledge which focuses
on building academic skills and motivation during the critical first three
semesters of college; partnerships of HBCUs with local school districts; and
interventions using cognitive skills training that improve the mathematics
performance of African American college students. Specific aims are to:
disseminate information on effective interventions for improving mathematics
performance in African American STEM majors; provide opportunities for
participants to share best practices that are having an impact at HBCUs; and
provide networking opportunities for future faculty training in these
interventions so that they can be applied at other institutions. The project is
informed by an on-going evaluation.
