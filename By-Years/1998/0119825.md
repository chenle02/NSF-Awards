The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries play a vital role in maintaining
and promoting a healthy population, and constitute a major sector of the US
economy. These industries have evolved from the empirical treatment of disease
to a sophisticated approach for drug development which requires a deeper
understanding of the biochemistry of life processes. As a consequence, the
accurate description of biomolecular interactions has become a central element
in understanding disease mechanisms, and now is an essential ingredient for
devising safe and effective pharmaceuticals. A variety of instruments and
methods are used to characterize biomolecular interactions. This I/UCRC will
enable pharmaceutical and biotechnological, and instrumentation companies to
work together toward the development of advanced technologies for characterizing
molecular interactions.
