Under this award, Princeton University will purchase CONVEX mini- supercomputer
facilities for theoretical and observational investigations. Primary use will be
for large scale simulations in cosmology to test the currently considered
theoretical models against the increasingly detailed observations of large scale
structure and the background radiation fields. The local facilities will be used
both for preliminary modelling and for manipulation and display of the results
obtained from NSF supported supercomputer facilities. Also significant will be
use for processing of both optical and radio images. For both applications, the
C-220 with its speed, large memory (512 Mb), and efficient FFT routines is
ideal. Princeton University is providing 50% of the purchase price in a cost-
sharing arrangement.
