This action provides supplementary funds for Dr. Fred Wendorf's archaeological
research in the Sinai Desert of Egypt. They will permit him to overhaul two
research vehicles which will be used to conduct an archaeological survey of the
El-Gorafi Basin. The sites in this region may represent the oldest agricultural
villages in Egypt, a major cradle of civilization. The architecture in the dry
desertic region is extremely well-preserved. The cultural materials associated
with the sites appear to be different from those found in the Levant and in the
Nile Valley. They may open a completely new perspective on the prehistory of the
Sinai Desert and Egypt. Some of the sites are situated in localities which will
soon be leveled and reclaimed for agriculture. Others are in areas where new
settlements are likely to be placed and those which are not destroyed by housing
will likely be robbed for building stone. It is important that these materials
be recorded and that excavation take place. These data will be of interest to
many archaeologists and shed new light on the rise of complex societies.
