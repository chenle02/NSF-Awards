Jharna Sengupta will carry out research into Fuchsian and Kleinian groups. This
is a subject which classically impacts both complex and geometric analysis. In
most recent years it has received added impetus from its applications to the
study of dynamical systems. The objectives of Sengupta's research are twofold.
Firstly, she will investigate deformations of Fuchsian groups of the second
kind. This is closely related to the study of projective structures on bordered
Riemann surfaces. Secondly, she will try to adapt results on Fuchsian groups to
the setting of Kleinian groups.
