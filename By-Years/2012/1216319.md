This project will investigate the vertical and horizontal spatial structure of
hydrometeor (cloud and precipitation) fields using statistical correlation
analysis applied to observed radar reflectivity as evidenced in satellite data
e.g. CloudSat, derived surface rain-rates and other satellite data (including
AMSR-E, MODIS, and CERES retrievals). Preliminary analysis incorporating all
observations regardless of synoptic conditions, has indicated that southern
hemisphere extratropics have longer correlation lengths of hydrometeor
occurrence in the horizontal and vertical than the northern hemisphere, however
there are shorter correlation lengths in precipitation occurrence. To gain
insight into such hemispheric differences, the plan is to draw out factors
controlling precipitation and cloud structure in cyclones applying compositing
techniques in the South Pacific region. This project will advance discovery and
understanding while at the same time promote teaching and learning by supporting
directly a graduate student researcher, who will give local seminars on this
research, as well as disseminate research results through conference
presentations and peer-review publications.
