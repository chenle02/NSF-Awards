This research project will address a problem in the initialization of global
numerical weather prediction models known as "spin-up". Before the model has
"spun up", there is an imbalance in the various model processes which adversely
affects the humidity, precipitation, divergence and evaporation fields. The
initial imbalances are due, in large part, to the data assimilation scheme. The
goal of this research is to reduce the model spin-up time and to improve the
precipitation forecast by improving the data assimilation scheme. The principal
investigator will further refine an assimilation technique he has developed in
which Newton relaxation, or nudging, is used to make the divergence and humidity
fields consistent with the observed precipitation at the beginning of the
forecast. This project is part of a joint program in numerical weather
prediction sponsored by NSF and the National Meteorological Center (NMC) of
NOAA. The principal investigator will use the NMC global forecast model for his
research. If the new assimilation scheme is successful, it will be used
operationally by NMC.
