In this Research Experiences for Undergraduates award, six students will
concentrate on applications of probability to the analysis of basic questions in
group theory. The principal goal is one of determining in a probabilistic sense
the likelihood that two elements of a group commute. Specifically, the team will
construct confidence intervals for the location parameter of a symmetric random
variable. The method uses the notion of resampling introduced by Tukey for
determining what are called typical values for the subsample means. To attack
the problems, students will be introduced to the high level programming
language, CAYLEY, which enables the user to define algebraic structures in which
various structural properties can then be classified. This important tool is
generally not available to undergraduates. Reports will be prepared at the end
of the program. Those students who have made significant progress will refine
the work into publishable form; efforts will be made to have students present
their work at forthcoming professional meetings. This is the third year of
support for this program. Results to date have been substantial.
