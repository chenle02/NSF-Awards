This program will explore a new approach to the synthesis of tungsten carbide-
cobalt cermets with ultrafine microstructures. Chemical reactions in a reactive
fluid bed will be attempted to produce nanocrystalline bimetallic powder.
Attention will be directed to the changes in drag coefficients, densities, and
charge susceptibilities of the bed particles as they are converted from
precursor powder to bimetallic powder. Metallurgical and chemical quality of the
product powder will be evaluated.
