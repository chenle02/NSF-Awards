This project aims to develop a proof-of-concept testbed for a larger community-
scale infrastructure called WimNet, the first open-access software-defined radio
(SDR) platform to advance research and education in 60 GHz wireless networking.
Existing studies of 60 GHz networks mostly rely on simulation or analytical
models, which cannot reproduce the sophisticated characteristics of real 60 GHz
radio environment. Aiming to fill the experimental gap, WimNet incorporates
programmable hardware components, which allow flexible implementation of
communications algorithms and network protocols. Users can remotely access the
WimNet testbed through a web portal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WimNet will facilitate
high-impact research and education in the domain of 60 GHz wireless networking
across multiple research institutions. Its potential impact includes: (i)
accelerating the development of the 5G broadband cellular networks and Gbps
wireless LANs, which can alleviate the current spectrum crisis and enable new
generations of mobile applications; (ii) integrating with existing NSF-supported
wireless testbeds; (iii) engagement of industrial partners to expand the
capability of WimNet and extend its impacts; (iv) public dissemination of
hardware/software components and test results; (v) modernizing
communications/networking courses with knowledge of multi-Gbps, high-frequency
radio systems, and promote hands-on experiences with a reconfigurable radio.
