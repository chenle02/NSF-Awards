The research goal of this project is to determine the tectonic history of the
Ford Ranges in Marie Byrd Land (MBL), West Antarctica. Events in MBL may relate
to the tectonics of the Gondwana Pacific margin prior to and following Late
Cretaceous rifting. Western Antarctica has been described as a collage of
microplates which apparently have been closely related to each other and
Antarctica since Jurassic; the relation of MBL to these microplates for this
time period is less clear. Strongly metamorphosed rocks in the Fosdick Mountains
may be the center of a metamorphic core complex formed during the rifting of the
Gondwana Pacific margin. During the first project year, an existing rock suite
from the Fosdick and Phillips mountains will be studied. In addition, scientists
will analyze satellite imagery preparatory to field mapping. Two field seasons
are planned. Geologic mapping, petrology geochronology, and paleomagnetic
studies will be conducted, and will provide data needed to reconstruct a
tectonic evolution of Marie Byrd Land.
