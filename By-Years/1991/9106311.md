American voters increasing are portrayed as individuals more concerned with the
personalities and images of candidates than with candidate ideologies or issue
positions. This proposal draws on recent research in cognitive psychology to
develop and test an explanation of this trend. Specifically, this research
develops a model of candidate evaluation which view voters as "cognitive misers"
in the sense that they attempt to strike a balance between the amount of thought
they invest in their voting decision and the likely ability of thought to
predict candidate's future behavior. Since candidates intentionally obscure
their policy positions and given the decreasing distinction between the parties
in most voters' minds, this model predicts that voters will rely increasingly on
personalities in evaluating candidates. A series of laboratory experiments will
be undertaken to test this interpretation. Subjects will be exposed to various
types of information including issue positions, group affiliations, appearance
and personality regarding competing hypothetical candidates. The effects on
candidate evaluation will then be tested. When completed this innovative
research will help determine not only the influence of personality on candidate
evaluation but also the source of those personality inferences in political
communication.
