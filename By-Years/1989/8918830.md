This proposal seeks to study experimentally fundamental heat transfer issues
for subcooled bubbly boiling flow in the annulus between two tubes, the inner
one heated. In such flows, heat transfer can take place between the walls and
the vapor, between the walls and the liquid, between liquid and vapor, and
latent heat is absorbed in the vaporization process. By means of very detailed
measurements of time resolved velocity, temperature, and by flow visualization,
the author hopes to gain the basic knowledge to formulate a more comprehensive
theoretical model than presently exists. In particular, the PI hopes to
investigate the role of turbulence in this process. He proposes to do this for
two fluids, R113 and water to determine the extent of universality of his
conclusions. The final objective of the work is to develop a mechanistic model
of subcooled boiling flow on the basis of these measurements.
