The main objective of this project is to obtain a controller design methodology
for uncertain, nonlinear, mechanical and aerospace systems which contain
flexible components. Using a singular perturbation approach, the first phase of
the research considers controllers which are designed assuming certain
components to be rigid, and then investigates the effect of flexibility in the
previously assumed rigid components on the controller performance. In the second
phase of the research, all flexibilities are taken into account in the
controller design; currently known results on the control of uncertain systems
are extended to systems whose uncertainties satisfy less restrictive structural
conditions than the previous conditions. In both phases, the design of the
controllers and the analysis of their performance are based on Lyapunov
functions.
