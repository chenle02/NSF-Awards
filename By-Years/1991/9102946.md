Professor Pedersen will study commuting selfadjoint extensions of first order
partial differential operators acting on smooth functions of compact support on
some domain. Such extensions may or may not exist depending on the given domain.
This project is motivated in part by the desire to understand spectral
properties of higher order constant coefficient partial differential operators,
and also by the connection between the spectrum of the commuting selfadjoint
extension and the geometry of the domain. Professor Pedersen will also
investigate the implications of these ideas for the various Laplace operators
associated to the domain. This project involves the connection between the
theory of differentiation (in many variables) and geometry in its simplest form.
One of the ideas which Professor Pedersen will investigate is how the
eigenvalues of these differentiation operators are related to the geometry of
the domain in n-space on which they are defined.
