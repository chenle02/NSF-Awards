Despite their increasingly ubiquitous deployment, RFID systems are plagued with
a wide variety of security and privacy threats. A large number of these threats
arise due to the tag?s promiscuous response to any reader requests. This renders
sensitive tag information easily subject to unauthorized reading. It also
incites different forms of relay attacks whereby a colluding pair, by relaying
information between a legitimate tag and reader, can successfully impersonate
the legitimate tag without actually possessing it.

This research explores novel context-aware security and privacy mechanisms by
leveraging the newly-equipped sensing capabilities on the next generation
(passive) RFID tags. The goal is to provide improved protection against
unauthorized reading and relay attacks without undermining the usability and
efficiency offered by the RFID systems. The project also includes a feasibility
study of the proposed mechanisms in terms of both economical and power
constraints, and a systematic analysis of possible (new) sensor-centric attacks.
The overall proposed activities range from system design and analysis to
implementation and performance measurements.

More broadly, this exploratory work intends to arrive at a better understanding
of the feasibility of utilizing parameters derived from the physical world to
solve security and privacy issues of the cyber systems. In terms of educational
activities, new security courses focusing on resource-constrained devices and
lightweight cryptographic tools will be developed.
