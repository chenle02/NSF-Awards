This project is responding to a growing demand for technically trained employees
for automotive manufacturing industries in north central Alabama. The faculty at
Jefferson State Community College (JSCC) formed partnerships with regional
manufacturers, area secondary schools, universities, and the Alabama Technology
Network to develop a Manufacturing Technology Training Center. Over $2 million
has been spent to renovate and equip the facility, which serves college and high
school students as well as economically disadvantaged adults referred from the
"One-Stop" career center established through the Workforce Investment Act. The
Center offers degrees, certificates and short-term training in five
manufacturing-related tracks. This project focuses on two tracks: industrial
maintenance and automated manufacturing. The project goal is to meet the
workforce needs of area manufacturing industries by fully developing curricula
for industrial maintenance and automated manufacturing that integrates technical
experiences into the classroom and laboratory, and is complemented with
workforce experience. The four major goals are to: (1) Develop faculty trained
to teach in these two programs, (2) Establish specific program requirements
including entry and exit requirements for certificate, degree, and short term
training that correlate with specific assessments and standards, (3) Fully
develop and teach each course in these two programs, and (4) Develop additional
partnerships with industries, secondary schools and colleges to establish
comprehensive 2+2+2 programs in industrial maintenance and automated
manufacturing. The curriculum development team composed of JSCC faculty,
industry representatives and educators from local high schools and universities
has developed the curriculum. DACUM and/or Work Keys processes were used to
establish specific academic and technical skills required for employment in each
area. This information has been organized into courses within the Alabama Common
Course and Curriculum Guide for Colleges and Universities.
