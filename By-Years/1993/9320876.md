9320876 Wohl The objective of the project is to assess potential hazards
associated with catastrophic flooding from glacier lakes in a portion of the
Arun River basin in the Nepalese Himalayas. The work will identify and
characterize glacial-lake basins and channels that have been subjected to
outburst floods. A better understanding of the casual relations between basin
and channel physical characteristics and flooding occurrences will be achieved
by using GIS software, remote sensing imagery and topographic maps, as well as
fieldwork of more detailed, on-site characteristics of lake basin (size and
volume of lake, seasonal changes of water level, changes in lake size through
time, type of dams, their potential stability, etc.) and outburst channel
features (channel cross-sectional and longitudinal morphology, flood erosional
and depositional ***
