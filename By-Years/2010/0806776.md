&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Investigators from the University of Texas Arlington and
Florida International University have received funding to investigate
physiological processes of arctic tundra vegetation during the winter. The study
will increase our understanding of physiological processes of arctic tundra
vegetation under snow during the cold season and increase our knowledge of how
these processes contribute to the carbon cycling and climate change. The project
will investigate cold season plant physiology, carbon acquisition under snow,
carbon turnover, sources of water for the plants during the cold season,
mortality, and respiration rate sensitivity to predicted changes in temperature.
The results are expected to provide new insights into plant physiology and
carbon dynamics of two tundra ecosystems during the cold season. &lt;br/&gt;
