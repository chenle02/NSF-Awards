There is a widespread need for comprehensive and advanced capabilities to
measure, monitor, report, and verify (MMRV) emissions and removals of greenhouse
gases from the atmosphere, across all regions and sectors. This workshop will
bring together a diverse group of researchers, including modelers and
observational scientists, to identify research priorities and approaches for
improving source attribution of observed greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations,
with a focus on modeling and improved understanding of surface-level processes.
The workshop will take place over two days and the primary output will be a
report to guide future research in this area.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
