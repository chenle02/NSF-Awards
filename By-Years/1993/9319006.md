9319006 Costain This research is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research that is
under the category of "research having a severe urgency with regard to
availability of or access to data,...". Three seismic industry speculation
lines, acquired about 20 years ago, SEISDATA 4, 6, and 8, cross the Appalachian
orogen from the Blue Ridge province, across the Inner Peidmont, the Central
Piedmont Suture, Piedmont, and Atlantic Coastal Plain. These data have never
been reprocessed or published in a format other than line drawings of tracings
fo the reflections from brute stacks. These data apparently disappeared during
the last decade and were believed lost. They have resurfaced once again and a
copy can be obtained for scientific use for a fraction of the original cost.
These seismic data cross important structural features on the eastern coast of
the U.S. and extend previous seismic work related to an NSF funded deep core
drill hole project, ADCOH. ***
