The University will buy an instrument to measure optical intensities in the
junior level course in geometrical and physical optics at the University of
Puget Sound. The sensing element of the instrument consists of 1020 photo diodes
arranged in a line, making it possible to measure the intensity of light as a
function of one space dimension. It will permit the quantitative study of some
classical experiments in wave optics, such as interference and diffraction
patterns, and strengthen the connection between the mathematical description of
these phenomena and observed behavior. It will also provide a suitable sensor
for new experiments, such as the Zeeman effect, a study of laser modes, and a
study of the resolving power of the Fabry- Perot interferometer. Equally
important is the experience will give students with modern instrumentation. The
University will match the award with an equal amount of funds.
