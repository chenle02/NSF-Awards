The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is in making structural
simulation widely available to communities of makers, small businesses, and
manufacturing enterprises, leading to dramatic improvements in performance,
quality, manufacturability, and cost savings. If successful, the proposed
research will result in a cloud-based simulation service, a disruptive
technology holding the potential to transform the simulation industry by making
structural simulation widely available to both novice and expert users, as a low
cost fully automated service that requires no prepossessing or data conversion.
Putting simulation technology into hands of makers and manufacturers is an
important step towards further democratization of manufacturing and wider
adoption of 3D printing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business
Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will establish scientific,
technological, and commercial feasibility of a fully automated and easy-to-use
cloud-hosted structural simulation service to support tasks in advanced design
and manufacturing. The service is intended to be used by a variety of users with
widely varying levels of expertise, with particular focus on the additive
manufacturing and the growing maker's movement. Specific research issues
include: (1) problems and simulation use scenarios in support of additive
manufacturing, including reverse engineering, manufacturability and intended
structural performance; (2) system architecture, computational challenges, and
prototype implementation of a cloud-based service for performing structural
simulation of intermediate and final solid manufactured artifacts; (3)
investigation of user interaction modes and scenarios that enable use of the
structural simulation service by a wide range of users, from novice designers
and makers to experienced design and manufacturing engineers.
