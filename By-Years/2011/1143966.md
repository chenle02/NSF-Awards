This project explores the design and use of multi-lifespan information systems;
that is, information systems that not only meet the needs of today's users but
can also maintain their usefulness beyond a single human lifespan. Specifically,
the project will (a) test the feasibility of a multi-lifespan information system
design approach; (b) generate preliminary design knowledge and methods for
multi-lifespan information system design; and (c) contribute meaningful
information system designs in our domain of study - international justice. To
achieve these goals, the project will leverage the Voices from the Rwanda
Tribunal testbed in two types of research activities: multi-lifespan information
system envisioning; and digital information tagging and meaning making from a
multi-lifespan perspective. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The
project will explore the feasibility of the potentially transformative multi-
lifespan approach, including: (a) envisioning futures responsive to the
information needs, concerns, and values of different generations; (b) through
conceptual, technical and policy-oriented mechanisms, anticipating and
supporting shifts in societal, political and technological conditions; and (c)
conducting preliminary investigations into how to involve the public in
interacting with deployed multi-lifespan systems. The project work is likely to
catalyze new design methods and technical mechanisms, ones that can account for
divergent futures, evolving socio-political situations, and robust information
system adaptability. New techniques for managing privacy, security, and freedom
of expression are anticipated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This
research will promote important societal values including human rights,
security, freedom of expression, and peace-building; and inform developments in
the field of international justice. The results will also be highly relevant for
other digital collections that are intended to outlast the creators' lifespans.
