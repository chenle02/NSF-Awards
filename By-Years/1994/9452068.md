9452068 Qazi The Research Foundation of the State University of New York, for
and on behalf of the SUNY Institute of Technology at Utica/Rome, requests
$51,496 from the National Science Foundation to develop a cost effective, real-
time multimedia communication facility. We propose to link the Institute's image
processing and fiber optic communication laboratories by an optical network to
improve undergraduate instruction. The SUNY Institute of Technology has
committed $25,748 in matching funds for this project. The proposed project is
intended to serve the needs of undergraduates enrolled in the five electrical
engineering technology (ETC) courses that will be enhanced through this project.
Undergraduate students majoring in electrical engineering technology, computer
technology, photonics, and telecommunications will also benefit from the
improved curricula. The enhanced laboratory environment will permit students to
acquire hands-on experience using a real-time system for the transmission of
voice, video, and data; to study the design of this facility; and to evaluate
its merits. Students will also learn how to capture, store, playback, and
process multimedia data on a personal computer using a fiber optic local area
network. Students will gain knowledge in the areas of fiber optics, image
processing, data compression, and networking, all of which have become vitally
important to business and industry today with the emergence and rapid growth of
multimedia technology. Real-time lab experiments with software and hardware will
be used to achieve a stimulating hands-on education. The duration of the project
will be 30 months.
