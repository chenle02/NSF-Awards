This grant funds the development of a software tool for the statistical analysis
of integrated circuit failures. The tool will be used on existing failure rate
data to locate unpredicted combinations of circuit parameters that produce
failure. Statistical methods are necessary because of the randomness in failure
data and the very large number of parameters which interact to as yet poorly
understood ways. These parameter combinations yield insight on the nature of
those interactions. This insight will be systematized using artificial
intelligence techniques.
