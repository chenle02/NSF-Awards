In this three-year U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research project in theoretical
chemistry between Nada Miljevic at the Boris Kidrich Institute for Nuclear
Science, Belgrade, and Alexander Van Hook at the University of Tennessee, the
investigators will study isotope effects in solution. In particular, they
propose to examine clay-mineral systems, carbon disulfide-methanol systems, and
aqueous solutions. In addition to advancing knowledge on thermodynamics of
solutions, these studies could have practical applications in industrial,
geochemical and agricultural operations. The U.S. and Yugoslav scientists have a
previous history of successful collaboration on these topics. This project was
approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on Cooperation in Science and
Technology and is supported through a joint fund consisting of matching
contributions from the governments of the United States and Yugoslavia. The U.S.
contribution is provided annually by the Department of State. No NSF funds are
involved. Grants are made to the principal scientific institution in Yugoslavia,
but include dollar funds for U.S. scientist travel to Yugoslavia and for
Yugoslav scientists' living expenses in the U.S.
