This project will further develop and enhance the Stork Data Scheduler to
support Azure cloud computing environment, and to mitigate the end-to-end data
handling bottleneck in data-intensive cloud computing applications. Stork data
scheduler has been very actively used in many data-intensive application areas
including coastal hazard prediction and storm surge modeling; oil flow and
reservoir uncertainty analysis; numerical relativity and black hole collisions;
educational video processing and behavioral assessment; digital sky imaging; and
multiscale computational fluid dynamics. Making Stork available on the Azure
environment will enable this already existing user base to easily migrate to the
Azure Cloud Computing platform as well as other Azure application groups
benefiting from the large-scale data handling capabilities of
Stork.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Stork Data Scheduler for Azure will make a
distinctive contribution to cloud computing community because it focuses on
planning, scheduling, monitoring and management of data placement tasks and
application-level end-to-end optimization of networked I/O for petascale data-
intensive applications. Unlike existing approaches, it will treat data resources
and the tasks related to data access and movement as first class entities just
like computational resources and compute tasks, and not simply the side effect
of computation. Stork data scheduler for Azure will provide enhanced
functionality for cloud computing such as data aggregation and connection
caching; peer-to-peer and streamed data management; early error detection,
classification, and recovery in data transfers; scheduled storage management;
optimal protocol tuning; and end-to-end performance prediction services. The
Stork data scheduler for Azure will dramatically change how domain scientists
perform their research by rapidly facilitating sharing of large amounts of data
in cloud computing environments.
