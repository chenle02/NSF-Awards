Optimal operation of bioprocesses is extremely important because these processes
utilize expensive raw materials, require large capital-intensive plants and
yield products that are low in concentration. Due to the inherent complexity of
biological systems, reliable mathematical models needed for optimization and
control of the fermentations are seldom available. Any change occurring in the
environment would alter the model and thus the optimal feeding strategy
calculated off-line may not be optimal for the exact process. Thus, in spite of
the availability of elegant theories on dynamic optimization and control, there
has been very limited success in implementing these theories experimentally in
fermentations. This study will develop a concept of on-line optimization for
batch and fed-batch bioprocesses that takes into account the continually
changing environmental conditions and unmodeled intracellular events using a
mathematical process description with time-varying parameters. A scheme will be
developed which estimates the model parameters on-line and computes and updates
the optimal feeding policy while the fermentation is in progress. The work will
address specifically the direct application of the proposed optimization concept
to an industrially significant process, namely cephalosporin fermentation, and
will try to validate the results through experimentation.
