0243808&lt;br/&gt;Vo&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will enable a
seven-member U.S. bioengineering team to visit Vietnam to conduct a needs
assessment. The team will be coordinated by Dr. Van Toi Vo, Tufts University,
and will visit three universities in Vietnam: the University of Technology in
Hanoi and in Ho Chi Minh City and Can Tho University in Hanoi. The goal of the
delegation is to assess general and specific needs in the field of
bioengineering in Vietnam and to conduct site visits to key departments and
laboratories. The information gathered by this team will provide knowledge of
the state of development of bioengineering in Vietnam. The needs assessment team
will identify and describe priority steps leading to the development of
appropriate bioengineering research in Vietnam and cooperation between the U.S.
and Vietnamese scientific communities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
