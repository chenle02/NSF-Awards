This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) will assist the
Department of Chemistry at Ripon College in the purchase of a 300 MHz NMR
spectrometer. This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas
including characterization of the electron transfer properties of the enzyme
glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase and studies on the nucleophile reactivity in
substitution reactions. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the
most powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of
molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific
arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of
interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR
spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research.
The results from these NMR studies are useful in the areas such as polymers,
catalysis, and in biology.
