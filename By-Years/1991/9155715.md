The project will use artificial intelligence techniques to construct a
prototype computer system to support and coach scientific argumentation. Running
in a network environment, the system will help students engage in a variety of
science-related argumentation activities, including discussing (a) competing
theories and the implications of simulated or real experiment they have carried
out and (b) implications of scientific knowledge for public policy issues.
Students will be able to build, examine, and refine arguments using several
different knowledge based tools and will be able to seek advice on which parts
of complex arguments deserve more attention, and why. The prototype will address
several specific scientific and policy topics in the areas of global warming and
plate tectonics. We will test the system with urban middle or high school
students and with non-science-major undergraduates and develop a clear plan for
building authoring tools and a run-time environment that could be used to
develop similar tools for other domains.
