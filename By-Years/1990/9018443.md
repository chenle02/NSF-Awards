Geomagnetically induced currents (GIC) could saturate a transformer core and
result in transformer stray flux heating. Many such incidents have occurred
during the March 1989 K-9 solar magnetic disturbance. Stray flux distribution
within a transformer is complicated and involves many factors. A systematic
three dimensional analysis of transformer flux distribution under GIC is
proposed. Magnetic fields everywhere inside a transformer will be calculated.
Stray flux patterns as well as eddy currents for different transformer designs,
core configurations will be analyzed and compared. The objectives of this study
are to reveal the fundamental transformer magnetization mechanism under the
influence of GIC, to assess potential stray flux heating possibilities of
geologically vulnerable transformer units. The research findings will help
utilities to justify the needs for mitigation actions on high risk units.
Manufacturers may use the research results to review their design strategies and
introduce possible design considerations to reduce GIC effects in the future.
