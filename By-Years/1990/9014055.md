This project will establish at Hampton University a multi-year Research
Experience and Enrichment program for engineering, mathematics, and science
students. The aim is to attract students into research, train them, and channel
them into graduate programs at major research institutions upon graduating from
college. Within a period of five years, 40 students selected from the discipline
areas of biological sciences, chemistry, engineering, marine science,
mathematics, and physics will participate in this project. Ongoing research
programs at Hampton University will form the framework upon which research
activities for participating students will be based. The students who
participate in this project are provided financial support not only as incentive
for pursuing scientific research, but also to help reduce their financial
burdens and make graduate school a competitive career option after graduation.
