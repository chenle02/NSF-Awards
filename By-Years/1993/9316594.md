9316594 Kirz A scanning soft x ray microscope has been built and put into
operation at the National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National
Laboratory. The instrument makes use of the bright, tuneable undulator source at
the X1A beamline. It uses zone plates fabricated under a Lawrence Berkeley
Lab./IBM collaboration to form a 50 nm beam spot. The microscope is in routine
operation, and is used by several groups to image wet biological specimens at
the resolution set by the spot size. New imaging modes are being developed that
extend the applicability of the technique to map particular chemical states
using the resonances present near elemental absorption edges (XANES), and using
the detection of visible light excited in fluorescent labels by the x ray beam.
In addition to continuing the operation of the microscope, support is requested
to extend the XANES contrast imaging capability, to improve substantially the
stability and the resolution of the instrument, and to explore the possibilities
in x ray microscopy at higher energies. The team welcomes inquiries by
investigators interested in using the instrument to solve biological problems
matched to its unique capabilities. u ~ s &amp;t &amp;9 : ; &lt; = &gt; ? @ A B
