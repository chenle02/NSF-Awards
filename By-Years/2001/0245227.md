The proposal focuses on fabrication and physical studies of semiconductor nano-
scale systems in three areas: II-VI magnetic semiconductor quantum structures
fabricated both by cleaved edge overgrowth and by the process of self-assembly;
III-V-based ferromagnetic semiconductor thin films and multilayers; and magnetic
nanostructures which form at II-VI/III-V semiconductor interfaces. The proposed
program is expected to have intellectual merit and broad impact far beyond its
specific scientific goals by contributing to the arsenal of spin-electronics
materials generally; and by training graduate and undergraduate students in
cutting-edge semiconductor fabrication techniques and in designing multi-
functional materials, thus contributing to U.S. manpower skills in areas which
are in wide demand in U.S. Industry, National Laboratories, and Academia.
Additionally, the Notre Dame team already has an exceptional track record of
collaborations (currently with more than forty other institutions) either by
providing research samples or by carrying out joint experiments. This activity
of dissemination and sharing of results is expected to further intensify as the
demand for spin-electronic materials continues to grow.

There is currently an intense worldwide movement in contemporary electronics to
explore the role of electron spin - in addition to its charge - with an eye on
increasing the functionality of electronic microchip devices, particularly in
the realm of computation. The present proposal addresses this issue by employing
state-of-the-art techniques to fabricate and characterize a series of novel
semiconductor nano-scale structures in which the role of electron spin is
magnified by the incorporation of magnetic ions. By training graduate and
undergraduate students in cutting-edge semiconductor fabrication techniques as
well as in designing multi-functional materials, the proposed program is
expected to have broad impact far beyond its immediate goals, since skills in
these areas of materials science are in broad demand in U.S. Industry, National
Laboratories, and Academia. Additionally, the Notre Dame team already has an
exceptional track record of collaborations (currently with more than forty other
institutions) either by providing research samples or by carrying out joint
experiments. This activity of dissemination and sharing of results is expected
to further intensify as the demand for spin-based electronic materials continues
to grow.
