This project is a one year program to conduct a conference entitled "Basic
Biological Concepts: What Should the World's Children Know?", in association
with a meeting of The Commission for Biological Education of the International
Union of Biological Sciences. The meeting will be held in Colorado Springs,
Colorado during September, 1992. Participants will include Commission members,
U.S. leaders in science education and invited science\biology teachers. Previous
to the conference, Commission members will prepare papers describing standards
for biology\life sciences that have been adopted in their countries. They will
define, from their country's perspective, what students should know and be able
to do (K-12) and describe the extent to which these goals are being attained.
This meeting will provide a unique opportunity to explore the essential elements
of biology curriculum from a world-wide perspective and will augment the work of
the National Research Council's National Committee on Science Education
Standards and Assessment. Proceedings of the symposium will be developed,
published, and distributed. Cost sharing equals 23.9% of the NSF award.
