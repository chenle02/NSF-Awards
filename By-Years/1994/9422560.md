This renewal grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the studies of
Professor Weiss at Georgetown University. The research, which is aimed at
developing new materials, focuses on correlating the molecular structures of
guest molecules with reaction dynamics in liquid crystals, polymer films, gels,
membranes, zeolites, and nanoscale cylinders. The four focal points of research
are photochemical studies on 2-naphthyl acylates, dynamic emission studies on
crystalline 4-alkyl-N-(4-cyanophenyl)-piperidines, studies on ALS (Aromatics
Linked to Steroidal groups) gelators of organic liquids, and studies on
polymerizations of columnar liquid crystals for chiral separations. In this
materials-driven project, Dr. Weiss will study structures and reaction dynamics
of guest molecules in constrained, complex media such as liquid crystals,
polymer films, gels, membranes, zeolites, and nanoscale cylinders. This multi-
faceted research employs photochemical, calorimetric, spectroscopic, and
polymeric techniques to unravel factors that influence their molecular
structures and reactivities. A better understanding of the factors controlling
transformations in these organized molecular assemblies will result from this
research that is expected to lead to new materials with specific diagnostic
applications.
