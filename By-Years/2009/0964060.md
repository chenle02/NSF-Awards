This collaborative project investigates Opportunistic Sensing (OS) and
Compressive Sensing (CS) in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). OS refers to a
paradigm in which a WSN can automatically discover and select sensor modalities
and sensors based on an operational scenario, resulting in an adaptive network
that automatically finds scenario-dependent, objective-driven opportunities with
optimized performance. CS is a novel sensing/sampling paradigm that goes against
the common wisdom in data acquisition. Both OS and CS help improve efficient
operations and performance of WSNs significantly. In particular, OS aims at
reduction from space by selecting a subset of sensors and modalities for
efficient data fusion, whereas CS targets reduction in sampling by selecting a
subset of samples non-uniformly. Therefore, theoretical foundations and
algorithms for opportunistic and compressive sensing are essential for advancing
the state of the art in WSNs that not only ensure effective utilization of
sensing assets but also provide robust optimal performance. This project
addresses fundamental research issues from information theoretic viewpoint to
evaluate joint OS and CS distortions, develop OS and collaborative CS schemes
for better performance of WSNs, and cross-layer design to adapt to the non-
uniform sampling in CS-based WSNs.&lt;br/&gt;This project will make a
significant contribution to the theory and applications of opportunistic and
compressive sensing to WSNs and will have a broad and deep social impact in
homeland security and defense. Under-represented and female students from
different societies will be recruited, and seminars and in-house short courses
will be offered to local industry via IEEE.
