The Scientific Reasoning Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts,
Amherst will conduct a feasibility study for engaging museum visitors in data
analysis through this planning grant.

Intellectual Merit: This project builds on the extensive prior work of the PI in
developing Tinkerplots software for middle school students. At the same time, it
potentially takes advantage of the many museum exhibitions that include various
kinds of data but provide no mechanisms for visitors to analyze the data and
draw conclusions. This project makes the connection by seeking to demonstrate
the proof of concept for the transfer of this data analysis program from the
formal to the informal setting.

Broader Impact: This project will purposefully test three very different
settings -- Museum of Science, Boston, MA; Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame,
Springfield, MA; and Missouri Botanical Garden, St. Louis, MO -- to explore the
advantages and limitations of this approach in those learning environments. If
successful, the software could have very wide application.
