This award funds a conference in algebraic geometry &lt;br/&gt;at the University
of Missouri-Columbia, April 5-6, 2002.&lt;br/&gt;The conference focuses on
Hilbert schemes, vector bundles&lt;br/&gt;and their interplay with
representation theory. &lt;br/&gt;It has two main goals. The first is to provide
a forum for &lt;br/&gt;algebraic geometers to meet with colleagues and learn of
&lt;br/&gt;recent research developments in these focused areas. &lt;br/&gt;The
second is to give graduate students, recent Ph.D's and women&lt;br/&gt;an
opportunity to broaden their mathematical horizons. &lt;br/&gt;The conference
includes 8 hour-long invited talks addressed by &lt;br/&gt;leading
mathematicians, and about 20 shorter communications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
focused areaes of the conference are at the central stage &lt;br/&gt;of recent
confluence between mathematics and physics. &lt;br/&gt;The mathematical
achievements in these focused areaes &lt;br/&gt;provide solid mathematical
foundation &lt;br/&gt;to the physics theories which are vital to explain the
universe.&lt;br/&gt;In addition, the conference will have a high impact on
diversity, &lt;br/&gt;as well as scientific and educational activities.
