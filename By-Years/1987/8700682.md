This grant is in the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program. In this study
the influence of the addition of highly reactive lithium or alkali metal salts
of organic hydrocarbon anions to a series of standard organomagnesium reagents
will be investigated. As these chemical species equilibrate, a new negatively
charged carbanion is formed that exhibits greatly enhanced chemical reactivity.
This dynamic equilibrium can also be favorably altered by the addition of crown
ethers or complexing agents the sequester the positively charged metal ions
resulting in markedly different chemical bahavior. Specifically, the proposed
research is concerned with preparations, structures, and reactions of new
organometallic species of main-group metals. A major portion of the research
will concern magnesiate ions. These negative organomagnesium ions will be
synthesized from ordinary organic compounds in a number of ways compounds,
including addition of coordinating agents, such as crown ethers and cryptands,
or simple salts, such as alkali metal alkoxides and tetraalkylammonium halides.
Structures and reactions of magnesiate species will be investigated. Magnesiate
ions generally are considerably more reactive than conventional organomagnesium
compounds and with some substrates furnish different products. Other
organomagnesium species to be synthesized and studied structurally include
organomagnesium cations (RMg+) and diorganomagnesium compounds (R2Mg) that are
stabilized by coordinating groups such as crown ethers. A portion of the
proposed work also will involve preparation of new organometallic species of
other metals, particularly species formed from organoaluminum or organozinc
compounds with crown ethers.
