This project examines how legal regulation shapes memory and cultural heritage.
Focusing on laws and practices governing historical excavation sites and
applications for excavation permits, the research asks how state regulation and
those governed by those regulations contribute to the production of historical
accounts, memorials, and material heritage. The research seeks to advance
understanding and theory of how law works in sometimes unexpected or
contradictory ways. The broader impacts of this project include the training of
a graduate student in rigorous empirical and qualitative fieldwork
methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Doctoral student Onder Celik, supervised by Dr.
Veena Das, will conduct this research through an ethnographic case study of laws
regulating excavation of sites of mass violence. In particular, the case study
will focus on the legal regulation of "treasure hunting" in the search for
Armenian treasures in Turkey. The anthropological research will be carried out
in five sites in Turkey using field research techniques, including participant
observation, interviews, and document analysis.
