Dr. Gideon A. Fraenkel and other members of the Chemistry Department at Ohio
State University are being supported to establish a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site in chemistry. For the period 1997-99, ten
undergraduate students will spend twelve weeks each summer actively engaged in
basic research projects drawn from the traditional areas of chemistry and
biochemistry. In addition, sessions are offered in safety, computer
applications, and library use. Field trips to local scientifically-oriented
organizations offer insights into applications and career opportunities.
Participants are recruited nationwide.
