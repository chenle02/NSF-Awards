The contractor will conduct the 1988 Survey of Recent Science and Engineering
Graduates. This survey collects information on the demographic and employment
characteristics of S/E bachelor's and master's degree recipients one and two
years after graduation. All necessary steps connected with collecting and
processing the data will be handled by the contractor with approval from the
National Science Foundation. The Foundation is responsible for developing and
maintaining a data base of demographic, educational, and employment information
on scientists and engineers. This data base, the Scientific and Technical
Personnel Data System, includes three surveys: the Experienced Sample Survey
Recipients, and the Survey of Recent Science and Engineering Graduates. Results
of the Experienced Sample and Recent Graduate surveys are combined to produce
national estimates of scientists and engineers.
