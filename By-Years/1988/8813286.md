A direct measurement will be initiated for the Newtonian constant of
gravitation, G, on a much larger distance scale than previously achieved. The
method to be used is a precise measurement of changes in the local acceleration
of gravity, g, at two locations in the vicinity of a large hydroelectric storage
pond. A detailed study of the proposed site (the Ludington Pumped Storage
Facility in Ludington, MI) and the proposed instrumentation (the portable
absolute gravimeters developed at JILA) has shown that a measurement of G to a
precision of 0.1%, on a distance scale of 10-100 m, is feasible. The result
would be directly sensitive to a proposed "intermediate range force", and could
confirm or negate some published claims for its strength and range. This project
will involve undergraduate students in laboratory calculations and field
measurements in a subject area which is both accessible to their understanding
and of immediate interest to the physics community.
