Malathy Venkataraman of The College of William and Mary is supported by the
Experimental Physical Chemistry Program and the India/South Asia Program to
perform high resolution infrared spectroscopic studies of molecules contributing
to the greenhouse effect and ozone depletion. This project is a collaborative
effort between Dr. Venkataraman and Dr. D'Cunha of the Bhabha Atomic Research
Center (B.A.R.C.), Bombay, India. Infrared spectra of carbonyl fluoride and
halon-1301 will be taken using the high-resolution Fourier transform
spectrometer at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and analyzed
using computer programs developed at B.A. R. C. Low temperature diode laser
absorption spectra of halon-1301 will be taken at the NASA Langley Research
Center in order to obtain more complete information on its molecular parameters.
This spectroscopic data will be valuable in pollution monitoring and
identification of spectral signatures in upper atmospheric research.
Chlorofluorocarbons, such as freons and halons, are known to be responsible for
much of the ozone depletion problem. The atmospheric concentrations of these
molecules are currently estimated from product analysis. This research will
provide information which can be used to directly monitor the concentrations of
these pollutants in the atmosphere.
