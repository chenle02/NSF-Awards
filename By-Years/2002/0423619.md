The objective of this research is to create/characterize Self-Reinforced
Composites that possess excellent mechanical properties for a variety of
applications. Self-reinforced composites of poly(methyl methacrylate), for
example, where the reinforcing fiber and the matrix are both poly(methyl
methacrylate), should not suffer from poor fiber-matrix interfacial strength and
hence have significantly greater tensile/flexural/fracture/fatigue properties
than the composites reinforced with other fibers. Even though poly(methyl
methacrylate) may be used in several medical/dental applications due to its
excellent biocompatibility, incorporation of the regular poly(methyl
methacrylate) fibers into poly(methyl methacrylate) matrix, without losing chain
orientation of the fibers, is virtually impossible because they have the same
thermal property. Hence, our approach is based on the novel idea of forming
stereocomplex fibers, for example, from mixtures of isotactic and syndiotactic
poly(methyl methacrylate), which have significantly higher melting temperatures
than the processing temperature of the self-reinforced composite.

High strength polymeric materials are needed for a variety of applications
ranging from tank armor to spaceships, not just medical/dental fields. By
replacing the fibers like glass or carbon conventionally used in composite
materials with stereocomplex fiber, we can achieve two important improvements:
one, the interfacial strength will be greatly enhanced, and two, a whole host of
new functional composites can be made, depending on the selection of the
materials to make stereocomplex fiber and the matrix, such as conducting
polymers, photo-responsive polymers, and other smart materials. These materials
will play an important role as structural elements, electronic components, and
optical sensors in the envisioned "mission to mars" endeavor.
