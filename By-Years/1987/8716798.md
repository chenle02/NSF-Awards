Research on the design of distributed databases is proposed. We have already
investigated in detail the problems of vertical and horizontal fragmentation of
data and their redundandt and nonredundant allocation in a distributed
environment. With the present proposal, we plan to extend our research in the
following areas: a) Integrate the present work into a comprehensive methodology
by combining the fragmentation and allocation schemes. Refine existing models by
incorporating further details of transaction processing and system overheads.
Study the effect of network topology and communication costs. b) Investigate
models for optimal refragmentation and reallocation with possible replication.
Develop design heuristics. c) Investigate the development of design tools, user
interaction, graphic support, etc., to enable designers to apply the design
methodology in practice to realistic problems. In particular, evaluate the
applicability of design heuristics in a expert- system like environment to
achieve fairly acceptable solutions to the design problem.
