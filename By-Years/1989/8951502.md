The Macalester College Department of Physics and Astronomy is implementing a
major revision of its intermediate and advanced laboratories to introduce
laboratory projects based on modern optical techniques and phenomena. In this
project the department will employ optical fibers as a medium for experimental
studies of basic optical phenomena. Guided waves, spectral properties of
impurity ions, nonlinear effects, sensor applications and communication
techniques are examples of techniques which will become accessible experimental
investigation. The affected courses include Optics, Optical Electronics, and
advanced student laboratory studies. The proposed instrumentation supports two
laboratory stations for optical fiber projects. The equipment includes a fiber
projects kit, components to expand the kit's capabilities to two laboratory
stations, a tunable broadband light source, two phase-sensitive detection
systems and two computer workstations for real-time instrument control and data
analysis. The college will match the award with an equal amount of funds.
