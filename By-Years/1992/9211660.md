Male reproductive function is under the control of a region of the brain called
the medial preoptic area. Within that area several neurotransmitters and their
interactions modulate that function. In this award, Dr. Elaine Hull will study
the effects of direct injections of neurotransmitter substances into the medial
preoptic area as well as the endogenous levels of these substances in the same
region. The technique used to collect fluid bathing the brain tissue is
microdialysis and the technique used to measure the levels of the
neurotransmitters is high performance liquid chromatography. Both of these
techniques are very sensitive to the small amounts of neurotransmitters that are
normally present within brain tissue. Behavioral observations will be made in
order to determine which neurotransmitters are released during reproductive
behavior. The neurotransmitters studied will be serotonin, dopamine, and gamma-
aminobutyric acid. This will provide information about the biochemical messages
that control reproductive function. The knowledge gained in these studies will
contribute to understanding how the brain controls complex functions, such as
reproduction.
