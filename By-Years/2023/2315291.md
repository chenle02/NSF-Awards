Kilo Moana is a 186-foot, general-purpose research vessel built in 2002 and
operated by the University of Hawaii under a charter party agreement with the
Office of Naval Research (ONR). The vessel is part of the US Academic Research
Fleet (ARF) and is supported by the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory
System (UNOLS). Ship time is made available to academic researchers funded by
the NSF, ONR, NOAA, NASA, and other federal and state agencies.

The University of Hawaii requests funds for purchase of the following
Oceanographic Instrumentation:

Reverse Osmosis/ Ultrapure Scientific Water System $23,576 OTDR/Copper Network
Tester $19,746 Overboard Handling System (OHS) Proof Load Test Kit $18,557
Hydrostatic Wire Cutter (2) $6,000 (not funded) Funded total $61,879 Broader
Impacts The principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review
Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 19-602). It provides infrastructure
support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in
support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually
undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF). The
acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-
funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated
instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and
expanding the base of potential researchers.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
