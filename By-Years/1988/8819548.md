In this project the strong motion records taken from the 26 accelerographs
located on and in the vicinity of the Vincent Thomas Bridge during the 1987
Whittier Earthquake will be studied. The study will: (i) define representative
and appropriately correlated non-synchronous support motions, (ii) validate
existing analytical modelling and seismic analysis, (iii) develop system
identification techniques that deal with multiple-input multiple-output models
(both linear and nonlinear), (iv) evaluate the bridge performance during the
earthquake, (v) optimize the return on the instrumentation investment and
improve the usefulness of the recorded-response data, (vi) propose a general
program for strengthening or retrofitting of existing cable-supported bridges,
(vii) obtain information on damping values as a function of the vibrational
amplitudes, (viii) obtain information on the soil-structure interaction of this
massive structure, (ix) develop elastic stoppers or other special devices to
dampen the effects of seismic and wind forces. The study will fulfill an urgent
need for comprehensive investigations of these unique and historical response
records to insure the safety of suspension bridges which have been widely in use
across the nation's seismic zones. The research results will be of extreme
importance to strengthen existing cable-supported bridges (as well as to design
new structure, and for up-grading and installing new monitoring
instrumentation).
