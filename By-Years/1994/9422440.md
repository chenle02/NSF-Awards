9422440 Henderson This project has two interrelated parts. The first examines
the effect of air quality regulation on decisions of firms concerning the
location of their plants, the scheduling of production, and the size of their
plants. The project tests the hypotheses that implementation of air quality
regulations has led firms to move plants from more polluted locations to less
polluted locations, move plants from states with more intense implementation of
regulations to those with easier conditions, implicitly reschedule economic
activity over the course of the day to help minimize extreme value air quality
readings, and downsize plants to avoid regulatory scrutiny. The results of this
study will improve our understanding of the unintended and overall effects of
environmental regulatory activity. Specifically, the investigation will help
show whether the Clean Air Act reduces emissions or just moves them around. The
second part involves a more extensive examination of plant productivity
determinants and location decisions of firms. The focus of the work is first on
establishing the existence of dynamic externalities which help bind clusters of
plants to the same locations over the years and then on quantifying the
magnitude and length (lag structure) to dynamic externalities. Dynamic
externalities are a critical component to determining the mobility and
productivity of plants and to understanding the organization of production
across space and within corporations. This project uses EPA and County Business
Patterns data collected under prior NSF projects and longitudinal individual
firm and plant data, available through the EPA and through the Center for
Economic Studies (CES) of the Census Bureau in the Research Data Center at the
Boston regional office.
