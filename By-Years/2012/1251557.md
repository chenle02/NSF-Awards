In order to advance the understanding of the critical zone and deeper crust and
to better couple the exchange of mass and energy between the surface and the
subsurface, this project will hold 3-day workshop to develop a long?]term vision
of a digital representation of the continental crust of N. America and design
concepts for prototype data model(s). The digital catalog of crustal structure,
composition and permeability (as well as parameters from which permeability
could be inferred) define the mechanisms by which to integrate vast amounts of
dcisparate data types and to construct a coherent, 3D picture of subsurface
structure and material properties, so that we can begin to represent subsurface
fluid flow in Earth system models and elucidate its critical controls in the
evolution of the Earth system from the past to the present and the
future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fluid circulation in the subsurface, from the
critical zone to the deeper crust, plays an essential role in surface, near-
surface, and crustal dynamics. In the critical zone (&lt;50m), soil water is a
ecologic filter and niche differentiator where energy is abundant, explaining
patterns in plant distribution globally and locally; and shallow groundwater is
a primary source for rivers, lakes and&lt;br/&gt;wetlands in dry seasons and
regions, thereby sustaining and modifying land and aquatic ecosystems,
influencing water quality, and buffering against droughts and temperature
extremes. Deeper in the crust (&lt;1km), the large sedimentary formations and
fractured rocks hold the fresh?]water aquifers that support major societies in
arid and semi-arid regions. In the deeper crust (&gt;1km), fluid flow affects
diagenesis, hydrocarbons, ore deposits, faulting, earthquakes, and geothermal
fields and involves water, gas and hydrocarbon flow. What are the flow paths
through the soils and rocks? How fast are the flows and how long are the
residence times? And how will they respond to changes in climate and land
surface drivers? The answers depend on a quantitative description of the
subsurface flow fields, driven by the hydraulic gradient but strongly controlled
by the permeability of the Earth?fs material. Creating a digital catalogue by
which to reconstruct this poorly sampled region of the planet will enable
multiple aspects of the Earth sciences to advance transformatively.
