The addition of a state-of-the-art scanning electron microscope to the equipment
available for students in biology, chemistry, and geology enhances the
laboratory experience of students in several ways: 1) an interdisciplinary
course in the use of the SEM is offered, 2) other courses have been enhanced by
the use of present- day SEM technology, 3) help attract majors into the
sciences. The grantee provides funds for this project that are an equal match
for the NSF award.
