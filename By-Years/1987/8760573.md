The overall objective of this program is to support the modernization of the
precision casting industries in the United States by providing knowledge
integrated Computer Aided Engineering and Manufacturing tools and methodologies
for significantly reducing the cycle-time for mold and process design and for
reducing the rate of rejection of finished cast products. The approach is to
make use of Knowledge-Base Integration and Parallel Computation techniques,
which have been developed by UES during the last three years, for (1)
integrating existing data bases and knowledge with CAD/CAM/CAE (computer-aided
design, computer- aided manufacturing, and computer-aided engineering) tools to
guide the designer in determining key process and design parameters; (2) speed
up process modeling techniques used for optimizing the design procedure. The
proposed system will be practical, cost effective and profitable in the vendor
industrial environment. During Phase I a feasibility study will be conducted to
identify the implementation strategy and in Phase II a prototype product will be
developed and the approach will be validated. The prototype product will be
productized and implemented in four or five major foundries in the United
States. To achieve the goals of Phase III, a consortium of foundries will be
formed.
