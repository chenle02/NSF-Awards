This project will establish a machine intelligence laboratory to be utilized to
strengthen the undergraduate program by directly supporting hands-on experience
in two new machine intelligence courses: Introduction to Machine Intelligence
and Expert Systems: Principles and Applications. In addition, undergraduates
from other departments will benefit through the opportunity to apply expert
system technology in their disciplines. The laboratory equipment being acquired
consists of a network of ten SUN workstations, two acting as file servers and
the other eight as economical diskless nodes. Interface technology including TV
cameras and digital scanners are connected to the network. Software running on
the machines includes a mixture of public domain and commercial software
implementing vision analysis tools, a neural network visualization tool and a
variety of commercial expert system shells. The combination of innovative
software, powerful workstations and modern interface equipment will provide an
effective and important environment for the hands-on projects and assignments of
the new courses.
