This project establishes an REU site in computer graphics and visualization at
the University of Rhode Island. A variety of multidisciplinary projects have
been identified for the interns, including fundamental graphics research or
research in support of a variety of applications to include graphical design,
transportation, education, and bioinformatics. The internships are designed for
both summer and academic year appointments, and the interns may participate in
research projects in three locations: the labs at URI, the not-for-profit imedia
organization, and the Frauenhofer Institute of Computer Graphics in Germany.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will aggressively recruit women and
underrepresented minority participants from a number of identified institutions
around Rhode Island. The three participating organizations will provide rare
opportunities to Rhode Island undergraduates to conduct research in resource-
rich environments. Interns choosing to conduct part of their research in Germany
will be exposed to international collaborations and one of Europe's premiere
research organizations. The projects offered should be of great interest to
undergraduates and therefore should help encourage them to pursue careers in
computer science. &lt;br/&gt;
