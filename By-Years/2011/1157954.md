A prosthetic robot hand is designed and developed with programmable passive
dynamics modeled after human hands. The goals include the development of
mathematical models of variable passive dynamics in human hands, the study of
the role of passive dynamics in hand operations, the design of novel joint
mechanisms, development of a hand prototype and an EMG control interface, and
the development of pedagogical laboratory modules for
education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project develops technology to substantially
improve rehabilitation and quality of life for persons with hand disabilities,
including amputees returning from ongoing wars. This work addresses the acute
need for substantial improvement in the functionality and control mechanisms for
prosthetic hands. Most current prosthetic hands do not address the underlying
design constraints of a useful prosthetic hand, namely, weight and size
limitations, limited control, ease of control and suitable aesthetics. In
addition, students learn this new subject and contribute to the advance of
science and technology in this domain. Finally, programs are in place to recruit
women, individuals with disabilities, and Native American students in
engineering research and education.
