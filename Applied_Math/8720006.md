This research is concerned with new applications of topology to molecular
biology and chemistry, and consists of three projects. The first is knot theory
and DNA, in which the analytical ability of knot theory and the precise new
experimental techniques of molecular biology (gel electrophoresis and rec A
enhanced electron microscopy) are combined to study enzyme mechanism and
substrate configuration. The second is the topological modelling of rotating
spiral wave phenomena in excitable media. The techniques of differential
topology can be combined with the algebraic topology of knot theory to quantize
these wave patterns, and to describe the time evolution of these patterns. The
third is polymers and the statistical mechanics of knots, in which knot theory
and self-avoiding random walk statistics are used to model volume exclusion
effects for polymers of high molecular weight in dilute solution. Some computer
computation, simulation and graphics will be required on these projects.
