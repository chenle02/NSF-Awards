Six unusual coenzymes (methanofuran, tetrahydromethanopterin, coenzyme M. nickle
tetrapyrrole F430, deazaflavin F420, and 7- mercaptoheptanolythreonine
phosphate) so far have been discovered to be required for the reduction of
carbon dioxide the methane. The present project continue studies on the terminal
reactions of this process, methyl group transfer and reduction to methane. The
protein known as component C is now clearly established as the methylreductase
(MR). Special interests are: How does the cell maintain MR in the active state?
%%% Methanogenic bacteria (methanogens) are archaebacteria and represent an
ancient divergence in evolution. An interesting aspect of this divergence is
that the biochemistry of methanogenesis has remained isolated in the
methanogens, a characteristic not shared by other living things. The uniqueness
of this biochemistry is dramatically shown by the six unusual coenzymes that so
far have been discovered to be required for the reduction of carbon dioxide to
methane. These studies are original and significant.
