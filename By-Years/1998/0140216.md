In this project laser light forces will be used to directly focus gallium and
indium atoms during the molecular beam epitaxy of III-V heterostructures. The
ability to focus the Group III atoms is particularly interesting because they
are the key building blocks of modern III-V semiconductor lasers. The optical
method will provide unprecedented control in the location and size of the
nanostructures. Thus, the work has the potential of revolutionizing
nanofabrication at the system level, and will have significant impact on the
field of optoelectronics and on the physics of heterostructures.
