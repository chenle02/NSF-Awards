An award is made to Boston University supporting a Research Coordination Network
to develop a simple, low-cost, tripod-mounted terrestrial laser scanner that can
rapidly survey a forest stand and automatically provide an accurate measurement
of the amount of aboveground biomass contained within the stand. Broader impacts
of this work include encouraging the participation of underrepresented groups
through a summer internship, thus serving the broader goal of diversity in
practitioners of science. One to three graduate students will be trained in the
rapidly developing field of terrestrial laser scanning, providing skills and
experience that will help move research and commercial technology forward.
Moreover, a widely-available lidar biomass scanner could be the key to better
assessment of carbon inventory and monitoring at regional and coarser spatial
scales. This would make an important contribution to global carbon management
and, in turn, help reduce human impact on climate.

By carefully-designed sampling, often incorporating aircraft and/or satellite
images, these measurements can be used to provide estimates of biomass, and
change in biomass with time, over large areas of forest. Such information is
essential for studies of the carbon cycle and measurement of mitigation of
anthropogenic increases of atmospheric carbon dioxide. A second network activity
identifies and develops other new applications of this and similar laser
scanners in forest ecology and related fields. The research network includes
researchers from the United States, United Kingdom, Netherlands, Switzerland,
Australia, and other nations who are presently working with commercial and
research-built terrestrial lidar scanners to study vegetation and forest
ecology. Network activities include workshops to bring lidar builders, users,
and ecologists together; smaller technology developer's meetings; exchanges of
graduate students or researchers between laboratories; and laboratory and field
standardization and intercomparison activities.
