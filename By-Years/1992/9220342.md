9220342 Platnick To increase the availability to systematic biologists of one of
the world's greatest entomological and arachnlogical collections in the world,
funds will be used (1) to hire two assistants to help curate the Hymenoptera and
Isoptera collections and complete a computerized database of primary type
holdings; (2) to hire two preparators to process specimens newly acquired
through an NSF-supported survey of insect and arachnid Biodiversity in southern
South America, along with relevant backlog material; (3) to support half the
costs of two-year curatorial/research appointments of specialists on the large
beetle families Chrysomelidae and Curculionidae; (4) to purchase standard-sized
insect storage cases, along with drawers and unit trays, to be installed on two
levels of a newly renovated, climate-controlled, compactor-equipped collection
facility; and (5) to purchase insect storage cases to accommodate large drawers
currently housing Lepidoptera under less than desirable conditions. ***
