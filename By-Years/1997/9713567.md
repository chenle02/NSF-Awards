9713567 Sillman The project investigates the chemistry of secondary species
associated with ozone formation, specifically total reactive nitrogen compounds
(NOy), peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) and associated organic nitrates, hydrogen
peroxide and organic peroxides. These chemical species have been measured during
a number of recent field measurement campaigns and for planned future campaigns
in the eastern U.S., including the Middle Tennesee Ozone Study, the NARSTO study
in the northeastern U.S. corridor, and the Ozone Photochemistry and Climatology
Experiment in Peliston, MI. The field data will serve as input into the
photochemical models to be developed and evaluated for this project. Model
results will be compared with measured values for ratios of key organic peroxide
compounds, along with other chemical indicators for ozone, NOx and reactive
organic hydrocarbons (ROG). Special emphasis will be placed on atmospheric
removal rates for peroxides and nitric acid in model calculations, and on recent
proposed changes and uncertainties in organic peroxide chemistry. An attempt
will be made to derive atmospheric removal rates for peroxides and nitric acid
by comparing measurements with different model scenarios. Implications for the
use of peroxides as ozone-NOx-ROG indicators will be investigated. Results from
this modeling project will provide rigorous and detailed evaluations of ozone
formation processes occurring in the lower troposphere over urban and rural
continental areas of the northeastern U.S.
