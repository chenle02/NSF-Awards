This Innovation Corps project will enable focused research by the proposed team
to help bring the proposed Electrochemical Desalination Cell (EDC) to the
market. EDC desalinates brine waste while producing electricity, synthesizing
valuable inorganic chemicals, and consuming carbon dioxide. The I-Corps PI's
previous NSF awards investigate the structure property relationships of
nanomaterials in energy conversion devices. The first demonstration of the EDC
was complete in through previous research, and proved the thermodynamic
feasibility of the device. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary research goal for
this project is to achieve power densities and desalination rates an order of
magnitude higher than that obtained from the initial prototype. If successful,
the proposed technology has the potential to create a sustainable business
through an industrial ecological approach that combines energy generation, brine
treatment and chemical synthesis into a single, integrated process.
