Measurement of displacements and motion during a real or simulated earthquake
is fundamental in experimental earthquake engineering research. This research
project investigates the concept of using a holographic camera that is capable
of producing a motion and strain diagnostics picture of a large surface at
kilometer distances. The intended purpose of the instrument is to monitor
surfaces such as the face of a building, a bridge foundation, a retaining wall,
or a geological structure during interaction with real or simulated geological
or meteorological forces. In ordinary holography an unmodulated reference wave
that travels the same distance as the object wave is required. The research
extends holographic interferometry to large, distant surfaces by deriving the
holographic reference wave from one of three possible sources, from the object
wave, a method known as local reference wave holography, from an optical delay
line, or from a glint on the object. The recording is further enhanced through
the use of CCD detectors and light amplifiers. Strain or motion contours and
vibrational mode structure can then be observed with resolutions of the order of
0.3 micrometers. The device employs double pulsed holographic interferometry.
The research will employ both analytical and experimental methods to determine
feasibility. This research project represents Phase I of a Small Business
Innovation Research Grant.
