This project is dedicated to new research on the analysis of Boolean functions.
Boolean functions are some of the most studied combinatorial objects in computer
science, with interest from diverse areas of theoretical computer science
including but not limited to quantum computing, complexity theory, and learning
theory. Since all computations in computer science are represented by Boolean
values, Boolean functions are commonly used to analyze the computational
process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, the investigator aims to make
progress on several central open problems in Boolean function analysis and build
connections to other research areas in computer science. Specifically, the
investigator focuses on the following three problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.
The Aaronson-Ambainis Conjecture on influential variables of low-degree bounded
Boolean functions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Mansour’s Conjecture on the Fourier
sparsity of small-size Disjunctive Normal Forms (DNFs).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3.
The sunflower conjecture on the structure of set
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Aaronson-Ambainis Conjecture has connections
to quantum computing. It captures when quantum queries can speed up classical
computation significantly. Mansour's Conjecture has connections to machine-
learning theory. As a corollary, it gives an efficient agnostic learning
algorithm for DNFs. The sunflower conjecture connects to extremal combinatorics,
which is an active research area of mathematics. The project’s educational plans
including course development are integrated with the research. One or two PhD
students will participate in this project as part of their PhD training. The
investigator will also create a course about Boolean-function
analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
