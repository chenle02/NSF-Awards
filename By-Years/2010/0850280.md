This project, administered in a center for ecology, is initiating an S-STEM
Green Scholarships program for talented transfer students with demonstrated
financial need to matriculate from 2-year colleges to a 4-year degree program in
an environmental science discipline. The Green Scholarship program builds on
existing support services and programs to prepare the Green Scholars to complete
a baccalaureate degree and enter the workforce or graduate school equipped to
solve complex environmental problems. Scholars enter a living-learning community
that includes common housing and courses to enhance research and problem-solving
skills. To additionally build a sense of community, scholars have access to a
central study room that houses undergraduate scholarship programs. A
multifaceted mentoring network of peers, faculty and staff is helping to ensure
that academic and professional goals are met and that the scholars perform at
the best of their abilities. Workshops on professional development and career
choices are provided, and governmental partners present seminars on internship
and employment opportunities. Scholars are also offered opportunities to partner
with research faculty mentors, and to experience vocational training through
internships at seven partner facilities.
