The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project potentially
includes any application that requires mirrors. The coating technology reduces
mirror production costs and enables the coating of mirror films over a large
area and an increased variety of surfaces. Some examples of possible
applications include solar thermal heating for power generation or industrial
processes. The use of mirrors in these applications enables the use of clean,
renewable energy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technology developed from this
research is an an optically reflective coating using a metal that is liquid at
room temperature. The metal is a low-toxicity gallium-based alloy that can be
sprayed onto surfaces to form mirrors. The coating technique is simpler than
current methods of manufacturing mirrors, allowing the coating of larger
surfaces and the coating of a greater variety of materials. An initial prototype
shows that the liquid-metal mirror coating has a higher optical reflectivity
than that of aluminum. This innovative application of liquid metal along with
the simple coating technique is inexpensive, simple, and can be applied on-site
using mobile coating units, saving time and money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
