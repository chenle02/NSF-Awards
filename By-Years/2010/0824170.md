Collaborative Research: Scaling Laws for NanoFET Biosensors

The objective of this research is to develop fundamental understanding on how
the performance of nanoscale field effect transistor biosensors depends on
device geometrical sizes at different physical conditions. The approach is to
numerically investigate device scaling behaviors at various physical conditions
by using a random resistor network model and experimentally test these scaling
laws at different field effect strengths by using Si-based devices as a model
system. Intellectual Merit: The outcome of this research will answer the
fundamentally intriguing and technologically important question on whether and
how the sensitivity and detection limits of field effect biosensors depend on
their geometrical dimensions and relevant physical parameters. The project is
transformative in terms that scaling laws for field effect biosensors as
critical design guidelines will enable tailoring the sensitivity and detection
limits in accordance with target analyte concentrations, and enable design of
devices with ultra-low detection limits. Broader Impacts: Ultra-sensitive
biosensors can find various applications from food safety, homeland security to
disease diagnostics for human health care. Graduate and undergraduate students
will be trained in this interdisciplinary project on device and computational
physics, semiconductor nanostructure fabrication and characterization, and
surface and interface biochemistry. Special efforts will be made to recruit
female and underrepresented minority students for participation. Research
discoveries from this project will be incorporated into the courses developed by
the principle investigators. Outreach activities include school visits, training
of high school senior students, and participation of NSF GK-12 Program.
