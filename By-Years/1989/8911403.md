Large-scale ranching and logging operations are converting mature, forested
ecosystems of Amazona to frequently-burned, regrowth forest. In a mature forest
relict at the heart of an Amazonian ranching and lumbering center, root systems
extend to at least 12 m depth and apparently enable this ecosystem to maintain
carbon assimilation and transpiration through the 5 month dry season. The
project will evaluate the hypothesis that frequently- burned, regrowth forests
(1) are shallow-rooted, (2) extract less water from the soil during the dry
season and (3) store less rainfall in the soil during the wet season in
comparison to the mature forests that they are replacing. These prediction are
tested by a comparative study of root distribution, fine root growth, soil water
availability, soil water uptake and rainfall storage in mature forest, intact
regrowth forest, and recently- burned regrowth forest. This will be accomplished
using a network of soil shafts, 7 m deep, in which measurements of root
distribution and monitoring spatial and temporal patterns of root growth, soil
water potential and soil water content will be observed. The studies proposed
here will ask basic questions about an important, but previously neglected
aspect of ecosystem structure and function within the context of a rapidly
changing tropical landscape. The investigator are well qualified for this type
of research and have more than adequate institutional support.
