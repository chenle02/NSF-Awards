This project is concerned with research in commutative algebra. The principal
investigator will investigate the structure of projective modules and the
efficient generation of ideals and modules over affine algebras. The goal is to
study these problems by attaching suitable invariants to projective modules and
ideals. These invariants arise from the geometry of the affine variety attached
to the ring. A prominent role is played by the Chow groups of the affine
varieties and the Chern classes of projective modules. This research is in the
general area of algebraic geometry. Algebraic geometry is the study of geometric
objects arising from the sets of zeros of systems of polynomial equations. This
is one of the oldest and currently one of the most active branches of
mathematics. It has widespread applications in mathematics, computer science and
physics.
