Long &amp; Medium-Term Research: Qualitatively Riemannian Foliations. This award
recommendation is made under the Program for Long &amp; Medium-Term Research at
Foreign Centers of Excellence. The program seeks to enable U.S. scientists and
engineers to conduct long-term research abroad at research institutions of
proven excellence. Awards provide opportunities for the conduct of joint
research, and the use of unique or complimentary facilities, expertise and
experimental conditions in foreign countries. This award will support an
18-month visit by Dr. Mark Kellum to work with Professor Etienne Ghys of L'>cole
Normale Sup>rieure de Lyon in Lyon, France, on "Qualitatively Riemannian
Foliations." The proposal concerns ongoing research into the structure of
qualitatively Riemannian foliations on compact manifolds, a continuation of
research the principal investigator began with his thesis, where he showed that
the Molino theory on leaf closures in Riemannian foliations generalizes to the
qualitatively Riemannian situation. In his thesis, he employed the theory of
locally compact transformation groups. This theory, together with results due to
Sacksteder, Furstenberg and Ellis in measure- theoretic and topological
dynamics, suggests studying the closure of the holonomy pesudogroup, when it
consists of equicontinuous or distal local homeomorphisms. These theories also
suggest a relaxation of our original differentiability assumptions on the
holonomy pseudogroup of local metric isometries. Ghys also points to many of the
same results in his treatment of qualitatively Riemannian foliations.
