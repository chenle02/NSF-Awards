This research consists of three separate parts. The first involves the analysis
of product design innovation and fashion cycles using dynamic game theory. A
model of the fashion cycle will be developed in which fashion is used as a
signaling device in a mating game. Designers can create durable design
commodities which are used by consumers to signal and to screen prospective
partners. In this context price and innovation, diffusion of fashion, and
conspicuous consumption behavior will be examined. The second part of the
project focuses on the comparison of equilibrium outcomes in dynamic games when
there are a large finite number of players and when there are a continuum of
players. The third part involves analyzing the participation and voting behavior
in two candidate elections when voters do not have the same information. The
conditions under which voters will abstain form voting will be examined. In
addition, the efficiency of elections as a mechanism to aggregate information
will be analyzed, as well as conditions under which election outcomes are biased
in favor of a minority.
