The H. J. Andrews Experimental Forest is a 16,000 acre (6400 hectare) U.S.
Forest Service property in the western Oregon Cascades dedicated to research and
education. It is jointly administered by Oregon State University (OSU) and the
U.S. Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research Station (PNW). Research use of
the Andrews Forest and nearby Research Natural Areas is heavy, with more than
7000 researcher-days of use and over 100 separate projects in each of the last 5
years. Current overnight capacity is inadequate, however, and threatens to get
worse as old, worn out trailers reach the point of condemnation. Since 1985,
capacity has declined from 54 to 40 and will decrease to 28 in the next two
years unless new space is created. Quite simply the research site is facing a
housing crisis. This project will help construct two quadruplex dormitories. OSU
has pledged $56,000 and PNW $137,000 for a total of $193,000, a 50/50 match. The
two quads would increase overnight capacity bedrooms, two bathrooms with showers
and a kitchen-living area. Bedrooms (about 100 sq. ft. each) will contain a bed,
desk, bookcase, and wardrobe. The quads will be plain but solid with 6 inch
studding, exteriors of T-1-11 siding, drywall panelling, and plywood
cabinetwork. They will also be well insulated with R-19 walls and floors, R-32
ceilings, and double-glazed windows.
