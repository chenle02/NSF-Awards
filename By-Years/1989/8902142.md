This award in the NSF/DARPA Joint Initiative on Image Understanding and Speech
Recognition is for a preliminary study of layered abduction as a control
mechanism in speech perception. Layered abduction is a structured inference
technique developed for problems in artificial intelligence and machine
learning. The proposed system for speech recognition will include acoustic,
articulatory, and phonological/prosodic strata, each forming and evaluating
hypotheses at various levels of temporal resolution. A simple system will be
built first to test the speech analysis techniques and develop efficient control
algorithms. This project will unify the existing and planned work of several
investigators at the Ohio State University, creating a framework for further
advances in speech perception.
