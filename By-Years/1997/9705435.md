*** The objective of this workshop is to bring together leading scientists,
engineers, practitioners, and entrepreneurs in the robotics and healthcare
communities, display state-of-the-art of healthcare robotics, and identify
fundamental issues and key technologies which require long term research
endeavors. The rapid increase of the aged population and soaring healthcare
costs are crucial problems faced by today's society. Traditional labor-intensive
services and costly treatments will no longer be affordable, yet demands for
quality care continue to increase. New healthcare technologies are emerging from
robotics and intelligent systems which would make significant changes in the
current practice of healthcare services. Minimally invasive surgery, for
example, allows patients to be quickly discharged from the hospital. Remote
health monitoring and tele-nursing systems allow patients to stay at home, thus
avoiding costly hospital stays. Robotic vehicles and manipulation technologies
allow bedridden patients and elderly people to live independently. Miniaturized
sensors and actuators, wireless communication, advanced human-machine interface,
and their integration technologies are pointing in the future direction of
healthcare technology. Furthermore, strategic planning of research, development,
and deployment as well as the social and economic impact of the new technologies
will be discussed at the workshop. The workshop will be held on March 26 and 27,
1997 in the Boston area. Participants will be invited from various sectors of
the healthcare community, e.g., hospitals, home health agencies, nursing homes,
insurance companies, as well as the vendors and researchers in robotics,
biomedical engineering, communication, and software. The result will be
published and disseminated as workshop proceedings as well as by web page and
virtual librari es.***
