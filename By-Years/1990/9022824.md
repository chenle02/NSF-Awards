This research examines the recrystallization kinetics in metal alloys that have
second phase particles. Some alloys containing fine particles can display
behavior changing from suppression to retardation to acceleration of
recrystallization with increasing plastic strain. This study centers on the
pinning forces that can occur from particles during primary recrystallization.
The experimental results will be compared to a model formulated to explain the
recrystallization kinetics. Calorimetry and transmission electron microscopy are
employed to follow the underlying mechanisms associated with the
recrystallization process. The research contributes to an understanding of
recrystallization processes in metal alloys and should result in a quantitative
model of the effect of small, hard particles on recrystallization kinetics. This
information will provide greater control of alloy microstructure during
processing.
