The PIs propose to conduct a detailed study of the electronic and vibrational
structure of O3 by angle-resolved electron scattering spectroscopy. They assert
that the electronic states must be better characterized in order to begin a
proper assessment of the role of ozone in the chemistry, radiative transfer, and
non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) effects in the terrestrial
atmosphere. The PIs plan to reproduce the 15-yr-old electron energy loss spectra
of Swanson and Celotta, with improved sensitivity, energy resolution, and
angular coverage, and to extend the measurements to include determinations of
electronic and vibrational excitation cross sections. The Swanson and Celotta
result, though pioneering, is marginal in sensitivity and definitive feature
assignments; however it remains the only tangible experimental evidence for the
energetics of the controversial low-lying metastable states of ozone. The
premise is that these states may participate in the O + O2 recombination
sequence, and thus could be significant energy carriers in the photochemistry of
O3 in the stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere.
