This project will synthesize the global record of zoogeographic and
paleoenvironmental distribution of Late Ordovician to Middle Silurian
brachiopods. The effects of the massive Ordovician-Silurian extinction event on
zoogeography and paleoecology will be traced in order to examine rates of
recovery and reorganization. Preliminary results indicating that wide
distribution of brachiopods promoted survival during the extinction will be
examined more closely, and the pattern will be examined to see whether or not it
holds in each of six paleoenvironmental zones arrayed from shallow to deep
environments. Construction of time-environment diagrams will permit detailed
examination of the evolutionary history and environmental distribution of
brachiopod groups.
