In this project supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic
Chemistry Program, John E. Bercaw of the Calif- ornia Institute of Technology
will investigate the synthesis and properties of new types of dioxygen-
compatible transition metal compounds which may be capable of selectively
oxidizing hydrocarbons. The eventual aim of this research is to develop a useful
catalytic method for converting hydrocarbons from coal, petroleum or natural gas
sources to alcohols (in particular, methane to methanol), which may be more
readily transportable and useful energy sources or chemical feedstocks. The
project has two thrusts: (1) synthesis of new soluble oxo or peroxo derivatives
of ruthenium, which could smoothly convert olefins to epoxides or carbonyl
compounds and hydro- carbons to alcohols, and (2) mechanistic studies which
involve carbon-oxygen bond formation or carbon-oxygen bond cleavage at hafnium
and tantalum. The latter project would lead to an understanding of the kinetic
and thermodynamic factors influencing carbon-oxygen and hydrogen-oxygen bond
formation at transition metal centers which would aid in design of the catalysts
in part (1). Related studies are also proposed which could provide some model
compounds and transformations of relevance to catalytic hydrodesulfurization
chemistry.
