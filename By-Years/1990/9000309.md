This experimental program will concentrate or reactions of chromium species with
oxygen and chlorine. Three unique facilities will be used: a high temperature,
fast flow reactor with laser-induced fluorescence monitoring of the Cr radicals;
a high temperature, atmospheric pressure, photochemistry metal reactor; and a
low pressure flow reactor coupled to a mass spectrometer. Like the past work on
aluminum reactions, due attention will be paid to the fundamental aspects of the
results. The temperature range to be investigated is 900 to 1900 K, with
pressures form 10-2 to 1.0 bar. The formation of metal compounds in
incineration, whether as particulates or gaseous emissions, has been identified
as an important economic and health problem. Little is known about the process
involved in the formation and disappearance of such species in incinerators. The
proposed program will provide accurate rate coefficient and mechanistic data on
elementary gas-phase reactions of interest.
