Ultsch 9603934 Reptiles and amphibians (herps) in the northern portions of
their ranges in North America may spend as much as half of their lives
hibernating. Aquatic harps avoid freezing by hibernating underwater, but they
then must switch from aerial to aquatic respiration, with its attendant
physiological challenges. However, there have been no detailed
physiological/ecological studies of naturally hibernating aquatic herps, and
only two species, both turtles, have been studied extensively during simulated
hibernation in the laboratory. We propose to study hibernation and overwintering
in northern herps, starting by expanding our previous studies on turtles to
include new species and field work. The field physiology and behavior of
naturally hibernating painted turtles, map turtles, soflshelled turtles, and
snapping turtles from known northern populations in New England will be studied
by radiotelemetric tracking. Concurrently, laboratory studies of physiological
responses to simulated hibernation will be conducted with all 4 species from
northern populations. Data should allow generalizations about
physiological/ecological strategies concerning this major portion of the life
cycle of freshwater turtles, lay the groundwork for future studies of other
harps, suggest general strategies among herps for overwintering, and provide
information important to conservation efforts.
