This project is intended to improve the mathematics instruction by making
effective use of state-of-the-art computers and associated technological
equipment. Innovations in the teaching of mathematical concepts have been made
possible by advances in computer hardware and software. We need to ensure that
our teachers can use these technological advances to their fullest potential.
This project will establish a laboratory to provide practical classroom
activities and demonstrations for prospective elementary and secondary
teachers.We will replace our outdated lab of Apple II computers with a network
of Macintosh workstations, a file server, a CD-ROM player, a video disk player
and a scanner. This local network will be connected to our existing campus
network and through it to the internet, giving our students access to a growing
network connecting elementary and secondary post-secondary educators.For our
education students in mathematics to be trained to teach at a world-class level,
they need experiences on state-of-the-art equipment. This equipment will enable
our students to learn problem solving strategies, programming, and applications
on equipment that will be the latest currently available. Thus, our students
will be able to contribute their expertise to the community-at-large upon
graduation.
