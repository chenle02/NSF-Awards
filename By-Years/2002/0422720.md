The goal of this project is the design, fabrication, control and testing of
novel, lightweight actuators that will be able to apply large forces and achieve
large displacements using compact mechanisms. The proposed concept for novel
actuation devices is based on a hybrid combination of Electro-Rheological Fluids
(ERF) and electromagnetic actuation concepts. The proposed new class of
actuation devices is called ECFS (Electrically Controlled Force and Stiffness)
actuators. Design, fabricate and control compact prismatic joints mobilized by
ECFS actuators will be studied. Extensive tests will be performed to demonstrate
the effectiveness of the ECFS actuators. Furthermore, the possibility of using
the ECFS actuators to power the joints of force-feedback devices and haptic
interfaces will be investigated. The broader impact and outreach activities of
this project are: a) the initiation of undergraduate students in research; b)
the establishment of collaborative projects on engineering design and robotic
systems with the science and technology high schools of New Jersey with the
objective to attract new students in this field; c) the organization of a
special session at the annual ASME International Mechanical Engineering Congress
and Exposition (IMECE) and of a focused section in one issue of the journal IEEE
/ ASME Transactions on Mechatronics on the design, modeling and control of
advanced actuators; d) the development and maintenance of a webpage on ERF based
devices; and e) the establishment of international collaborative activities in
the area of advanced actuators.
