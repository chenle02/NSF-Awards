Elliptic variational inequalities are fundamental mathematical tools for
modeling phenomena that involve elliptic partial differential operators and
constrained optimization. This project will develop and analyze finite element
methods for fourth and higher order elliptic variational inequalities, which
arise naturally for example in mechanics and elliptic optimal control problems.
A recent theoretical advance by the PIs demonstrates that, for the displacement
obstacle problems of Kirchhoff plates, the heart of the error analysis involves
only problems at the continuous level and therefore any finite element method
that works for fourth order boundary value problems can also be adapted for
obstacle problems. This new approach will be extended to other fourth and higher
order variational inequalities with different types of constraints, which will
bring well-developed finite element methodologies for boundary value problems
(conforming and nonconforming methods, discontinuous Galerkin methods,
generalized finite element methods, isoparametric finite element methods, local
mesh refinement, singular function method, etc.) into the study of numerical
solution of higher order variational inequalities. Fast solvers for higher order
variational inequalities, such as multigrid methods, domain decomposition
methods and adaptive methods, will also be developed. In particular this project
will lead to new algorithms for second order elliptic distributed optimal
control problems with pointwise state and/or control constraints that are
fundamentally different from existing algorithms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
results from this project will provide new insights to the numerical solution of
higher order variational inequalities, an area that is becoming increasingly
important as more and more complex phenomena in science, engineering and finance
are being modeled by higher order differential equations. The outcomes of this
project will impact diverse areas that require reliable and efficient numerical
algorithms for the solution of such inequalities.
