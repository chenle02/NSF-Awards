Technical Narrative: This proposed workshop, organized by the South Dakota
School of Mines and Technology, and Istanbul Technical University, is scheduled
for 09 May 1992 in Istanbul, Turkey. The workshop objective is to discuss the
future needs and future directions of U.S-Turkey collaborative research on the
use of cementitious materials in concrete. This workshop will follow the Fourth
CANMET/ACI International Conference on Fly Ash, Silica Fume, Slag, and Natural
Pozzolans in Concrete to be held 03-08 May 1992 in Istanbul. This proposal
supports the travel of approximately eight U.S. engineers who will participate
in the workshop and also present papers at the conference. This workshop to plan
future collaborative research activities involving construction materials
fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling
leading experts in the United States and Turkey to combine complementary talents
and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
