Cohoon This research takes an integrated look across the physical design
activities of partitioning, floorplanning and routing. The work has two
components, routing and partitioning. In routing, algorithms for generalized
multi-layer and multi-net routing are being explored. These algorithms are
designed to route on any number of layers, work on a rectilinear, gridless
surface with obstacles, account for technology constraints, and permit
horizontal, vertical and 45 degree wiring on a layer. In partitioning, a
powerful geometric partitioning technique called SHARP is being used to develop
algorithms (including parallel ones) which bridge between various physical
design activities, such as floor-planning, Steiner routing, and identification
of critical nets. Algorithms are being integrated into a tool for overall
design, and a visualization tool is being developed.
