9414511 Luzzi This grant supports a 12-month research visit in Japan for
Professor David Luzzi, Department of Materials Science and Engineering,
University of Pennsylvania, to Kyoto University, where he will work with
Professor Masaharu Yamaguchi of the Department of Metal Science and Technology.
The research project focuses on the dependance of interface structure on
processing conditions and the effect on mechanical properties in directionally
solidified in-situ composite materials. The project takes advantage of the
process expertise of the Japanese group led by Dr. Yamaguchi and the specialized
equipment present in his lab. The economic implications of the development of
these high-temperature materials is significant, especially for the aerospace
industry. The research should lead to the development of several candidate
materials systems, whose applications should increase steadily over time as the
materials are improved and costs are reduced. In addition to carrying out
research at Kyoto University, Professor Luzzi will visit Japanese companies
which are active in high-temperature materials research. ***
