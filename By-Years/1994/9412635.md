9412635 Beale The award would enable the Principal Investigator to undertake
projects in the general area of machine design and maintenance as it relates to
textile machines used for knitting, weaving and textile processing. Specific
efforts to be undertaken include finite element modeling of machine components,
control system optimization of textile processing machinery, kinematic synthesis
of textile mechanisms, and application of smart material technology. Design
improvements to the loom would also be considered, involving the use of braiding
principles in order to achieve improvements in the production rate. The design
improvements have the potential to achieve an order of magnitude improvement in
production rate in the intensively competitive of textile manufacturing. The
interaction between the Principal Investigator and the textile manufacturer
would also be mutually beneficial to both parties involved. The former would
benefit from its impact on his teaching and research activities, whereas the
latter would benefit from exposure to advanced technology.
