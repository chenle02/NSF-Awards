9507726 Cable This award supports a one-year postdoctoral fellowship from the
Japan Society for the Promotion of Science for Dr. Samuel B. Cable. This
fellowship will make it possible for Dr. Cable to collaborate with Prof. Yutaka
Uchida of the Science University of Tokyo and the University of Tokyo. They will
use three dimensional magnetohydrodynamic computer modeling to test alternative
theories of the origins of solar flares. New theories of flare origin are needed
because many of the traditional ideas in this field have met with serious,
perhaps insurmountable, difficulties in light of the data from the Japanese
"Yohkoh" satellite. This project fulfills the Program's objective of exchange of
scientific knowledge through international collaboration. As a postdoctoral
fellow, Dr. Cable will be able to familiarize himself with the Yohkoh data
(unquestionably the best data on solar flares available to date) and with new
theories regarding solar flares developed by the Yohkoh research staff. He will
also contribute to the development and testing of these theories. ***
