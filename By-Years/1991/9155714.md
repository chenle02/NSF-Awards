This project is to lay the groundwork for a practical implementation of the
knowledge assessment techniques, developed by the PI and his collaborators, in
some selected schools in Orange County California. This involves gathering a
team of collaborators, including teachers, securing the appropriate physical
conditions, and beginning the construction of the pedagogical materials. The
proposed work is broken down into five phases: 1. contact with local elementary,
junior, and senior high schools; 2. assemble the team of researchers, including
the PI's and 4 expert teachers; 3. selection of a large collection of items to
form the domain of the knowledge structures, and covering grades 1-12; 4.
analyze the selected items for conceptual content and skills for mastery; 5. use
the QUERY routine to make a first pass at building the knowledge structures,
using the teachers as subjects;
