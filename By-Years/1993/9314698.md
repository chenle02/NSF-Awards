9314698 Tyson Abundances and Kinematics of Stars in the Galactic Bulge and Role
of Supernovae in the Evolution of Dwarf Galaxies. Dr. Tyson will use this
Minority Research Initiation Planning Grant to explore the scientific fertility
of two lines of research: (1) Element abundances in and kinematics of classes of
stars in the bulge of our Galaxy; and (2) Star formation in dwarf galaxies. By
the end of the planning grant period, Dr. Tyson expects to have selected one of
the two areas for pursuit of a full-scale research program. ===============
