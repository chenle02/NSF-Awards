This award supports a manufacturing initiative to assist in developing the
instruments, methodology, metrology, and basic engineering science necessary to
accelerate and support the growth of a new high-technology industry,
nanotechnology. Nanotechnology is the technology where dimensions and tolerances
in the range 0.1-100 nanometers (from the size of an atom to the wavelength of
light) are crucial. The effort is designed to collaborate with and complement
the research efforts of other teams and centers in the U.S. working in this
important area. In order to provide a conceptual goal for the effort, the focus
will be on attempting to develop the technology to build advanced mass storage
devices using micro-mechanical actuators and molecular manipulation. The device,
conceptualized, is a "write-once, read-many" (WORM) drive, in analogy to optical
disk technology where this was the first type of mass storage developed.
