Program verification has broad applications, from ensuring safety of mission-
critical software to improving program robustness and programmer productivity.
Automatic program verification techniques employ various forms of learning to
enhance scalability on large programs. These include deductive learning in
modern logic-based solvers and learning from counterexamples in abstraction
refinement procedures. Modular verification is essential for scaling
verification to large software, and concurrent program verification is critical
due to the wide prevalence of multi-core hardware. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project develops techniques for learning inductive invariants for modular
verification in a teacher-learner setting. The research objectives include
studying suitable languages of invariants at procedure boundaries, identifying
requirements for progress in learning, and developing effective techniques for
guiding the learner. The project also addresses verification of concurrent
programs, where learning over different event sequences is performed by dynamic
and predictive analysis over program traces. The goal is to drive the learning
toward unexplored program behaviors by automatically generating test inputs. The
research objectives include studying new trace abstractions and coverage metrics
for concurrent programs, and developing techniques for coverage-guided test
generation. The methods for driving learning include directed testing to target
specific scenarios relevant for learning. Beyond these specific contributions,
the results will provide insights on applying machine learning techniques in
combination with static and dynamic analysis for advancing program verification.
The project includes development of educational material, tools, and benchmarks
that will be made publicly available.
