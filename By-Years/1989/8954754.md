This project will move towards implementation of the recommendations developed
by the Mathematical Association Of America in a previous National Science
Foundation (NSF) funded project. The Association recommends that schools
nationwide establish prognostic testing and counseling programs in mathematics
for college-bound students in the junior year of high school. The purpose of
this testing is to allow such students in their senior year to take whatever
further mathematics is necessary to minimize the need for remedial mathematics
courses in college. In this project members of the mathematics faculties and
administrations at three Pennsylvania universities will work with ten high
schools in western Pennsylvania to encourage institution of such testing and
counseling programs. The experience in these high schools will serve to guide
further implementation throughout the state. Cost sharing by the partners will
total 230% of the NSF funding.//
