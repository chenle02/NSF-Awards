This award supports participation in a conference on commutative algebra, KUMUNU
2018, which will be held at the University of Kansas, Lawrence, Oct 13-14, 2018.
KUMUNU (which is named for its original participating institutions: the
University of Kansas, the University of Missouri, Columbia, and the University
of Nebraska, Lincoln) is an annual conference (held since 1999) for commutative
algebraists in the Great Plains region. Major goals specific to KUMUNU 2018 are
to broaden the geographic reach of the conference, promote a connection between
commutative algebra and related areas, and showcase the research of early career
mathematicians. To promote connections between commutative algebra and other
areas, talks from some experts on tropical geometry, convex geometry, and
optimization are included. The conference will also include a poster session for
junior researchers.

The general goal of KUMUNU is to provide a setting to share cutting-edge
mathematical research and promote collaborations among algebraists in or within
driving distance of the Great Plains region. KUMUNU 2018 aims to advance
mathematics through the dissemination of new and innovative results and
techniques via research talks. These talks are intended to inspire participating
mathematicians and promote collaboration. Invited speakers are David Eisenbud
(University of California), Raymond Heitmann (University of Texas), Siamak
Yassemi (University of Tehran), Ryo Takahashi (Nagoya University), Jason
McCullough (Iowa State University), Parangarma Sarkar (University of Missouri),
Kyungyong Lee (University of Nebraska). Informal discussions between talks will
help spread new results and ideas. Talks will be held from noon on Saturday to
noon on Sunday, thereby minimizing expenses for participants. Award funds will
defray one night's accommodation and travel expenses, with an emphasis on
support of graduate students and early-career researchers.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
