The Mississippi Alliance has developed a three component statewide strategy
which will focus on undergraduate research and education to increase enrollment
and graduation rates of minority students in science and engineering, a
precollege outreach program with focus on early identification, and an
industrial linkage to leverage NSF monies. The activities developed by this
alliance are as follows: 1. six week summer residential experience, 2. student
support teams, 3. undergraduate student research, 4. interdisciplinary seminars,
5. GRE workshops, and 5. an annual IMAGE Conference. The average total minority
enrollment in the participating institutions is 31%. The average minority
enrollment in science and engineering is 24%; AMP funds should enable the
increase of underrepresented minorities in science and engineering.
