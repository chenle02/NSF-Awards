An Astronomy lab course for juniors and seniors is being offered. It will be a
hands-on course in optical and infrared astronomy instrumentation. The emphasis
is on the hardware used in contemporary astronomical observations, rather than
software, and the lab will explore the operation of real detectors and optics,
rather than just the principles. The lab is intended to prepare students to
design and build spectrographs; detector systems, controllers, and cameras by
doing real projects.
