9615239 Biscaye This award is for one year of support to continue work on
samples of atmospheric dusts from ice cores from Siple Dome, West Antarctica.
The dusts will be extracted from the ice and analyzed for mineralogical and
isotopic (strontium, neodymium, lead) compositions with a view to determining
their provenance---the continental area(s) from which they were derived and
transported through the atmosphere to Siple Dome. The principal means of
relating the dusts to their continental source area(s) will be to compare their
mineralogical and isotopic characteristics to the fine grained particles from
samples of loess and other aeolian sediments from Southern Hemisphere
continental areas. Information on the source areas of the dusts at various times
in the past provides constraints on models of paleoatmospheric circulation and
transport around and to Antarctica.
