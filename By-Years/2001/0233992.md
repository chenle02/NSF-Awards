This research explores the use of faunal and geochemical proxies to investigate
the interactions of sea level fluctuations and tectonic processes on the
Indonesian Seaway and associated effects on the early development of the western
Pacific warm pool. The study will use statistical analyses of planktic
foraminifer populations and isotope measurements on multi-species of planktic
foraminifers to reconstruct upper water column structure, productivity and
seasonality for key intervals during the middle to late Miocene (ca 13.5 - 6.0
Ma). Mg/Ca measurements on benthic and planktic foraminifers will be used to
estimate the influences of ice volume and surface water salinity on the oxygen
isotope record. &lt;br/&gt;
