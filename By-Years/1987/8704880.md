A servo-hydraulic testing machine is being provided for characterization of
materials at high temperatures. The materials of interest are fiber composites
with brittle matrices, such as ceramic, glass and carbon, and metal matrix
composites. The increasing need for applications of these materials at high
temperatures--up to at least 2000 degrees Centigrade--has created the
requirement for mechanical characterization at high temperatures. This poses a
challenging problem for testing equipment and procedures. The machine can be
modified by addition of a high-temperature furnace with water-cooled grips and
an electro-optical extensometer for high-temperature characterization of
materials.
