This is an award to provide support for purchase of engineering research
equipment to permit study of anaerobic decomposition of municipal solid waste.
The equipment to be purchased with this support consists of a refuse shredder
and a high-speed liquid chromatograph system. This equipment will be used on
several research projects involving management of municipal solid wastes
including studies of the inhibition of solid waste decomposition in sanitary
landfills, techniques to enhance methane production from refuse, fate of
hazardous wastes in landfills and the biodegradative characteristics of
individual components of municipal solid wastes. The proposal leading to this
award was submitted in response to the Program Announcement and Guidelines NSF
90-146, Research Equipment Grant Program. Results are expected to provide
guidance for engineering design of alternative processes and systems to manage
solid wastes to placement in landfills.
