The PI proposes to examine the ultimate causes of variability in the forceps of
S.apicedentatus by estimating the potential for a further evolutionary response
and clarifying evolutionary constraints on the evolution of earwig. This will be
accomplished by combining a partitioning and quantification of selection with a
quantitative genetic analyses of forceps morphology. Computerized image analysis
will be used to relate the morphological variability in forceps to success in
intra and intersexual interactions. This provides a measure of relative fitness.
Quantitative genetic analysis that estimate heritabilities and genetic
correlations will indicate potential genetic influences and constraints on
variability. The genetic analysis yields a measure of the potential for response
to selection. Combining the analysis of selection with the estimated response to
selection will provide a detailed description of the evolution of forceps in S.
apicedentatus. This, this study will provide a detailed analysis of the
evolution of a sexually dimorphic structure. In addition to this laboratory
study, the PI will continue to collect preliminary field observations on the use
of forceps by S. apicedentatus in the Sonoran desert of Arizona. Thus, the
laboratory observations can be compared to a more natural situation. In
addition, the field work will also generate preliminary data for future
comparative analyses of variability between populations and species, and
information useful in designing future field studies of other species of
earwigs.
