This applicant will study the genes in yeast that are involved in regulation of
entry of the cells into a stationary phase when placed under inhospitable
conditions. Some genes are expressed only when the cell enters the stationary
phase. Specifically, he plans to study those genes that control expression of
the stationary phase specific genes, and to determine whether there is a causal
relationship between expression of those genes and entry into stationary phase.
Plans call for the work to be conducted in the laboratory of Dr. Margaret
Werner-Washburne at the University of New Mexico.
