The purpose of this project is develop economic models for analyzing the design
of securities, considering the roles of market liquidity, security ratings,
credit enhancement, and the distribution of information across investor groups.
Among the questions to be addressed are: What is the role of security rating
agencies in mitigating the costs of illiquidity, and how is security design
affected by that role? Is there a useful role for rating agencies beyond the
traditional role of evaluating default risk? Do informational asymmetries and
other distinctions among investor groups cause clientele effects in security
design? The results of this project are intended to further our understanding of
how security market innovation and rating are affected by information held
asymmetrically among issuers, underwriters, broker-dealers, and groups of
investors. The project may also include results that in will assist security
issuers, underwriters and rating agencies in the efficient conduct of their
businesses. In addition, the research may also uncover welfare implications that
will be useful to decision- makers in formulating regulations regarding the use
of security ratings.
