This action provides continued funding for investigators at the University of
Illinois at Chicago to continue their research using facilities at Fermilab
(E672). They are studying high energy collisions in which pairs of muons are
produced in association with other particles. This experiment will help
elucidate the theory of the strong interactions quantum chromodynamics.
