The goal of the project is to find out the total protein composition of the
plant nucleus, and to see whether this composition changes in different plant
organs and cell types. To reach this goal, the PIs will combine their technical
expertise in the areas of high-speed fluorescence-activated flow sorting of
nuclei and high throughput analytical proteomics. The experiments will use flow
sorting to rapidly purify nuclei from homogenates prepared from plant tissues
and organs. These nuclei will be analyzed using high throughput proteomic
techniques, particularly mass spectrometry, to identify as many as possible of
the individual proteins contained within the nuclei. The project will develop
these procedures using two plant species, the dicot model Arabidopsis thaliana,
and the monocot crop Oryza sativa. These species were chosen since their
complete nuclear genome sequences are available. Further experiments will
examine nuclear protein composition within specific organs (roots, shoots,
leaves, flowers), and within specific cells of the root (epidermis, endodermis,
vascular system, meristem, and cortex). The SGER funding will be employed to
determine the technical feasibility of this experimental strategy.
