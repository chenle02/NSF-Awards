Fishes live in an aquatic medium that is rich in potential chemical cues.
Soluble chemical products from various parts of a fish's body are known to
trigger many forms of social and symbiotic behavior. Fish anesthetics that are
commonly used for laboratory procedures and to capture fish in the field have
long been rumored to have a negative effect on fishes' sense of smell. Limited
research on one common anesthetic produced conflicting results. There have been
no studies of the effects of other commonly used anesthetics or of any chemical
at concentrations commonly used for field collections. Many fish behaviorists
could be using test subjects that are deprived of a significant portion of their
normal stimulus input. This study will provide an initial indication of the
effects of the four most common anesthetics at the strongest concentrations
normally used. The fright reaction of the goby, Asterropteryx semipunctatus,
will be used as a test system. This reaction can be released, with about equal
probability and intensity, by a chemical cue and a visual cue. Thus, fish that
show impaired responsiveness to chemical cues can be tested for responsiveness
to visual cues to distinguish any general effect on responsiveness from specific
impairment of the chemical senses.
