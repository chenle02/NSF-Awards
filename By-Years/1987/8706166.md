Heteroarm star polymers contain n arms, of which x arms are comprised of
monomer A while n-x arms are comprised of monomer B. These star-shaped polymers
are organic materials of entirely new chemical structure. Recent theoretical
work predicts they will exhibit unusual segregation and interphase phenomena.
Synthetic procedures will be developed for preparation of these new materials
with n = 3,4 with precisely defined architectures and for the attachment of
special functional groups at the free ends of the B arms. The consequences of
interarm interactions in isolated heteroarm stars will be assessed from the
rates and equilibrium for macrocyclization, as deduced from excimer emission by
molecules in which two arms bear pyrene at their free ends. Discrimination among
the various types of interarm interactions that can occur in semidilute
solution, melts, and in the solid state will be determined with heteroarm stars
selectively labelled for study of excimer emission or the rate of nonradiative
singlet-energy transfer. The dynamics of isolated heteroarm stars, as well as
their diffusion in concentrated solutions and melts, will be determined using
pulsed-gradient spin-echo nuclear magnetic resonance.
