This project seeks to build an algorithmic foundation&lt;br/&gt;for the analysis
of complex self-organizing systems.&lt;br/&gt;Computing theory has been
successful at&lt;br/&gt;pinning down the computational power of&lt;br/&gt;common
dynamical systems, but less so&lt;br/&gt;at analyzing their behavior and
functionality.&lt;br/&gt;Recent research points to the potential
benefits&lt;br/&gt;of viewing these systems as "natural
algorithms."&lt;br/&gt;The approach is premised on the belief that&lt;br/&gt;the
algorithm itself is at least as important&lt;br/&gt;as the data it generates and
that&lt;br/&gt;the current reliance on simulations and statistics&lt;br/&gt;must
be supplemented with analytical tools,&lt;br/&gt;something akin to an
``algorithms calculus.''&lt;br/&gt;The research will be oriented along the
following lines:&lt;br/&gt;new proof techniques and analytical
tools;&lt;br/&gt;communication-based algorithmic
renormalization;&lt;br/&gt;geometry, topology, and approximation of complex
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ambition of this project is to
lay&lt;br/&gt;the foundations of an algorithmic theory of&lt;br/&gt;complex
adaptive systems. Algorithm design&lt;br/&gt;has been one of the most
fruitful&lt;br/&gt;areas of computer science in the past few
decades.&lt;br/&gt;Building a bridge between this intellectual
discipline&lt;br/&gt;and the ever-growing area of complex
systems&lt;br/&gt;could potentially have a major impact on science as a
whole.&lt;br/&gt;Accordingly, the present project will
involve&lt;br/&gt;collaborations with computer scientists, control
theorists,&lt;br/&gt;physicists, and systems biologists.
