This project will develop a set of pedagogically sound microcomputer- based
laboratory experiments for beginning physics courses. In addition, it will
introduce computer interfacing and control into the advanced physics
laboratories. To achieve these objectives, Muskingum will purchase computers
with a laser printer, a microcomputer network for the beginning labs and
computer-interfaced measurement instruments for the advanced labs. The
microcomputers in the beginning labs will include interfaces that turn them into
fast, accurate, multipurpose lab instruments that beginning students can use
with ease. The interfaces for the advanced lab experiments will allow the
students to design and carry out computer-run experiments. For both beginning
and advanced labs, the laser printer will provide high quality graphic output
from which the students will extract data. This project will improve the physics
program by making the labs more up-to-date, more instructive and more
interesting for the students.
