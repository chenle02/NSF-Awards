When estimating or testing economic relationships, economists often discover
that the data they plan to use is not drawn randomly from the target population
for which they wish to draw an inference. Instead, the observations are found to
be sampled from a related but different distribution. If this feature is not
taken into account when doing statistical analysis, subsequent inference can be
seriously off the mark. This phenomenon is commonly called selection bias. An
important class of models in microeconometrics is characterized in terms of
conditional moment restrictions. Thhis develops a new efficient semiparametric
approach for conducting inference in models with conditional moment restrictions
when the target population is stratified.
