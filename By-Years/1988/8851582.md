The Physics Department will create a student laboratory which will introduce
undergraduates to fundamental concepts and current research techniques in the
field of modern optics. In the first half of the course students will build up a
basic working knowledge of the principles of lasers by constructing both a
pulsed dye laser and a continuous wave helium-neon laser cavity. In the second
half of the course students are given the opportunity to carry out detailed
experiments, concentrating on a specific area in modern optics. Initially three
topics, acousto-optic modulation, molecular spectroscopy, and holography/optical
information processing will be offered. Subsequently, additional topics such as
fiber optics and nonlinear crystal optics are to be developed.
