This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is aimed at
developing a micro optical switch array that implements the principle of
electro-wetting-on-dielectric, a liquid micro-actuation mechanism based on the
electrical control of surface tension on dielectric surfaces, for use in optical
telecommunications and optical computing. While MOEMS devices move solid micro-
mirrors, liquid actuation is attractive because of the compactness of the device
and absence of the stiction problem inherent in solid-solid surface contact.
Currently, a couple of companies use liquids for their optical devices. Compared
with their liquid-based optical MEMS under development, which use thermal energy
to move liquid, electrical control of surface tension (i.e., electro-wetting) is
especially promising because of its unprecedented energy efficiency (estimated
~10 W during switching with < 30 V) and reliability. Unlike other electro-
wetting principles the proposed electro-wetting-on-dielectric driving promises
high speed and long-term reliability, which are critical for commercial success.

The electro-wetting-on-dielectric micro optical switch arrays will find use
within any system requiring optical signal routing such as optical computers,
optical instrumentation, distributed sensors, and medical monitoring.
