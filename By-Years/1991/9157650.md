This research will focus on the development of a generic, scaleable parallel
computing tool for fluid dynamics. This tool will be a concrete demonstration of
a broader research approach to using scaleable parallel computers. This approach
is based on problem structure: defining scaleable, generic building blocks and
strategies for a specific application domain.
