9704949 Kusner This project deals with various geometric variational problems.
One focus of the project is geometric moduli problems, especially for complete
constant mean curvature surfaces and conformally flat constant scalar curvature
metrics. Tools from mechanics and symplectic geometry - and in the case of
surfaces, Teichmuller theoretic methods and representations involving spinors
and quaternionic forms - is to be used to understand the structure of these
moduli spaces. Geometric variational problems include a variety of problems
where finding extremal or optimal objects amongst families of objects all
satisfying certain boundary or initial conditions. For example, a minimal
surface spanning a given boundary minimizes the surface area amongst all
surfaces spanning the same boundary. Minimal surfaces, and more generally,
constant mean curvature surfaces, can be used to model certain condensed matter
- this is based on the observation that when two homogeneous media meet their
interface forms a constant mean curvature surface.
