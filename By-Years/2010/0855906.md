Planning Grant for an I/UCRC for Intelligent Storage

0855729 University of Minnesota; David Lilja 0855906 University of California-
Santa Cruz; Ethan Miller

The Center, comprised of the University of Minnesota (lead institution) and the
University of California-Santa Cruz, proposes to manage and preserve large
volumes of data and to be able to locate those data in an efficient manner. The
goals are to develop innovative storage systems and new storage architectures,
solve the long-term data preservation issues, develop efficient benchmarking,
tracing, performance management and tuning tools for I/O and input systems,
propose solutions that ensure data/information privacy and security, and to
explore ways to save energy in data center. The proposed Center will build on
the respective University's research talent and technology transfer skills to
attract industrial partners who will subsequently play a significant role in
planning, selecting, and implementing the output of the research.

The broader impact of the potential research outcomes includes fostering the
advancement of science and technology, making the society more efficient and
secure, providing better health-care delivery, and better ways of preserving
information. The industry participation will enhance the students' educational
experience by providing a pipeline for talented engineers and scientists to
industry. The proposed Center is committed to enhancing the education process by
bringing input from industry, developing new courses at both undergraduate and
graduate levels, and emphasizing the diversity of the student population. The
Center also has plans to recruit more female and under-represented minority
students and faculty into its research group.
