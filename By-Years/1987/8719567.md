Dynamic crack propagation in metals and ceramics will be studied in this
experimentally oriented research program. A new and versatile experimental
technique, which utilizes miniature strain gages, will be developed to evaluate
a fracture parameter, the J-integral. This strain gage technique together with
the established birefringent coating and caustics techniques will be used to
analyze rapid crack propagation in opaque materials. This study will identify
the material and structural parameters, which govern the run and arrest
phenomena of a crack, for designing crack arresters in safe fail structures. Dr.
Shukla will also continue his empirical modelling of crack curving and branching
using photoelasticity. He will initiate a new crack branching study of 4340
steel subjected to uniaxial and biaxial loadings. Such study should lead to a
better understanding of the material removal process in machining of metals and
the design of armor and antiarmor devices. Although young, Dr. Shukla has
already established himself as a competent and meticulous experimentalist in the
field of dynamic fracture.
