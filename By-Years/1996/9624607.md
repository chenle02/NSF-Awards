Dr. Wornat's proposed research on pyrolysis mechanisms and kinetics of
polycyclic aromatic compounds is aimed towards determining the pathways and
kinetics of reactions involved in the formation, transformation, and destruction
of polycyclic aromatic compounds (PAC) and soot from coal and other fuels.
Experiments will be conducted using a flow reactor with samples being withdrawn
at specific reaction times and analyzed using HPLC/UV. From measurements of
intermediates and products, reaction mechanisms will be developed and kinetic
parameters derived. Connections will be made to soot formation. This work is
distinct from the usual acetylene route used for soot formation from lower
hydrocarbons. The educational plan is innovative and includes several attractive
features including student research, guest lecturers and visits to power plants.
