(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spontaneous emission occurs when an
atom gives up its excess energy by releasing a particle of light, or photon.
However, if the atom is placed near a mirror, this process can be inhibited,
allowing the atom to keep its energy. The question is, if the atom does not emit
a photon, then how does it sense the presence of the mirror in the first place?
Quantum theory predicts that, even when the atom's emission is "inhibited,"
there is still a probability to find a photon between the atom and the mirror.
This prediction of quantum theory will be tested for the first time
experimentally, by quickly removing the mirror and timing the arrival of photons
at a nearby detector. The spontaneous emission will come not from a single atom,
but from a parametric downconverter, another optical device that undergoes
spontaneous emission. The experiment will provide the first direct evidence for
photons emitted under these conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More generally, the
techniques developed for this experiment may improve the stability of quantum
light sources, and allow the tailoring of their properties for special needs,
such as transmission through optical fiber or other optical elements. These
sources, in turn, may benefit society as elements of quantum computation or
quantum cryptography systems. In addition, this work will provide undergraduate
students with excellent training in research, giving them experience with
lasers, modern optics, electronics, and calculational methods. Undergraduates
working on this project will also confront foundational issues in quantum
mechanics concerning the nature of light, and see a real-world example of
quantum theory in action.
