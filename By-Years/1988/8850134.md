This Young Scholars project is designed to provide high ability and high
potential secondary students with the opportunity to learn about careers in
plant and soil sciences. Specific objectives are to (1) provide hands-on
experience in a research laboratory; (2) utilize research scientists as role
models for young scholars; (3) inform students about research methods and
ethical issues associated with research; and (4) provide information about
career planning, development and opportunities. Twenty young scholars between
their junior and senior years in high school will participate in the 6-week
summer program. Colorado State University faculty members and cooperating
scientists will deliver lectures, lead discussions, conduct field trips, and
provide students with research experience. Disciplines contributing to this
program include agronomy (crop and soil sciences), botany, genetics,
horticulture, range science, forestry, microbiology, plan pathology and
entomology.
