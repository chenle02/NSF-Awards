This award provides funds for the further refinement of interactive computer
software that simulates a variety of types of experiments in population biology.
By its nature, population biology deals with quantitative aspects of ecology,
evolution and behavior. Examples include the effects of predator/prey or
host/parasite relationships on the success (or extinction) of particular
species, rates of fixation of mutations within populations of defined size, and
others. Mathematical models in these branches of biology translate known or
assumed properties of individual members of populations into predictions about
the properties of the population as a whole. The mathematical manipulations
required are often tedious, difficult, or both. Thus math anxieties seriously
impede the study of more than the simplest basic principles of population
biology at the undergraduate level. The exemplary software being developed by
Alstad and his colleagues will make both simple and complex population models
far more accessible to students at all levels.
