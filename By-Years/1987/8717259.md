This investigator will conduct empirical and theoretical research on memory for
information about people and the construction of social categories. The first
set of studies surveys the functions that memory serves in everyday social life
and explores the contents and organization of peoples' memories for their
acquaintances and for public figures they "meet" through public media. Two
primary questions motivate the research plan: How does function determine memory
contents and structure? Do memories of emotion-provoking individuals differ from
those of neutral, non-evocative individuals? A second set of studies occurs in
controlled, laboratory "get acquainted" tasks and is designed to study the
effects of social goals on subjects" memories of other people they encounter in
laboratory interactions. The primary motivation underlying these studies is to
test the generality of results from previous laboratory person memory research
in social interactions with actual people. A third set of studies is concerned
with a separate topic, the creation of conjunction categories for novel social
groups (e.g., male nurses, female mechanics, etc.). The guiding question here
concerns the development of a theory to predict the manner in which two
"ingredient" categories will be combined to yield a new conjunction category.
The Principal Investigator is well known as a strong and productive scholar.
