This research program is for the study of global characteristics of currents in
the high latitude environments. The data collected from various satellites
(NASA, DoD and Swedish Viking) will be used in formulating models of the current
systems. Radar and ground-based data also will be used. These models will be
useful in the study of the effect of the interplanetary field on the global
electromagnetic environments.
