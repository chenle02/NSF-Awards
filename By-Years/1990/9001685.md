This project involves a study of recovery, reconstruction and mitigation
activities in Charleston, South Carolina in the aftermath of Hurricane Hugo. The
research will have three primary goals. First, to examine reconstruction
policies in relationship to their impact upon mitigation. Second, to analyze the
influence of hazard reduction activities in one area (seismic hazards) upon the
impact and recovery from a related, though different, hazard. Third, to study
the effect of place specific sense of community upon the reconstruction and
mitigation processes. Data sources will include interviews with officials, a
survey of households, and relevant documents and reports.
