The Katmai Scientific Drilling Project is a large multi- agency project (NSF,
DOE, USGS) which will be coordinated by the Interagency Coordinating Group (ICG)
for Scientific Drilling. The membership of ICG consists of the same three
agencies. The National Park Service has received notice that the ICG will submit
a proposal to drill at Katmai. While they are sympathetic to the aims of the
research, the Park Service wants to determine whether Katmai is uniquely suited
to the particular goals of the project. Accordingly, the Park Service has asked
that the ICG support an independent assessment of this aspect and suggested the
National Academy of Sciences as an appropriate organization for the study. In
response to the request from the Park Service, the NAS/NRC has established a
Panel on Volcanic Studies at Katmai, under the aegis of the U. S. Geodynamics
Committee. This is a request for NSF's share of the support for the Panel. The
total cost for the panel will be $34,700, so NSF's share is $11,566. This amount
will be transferred to the U. S. Geological Survey which is handling the grant
to the NAS/NRC.
