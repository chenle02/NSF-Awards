Diatoms are microscopic aquatic organisms that are collectively responsible for
approximately 20% of the photosynthetic activity on Earth. However, little is
known of the response of these important organisms to changes in their
environment. The primary goal of this project is to understand how these
organisms sense the environment and alter their physiology to optimize their
growth and productivity. This project will develop important novel tools that
are anticipated to be of broad value to the research field, and will elucidate
the mechanisms by which changes in the environment influence cell physiology. It
will provide research opportunities for undergraduates and advance public
science education.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project will elucidate how simple
environmental signals lead to rapid and reversible physiological responses in a
model marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum. The signal transduction pathways
that facilitate these responses are virtually unknown. The hypothesis will be
tested that retrograde signals emanating from the electron transport system in
the plastid are the primary means by which diatoms translate environmental
signals into nuclear gene expression, leading to reversible physiological
responses. Based on a bioinformatics analysis, a reverse genetics approach will
initially be used to target five genes hypothesized to represent major
components of the retrograde signal transduction system in diatoms. The project
will utilize a rapid and robust gene-editing approach based on CRISPR/Cas9
technology, combined with a technique based on self-processing ribozyme
sequences that flank the guide RNA to target the genes encoding the putative
signal transduction proteins.
