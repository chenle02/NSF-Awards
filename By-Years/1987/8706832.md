The biggest challenges facing robotics today are issues dealing with
uncertainty, processor faults and self-organization. The proposed research
embodies a novel yet realistic approach to visually guided control of multijoint
movement in uncertain environments. It is based on a new network control theory
that focuses on adaptive control principles, realized in parallel neural- like
networks. This new adaptive control theory allows a control system to adapt to
most sets of kinematics while it learns a "sense of space" by its own
experience. It uses both sensor and effector constraints to adapt to its
mechanical system over time and maintain its adaptation to unforseen changes in
the mechanics and sensor- actuator calibrations. The essence of this proposal is
involved in a representation of visual targets in terms of actuator signals used
to manipulate those targets. The proposed controller will learn precise sensory-
motor calibrations starting with only loosely defined relationships. It offers
fast parallel processing that can be generalized to any number of joints at any
resolution. The proposed research combines principles of neural organization
within the constraints of engineering reality.
