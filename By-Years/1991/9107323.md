Professors Kaplan and Cattani will investigate several questions concerning the
properties of flat holomorphic bundles carrying additional structures such as
polarized variation of Hodge structure or a Higgs field. They plan to study the
local monodromy of such bundles with applications to the fine structure of
modular varieties, the characterization of maximal variations of Hodge
structure, and the construction of harmonic metrics. This research lies at the
interface of algebraic and differential geometry. The objects under study are
algebraic varieties, essentially the zero sets of polynomials, but the methods
used to study these objects are analytic. This mix of algebraic and differential
geometry has been particularly successful in attacking problems which did not
yield to purely algebraic methods.
