Four research topics are pursued. The first is on inverse problems and
measurement error models. New adaptive wavelet denoising for 3-dimensional
objects will be studied and new non-Fourier deconvolution methods for
measurement error models will allow users to take into account non-homogeneous
errors that occur often in astronomical data. The second area is on biased
sampling. Nonparametric and semi-parametric methods will be studied for data
from multiple surveys and semi-parametric methods will be developed for survival
data. The third area is on high dimensional graphics and data mining. Efficient
methods and software will be developed for (large) data analysis and modeling.
The fourth area is on mixture problems. New tests and model selection procedures
are proposed.

The challenges for statistics arising from astronomy, genetics, medical imaging
and computer science are multifaceted. Data can be complex due to measurement
errors or other unobservable features; or large in size or dimension due to
advances in sciences and information technology; or small due to some intrinsic
nature of data, for example, halos, ancient stars, are scarce in comparison to
other stars. This project develops new theories, practical methods and efficient
computational tools to meet these challenges, via the above four major research
topics. The interdisciplinary nature of the research will impact our knowledge
in the sciences. The research will also benefit education and human development,
via training of students, integration with research and mentorship and
collaboration with scientists.
