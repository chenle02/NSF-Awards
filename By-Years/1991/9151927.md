A major goal of the Alma College Biochemistry Department is to provide well
equipped facilities to teach undergraduate students modem techniques in
biochemistry and molecular genetics. The goal of this project is to introduce
fluorescence spectroscopy into the undergraduate biochemistry laboratory as a
powerful analytical tool. The requested instrumentation provides rapid and
sensitive detection of molecular events allowing investigation into areas of
biochemistry that complement current methodology and instrumentation available
in the laboratory as well as reinforce the lecture portions of the courses
offered in the department. The introductory biochemistry, advanced biochemistry,
and molecular genetics courses offered by the biochemistry department will use
the fluorescence spectrophotometer and supporting equipment. We will study
protein-ligand interactions, enzyme kinetics, and protein denaturation kinetics;
to investigate properties of liposomes, living cells, and biological membranes;
to quantitate small amounts of nucleic acids; and to probe protein-nucleic acid
interactions. In addition to its role in the classroom experience, the
fluorescence spectrophotometer will also enhance student research opportunities
that Alma College provides its students. The instrumentation will significantly
enhance the biochemistry laboratory experience and will provide students with a
powerful technique that is underutilized in the undergraduate biochemistry
laboratory presently.
