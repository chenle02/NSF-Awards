In this project, the PI team will study the plastic flow behavior of materials
in the lower mantle of the Earth that occupies a large fraction of Earth between
the upper mantle and the core. Plastic deformation in this region is an
important mechanism of cooling of Earth and it also controls the way in which
materials are stirred or mixed. The experimental studies on plastic deformation
under the conditions of the lower mantle have been difficult due to the
difficulties in generating and measuring stress and strain under these
conditions. The team has made various modifications to the deformation apparatus
that was developed in their lab to conduct these deformation experiments. The
results will provide the first data set to understand the whole Earth thermal
and chemical history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rheological properties of the lower
mantle will be investigated using a rotational Drickamer apparatus developed in
in the PI's laboratory. This apparatus, after numerous modifications, now allows
his team to conduct large strain quantitative deformation experiments (to strain
~100-300%) under shallow lower mantle conditions (P to 28 GPa, T to 2200 K)
providing the quantitative results on rheological behavior under these
conditions. Not only the flow laws of each mineral, but also the microstructural
evolution will be studied to provide the mechanisms of deformation and the
nature of lattice-preferred orientation that can be used to interpret seismic
anisotropy.
