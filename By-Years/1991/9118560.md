This award supports a project designed to confirm that the East Antarctic ice
sheet has become thinner in the past 100,000 years. The project will measure the
exposure ages and erosion rates of Antarctic rocks from Southern Victoria Land
using in-situ produced Beryllium-10 and Aluminum-26, in collaboration with Drs.
Gunter Faure and Teresa Mensing at the Ohio State University. This new surface
exposure dating method is applicable to various geomorphological subjects and is
especially useful in Antarctica. Measurement of other in-situ produced
cosmogenic nuclides, particularly 14C and 21Ne, will be performed for selected
samples.
