This award provides funding to purchase seismic reflection data processing
software and an electrostatic plotter for the University of Arizona reflection
seismology program. The University of Arizona has recently acquired a dedicated
Convex C- 1 mini-supercomputer with state funds for the seismology program.
Reflection seismology research at Arizona is aimed at interpreting deep crustal
structure and requires processing of massive amounts of data as well as hard-
copy displays of interpretive models.
