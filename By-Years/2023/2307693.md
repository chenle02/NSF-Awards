In order for a galaxy to form new stars, the galaxy gathers more hydrogen gas.
This gas is thought to rain down onto the galaxy, and indeed, gas clouds of
different shapes and sizes are already found around the Milky Way galaxy.
Because we see a single snapshot in time, the fate of these gas clouds is not
actually known. This project will determine whether the hydrogen clouds grow as
they fall into the galaxy as star formation fuel, or if the clouds will be
scattered and destroyed as they fall. The investigators will compare computer
simulations of clouds moving towards a galaxy to new observations of clouds near
the Milky Way. Students will be trained how to conduct scientific research, and
the observations will be shared with the public.

The physical processes behind the destruction and growth of cool gas clouds in a
hot medium is a long standing astrophysical problem. An ideal testing ground for
recent theoretical advances is in our own Milky Way, in particular in the halo
of our Galaxy, where discrete clouds can be easily isolated, are largely
separate from the process of star formation, and are well observed. Detailed
comparisons will be made, in the observational plane, of new high-resolution
observations of halo clouds to high-fidelity magnetohydrodynamic simulations of
the cloud destruction and growth. To complete the comparison between the
simulations and observations, a library of simulated clouds with varying
physical conditions will be created, and a suite of observational data on clouds
with distance constraints will be prepared. The simulated clouds will be put
onto the observational plane to compare the spatial morphologies and velocity
structures. In addition to the research experiences for students, the project
will develop a science service learning course that will teach undergraduates
better methods for explaining scientific research to the local community.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
