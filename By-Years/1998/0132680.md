Daniel Nocera of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is supported by the
Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program to conduct
research on the development of photoinduced multi-electron oxidation-reduction
transformations. Dinuclear inorganic complexes in which the constituent metal
centers differ by two units of oxidation state will be prepared and
characterized. Photoinduced reactivity of these complexes will be studied.
Specific systems selected for study include the photochemical production of
dihydrogen from hydrohalic acids catalyzed by a newly discovered dirhenium
photocatalyst, and related materials to be synthesized. Stereoelectronic factors
that account for stabilization of two-equivalent mixed-valence complexes by
diphosphazanes will be investigated and insights thus gained will be applied to
design and synthesis of new two-unit mixed valence complexes.

The main thrust of the present proposal is on extending scientific understanding
of two-electron photochemical processes and two-equivalent mixed-valence
complexes, rather than on development of specific catalyic systems. However, the
work has high potential of leading to future useful technological applications,
such as design of energy-conversion photocycles, and activation of C-H bonds by
multielectron photoredox transformations.
