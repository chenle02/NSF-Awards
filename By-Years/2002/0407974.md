Dissertation Research: Adaptive functions of California Towhee (Pipilo
crissalis) duet song PI: Walter Koenig and Lauryn Benedict

The proposed research will examine California Towhee (Pipilo crissalis) duet
song as a tool for addressing the evolution of vocal communication between pairs
of socially monogamous birds. Previous studies of duetting have been few,
especially among temperate species, and have failed to arrive at a general
consensus regarding the functional significance of this complex trait. Discrete
reproductive costs and benefits of duet song will be specified to allow for
experimental tests of predictions and relevant hypotheses. Previous research
suggests that duetting in California Towhees occurs in a variety of contexts
such as territory defense, mate guarding, ensuring partner commitment, and
individual recognition. This study will provide an integrated, complete analysis
of vocal duet function by considering multiple potential benefits accrued to
individuals in pairs that duet and will be one of the first studies to
experimentally test multiple adaptive hypotheses for the function of duet song
in birds.
