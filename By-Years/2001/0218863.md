Self-Healing Polymers for Improved Fatigue Life

This collaborative GOALI project seeks to improve the fatigue life of
thermosetting polymers through the addition of self-healing functionality.
Thermosetting polymers are used in a wide variety of applications ranging from
composite structures to adhesive joints to microelectronic packaging. Because
these polymers have low strain-to-failure, they are highly susceptible to damage
in the form of cracking. Fatigue loading is particularly problematic, causing
small cracks to initiate deep within the structure where detection is difficult
and repair is virtually impossible. These cracks often lead to catastrophic
failure of the material. Self-healing functionality is accomplished by
incorporating a microencapsulated healing agent and a catalytic chemical trigger
within a polymer matrix. Fundamental research will be undertaken to address
critical issues relevant to self-healing of fatigue damage. The ability to
autonomically heal fatigue cracks in brittle polymers has the potential to lead
to safer, more reliable materials in microelectronics and related applications
and represents the first step in developing materials systems that possess
greatly extended lifetimes. This GOALI project will enable collaborative efforts
to explore this new technology for microelectronic applications. Results will
lead to fundamental scientific foundations on which new design and production
practices are based for improved fatigue performance. The proposed work will
result in the education and training for two graduate students and one
undergraduate research assistant. Moreover, several concepts from this project
will be incorporated into a new senior undergraduate/ first year graduate level
course entitled Autonomic Materials Systems.
