This awards supports the research of Professor I. Dolgachev to work in
algebraic geometry. Professor Dolgachev will study relations between invariants
and vector bundles. He also intends to study problems related to instantons and
moduli spaces of vector bundles. This research is in the field of algebraic
geometry, one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which blossomed
to the point where it has, in the past 10 years, solved problems that have stood
for centuries. Originally, it treated figures defined in the plane by the
simplest of equations, namely polynomials. Today, the field uses methods not
only from algebra, but also from analysis and topology, and conversely it is
extensively used in those fields. Moreover it has proved itself useful in fields
as diverse as physics, theoretical computer science, cryptography, coding theory
and robotics.
