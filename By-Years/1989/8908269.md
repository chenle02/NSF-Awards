The proposed work comprises several topics in the application of bargaining
theory to empirical studies of strikes and other disputes. The aim is further
development of bargaining models useful for econometric studies and for policy
analysis. Among these topics are: the effect of pre-strike negotiations on the
frequency of strikes; elaboration of the predictions of attrition, screening,
and signaling models of bargaining, as well as extensions to include cases with
reservation wages dependent on employment levels; explanatory mechanisms for the
procyclic incidence and settlement rates observed in strike data; and
development of bargaining models and specifications of unobserved heterogeneity
adapted to econometric estimation. Data from previous studies is used to
estimate a bargaining model. Subsidiary topics include application of bargaining
theory to legal provisions in general bargaining models, and several related
technical issues in the general formulation, analysis, and computation of game-
theoretic models. This project is extremely important because it provides new
insights into the nature of strikes and because it makes bargaining models more
useful for empirical research. The project links a large body of empirical
research based so far on simple models or data description to rigorous theories
of bargaining showing conditions under which strikes would occur. This will be
one of the first efforts to use rigorous theory to explain empirical
observations and the empirical observations to test the theories. Bargaining
theory is one of the major tools used by economic theorists to study a wide
range of economic phenomena, so the improvements this project will make in
bargaining theory will benefit a number of areas of economic research.
