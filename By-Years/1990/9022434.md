The 13C and 14C composition of dissolved inorganic carbon will be measured in
the equatorial Pacific Ocean during two U.S. JGOFS cruises in Spring and Fall
1992. The objective of the research is to estimate the rates of new production
in the equatorial pacific and determine the effects of CO2 gas exchange,
upwelling and biological production of surface ocean CO2 levels.
