This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a
wireless and batteryless RFID heart monitoring system based on phonocardiograph
MEMS technology. The system uses a disposable MEMS sensor in the form of
adhesive tags that receive power remotely through a remote radio
frequency&lt;br/&gt;source. In this proposed system, heart sound is obtained
through wireless communication with a personal computer (PC) node. With the PC,
heart sound is presented graphically, recorded or analyzed for further use. The
PC node can be part of a remote patient monitoring (RPM) system. The wireless
phonocardiograph offers some other advantages over other cardiograph systems: no
wire connections and no electrical contact point between the human body and the
sensor as compared with a multi-wire ECG, multi-channel monitoring of the
cardiovascular system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercialized product with
disposable tag-based sensors can replace the jungle of wiring and/or battery
powered heart monitoring devices currently in use by the millions worldwide.
This system with low cost and a highly versatile system platform will be
qualified first with non-clinical setting and later for extensive use within the
hospital itself.
