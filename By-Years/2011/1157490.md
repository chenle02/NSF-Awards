This award from the National Science Foundation to Florida State University
supports the operation of the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL)
for a five year period, 2013-2017. High magnetic fields are a critical tool to
the condensed matter physics and materials research communities and increasingly
to the chemistry, biology and biomedical communities. The Laboratory provides a
User Program for research using high-magnetic-fields at six unique facilities:
Steady-State (DC) Resistive Electromagnets, Pulsed Electromagnets, Ultra-Low
Temperature, Ion Cyclotron Resonance, Electron Magnetic Resonance, and the
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance/Magnetic Resonance Imaging User Facilities. The
Facilities are located at three geographically distributed campuses: Florida
State University, University of Florida and Los Alamos National Laboratory. Each
user program is built around unique magnetic-field capabilities supported by a
world-leading scientific expertise. Access to the User Programs is provided on a
competitive basis to the most meritorious proposals submitted from an
interdisciplinary scientific community spanning materials science, condensed
matter physics, magnet technology, chemistry, and biology.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NHMFL's nationally recognized education and public
outreach programs will utilize the laboratory's scientists, infrastructure, and
website to target K-12 students, undergraduates and teachers (via the Research
Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) and Teachers (RET) programs), and to expand
research and mentorship programs for female and minority graduate students and
early career scientists that are tailored to advance each individual's career
goals. The Laboratory has an updated diversity plan which is designed to play a
leadership role in broadening participation.
