The objective of this research is to limit a systematic study of the tradeoff
between structural simplicity and expected performance in combinatorial
algorithms. In this research, the attention is restricted to some fundamental
algorithmic problems on words (or strings). One goal is that of testing to what
extent simpler and more direct algorithms can be expected in practice to match
performance of more complicated, asymptotically faster ones. (In general,
straightforward algorithms are not only more easily designed, but also more
easily encoded, debugged, documented, upgraded etc.) Another goal is that of
discovering entirely new algorithms on words that would represent good
compromises in terms of structural complexity, expected performance and worst-
case performance. A third goal is that of identifying novel cost measures for at
least some classes of algorithms, possibly along with new analysis-design
methodologies.
