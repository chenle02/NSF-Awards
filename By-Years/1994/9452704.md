9452704 Watford Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University seeks to
initiate a 4 week, residential Young scholars project for 30 students entering
the 12th grade. The Manufacturing Engineering Program for Young Scholars will
introduce young scientists and engineers to manufacturing systems design and
control. Topics include Computer-Aided Design, Manufacturing Processes/Computer-
Aided Manufacturing, Robotics, Statistics and Quality Control and System
Simulation. Lectures, laboratory exercises and trips to industrial facilities
will introduce manufacturing methodologies using hands-on techniques and
emphasize the importance of basic scientific, mathematical, and engineering
concepts in the development/operation of manufacturing systems, Project
assignments will include both designing and prototyping of manufactured parts
and the analysis and control of manufacturing systems. Completion of the project
work will involve the participation in project management tasks and in oral
presentations. Videotaped presentations will be part of the follow-up component.
