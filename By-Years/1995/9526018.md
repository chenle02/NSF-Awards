ABSTRACT CMS9526018 "Application of MDO to Infrastructure Planning on the
Wasatch Front" PI: Balling, R., Brigham Young University The "Wasatch Front" is
a metropolitan area of rapid growth in Utah, with about 1.5 million people in 70
cities along a narrow corridor about 80 miles long and 5 to 15 miles wide. The
coupled problems of growth management and infrastructure renewal for this area
are complicated. This research will address transfer of Multidisciplinary Design
Optimization (MDO) technology to the planning and design problems associated
with infrastructure renewal and growth management. The MDO approach will give
individual agencies as much freedom as possible in making planning/design
decisions while maintaining coordination between disciplines so that the overall
system can be optimized. MDO tools consist of optimization and search
algorithms, support for sensitivity analysis, approximate analysis models,
robust design support, and other decision support tools. The research will be
accomplished in a collaborative relationship among faculty from BYU, several
departments in the Utah State Government, the Wasatch Front Regional Council,
and the Mountainlands Association of Governments. The project will develop and
generalize the MDO methodology, including development of a prototype application
on a subsystem of the "Wasatch Front", and then continue with development of a
detailed implementable plan for application of MDO to the larger regional
system.
