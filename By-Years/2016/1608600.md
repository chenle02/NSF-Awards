Three-manifolds are spaces closely related to the universe we live in. To
develop a better understanding of such spaces one calls upon methods from
several research areas, such as geometric topology, algebra, number theory, and
theoretical physics. An invariant of a manifold is an associated object that
depends only on the manifold type, and carries useful information. This NSF
funded project addresses several important, unsolved problems related to
classification of three-manifolds and realization of number-theoretic manifold
invariants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bi-Lipschitz geometry is a natural framework
for the geometric study of universal covers of compact manifolds, where it
connects geometric topology with geometric group theory. It is also the natural
framework for the study of the local geometry of algebraic sets. In both
situations, three-dimensional manifolds play an important role. One aim of the
project is to complete the quasi-isometric classification of 3-manifold groups,
a project on which a large number of researchers have been working for two
decades, and on which the PI and Behrstock made very significant progress over
the last several years. Another is to apply Lipschitz geometry of complex
singularities to significant open questions, such as the geometric meaning of
Zariski equisingularity in higher dimensions (the PI and Anne Pichon recently
resolved the 2-dimensional case), the Zariski multiplicity conjecture,
classification of complex map germs and more. At the other end of the spectrum,
for hyperbolic manifolds there are also postulated connections between
geometric, arithmetic, representation-theoretic and quantum based invariants of
manifolds, on which the PI and his students have made progress, and which is
continuing.
