This project will synthesize knowledge about the reproductive biology of
tropical forest trees. The synthesis will incorporate recent ideas and data,
update previous findings, and review the impact of contemporary global
environmental changes such as land use change, the spread of invasive species,
and climate change. This review will help define future trends in reproduction
and regeneration in tropical forests, and assess the effects of these trends for
sustaining tropical biodiversity.

The results of this synthesis will be of interest to a wide range of biologists,
and foster new research on reproduction and regeneration of plants in tropical
forests. The work on the effects of global environmental change on the
reproduction and population biology of forest trees, and the possibilities for
mitigating these effects, will help conservation biologists, resource managers,
and policy makers. It will offer opportunities for graduate students to
participate in the synthesis of concepts and data, meta-analyses, and the
linking of fundamental research with issues of human use of natural resources,
land management, and conservation.
