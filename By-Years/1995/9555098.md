This project will produce real images of chemical and physical changes occurring
at the microscopic and atomic levels. These images, from different instruments
(optical, electron, and scanning probe microscopes), will be captured
electronically (video tapes and CD ROMs) and used in conjunction with molecular
modeling as instructional aids in introductory chemistry courses. The objective
is to introduce students to the relationships between macroscopic changes in
materials and the corresponding changes in the arrangements of their atoms and
molecules. The graphic images will be combined with interactive benchtop
demonstrations and computer animation's to produce dynamic visual instructional
components (dynamic visualization modules, DVMs) for introductory chemistry
courses. The existing instrumentation and modeling facilities required for the
project are currently in place. Once developed the DVMs will be tested with
approximately 4000 general chemistry students at Arizona State University and
the Maricopa Community College system. Lack of funding eliminated proposed
faculty workshops and the participation of Phoenix area high schools. There is a
goal of national dissemination by a commercial publisher once the DVMs have been
tested in the local environment.
