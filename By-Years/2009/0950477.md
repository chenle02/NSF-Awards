This Cooperative Agreement creates a community-driven facility that consolidates
a number of essential cyberinfrastructure activities in the solid-earth
geosciences at the Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University. It
includes data repositories; author attribution schema; data management,
discovery, and visualization tools; web portals and services; and the
development and implementation of a sample unique-identifier registration system
and database interoperability and metadata standards. The project also includes
the creation of geoscience education and outreach modules and workshops. Goals
of the facility are to serve the data management and discovery needs of the
geoscience community and to provide direct public accessibility to NSF-funded
data sets and associated data products. To achieve these goals, the collected
activities are overseen by an external advisory structure of users and domain
scientists in the geoinformatics, geophysics, igneous petrology, geochemistry,
sedimentology, hydrothermal vent fluid, and polar geoscience communities and who
work in concert with NSF to best serve community needs and monitor project
performance. The broader impacts of the resulting facility and its activities
are broad and far-reaching in terms of building infrastructure for science and
education in the solid-earth geosciences. The resulting infrastructure and
unified data submission procedures and standards will significantly advance the
field of geoinformatics and provide essential tools for discovering data and
combining disparate datasets such that more complex scientific problems can be
tackled by providing a means to efficiently collect and view and model multiple
datasets. It also provides an important educational tool for students by
allowing them to explore large amounts of data in creative ways.
