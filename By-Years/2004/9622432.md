*** 9622432 Mote This research project investigates its effects of shear and
internal forces resulting from handling and transport of web material at high
speeds. The wrinkling instability and the flutter of webs transported in air or
other fluids are the common, and often the principal, limitations to
productivity in web systems. Current research provides the deflection and the
state of membrane stress required for study of web stability and wrinkling.
Nonlinear modeling of the translating web and a singular perturbation modeling
of the flexural stiffness is used to deduce the relationship between the
critical boundary shear, the web stiffness, and the transport speed under
various wrinkling conditions. Singular perturbation techniques are used to treat
the small, finite flexural stiffness. The maximization of transport speed is
pursued through the flutter and wrinkling analyses of webs translating close to
a surface that is designed to avoid instabilities.***
