9220638 Zahn The proposed research is the continued study of high voltage
insulation, conduction and breakdown characteristics in liquid, gaseous and
solid dielectrics. Insulating dielectrics used in power apparatus, such as
transformers and cables, and in the pulse power technology, such as Marx
generators and pulse forming lines, have their performance affected by injected
space charge and by surface charge accumulation on insulating surfaces. This
charge distorts the electric field distribution and introduces the charge
migration time between electrodes as an additional time constant over the usual
dielectric relaxation and fluid transport times. Charge injection from high
voltage stressed electrodes are measured by Kerr electro-optic field and charge
mapping measurements, voltage-current terminal measurements, and electrical
breakdown tests. The magnitude and polarity of injected charge and the
electrical breakdown strength deped strongly on electrode material combinations
and voltage polarity. The research tries to understand conduction, aging,
degradation, and breakdown mechanisms in high field stressed gaseous, liquid,
and solid dielectris using new modern optical, electronic, and computer
instrumentation to give us eyes to see charge transport effects inside materials
that could not be seen before. These measurements are improved by also using
newly developed sensors to continuously monitor liquid and solid conductivity,
permittivity, moisture, and volume charge densities so that necessary parameter
values are known to allow comparison between theory and experiment. Charge
transport theory will also be used to analyze published experimental results of
others of space charge distributions measured with electro-acousitc methods. ***
