The research entails investigating the conformal transformations of self-dual
metrics and affine structures on quaternionic manifolds. The methods entail
those relating to self-dual connections on vector bundles over 4-manifolds and
the associated complex manifold or twistor space. The underlying concepts are
extendable to higher dimensions via the quaternionic setting. This research has
a number of ramifications to general relativity theory, quantum gravity and
other areas of mathematical physics.
