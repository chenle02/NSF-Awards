*** 9661472 Cooper This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project will
prototype InterCam, a system for providing interactive, telerobotically-
controlled, live video on the world-wide web. The InterCam system will be based
on an operational research system developed earlier bar the project principles.
To establish commercial viability, it must be determined whether the system can
be developed on a cost-effective hardware/software infrastructure, as well as
important additional functionality. A new system on an Intel/Windows NT platform
will be developed. Also to be done will be re-engineering of the timesharing
functionality at the heart of the software as a multithreaded distributed
operating system, exploiting the multiprocessing functionality, and platform
transparency of Java, new shareable control methods. and exploring the
plausibility of incorporating basic computer vision capabilities into the
system. It is hard to overstate the potential impact of this technology. Many
different concrete application areas have been identified such as:
teleconferencing ("look where you want to look"), security, remote process
monitoring accessible from anywhere, affordably, Internet publishing, and
product and real-estate marketing (the virtual ahowroom or open-house) ***
