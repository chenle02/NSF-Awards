The Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry program will provide a
grant to Dr. Milton R. Smith of Michigan State University to explore the
reactivity of boron containing reagents with transition metal complexes. He will
study the reactivity of metal-olefin complexes with borane reagents emphasizing
selective transformations relevant to hydroboration chemistry. He will develop
synthetic routes to, and fundamental reaction chemistry of, single and double
bonds between boron and early transition metals. He will also explore the
oxidative and metathetical reactivity of boron-boron bonds with transition metal
complexes. He proposes experiments to induce catalytic conversion of olefins to
vinyl boranes, to define the mechanisms of these reactions, to prepare compounds
with metal-boron double bonds, and to investigate the involvement of B-B bonds
in redox and metathetical reactions. The principal relevance of this work is
tied to metal-catalyzed hydroboration of alkenes in organic chemistry. The
addition of borane reagents to unsaturated organic molecules is an extremely
versatile reaction, particularly because the conversion of borane groups to
various functional groups generally proceeds with retention of the
stereochemistry at the carbon. This project pushes the frontier of hydroboration
chemistry. It is expected to uncover relevant mechanism information which will
aid in the discovery of new catalysts with new and different properties. The
discovery of a boron metal double bond would be a major achievement in this area
and could have far reaching implications.
