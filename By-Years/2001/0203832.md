This project addresses local vibrational mode (LVM) spectroscopy of
semiconductors such as GaN, ZnO, Si, and CdTe in order to determine the
structure of defect centers and their vibrational interactions with the host
environment. Impurities such as hydrogen, oxygen, and DX centers will be studied
in these technologically important materials. Hydrostatic pressure will be used,
with infrared (IR) and Raman spectroscopy, to probe the LVMs arising from such
impurities. In addition to inorganic semiconductors, organic semiconductors such
as pentacene will also be investigated. Time-resolved experiments using
ultrafast IR spectroscopy will be used to probe vibrational lifetimes and
resonant interactions in semiconductors.

The project addresses fundamental research issues in a topical area of
electronic/photonic materials science having high technological relevance. An
important feature of the project is the strong emphasis on education, and the
integration of research and education. The proposed educational activities will
benefit a range of students from the eighth grade to graduate school.
Educational programs integrated with research include outreach activities with a
public school on the Colville Indian reservation, improvements to undergraduate
physics courses, and the development of laboratories and lecture demonstrations.
These activities are pursued to encourage students from diverse backgrounds to
enter fields related to materials science and solid-state physics.
