9529807 Evans Title: Collaborative research: physical properties of partially
molten feldspathic rocks in the ocean crust The strength and deformation of the
ocean crust depends primarily on the strength of the lower crust (oceanic layer
3) which is composed of gabbros. The strength of these rocks have not been
investigated in detail and this project is designed to determine how the crust
deforms when it is under pressure and when it is partially molten. These results
may explain why some mid-ocean ridges have large axial valleys while others do
not. The presence of melt also affects the velocity of seismic waves and the
viscosity of gabbro depends on the amount of melt present and how it is
distributed in the rock. This study is designed to make these measurements so
that we can model the deformation of the ocean crust and the velocity of seismic
waves.
