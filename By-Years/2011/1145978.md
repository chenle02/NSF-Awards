Species are delineated on the basis of their shared evolutionary histories, but
whenever they have been examined in detail, they show variation across their
ranges. If this variation represents fine-scale adaptation to local conditions,
adaptation at the overall species level may be hindered. The project entails
examining this issue by characterizing the evolutionary patterns in snake venoms
across and within species. Snake venoms are ideal for studying adaptation
because of their evolutionarily significant roles in feeding and defense and
their potential for specialization for local prey species. The venoms of 10
species of snake native to the United States will be completely characterized by
cutting-edge molecular techniques for study of species-level adaptive evolution,
and venom variation within three of these species will be quantified for study
of fine-scale adaptation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will provide an
unprecedented characterization of snake venoms and their geographic variation
for some of the most medically significant species native to the United States,
contributing to our understanding of adaptive evolution. Snakebites cause an
estimated 125,000 deaths per year worldwide, and the development and improvement
of treatments for them will benefit from this detailed molecular
characterization of venom composition. Because of the targets of snake-venom
toxins and their shared ancestry with proteins involved in basic biological
processes and human disease, the results of the project could strongly influence
drug design and treatment for pain, inflammation, arthritis, cancer, heart
attacks, and strokes.
