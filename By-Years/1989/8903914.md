This award provides 51% of the funding required for the acquisition of
computing hardware and software to upgrade the geophysical computing facility in
the Department of Geological Sciences at the University of Southern California.
The University is committed to providing the remaining 49% of the funding. The
improved computing facility will be used for computationally-intensive research
projects that include: investigation of earthquake source properties, near-field
effects and site responses for large earthquakes; spatial and temporal
variations of coda-Q in relation to earthquake processes; depiction of the
crustal structure and evolution of the southwestern U.S. using multichannel
seismic reflection profiles; study of friction and fracture instabilities in
fault zones; and a damage mechanics approach to the source mechanism of
underground nuclear explosions.
