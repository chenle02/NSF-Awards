This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in the general
area of chemical synthesis in the subfield of materials chemistry. Zinc selenide
(ZnSe) has important potential applications as a material for visible light
emitting devices and short wavelength lasers for display applications.
Metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) of ZnSe is the most promising
production method but is hampered by its use of hydrogen selenide, an extremely
hazardous and toxic gas. Hydrogen selenide also has significant disadvantages
because it undergoes room temperature gas phase reaction with dialkylzinc
reagents leading to poor growth uniformity and morphology. Initial attempts to
replace hydrogen selenide with organoselenium source reagents have met with
limited success due to high growth temperatures and carbon contamination of the
deposited films. This Phase I program will investigate novel organoselenium
reagents based on rational molecular design and understanding of decomposition
mechanisms. Subsequent research will allow for the scale-up and purification of
the optimal reagent for the production of ZnSe.
