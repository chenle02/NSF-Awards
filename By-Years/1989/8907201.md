This project will fund a working conference of scholars on American Indian
population history to be held in 1992, the 500th anniversary of the introduction
of European culture to this hemisphere. The conference will assess the state of
knowledge on disruption, and the subsequent impacts of European development upon
Indian communities. The conference will bring together 15 experts from the
disciplines of anthropology, demography, history epidemiology and sociology to
assess our current state of knowledge and plan future research. This conference
is timely because the 500th anniversary of the conquest of the hemisphere by
Europeans is an appropriate time to assess our knowledge and plan future
research. Understanding demographic history is important to help us understand
how populations react to stresses, so that we can deal with problems raised by
current changes.
