This project will continue the development and deployment of UpTempO buoys in
the Arctic Ocean. UpTempO buoys float at the ocean surface, equipped with (i) a
sea level pressure sensor, (ii) a 60 m long string of 12 thermistors, and (iii)
two ocean pressure sensors at 20 m and 60 m depth. In this next phase of the
project, the research team will improve the buoy by adding a high precision
conductivity/temperature pair near the surface on some buoys, which will provide
calibration data as well as the first-ever Lagrangian near-surface salinity data
in the rapidly freshening Arctic Ocean. They will also make several technical
improvements, including the use of inductive modem technology which provides for
a more flexible architecture. Two ?short? buoys will be built per year, for
deployment in the Chukchi Sea. Data are recorded hourly, uploaded in near real
time to the Iridium satellite communications network and then downloaded to the
Global Telecommunications System (GTS) and to the investigators' local web site
which is linked to national data centers. Buoy deployment uses existing assets
such ship cruises planned as part of other projects. This project addresses
several major targeted questions such as, ?What is the impact of warming and
reduced sea ice cover on the physical marine system?? And ?Is the sea ice/ocean
system undergoing an ?unprecedented transition into a different regime??,
observing priorities such as to ?observe the energy balance of the atmospheric
and oceanic boundary layers?, and high-priority regions (e.g, the Beaufort and
Chukchi Seas) identified in the ?Observing Ocean and Sea Ice? 2005 SEARCH
Implementation Workshop. The team will plan a major new exhibit about polar
buoys to be shown at (i) the annual Polar Science Weekend at Seattle?s Pacific
Science Center and (ii) a new Portal to Current Research season-long exhibit to
be developed as part of this project, in collaboration with the PacSciCenter.
