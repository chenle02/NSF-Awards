This project will produce a systematic revision, clarifying relationships of the
members of the family Cryptophagidae, a group of beetles with many members that
are fungus feeders. Character traits of adult morphology will be investigated in
this analysis and computer assisted methods of examining data will be used.
Interesting patterns of shifts between fungus feeding and plant feeding and loss
of flight capabilities among different species will be explored.
