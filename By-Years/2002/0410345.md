This is a US-Polish workshop on geometric methods in dynamical systems that will
be held at the University of Delaware. The organizers of the workshop are Dr.
Judy Kennedy of the University of Delaware and Professor Roman Srzednicki from
the Jagiellonian University in Krakow, Poland. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
workshop has both theoretical and practical applications. It will address the
theory of nonlinear dynamical systems as well as computational techniques for
investigating real dynamical systems. The group of mathematicians involved in
this workshop share a common interest in geometric and topological methods used
to study dynamical systems. While there has been a fairly long history of
collaboration between the two groups, this workshop will encourage more
collaboration and will help sustain ongoing collaboration. It should also
alleviate instances of duplication of results among members of the
group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop in mathematical sciences fulfills the
program objectives of bringing together leading experts in the U.S. and
Central/Eastern Europe to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in
areas of strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of equality,
reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.
