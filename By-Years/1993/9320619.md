Proposal: 9320619 ABSTRACT Date: 10/27/93 PI: Garcia-Garabay U. Cal. Los Angeles
A systematic investigation of the chemistry of phenyl-alkyl carbene derivatives
in organic molecular crystals will be made. Carbenes will be generated in the
solid state both thermally and photochemically by the extrusion of molecular
nitrogen from phenyl alkyl diazo compounds. The study will include pure
crystalline solids and mixed molecular crystals, and will combine techniques
from photochemistry, solid state chemistry, and material science. Product
studies and rates of reactions will be followed as a function of crystal and
molecular structures, which will be determined by X-ray crystallographic
analyses. Correlations will be sought for crystal and molecular structural
features with product selectivity and specificity. Bulk magnetic properties will
be measured to determine if ordered spin- spin interactions occur, which would
lead to ferromagnetic behavior. This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program
supports the work of Professor Miguel Garcia-Garabay at the University of
California, Los Angeles. Carbenes, which are divalent species rather than the
usual tetravalent carbon molecules, will be studied in the solid state. Various
carbenes will be produced both thermally and by light irradiation by the
extrusion of molecular nitrogen from precursor molecules. Crystal structures of
these precursor molecules will be determined by X-ray crystallographic analysis
and the products and rates of these reactions will be correlated with the
crystal and molecular structure. These studies will provide insight to carbene
chemistry and solid state chemistry.
