Everyone worries to some degree. Someone with financial problems may worry about
paying the rent, keeping a roof over their head. Worry is closely linked to fear
and anxiety as it anticipates potentially negative events. Although everyone
worries, not everyone worries to the same degree. Worrying too much causes
irritability and fatigue, interferes with concentration, and impairs performance
of normal daily tasks. Worry can also affect memory. A sad person is more likely
to remember previously sad events, thus negative feelings can be self-
amplifying. &lt;br/&gt;Dr. David Tucker and Matt Brown, M.A. will explore such
phenomena with support from the National Science Foundation. The project will
focus on identifying how worry and mood affect memory for related and unrelated
experiences. Broader impacts include results that may enhance treatments for
anxiety and mood disorders and early identification of individuals at high risk
for developing anxiety or mood disorders, aiding in the development of potential
prevention or early intervention strategies. This project will take place in the
context of Mr. Brown's dissertation studies and will provide educational
opportunities for students who participate in conducting research&lt;br/&gt;
