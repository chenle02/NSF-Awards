The Department of Earth Sciences is making scanning electron microscopy an
integral part of the undergraduate science education in all laboratory science
departments at Pacific Lutheran University. The Department has purchased a JEOL
Model JSM-T330A Scanning Electron Microscope equipped with a KEVEX Delta Class
Series II Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectrometer (EDS) for element analysis and a
Backscattered Electron Detector to sharpen images. This instrument is being by
four departments: Earth Sciences, Chemistry, Biology, and Physics/Engineering.
It is used for classroom and laboratory demonstration in lower division
Oceanography and biology classes, and is an integral part of upper division
classes and laboratories. Undergraduate students and faculty in upper division
classes are using the equipment to examine fossils, surface textures and growth
of mineral grains, authigenic mineral formation and alteration, biochemistry and
chemical analysis (including polymers and biopolymers), cell biology, histology,
developmental biology, and physical and thermal material stress analysis.
Student and faculty independent research projects are also greatly enhanced with
the availability of an SEM.
