In this project in the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor Francois N.
Diederich will investigate "Cyclophanes to Study Principles of Molecular
Recognition in Aqueous Solutions" in the Chemistry Department at the University
of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Molecular recognition is the study of
designed polymolecular entities and assemblies formed between two or more
chemical species and held together by intermolecular forces, the noncovalent
bond. This fascinating and dynamic research area is recognized worldwide as an
important intellectual and technological frontier in chemistry. These studies
will lead to guidelines for the design of new hosts and to new insight into the
workings of biological molecules. This information is especially valuable for
those scientists interested in designing new receptors to selectively remove
toxic molecules from waste waters or bodily fluids in humans. This study
involves a comprehensive synthetic, physical organic, and computational approach
to explain apolar complexation in aqueous solutions. The role of water will be
defined in comparative investigations in aqueous and organic solutions. For
these studies, a unique series of cyclophane receptors with apolar binding
cavities is already available, and others will be prepared to reach specific
objectives. Titration microcalorimetry is being used for accurate determination
of the complete set of thermodynamic quantities for apolar complexation
processes in aqueous and organic solutions. Hydrogen-deuterium isotope, salt,
and buffer effects on apolar association are also being studied.
