This research will analyze recordings that were made by chance from an IRIS
network installed in the northern Caucasus which recorded the ApÄ±ril 29, 1991
Ms=7.2 Ossetian earthquake in the Soviet Union. Seven of the stations were
transferred to the aftershock area by May 15 and recorded more than 500 events.
This is a rare opportunity to study an intercontinental earthquake that is
related to the continent-continent collision of the Arabian and Eurasian plates.
This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction
Program.
