Center for Lasers and Plasmas for Advanced
Manufacturing&lt;br/&gt;IIP-0823780&lt;br/&gt;University of
Virginia&lt;br/&gt;Gupta&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a proposal to renew the
University of Virginia's participation in the Lasers and Plasmas center, an
I/UCRC center that was created in 2002. The center was initially established as
a single university center and currently has grown to a multi-university center
with participation from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor and Southern
Methodist University. The primary focus of the center's research is in laser
applications for advanced manufacturing. Some of the center's research
activities have included laser removal of oxides, laser micro-machining of
titanium, laser microtexturing, optical sensor for laser welding, micromachining
of aluminum alloys and carbon nanocomposites. The future center research will
focus on applications of high power diode and fiber lasers for various materials
processing needs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Laser processing techniques are expected
to increase well beyond the applications of today as research provides improved
development of this important process. The integrated effort of multi-university
center for laser applications provides a great benefit to the society in terms
of helping US industries to be more competitive in advanced manufacturing. The
center will provide education and training to prepare students to meet future
workforce needs. The center will provide a unique experience to graduate
students who will interact and collaborate with industrial researchers and
engineers. The center will continue to involve undergraduate students through
REUs.
