The producer, or intermediate business, services sector has been one of the
most dynamic in terms of job growth over the past twenty years, and this trend
is expected to continue into the foreseeable future. At a national level,
previous research has provided insights into aggregate spatial patterns of
employment change in the producer services, but work at the level of individual
establishments has been lacking. Little information exists on how producer
services firms have developed in this period of rapid overall growth. Current
theoretical models of firm dynamics derive from research on manufacturing
sectors of the economy; there is a paucity of research to indicate whether the
producer services behave differently or the same as industrial firms. This
project will test a number of theoretical hypotheses put forward to explain the
growth of these services through survey research on a geographically and
industrially differentiated sample of establishments. It will attempt to clarify
the relative importance of externalization processes and the changing division
of labor within firms, document changes in technology in the mode of provision
of services, examine the role of information technologies, analyze the nature of
flexible production systems, and explain changes in the locations where services
are sold. Most research on spatial aspects of the restructuring of the US
economy have concentrated on industrial sectors. This investigation would
provide badly needed tests of current theoretical arguments regarding the bases
of development of producer services. It would provide basic knowledge of
development processes at the level of the firm, and it would contribute to
formulation of necessary location theory related to services industries. The
results of this project would also inform public policy regarding the
feasibility of services as substitutes for contracting resource-based industry
in smaller and peripheral locations.
