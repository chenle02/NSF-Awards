The Principle Investigator will develop techniques for acquiring high resolution
Doppler radial velocity measurements using a fixed-delay interferometer. The
proposed instrument can provide Doppler resolution limited only by intrinsic
stellar line widths, and independent of the spectral dispersion of the post-
disperser used for separating fringes in different wavelengths. The technique
will be used for detection and characterization of extra-solar planetary systems
around solar-type stars. The PI will explore the feasibility of using this
technique for multi-object radial velocity observation and planet detection
around B, A, early F, and late M type stars. The technique and instrumentation
can be adapted to a wide variety of telescopes. Eventually, this technique could
be used in a full sky survey for planets around hundreds of thousands of stars.
The detection and study of extra-solar planets has broad impact to the
astronomical community and has a proven appeal to the public at large.
