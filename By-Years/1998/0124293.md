This project will develop a prioritized research agenda for studies of the
effects of climate change and variability on estuarine systems. Although there
is a general understanding of the physical effects of such changes, the
consequences to the biodiversity and functioning of these ecosystems-or their
biocomplexity-are poorly understood. The investigators are particularly
interested in the mechanisms by which estuarine and coastal biocomplexity allows
ecosystems to adapt to climate forcing in the context of human population
impacts. Drs. Boesch and Giblin plan a community town meeting at the biennial
conference of the Estuarine Research Federation, and a focused workshop
involving estuarine, social and climate scientists. The objective of these
meetings is to facilitate idea sharing and team building among climate change
scientists, social scientists and scientists working in traditional estuarine
disciplines. This project is expected to accelerate the involvement of the
estuarine science community in addressing the complex and critically important
questions of climate change effects in the fragile coastal zone.
