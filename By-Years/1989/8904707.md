This research seeks to determine the parameters of the stress cycle of
earthquakes along the Central American subduction zone. The work will integrate
observed temporal and spatial seismicity patterns with theoretical models of
plate subduction. The models will be constrained with bathymetric, seismicity,
and fault mechanism data from local and global seismographs. The relative
influences of geometry and coupling on observed seismicity will be evaluated via
comparisons of the relatively simple regime of the Middle America Trench
offshore Mexico with the more complex regions offshore Central America and
Chile. This research has as its main goal the definition of the earthquake cycle
in anticipation of utilizing the resultant model for prediction of earthquakes
at subduction zones. It is therefore directly applicable to the National
Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
