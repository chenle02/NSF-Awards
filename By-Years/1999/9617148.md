9617148 Roberts This award provides funds to partially support the five day
workshop, "Statistical Physics Methods in Discrete Probability, Combinatorics,
and Theoretical Computer Science" to be held March 23-27, 1997 at the Institute
for Advanced Study in Princeton. The goal of the workshop is to bring together
researchers working at the interface of statistical physics, probability,
combinatorics and theoretical computer science with the intention of developing
a common language and recognizing parallels among the fundamental problems being
addressed in these disciplines. There will be several introductory lectures
surveying some of the major themes of the workshop. In addition, there will be
more advanced lectures giving junior and senior researchers opportunities to
present recent results. There will be ample time for discussion of open
problems.
