The research entails the geometry and topology of hyperbolic structures on
3-dimensional manifolds. In particular, metrics of non-positive curvature will
be studied and the fundamental groups of these manifolds will be related to
those of other classes of manifolds. The techniques exploited may have potential
applications to other branches of mathematics.
