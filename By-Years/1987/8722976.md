Solitary waves (solitons) are large amplitude internal gravity waves that
propagate on density interfaces in the ocean over large distances with no change
in form, carrying energy and mass. They have particular importance in coastal
regions where breaking over sloping bottom topography generates tremendous
forces on structures and internal mixing. Their behavior in these regions is not
well understood. In this project Kao will investigate the shoaling of these
waves, with emphasis on the breaking process. Both theoretical models and
laboratory experiments would be carried out and the results compared.
