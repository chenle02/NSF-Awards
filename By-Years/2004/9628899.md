Award Abstract Fellow: Sandra T. Merino Proposal number: BIR 9628899 This action
funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for 1996. This fellowship
supports research and training in the area of prokaryotic genetics, specifically
an analysis of duplicated DNA sequences subjected to premeiotic methylation. The
mushroom Coprinus cinereus is used in this study because genes are normally
present in only one copy per nucleus, duplicated sequences are methylated
premetotically in crosses, and methylation effects are detectable in the veil
cells of the mushroom cap. This unique organism is ideally suited for studying
premiotic homology search in cell division. Genes have been isolated from the
mushroom which are necessary both for survival after gamma irridation and for
meiosis. These mutants are being used to study the role of MIP, methylation
indued premeiotically, in meiotic chromosome pairing and synapsis.
