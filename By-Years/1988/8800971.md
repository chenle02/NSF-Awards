Graduate student Ramirez-Domenech proposes a study of the floral development of
the mimosoids, a subfamily of tropical legumes. Scanning electron microscope
studies will reveal the organ of initiation and pattern of growth of floral
parts, which can then be used to help define and distinguish species and genera.
Trends in the patterns of floral development may also prove useful in
reconstructing ancestor-descendant relationships. The proposed research
constitutes a completely new line of inquiry into the systematics and evolution
of the Mimosoideae. The project may encourage other botanists to explore
developmental morphology for new information concerning classification and
evolution.
