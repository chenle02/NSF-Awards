Worm-like body shapes are thought to be some of the earliest evolved body plans
for soft moving organisms. This simple cylindrical shape is often modified
through evolution with the addition of limbs and other structures to improve how
an animal interacts with the environment. This project asks a very fundamental
question: how do such soft appendages change the way a soft-bodied worm-like
organism moves? The caterpillar, tobacco hornworm (Manduca sexta), offers a
great system to answer this question.

Using a custom-built force sensor array, the investigators directly measure
forces the caterpillar legs exert during normal crawling. By matching the
movements of the body to forces in different directions it is possible to
accurately describe how different legs help the caterpillar crawl and climb.
This study will also measure changes in body pressure to establish how
caterpillars differ from non-legged soft invertebrates such as leeches and
earthworms. It is expected that because the caterpillar has legs to anchor the
body, it will rely less on stiffening its body with fluid pressure for fine
movement control. The experiments will test if legs allow soft animals to
exploit stiff structures in their environment as a continually changing
skeleton. In effect the caterpillar can conform to the shapes that it crawls
upon.

Understanding the functional benefits of appendages on a worm-like morphology
not only provides insights to soft material control, but also gives clues to why
different caterpillars have different numbers of legs. Practically, this project
pushes the technical limits of biomechanical measurement. It will also expand
our understanding of animal locomotion and contribute to current theories of
legged systems, both animals and machines. Conceivably, this project can benefit
engineering and the development of soft robots and devices.
