This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial biology for
FY2004. The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of
protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are
not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides
opportunities for recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in
microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of
established scientists, and to broaden their scientific horizons beyond the
research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These
fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their
research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves
of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign
locations.

The research and training plan is entitled "Assessing nitrogen fixation in
estuaries using molecular tools." This research seeks to understand how
nitrogen-fixing bacteria respond to increasing nitrogen loads. It explores the
fundamental controls on nitrogen processing at the microbial level. A suite of
molecular tools including construction of clone libraries, DGGE, and RT-PCR are
being used to address questions that relate to the role nitrogen fixing bacteria
play in the nitrogen cycling of temperate salt marshes and sea grass beds.
