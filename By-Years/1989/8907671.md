Parallel algorithms for various classes of large-scale network optimization
problems will be developed and tested. Research will focus on the following
classes of network flow problems: l. Pure single-commodity 2. Generalized
(networks with gains and losses) 3. Nonlinear 4. Multicommodity These problem
classes span a very broad range of large-scale real-world applications as well
as a spectrum of mathematical classes. They also form a natural continuum, since
parallel techniques developed for the first two classes of linear networks are
often relevant to the latter two classes, in which single-commodity linear
networks may arise as subproblems. Thus, there are synergetic relationships
between these areas. A goal of the research is to unify and extend earlier
results in parallel optimization in order to obtain efficient algorithms that
are based on a variety of primal and dual decomposition approaches and suited to
implementations on multicomputer as well as multiprocessor architectures. These
methods will be tested on large-scale test problems on the parallel systems
available locally as well as on other parallel hardware available via Internet.
