In this proposal, the principal investigator (PI) plans to study the second part
of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture for modular abelian varieties
(including elliptic curves). This conjecture gives a formula that relates
certain invariants attached to the abelian variety, including the orders of the
Shafarevich-Tate group, the torsion subgroup, and the component groups. To start
with, the PI will study the possible cancellations between the orders of the
torsion and component groups in the formula, by extending work of Mazur and
Emerton. The PI also plans to use the notion of visibility to show that the
conjectural order of the Shafarevich-Tate group divides the actual order (in
certain cases), assuming the first part of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer
conjecture. In the course of the work, the PI hopes to prove results that should
be of interest independent of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture,
including generalizations of several parts of Mazur's seminal paper "Modular
curves and the Eisenstein ideal" to non-prime level.

This proposal falls in the area of arithmetic geometry, which concerns the
application of algebraic geometry to number theory. Number theory is one of the
most ancient branches of mathematics, and deals with questions regarding
integers or rational numbers and their properties. Algebraic geometry is the
study of solutions of polynomial equations using geometric techniques. Thus
arithmetic geometry can be thought of as studying integer or rational number
solutions to systems of polynomials. Elliptic curves are certain polynomial
equations whose solutions can be added in a certain way, similar to usual
addition. The work of the PI will enrich our understanding of elliptic curves;
for example, in finding the number of solutions to the equation defining an
elliptic curve, provided this number is finite. Elliptic curves are important
objects of study in number theory, and have applications both within and outside
mathematics. For example, they played an important role in Wiles's proof of
Fermat's Last Theoerem, and are being applied to cryptography. In particular,
the work of the PI has potential long-term applications to real-life problems.
