This grant provides partial support for Gordon Research Conference and Gordon
Research Seminar on plasmonics at Colby College in Waterville, Maine on June
9-15, 2012. The field of plasmonics encompasses the science and engineering of
optical interaction with nanometer-to-micrometer structures. The Gordon Research
Conference on plasmonics brings together some of the most active world renowned
senior and junior scientists in the field of plasmonics to deliver exciting,
cutting-edge, and thought-provoking invited lectures and to actively promote and
engage in extensive scientific discussions and interaction with researchers,
students, and postdoctoral fellow participants. The two-day Gordon Research
Seminar, run by graduate students before the conference, is designed to
stimulate students' awareness of the fast growing frontiers of plasmonics across
multiple disciplines, provide an environment for initiating and building
professional relationships and fostering interdisciplinary dialog and
collaboration, and prepare graduate students and postdocs for the extensive
interactive scientific dialog during the subsequent Gordon Research Conference
on plasmonics. The NSF funds are used mainly to provide financial support for
graduate students, postdocs, and junior faculty members, especially from under-
represented groups.
