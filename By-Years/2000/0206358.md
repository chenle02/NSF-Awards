AST-0206358&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI Kulkarni&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neutron stars
are exotic remnants of stellar evolution. First identified as isolated radio
pulsars and X-ray emitting binaries, the number and variety of such systems has
grown enormously in the last two decades with the discovery of rapid
(millisecond) radio and X-ray pulsars, soft gamma-ray pulse repeaters,
relativistic binary systems, etc. Along with this diversity is mounting evidence
of a tremendous range in magnetic field strength. This contributes to the
interest in neutron stars as laboratories for physics under extreme conditions
and as tracers of the evolution of massive stars. This project pursues three
basic areas of research. The investigators in this team (including two graduate
students) will carry out the first coherent census of all classes of neutrons
stars within 5 kpc of the sun, perform a deep search toward globular clusters
for sub-millisecond pulsars using the Parkes radio telescope (Australia), and
the new Green Bank Telescope (West Virginia), and with improved instrumentation
at Parkes determine distances and binary component masses for a sample of
pulsars and contribute to placing new limits on long-period gravitational
waves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
