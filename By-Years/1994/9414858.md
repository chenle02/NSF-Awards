9414858 Weathers This project is on research to study the culturing of plant
organs (hairy roots) by a NMB. Also, methods to recover the secondary
metabolites produced by the plant organs which are not lethal to the plants will
be investigated. The objectives of this research are to: (1) develop and test
mathematical models for the key transport processes in the NMB; (2) conduct
complete growth cycle experiments using a fully instrumented NMB; (3) measure
the kinetics of growth and secondary metabolite production in the NMB and
compare these kinetics to that of other reactors for the culture of hairy roots;
and (4) develop, measure and model non-lethal product release methods. ***
