The principal investigator will develop a new method for determining D/H
fractionation factors for systems of geologic interest. The primary goal of the
study is to determine partition function ratios of common hydrous minerals as a
function of temperature and thereby establish a self-consistent set of
fractionation factors for application to geochemical problems. This will help
resolve major discrepancies in the literature. The information will also be of
considerable theoretical and physical chemical interest.
