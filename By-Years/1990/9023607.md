This research is concerned with the basic physical, electronic and material
properties of multi- dielectric microstructures which use quantum mechanical
tunneling of carriers into deep-level, storage traps to create a nonvolatile
semiconductor memory device. The particular device under investigation is the
polySilicon gate-blocking Oxide-silicon Nitride- tunnel Oxide-Silicon (SONOS)
multi- dielectric microstructure. The traps are located in the silicon nitride
and this research explores the physical mechanisms by which charge injection,
transport and storage is accomplished in 'scale' device structures. The origin
and control of these traps is an important objective in the program as well as
the examination of electron and hole transport across interfacial boundaries
with novel charge-separation techniques. In particular, we propose to
investigate a new SONOS device structure which uses a polysilicon storage region
for increased charge storage at low programming voltages. These SONOS structures
show great promise for low voltage programming and the results of this research
will impact such areas as high density, nonvolatile memories, application
specific integrated circuits, wafer scale integration and neural networks. In
particular, the low power, electrically reprogrammable SONOS analog conductance
is an attractive 'modifiable' synapse for neural network implementation.
