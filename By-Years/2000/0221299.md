This dissertation compares professionalization and unionization as means for
promoting the interests of family child-care workers. Initially, qualitative
methods will investigate two Illinois campaigns representing each strategy. The
professionalization and unionization campaigns differ in their reliance on child
development experts or grassroots organizers; in their advocacy of better
training and certification or their emphasis on worker solidarity; and in their
state lobbying efforts for higher child care standards or increased pay for
workers. Surveys will evaluate the success of each type of campaign in
mobilizing support among child care workers. The study expects the unionization
campaign to be more attractive to lower income child care workers while the
professionalization campaign should be better supported by the child care
workers who are already better educated.
