With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
(CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Texas in
Arlington will acquire a 300 MHz NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will enable
researchers to carry out research on synthetic organic, inorganic, physical
organic and polymer chemistry. These include the study of a) novel
enantiomerically pure metal-organic dendrimers; b) metal complexes of new
fluorinated poly(pyrazolyl)borate ligands; c) polymeric materials with enhanced
electrical conductivity, superconductivity or electro- and photoluminescent
properties; d) the study of ISAMs with nonlinear optical properties; e) the
total synthesis of bioactive alkaloids and synthetic methods development; and f)
molecular recognition of gases. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
(NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists for the
elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown
substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and
to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to
state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out
frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have a particular
impact in materials science and the development of new polymers.
