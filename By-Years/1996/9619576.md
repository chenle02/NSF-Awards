AST-9619576 Reconstructing the Magellanic Clouds Star Formation History from a
Digital UBVI Photometric Survey. Dr. Zaritsky will investigate the global and
spatially resolved star formation history of the Magellanic Clouds in order to
better understand the evolution of galaxies in general and the detailed
evolution of the Clouds in particular. This work will produce the first large-
scale UBVI digital survey of the Magellanic Clouds to bridge studies of galaxy
evolution that are based on photometry of individual stars and those that
utilize integrated properties of galaxies. The results of this research are
expected to provide a fundamental advance in the study of galaxy evolution and
provide the empirical constraints necessary to test evolutionary models.
