Peterson 97-11621 Studies of the Magnitude of climate changes expected resulting
from buildup of atmospheric CO2 are predicted to affect many facets of the
Earth's environments, although the magnitude of many of these effects is
unknown. This study aims to integrate data bases regarding the biodiversity of
Mexico, thematic geographic data, up-to-date information from satellite imagery,
and simple models of global climate change into a series of predictions of the
effects of these changes on species of birds, mammals, and butterflies in the
region, a first assessment of the biodiversity consequences of global climate
change. Multi-seasonal analysis of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer
imagery will be used to produce a detailed region wide vegetation map, which
will be combined with existing environmental maps and data bases to characterize
habitat types. Simple models of the effects of elevated C02 and other agents of
climate change will be used to mimic future shifts in distribution and extent of
vegetation types and habitats. Geographic distributions of individual species
will be predicted based on characteristics of sites of known occurrence; based
on the future-shift models developed from climate change projections, species'
future distributions will be modeled, and extinction's and colonization
inferred. The overall result will be an assessment of the biodiversity
consequences of anticipated climate change over the next several decades or
centuries in Mexico, as well as the development of several methods and models
that will be useful to other investigators interested in similar and related
issues.
