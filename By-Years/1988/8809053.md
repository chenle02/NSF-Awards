Precedence constraints arise frequently in discrete optimization problems.
Polyhedral theory and computational experience both suggest that integer
programs defined largely by precedence constraints have structure that can be
exploited to develop good polyhedral-based algorithms for their solution. Two
important integer programming problems with precedence constraints are the
precedence-constrained knapsack problem and the plant location problem. The PI
will develop new polyhedral results for these NP-complete problems so that
together with existing polyhedral results fast, efficient algorithms for their
solution can be implemented. Special attention will be given to the development
of parallel algorithms. Beyond providing operational algorithms that can be used
to solve actual applications of these two problems, the work will extend the
known theory of polyhedral combinatorics.
