The present study will attempt to reconstruct the phylogenetic history of the
genus Fundulus, a group of about 35 species of freshwater and brackish water
fishes, commonly known as killifishes or topminnows, using genetic similarities
determined from starch gel electrophoresis of enzymes. This is an ideal group of
species for studies for this sort, because the number of species is large enough
to provide interesting results, permit thorough examination of the variety of
geographical areas and ecological habitats occupied, and to utilize information
from disparate types of studies to interpret patterns and processes of
evolution. The results of the study will be useful to many biologists since
killifishes have been used extensively as experimental animals for many kinds of
biological research.
