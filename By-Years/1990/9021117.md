The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) is the second largest
professional society of computer and information scientists and engineers in the
United States. ACM has an international membership of approximately 80,000. The
project is expressly designed to address a well documented lack of information
concerning the nature of disability in science and engineering professions. ACM
will utilized the information resulting from the assessment in attracting
individuals with disabilities to the computer and information science profession
in general and ACM membership and participation in particular. They will use the
information to plan the development and modification of member policies to
increase the quality of service for disabled members. Potential specific results
include: * Improved planning for conferences, symposia, and workshops to ensure
equal opportunities for professionals with disabilities, both ACM members and
nonmembers, to participate. * Determine alternatives for regular member services
including publications to make them more accessible to members with
disabilities. *Identify means to attract more individuals with disabilities to
the computing professions in general and ACM membership in particular. The
project is directly related to the interests and objectives of the NSF Computer
Information Science and Engineering Directorate in that CISE represents the
computing profession within NSF and is particularly interested in furthering
opportunities for professionals with disabilities in computer and information
science.
