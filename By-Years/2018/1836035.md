The SIAM Central States Section (SIAM CSS
https://www.siam.org/sections/central/) was formed in 2014 to serve SIAM members
in Arkansas, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, and
Oklahoma. The 4th Annual Meeting of SIAM Central States Section will be held
10/5-10/7, 2018 on the Norman campus of the University of Oklahoma. The url for
the conference website is http://www.math.ou.edu/conferences/siam2018
.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theme of this conference will be centered around
applied and computational Mathematics. This award will be used solely to support
junior researchers (students/postdocs/early career faculty), minorities, people
with disability and colleagues from 4-year colleges. Our long-term goal is to
build a stronger computational and applied Math program throughout all the
central states. The SIAM CSS annual conference series provides a very important
platform for computational and applied mathematicians to exchange knowledge and
network with experts from all over the U.S. and other countries. This conference
will give ample opportunity for people to interact at discussions during the
breaks, between talks, as well as after the talks. In particular we expect
participants from the central states (that may or may not present at the
conference) to have the opportunity to establish interactions with researchers
that they would not often have a chance to meet in this part of the
country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
