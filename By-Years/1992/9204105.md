The P.I. proposes to continue a U.S.-Russian collaborative project (started in
1989) to study geochemical, tectonic, and structural segmentations along the MAR
between Hayes and Atlantis Transforms. The Russian vessel Boris Petrov will be
used for overall geophysical and bathymetric surveys and ALVIN will be used to
sample ridge segments at shorter wavelength intrasegement scale. The goal is to
evaluate the petrogenetic processes (mantle source variations, depth of melting,
crystal fractionation, magma mixing etc.) that are responsible for the observed
geochemical and tectonic variations at all scales of ridge segmentation.
