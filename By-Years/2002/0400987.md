&lt;br/&gt;The Purpose of the project is to support research in operator
algebras and &lt;br/&gt;related fields. Operator algebras provide models and
tools for the study &lt;br/&gt;of noncommutative, or quantized systems and
objects. A large part of the &lt;br/&gt;subject is the study of von Neumann
algebras (introduced by John von &lt;br/&gt;Neumann about seventy years ago).
These are the noncommutative measure &lt;br/&gt;spaces. The research objective
of the project is to further develop the &lt;br/&gt;theory of quantum (or
"free") probability and statistics in the context of &lt;br/&gt;von Neumann
algebras and find applications in mathematics and
beyond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Probabilistic and statistical methods are widely
used in many areas of &lt;br/&gt;sciences and in our daily lives. For many
complicated systems such as &lt;br/&gt;financial markets or networks, classical
theories are not quite &lt;br/&gt;effective in explaining how the systems work
and predicting the future. &lt;br/&gt;Quantum probability and statistics provide
tools in dealing with large &lt;br/&gt;systems with more interactive or
intertwined variables. Progresses in the &lt;br/&gt;study of quantum probability
and statistics will enhance our understanding &lt;br/&gt;of the laws in nature
and the quality of our living.&lt;br/&gt;
