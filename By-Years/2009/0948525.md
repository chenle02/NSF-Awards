Organisms frequently direct stationary cells to become migratory in order to
build various structures throughout their body. One such migratory cell type,
the neural crest, gives rise to portions of the heart, components of the gut and
sensory nervous systems, skin pigment cells, and the craniofacial skeleton. The
formation of migratory neural crest cells is mediated, in part, by the activity
of a protein called Snail2. The central goal of this research project is to
delineate the role of Snail2, and the genes Snail2 regulates, during neural
crest cell migration. To address this question, various molecular and
biochemical experiments will be performed to examine the role of two putative
Snail2 target genes, alpha-N-catenin and cingulin, in the neural crest. The
results of this work will reveal the distribution and function of alpha-N-
catenin and cingulin in the developing embryo, as well as define the mechanism
by which Snail2 regulates alpha-N-catenin and cingulin.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this proposal include: 1) the
integration of research and teaching at the high school, undergraduate, and
graduate levels, 2) the support of female scientists through participation in
the University of Maryland, College Park chapter of the Association for Women in
Science, and 3) the generation of important reagents that will be available to
the scientific community. Collectively, this project will help better prepare
the next generation of scientists for careers in both academic and non-academic
settings, and the proposed experiments will shed light on the processes
regulating neural crest cell migration and the fundamental molecular mechanisms
controlling the directed movement of cells during embryonic development.
