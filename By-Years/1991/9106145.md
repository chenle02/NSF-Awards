Although people have migrated to the U.S. from Asia throughout most of the last
two centuries, historical and geographical studies of immigration and immigrant
settlement in the United States have focused primarily on European relocation to
North America. This doctoral dissertation project will examine the migration of
the Chinese who came to live in Pennsylvania between 1860 and 1920. Documentary
and archival research will be used to examine the roles of individuals and
institutions in the relocation to the U.S. Special attention will be given to
the ways that Chinese and American institutions affected family structures and
locational patterns of Chinese immigrants. This project will add to our
understanding of the interplay between individual motivations and institutional
elements that influence the time and place of migration and settlement. It will
broaden our view of the nature of migration and settlement in the United States
by presenting a balanced view of the Chinese, an historically underrepresented
ethnic group. This project also will provide an excellent opportunity for a
promising young scholar to continue to develop independent research skills.
