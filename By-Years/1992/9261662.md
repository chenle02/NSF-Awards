This proposal is for developing a VLSI CAD tool to do the process of compacting
a wiring design into minimal chip area. The novelty in this tool is that it
seeks to go beyond existing compaction tools and deal with designs that have
millions of transistors, which is three orders of magnitude beyond current
capabilities. The approach relies on the quasi-linearity of the compaction
algorithms already developed. These topological approaches to compaction are
being developed through parallel computing techniques and maintaining structural
hierarchy. A coarse grain parallel implementation is being implemented in the
C-Linda language, and it is being tested in distributed environments and on
tightly coupled MIMD machines.
