Proposal: EAR-0207607&lt;br/&gt;PI: Jordan&lt;br/&gt;Title: EarthScope
Computational Science and Information Technology
Workshop&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant is intended to support a workshop in
the area of Computational Science and Information Technology (CSIT). The purpose
of the workshop will be to develop preliminary plans for a CSIT component of
EarthScope program that will address issues in three areas critical to the
program's success: (1) data collection, archiving, and distribution, (2)
modeling and simulating nonlinear geosystems, and (3) advanced information
technologies for the EarthScope collaboratory. A major objective will be to
cross-educate members of the geoscience and computer-science communities in the
major research goals and capabilities of the two fields, and to discuss how
these capabilities can be mobilized to enhance the success of the EarthScope
program. The workshop will be open to about 70 participants from the geoscience
and computer science. The organizing committee will produce a summary of results
in the form of a preliminary CSIT plan, which will be widely circulated for
review and comment. A final plan will be submitted to the National Science
Foundation by August 2002. The workshop is to be jointly supported by NSF and
NASA.&lt;br/&gt;
