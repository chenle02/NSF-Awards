The successful development of a stochastic computer model of combustion flows
would be a major step on the way to reliable design techniques. What is proposed
is a model which would bypass the complexity of chemical kinetics, while using
recent advances in multiprocessing, turbulent flow simulation and combustion
mixing. Although ambitious and in need of careful correlation with reality, a
working model would be extremely useful in a wide range of combustion
applications, from small heaters to giant boilers and jet engines.
