Campus Academic Research Infrastructure: Development of Automatic Test Station
for Network Synchronization Performance Characterization This Academic Research
Infrastructure award supports the development of an automatic test station for
synchronization characterization of telecommunications networks. The research
projects supported by the award include: 1. The development of the test station.
2. Development of software for the generation of test signals and for the user
interface. 3. Research on better synchronization in synchronous optical
networks.
