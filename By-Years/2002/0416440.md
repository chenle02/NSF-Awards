Title: Intestinal bicarbonate secretion in marine teleost fish &lt;br/&gt;PI:
Grosell, M. &lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Miami Rosensteil School of
Marine and Atmospheric Sciences&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates a
novel aspect of salt and water balance in marine fish. Like most other
vertebrates, marine fish maintain plasma osmolality ~ 300 mOsm which is much
lower than that of the surrounding seawater (~1000 mOsm). Fish drink copious
amounts of seawater to displace diffusive water loss to their environment. The
imbibed seawater is desalinized in the esophagus after which Na+ and Cl-
absorption in the intestine drives water uptake. Recent evidence suggests that a
substantial portion of this intestinal Cl- uptake occurs via Cl-/ HCO3- exchange
across the apical membrane of the intestinal epithelium and that this exchange
process contributes to active transport of both ions. The PIs will aim at
characterizing the cellular mechanisms of this Cl- uptake/HCO3- secretion system
on isolated intestinal epithelia and to evaluate its contribution to overall Cl-
and water absorption absorption also in intact animals. The high rates of HCO3-
secretion results in highly alkaline intestinal fluid, which leads to CaCO3
precipitation in the intestine. One consequence of this precipitation is reduced
osmolality of the intestinal fluids, which is hypothesized to aid water
absorption. Manipulations of the precipitation through intestinal perfusion with
salines of different composition are being performed to test this hypothesis.
Although the substantial intestinal base secretion is not involved in dynamic
regulation of acid-base balance it forms an important component of acid-base
exchange with the environment. The PIs will investigate how variations in
intestinal base secretion in response to different ambient salinities may be
compensated by extra-intestinal acid extrusion. The research has a strong
educational component and involves several undergraduate and graduate
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
