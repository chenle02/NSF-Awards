The objective of this award is to provide financial support for students at US
institutions to attend the 22nd International Symposium on Mathematical
Programming to be held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 12-17 July 2015. This
symposium is organized every three years by the Mathematical Optimization
Society and spans virtually all aspects of mathematical optimization. The goal
is to provide partial travel and local expenses support to students who
otherwise might not be able to attend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Successful outcome
of this award is that it will provide an opportunity for students to attend an
important conference that is held in the US less than 50 percent of the time.
The conference is a particularly attractive one, due to the diversity of the
covered topics as well as the geographical provenance of the attendees. Students
have a strong interest in participating, as very recent and topical research is
presented, and the possibility to network with and learn from researchers whose
interests are similar to theirs is an important opportunity.
