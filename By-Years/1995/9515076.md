9515076 Ellison This project consists of the development of game-theoretic
models and empirical analysis of the way in which individuals, firms, and
societies learn in particular situations. These projects will try to provide a
more general understanding of how "conventions" for behavior in a society arise
by discussing when evolution in economic models occur quickly, to explore
whether equilibria of game-theoretic models which require players to use mixed
strategies can be justified as the outcome of a process of learning in a large
heterogeneous environment, and to describe how the need to allocate analytical
resources may affect the structure of hierarchies in firms. In addition several
empirical studies are undertaken in order to improve understanding of the
industries and behaviors in question and more broadly to assess the relevance of
recent theoretical work. These studies explore the riskiness of mutual funds'
portfolios, the location decisions of manufacturing plants, and the behavior of
pharmaceutical firms at patent expiration.
