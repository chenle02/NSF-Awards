This effort is a study of the interactions of lightwaves with various types of
materials, most notably crystals, and fibers. Attention will be focused on the
processing of images and basic optical logic operations. Processing of images
relates to the ability to obtain an image from a relatively bright background or
other source of noise or the ability to abstract certain desired features from
an image. Other investigations which will be pursued include the ultimate limits
which might be achieved in switching of an optical beam either on or off, or in
direction. The ultimate limits refers to minimum power or energy and the minimum
time needed to do this.
