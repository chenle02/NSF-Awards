This award will support a two-day Earth Science Education and Outreach Provider
Summit at Tempe in the winter of 2012, hosted the EarthScope National Office.
Participants will include E&amp;O personnel and advisors from facilities and
large research projects supported by the Division of Earth Sciences and other
related organizations. The Provider Summit will be co-facilitated and evaluated
by E&amp;O experts from the Science Education Resource Center (SERC) at Carleton
College. The outcome and products of the meeting will constitute a unique
resource for shaping informal and formal Earth science education and public
outreach. The EarthScope National Office will ensure that the findings and
products of the Provider Summit will be widely disseminated through its own
channels, through SERC, and via the other participating organizations. These
resources will be highly visible and freely available to all Earth science
educators, educational institutions, and societies.
