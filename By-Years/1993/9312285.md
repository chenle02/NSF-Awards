9312285 Mattice Technical Narrative: This project represents a collaborative
research effort between the University of Akron and Bogazici University,
Istanbul, Turkey. The investigators intend to develop procedures for the
simulation of polymers in three environments -- inclusion complexes, the
amorphous polymer at bulk density, and diblock copolymer micelles. This research
may prove valuable in gaining insight into the factors that influence the
dynamics of flexible chains and their rate of entry exchange into and out of
micelles. The problems to be addressed in this research are relevant to a wide
range of practical problems in polymer processing and polymer structure-property
relations. Project funding will enable the researchers to develop simulations on
both campuses and to visit each other's laboratory over the course of this
three-year study. This project in materials research fulfills the program
objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the
United States and Turkey to combine complementary talents and conduct research
in areas of strong mutual interest and competence. ***
