This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in the general
area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the subfield of
electrochemistry. The thrust of this experimental activity is to evaluate the
feasibility of utilizing new, high surface area carbon and graphite anodes as
electrodes for oxidative electrosyntheses. The number of stable, inexpensive
anode materials available for use in electrosynthetic processes is quite
limited. This Phase I activity capitalizes on new technology that has recently
been developed by The Electrosynthesis Company. These materials have been found
to be stable in strongly acidic media at high oxidation potentials. The efficacy
of these materials relative to noble metals is being evaluated for use in four
industrially important electrochemical processes: electrosyntheses of sodium
perchlorate, persulfate, ozone, and dimethyl sebacate. These new electrode
materials could provide equivalent or better performance than platinum, thereby
resulting in lower cell capital and operating costs for the production of the
desired chemicals. The potential commercial importance of this project is
substantial in that replacement of a strategic material (platinum) is addressed.
