Description: This project supports participation by a scientist from the
University of Jordan (Dr. M.H. Abu Zarga) in a research project with Dr. Maurice
Shamma of the Chemistry Department, Pennsylvania State University to investigate
the chemical contents of a variety of Jordanian plants. The plants will include
Androcymbium palestinum, Colchicum decaisnei, and Paronychia argentea. The
Jordanian scientist will spend about five months at Penn State for in-depth
chemical analysis of these plants' contents. The first two plants are known to
be rich in alkaloids. The third is not rich in alkaloids but is used in folk
medicine and it is desirable to separate its chemical constituents including
terpenoids, flavonoids and lignans. Pure compounds obtained in the research will
be forwarded to NIH for their clinical research and to industry to test for
possible agricultural applications. Scope: The PI is a world expert in the
research on natural products' chemistry. His research in collaboration with the
Jordanian scientist is likely to result in a better understanding of the
chemistry of the plants being studied, and in better cooperation between
scientists of the U.S. and Jordan which could lead to discovery of possible
pharmacologically interesting compounds.
