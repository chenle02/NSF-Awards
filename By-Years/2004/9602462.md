9602462 Capone This award provides support for a 3 month National Science
Foundation Dissertation Enhancement Award for Douglas Capone at Tokai
University, School of Marine Science and Technology. Dr. Capone's student, Ms.
Margaret Mulholland will work with Dr. Kaori Ohki, Professor in the School of
Marine Science and Technology, on a research project entitled, "Regulation of N2
fixation in Trichodesmium". Trichodesmium spp. are N2 fixing, marine
cyanobacteria that occur throughout the tropical and subtropical oceans in areas
otherwise noted for their paucity of plant life. As for many terrestrial
systems, limitation of oceanic plant production is attributed primarily to a
shortage of utilizable nitrogen compounds. Trichodesmium spp., utilize
dinitrogen gas, the most abundant form of nitrogen, thereby alleviating nitrogen
limitation and providing new nitrogen input into these systems. Trichodesmium
spp. can sustain high rates of N2 fixation in nature; however, little is known
about the biochemical and physiological conditions that support N2 fixation in
these species since they have been difficult to maintain in controlled culture
systems. Professor Ohki and her collaborators have been successful in their
attempts to grow Trichodesmium in cultures,but transfer of this culture to other
laboratories has proven unsuccessful. This project will examine the cellular
regulation of N metabolism and N2 fixation in Trichodesmium NIBB1067 grown under
controlled conditions with and without fixed nitrogen compounds. Results from
these studies will be compared with results from the field in order to better
understand the natural populations of Trichodesmium. ***
