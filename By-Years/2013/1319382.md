Online community question-and-answer systems such as Yahoo! Answers provide a
venue where people can pose questions, provide answers and browse and comment on
both. Such sites are now a central part of online interaction on a wide range of
sites, including specialized sites for software development, tax preparation,
and product support. In this projects, the PIs will experimentally answer a set
of causal questions drawn from diverse research literatures about how to improve
the performance of Q&amp;A systems, specifically what leads people to provide
good quality answers (and questions), how to route questions so they are
answered by the best possible member, how referrals and profiles affect
questions and answers, and to what extent different kinds of incentives affect
behavior on the site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is important
because online question and answer systems have become an important source of
information and advice for individuals and businesses, an important and
economical way for businesses to help their customers support each other, as
well as an important source of content for web search engines. By understanding
these systems, building models of usage and testing designs to support their
improved operation, the project will help systems designers understand
approaches that can promote beneficial social experiences for users and that can
inform the construction of valuable community-contributed repositories of
knowledge. Additional benefits include the release of data sets for other
researchers and the training of student researchers.
