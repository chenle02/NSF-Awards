This proposal from George Washington University and its partner, the Potomac
Communication Group, is aimed at designing a system to develop the capacity of
the MSPs to use, generate and disseminate knowledge about educational
improvement. The goals are to identify promising dissemination practices,
identify what knowledge decision -makers need , and develop a preliminary
framework for the dissemination of activities and findings of the MSPs. There
are five research questions: 1) What are the information needs of key education
decision-makers? 2) What contextual factors influence or motivate the use of
knowledge in decision making? 3) What are the information pathways used by the
decision-makers to access information? 4) What barriers or motivating factors
are present in accessing and using the knowledge to transform STEM education? 5)
What knowledge dissemination strategies or combination of strategies stimulate
reform of STEM education?
