Franklin and Marshall College is establishing a connection to NSFNET via a
56,000 bits per second line through the PREPNET mid-level network. The
connection enhances collaborations of campus scientists with colleagues at other
institutions, and allows access to libraries and other remote facilities
throughout the internet. This award funds part of the costs for two years.
