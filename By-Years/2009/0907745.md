This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Michal Simon and students will
undertake a project to explore the formation of single and binary stars. The
research will provide theorists with precisely measured masses of young stars to
enable critical tests of theoretical calculations of early stellar evolution.
Astronomers use theoretical calculations describing the evolution of young stars
to estimate their masses and ages. Unfortunately, for stars less massive than
the Sun, the calculations yield discrepant results. For stars less massive than
about 0.5 solar mass, the calculations are essentially uncalibrated by empirical
data. Masses of low mass young stars will be measured by their gravitational
interaction. The project will also identify new, low-mass stars near the Sun
from their motions in space. This will provide improved samples of young
binaries for mass measurement, along with desirable targets for exoplanet
searches by high resolution, high contrast imaging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
research offers graduate students the opportunity to learn how to use the best
contemporary instruments and to collaborate with astronomers who are expert in
their use. Dr. Simon will also continue his outreach efforts with other
astronomers at Stony Brook, in particular via the long-running program "Open
Nights in Astronomy."
