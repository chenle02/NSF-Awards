This award supports U.S. participants in a Madrid-based semester-long sequence
of technical research workshops, courses, collaborative visits, and an
international conference in a subject area at the boundary of traditional
control theory and combinatorial algebra. The three-month sequence of events is
motivated by recent innovations in combinatorial algebra, particularly
combinatorial Hopf algebras, and their powerful application in numerical
integration and control.

The program consists of: * A week-long technical workshop in early April in
Madrid. The goal is to bring together experts and young innovators from
different areas, survey the state of the art in each, and forge consensus on
research topics in which swift progress is feasible. * A mid-April week-long
school in Zaragoza, Spain aimed at graduate students and postdocs in
mathematics, physics, and related areas who are planning to do research in the
field of control and modern combinatorics. Four established researchers in these
fields will lead the school, which is to include lectures and problem sets. * A
month-long advanced course on combinatorics relevant to control, offered in
Madrid in May. * Focused research collaborations. Small teams of two to four
researchers will collaborate in Madrid for periods from two to four weeks during
mid-April to mid-June on the research themes identified in the workshop. It is
intended that these collaborations will connect creative young talents with
experienced leaders in the fields. * A week-long International Conference held
in Madrid in June. Participants of the preceding events will present their
results, redefine objectives for future research, and lay the foundation for
future collaborations.

The activity promises to build new long-term international research
collaborations and to catalyze research in this promising interdisciplinary
area.
