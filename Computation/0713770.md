Elliptic partial differential equations are ubiquitous in science and
engineering applications, and their fast and accurate numerical solution remains
an important area of research. Adaptive finite element algorithms for
automatically constructing efficient computational grids are very popular tools
for solving such equations. An adaptive finite element method (AFEM) is an
iterative feedback procedure in which an initial approximate solution is
computed, and information from the initial approximation is then used to
construct a better approximation. What is meant here by "better approximation"
depends upon the desired output from the computation. Most adaptive codes are
designed to control the energy norm (root-mean-square, or average, of the first
derivatives) of the error because the energy norm is closely associated with the
finite element algorithm. The goal output from many computations, on the other
hand, is related to other ways of measuring the error, and there is generally no
guarantee that control of the energy error will lead to computationally
efficient control of other measures of the error. Much recent research has thus
focused on using adaptive codes to compute "quantities of interest" not related
to the energy norm.

This project involves the construction and analysis of adaptive algorithms for
computations where the goal quantity is either related to pointwise information
about the error, or is a location within the overall computational domain.
Situations where such information is desirable include locating the maximum
temperature in a body at thermal equilibrium and determining where the stresses
in an elastic body exceed a given threshold. Level set methods in which evolving
interfaces are represented as level sets of solutions to partial differential
equations have also gained popularity in recent years. This project contains
three main goals. First, the PI and others have previously developed several
aspects of a basic theory for a posteriori estimation of pointwise errors in
simple model problems. This theory will be enriched and extended. Secondly, we
will investigate application of this basic theory to systems important in
applications, in particular the stationary Stokes system from fluid dynamics and
equations of linear elasticity. Finally, we will develop an adaptive algorithm
that rigorously controls level sets of solutions to elliptic problems. The
proposed research also provides for the training of a graduate student in
numerical analysis and scientific computing.
