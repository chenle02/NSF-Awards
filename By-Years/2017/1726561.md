An award is made to Montana State University (MSU) to acquire a Confocal Raman
microscope with cell-sorting ability. The Center for Biofilm Engineering at MSU,
where the requested instrument will be located, is a student-focused research
center of excellence that was originally funded by the NSF-ERC program. The
Center serves a key role, both nationally and internationally, in training
biofilm researchers and also has a strong track record of broadening the
participation of women and Native Americans in engineering and science through
its research programs that emphasize hands-on research education. Currently, one
of the most pressing challenges in microbiology is to identify roles for
individual microorganisms in complex, native habitats. Raman microscopy is a
novel way to study the contribution of individual microbes in complex
environments that range from human and environmental health to agricultural
productivity and ecosystem functioning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Raman is a
vibrational spectroscopic method that provides a fingerprint of the molecular
composition of a sample. A cell's Raman spectrum contains information about its
identity, physiological state, metabolic activity, and health/disease state. MSU
faculty and students will use the Raman microscope to characterize the
physiology, activity, and ecology of cultivated and uncultivated microbes in
their native state in a large number of ecosystems, including geothermal
springs, deep-sea sediment, and industrially and medically relevant biofilms.
The ability to use Raman for fast and non-destructive analyses will allow living
cells to be analyzed. This will enable downstream experiments such as cell
separation followed by molecular analyses. The acquisition of this instrument
enables the expansion of MSU faculty into novel research trajectories and help
them transition the field of microbiome research from correlative studies to
causal understanding of microbial function.
