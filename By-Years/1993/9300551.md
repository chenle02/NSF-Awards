This grant supports Professor Elliott to work in the area of probabilistic
number theory. Specifically, this proposal is to study the values of arithmetic
functions on prescribed sequences of arithmetic interest. Besides their own
merit, such functions bear upon problems in algebra, and apply to the study of
algorithms for the factorization of large integers, and so to cryptography. This
is research in the field of number theory. Number theory starts with the whole
numbers and questions such as the divisibility of one whole number by another.
It is among the oldest fields of mathematics and it was originally pursued for
purely aesthetic reasons. However, within the last half century, it has become
an essential tool in developing new algorithms for computer science and new
error correcting codes for electronics.
