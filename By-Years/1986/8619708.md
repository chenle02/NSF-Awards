The detailed analysis of airglow and auroral optical emission measurements
requires sophisticated computer models of electron impact energy loss/excitation
processes, photochemistry, and radiative transfer of optically thick EUV
resonance lines in the atmosphere. Due to the complexity of the modeling effort,
only one group (R.R. Meier and colleagues at NRL) has previously been engaged in
comprehensive modeling of the UV spectrum of the dayglow and aurora. In addition
to collaborating with Dr. Meier in the analysis of U.C. Berkeley SRP78-1 EUV
data, we are now conducting or own theoretical investigations and analyses of
both EUV and visible region airglow and aurora. The quantitative investigation
of airglow and auroral excitation and emission processes plays a significant
role in the elucidation of the photochemistry and energetics of the coupled
magnetosphere-ionosphere-atmosphere system. The daytime ionosphere is formed and
maintained through the absorption of solar EUV radiation at wavelengths below
1025 >. In the auroral zones, where geomagnetic storms may have a profound
influence on neutral atmospheric and ionospheric structure, much of the energy
deposited in the atmosphere by precipitating energetic electrons is released in
the form of optical emissions. Thus, the spectroscopy of atmospheric emissions
serves as an important diagnostic tool in understanding and monitoring the
global terrestrial environment.
