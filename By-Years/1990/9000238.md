Partial support is requested to defray room and board costs for graduate
students attending the West Coast REgional Developmental Biology Conference for
1990. The conference is to be held on May 3-6, 1990 at the Stanford Alumni
Center, Fallen Leaf Lake, California. The tentative schedule calls for thirty
speakers, reflecting as full a mix of gender, race and degree of professional
advancement as is compatible with the primary criterion of scientific
excellence. Topics to be addressed in formal sessions include: 1) Cell adhesion
in Development, 2) Molecular Basis of cell differentiation, 3) Induction, 4)
Growth factors in development, 5) Pattern, 6) A Workshop on Techniques of
Visualization. In addition, all attendees will be invited to contribute to a
formal poster session. %%% These regional meetings have traditionally played a
very important training function for younger scientists (graduate students and
post doctoral students).
