9452213 Betounes This project is to create a computational laboratory/classroom
learning environment for three senior level mathematics courses: Partial
Differential Equations, Differential Equations, and Advanced Engineering
Mathematics. This laboratory is enabling the students, through experimentation
and investigation, to enhance their comprehension of the subject matter in these
courses. A novel feature of the project is the use of portable computers, as
well as fixed laboratory computers, to augment the students' learning process.
