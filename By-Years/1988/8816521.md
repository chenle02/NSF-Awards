Fish larvae are an important component of the zooplankton community, yet little
attention has been focussed on Antarctic larval fish ecology. The processes by
which marine fish larvae function affect the dynamics of antarctic fishes and
ultimately the entire antarctic marine ecosystem. Before meaningful research can
be conducted on these processes, it is essential to identify which life history
stages, and/or environmental events are significant to larval growth, survival
and ultimately recruitment into the adult population. The examination of
variables influential to larval fish survival has been augmented by dramatic
advances in the study of microstructural patterns in fish otoliths; structures
which effectively serve as storage sites of chronological information. The
employment of otolith techniques in larval fish investigations promises to
provide a schedule of larval fish growth rates, hatching periodicity, and
environmental histories, and subsequently would make it possible to better
understand larval fish processes. Through the execution of controlled laboratory
experiments, otolith microstructure will be investigated to determine the
causative agents involved in otolith formation. Knowledge from the laboratory
experiments will be applied to field populations to delineate larval fish ages
and growth. The resultant information will be coupled to environmental data in
order that growth and survival will be related to the physical and biological
aspects of larval fish habitats. These results will provide the structural
framework within which research may be directed toward elucidating the factors
influential to growth and mortality, and will guide the way for similar research
in other ecosystems. A broad model, developed through the utilization of otolith
information, would be applicable to recruitment studies and would greatly
improve our understanding of the dynamics of the early life history stages of
Antarctic fish populations.
