This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research here will center on two
major themes, pursued with theoretical calculations, both numerical and
analytic: (i) The first part of the work examines the time-dependence of quantum
entanglement, to clarify and extend recently identified phenomena related to
early-stage decoherence (ESD), also called entanglement sudden death. The PI
further will examine entanglement in a system consisting of two atoms in two
different cavities. The second part of the work deals with the dynamical
evolution of quantum entanglement, to obtain an improved description of
propagation in partially coherent optical absorbers of two competing and
cooperating short pulses. The emphasis will be on ways to find analytical
solutions. There will also be a workshop in the first area of the research, on
Non-Markovian Relaxation and Entanglement
Dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students working in this research program will
receive training that will enable them to continue to work in science in
academic, industrial, and governmental contexts, taking their education and
their talents into a wide community.
