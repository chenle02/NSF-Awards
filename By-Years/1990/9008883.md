This grant supports a workshop From Fundamental Fields to Nuclear Phenomena at
Boulder, Colorado September 20-22, 1990. The overall theme is to focus
theoretical attention on a major issue in nuclear physics - how to relate
observed nuclear properties to the underlying field theory of the strong
interactions (QCD). The specific topics that will be addressed involve frontier
issues in nuclear physics elementary particle physics and also atomic physics
covering problems ranging from the nature of the nuclear-nucleon interaction to
relativistic many-body systems.
