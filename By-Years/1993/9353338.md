9353338 Porter, A. Duane This is a master's degree program for 50 well-prepared
high school mathematics teachers, primarily from Wyoming and Neighboring States.
Participating teachers have a choice of 2 program formats: (1) an academic year
institute, or (2) a sequential 4-summer institute. The 14 specially designed
courses of the program focus on mathematical content, pedagogical issues,
integration of technology into the teaching of mathematics, and assessment. A
program component focuses on the special needs of Native American students. A
research paper, generally classroom-based, is required for the degree. After
receiving their degree, participants, supported by project staff, are expected
to offer "short" courses in mathematics and pedagogy for other teachers in their
home schools and districts. ***
