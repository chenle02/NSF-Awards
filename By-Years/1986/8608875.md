This research considers a fundamental control problem, the compensation of
uncertain plants. The effect of sensor noise at the plant input is taken into
account in the compensator design and is called the cost of feedback. Nonlinear
compensation techniques are proposed for achieving desired feedback benefits
with less cost than in conventional optimal linear time invariant design. The
proposed techniques take into account most important factors occurring in real
applications, i.e. plant uncertainty, sensor noise, and loop bandwith. Nonlinear
compensation, though still in its infancy, is potentially a very powerful tool
for control system design. The research being proposed holds the promise of
providing nonlinear compensation techniques which would be extremely useful in
designing real world control systems.
