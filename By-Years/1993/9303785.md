9303785 Nielsen This award provides 28 percent of the funding necessary to
upgrade the controlling computer system on the electron microprobe in the
College of Oceanography at Oregon State University. The institution is committed
to providing the remaining funds needed. The electron microprobe laboratory at
Oregon State University provides analytical capabilities (quantitative elemental
micro- analyses with a spatial resolution of a micrometer) that is required for
the research of a large number of faculty and students in the College of
Oceanography and in the Department of Geosciences at Oregon State. ***
