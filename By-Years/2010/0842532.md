As organisms permanently attached to one location in the ground, plants have
developed mechanisms to sense environmental conditions and respond
appropriately. For example, many plants use photoperiod, or the relative length
of light and dark periods in a 24-hour day, to determine whether impending
environmental conditions are favorable and thus regulate the onset of flowering.
The molecular mechanisms by which photoperiod regulates the onset of flowering
in plants are not fully understood. This project uses Japanese morning glory
plants to investigate whether the plant hormone ethylene is involved in
regulating plant flowering time in response to photoperiod. Ethylene has well-
established roles in many developmental processes in plants, including fruit
ripening and leaf senescence, but its role in photoperiodic flowering is
unclear. Molecular biology techniques will be applied to determining whether the
expression of various flowering genes in Japanese morning glory is reduced when
ethylene biosynthesis or ethylene signaling in the plants is disrupted. The
research will fill in a major gap in our knowledge of plant flowering, while at
the same time provide training in biological research to numerous undergraduate
students at a Primarily Undergraduate Institution in rural Vermont. Finally, the
research will impact agriculture as most crop plants are annual plants, and
determining when to flower is critical for their reproductive success.
