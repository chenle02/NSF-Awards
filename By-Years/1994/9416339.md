9416339 Gephart This research involves the use of approximately 1000 well-
constrained aftershock focal mechanisms to estimate the state of stress in the
vicinity of the mainshock fault plane of the Northridge earthquake. Within the
aftershock data set, the considerable diversity of focal mechanisms, observed
both locally and across the aftershock region, may enable very well-constrained
estimates of stress. Following an established technique, among a group of focal
mechanisms, a stress tensor is sought that most closely predicts the observed
direction of slip on at least one of the nodal planes of each mechanism. This
analysis yields only four of the six numbers of the stress tensor, but requires
no assumptions about the absolute magnitudes of shear or normal stress in the
region, which are generally poorly known. By dividing the data into subsets,
possible spatial and temporal variations in the stress field can be assessed.
This project is a contribution to the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction
Program and is supported by the Northridge Earthquake Emergency Appropriation.
