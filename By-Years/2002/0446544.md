The University of Kansas is awarded a grant to improve the Specify software. The
Specify Software Project (http://specifysoftware.org) supports 112 biological
research collections (museums and herbaria) with software and technical support
for the digital capture, management and web accessibility of their collections
data. The mission of the Project is to mobilize and deploy data gathered,
vouchered and documented during 300 years of the biological exploration of the
planet for education, research and application in science and society. The
Project develops and supports Specify, a Windows-based, open source, collections
data management application for multiple taxonomic disciplines. Specify provides
baseline software support to small, medium and large research collections.
Without a licensing fee and with free helpdesk and data management support for
non-profits institutions, Specify is the only affordable, professionally
engineered and supported package for many major U.S. research collections. The
goals of this award are (1) to strengthen support of biocollections computing,
by providing ongoing helpdesk and data management services related to our
current Specify application, (2) to grow the number of collections that use
Specify to 150-200 by the end of 2007, (3) to redesign the Specify user
interface as part of a usability engineering process to make the application
easier to learn and use, (4) to collaborate with European and other
international initiatives to define more useful standards and interfaces for
collections data, and (5) to re-engineer Specify into a versatile, three-tiered,
object-oriented platform, written in Java, and optimized for user interface
extensibility, code-reuse, and community development collaboration. The
transformation in Specify's software architecture will position and enable
Specify collections to participate fully in emerging grid computing
environments.
