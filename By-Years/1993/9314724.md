9314724 Chevalier The study of supernovae has progressed to the point where
these events are valuable probes of stellar evolution and high energy physics.
Observations at X-ray, radio, optical and ultraviolet wavelengths for supernova
1993J will be used to model the interaction of the shock from the exploding star
with circumstellar gas. Departures from spherical symmetry are expected to be
important and will be taken into account. The effect of magnetic fields on the
morphology of planetary nebulae will also be investigated. ***
