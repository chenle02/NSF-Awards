Advancement in accelerator science and technology is required to make possible
new discoveries in elementary particle physics, and one path towards that goal
is to devise new accelerator designs to provide high acceleration rates with
high efficiency. This experimental research project, with theoretical and
computational support, aims to confirm fundamental aspects of a new accelerator
design based on a two-beam concept whereby one beam with a large number of
particles provides energy to accelerate a beam of fewer particles to a higher
energy. The pursuit of paths such as this is essential to increase the
likelihood that a future multiple-tera-electron-volt (i.e. a million-million
electron volt) machine to collide electrons with positrons will be built at an
acceptable cost. This project, based at the Yale University Beam Physics
Laboratory, will support construction of a unique university-based facility for
exploring a range of additional beam-driven acceleration ideas and will provide
training opportunities for the next generation of much-needed accelerator
scientists, including students, postdoctoral researchers, and junior
faculty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical objectives of this project are: (1)
to configure a 500-kV electron gun with an associated beam transport line to
provide a long high-current multi-Amp bunch train; and (2) to apply such a bunch
train as the drive beam to excite a detuned bimodal cavity structure to achieve
high acceleration gradient and high transformer ratio. Two microwave modes of
this structure will be excited by the drive beam, with the frequency of the
higher mode equal to three times that of the lowest fundamental mode. The
frequencies of these two modes are detuned away from that of the drive beam or
its third-harmonic, to support unconventional spatiotemporal distributions of
the electromagnetic fields in the cavities. This strategy is predicted to allow
the accelerator to operate at high acceleration gradient with low breakdown
rates and great system simplification. The intended future outcome is the
evolution of a viable accelerator structure design that can support a novel two-
beam acceleration scheme with both beams moving along the same central axis in
the structure.
