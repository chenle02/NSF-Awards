9318905 Lupton Assoc. of Computer and Information Science Depts. in Minority
Institutions (ADMI) Training and Planning Workshop for Small Colleges Use of the
Internet and NSFNET The Associations of Computer and Information Science and
Engineering Departments at Minority Institutions (ADMI) was formed to assist
minority institutions in the development and strengthening of their research and
education programs. As part of its Annual Workshop ADMI, a training and planning
tutorial on networking is proposed for small institutions located predominantly
in the northwest area of the nation. The tutorial will provide an overview of
networking and its use and help to develop plans for Native American colleges,
reservation institutions of higher education, and others to become effective
network users. Communication links between small colleges and larger
institutions are of vital importance which allow educators to cross over
barriers that exist between two year colleges, four year colleges, and research
universities. ***
