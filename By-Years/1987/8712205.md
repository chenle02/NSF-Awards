This award will enable Dr. W. Lester S. Andrews, University of Virginia, to
collaborate with Drs. Sefik Suzer and J. Hacaloglu, Middle East Technical
University, Ankara, Turkey. They propose to develop a new experimental technique
for impacting matrix samples with low energy electrons during condensation at
10K and to examine the fragment ions and radicals by absorption and emission
spectroscopy in the visible and infrared regions. The combination of emission
and absorption techniques will yield a better understanding of electron impact
phenomena, which are of great significance to the topics of mass spectroscopy,
plasma etching, electrical discharges, and atmospheric chemistry. The research
will produce basic data on important charged and neutral chemical species. Dr.
Andrews and Dr. Suzer have successfully collaborated in the past, and the
proposed research is an extension of their previous work.
