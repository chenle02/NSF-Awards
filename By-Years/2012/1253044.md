Pulsed lasers have played a central role in a large number of applications
ranging from fundamental scientific studies to industry. In the coming decades,
pulsed lasers "in the form of optical frequency combs" will help unravel current
mysteries in science, such as dark energy or the potential time-dependence of
fundamental constants. But many of these experiments are now approaching the
limits of existing tools. Continued progress in these fields will require new
approaches. This project will deliver a new framework for understanding the
quantum and classical noise limitations in pulsed laser sources and demonstrate
novel interdisciplinary approaches towards creating a new kind of pulsed laser
that will serve as the next generation of optical precision tools.

This project will lead to robust pulsed lasers with record-low noise
performance, which will have a strong impact on science and technology. In
astronomy, they will aid programs such as the dark energy search through the
calibration of astronomical telescopes. In basic physics, they will serve as new
precision tools for atomic and molecular spectroscopy. The project will also
serve the scientific community by training and mentoring graduate and
undergraduate students, and broadening the participation of underrepresented
groups through an extensive set of outreach activities and diverse recruitment
efforts. Finally, impact on society will occur notably through novel medical
diagnostics, environmental sensing, and high-speed optical telecommunication
systems.
