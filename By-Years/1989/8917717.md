Dr. Van Altena will continue his Southern Proper Motion (SPM) program. These are
second epoch observations, the first epoch data were obtained between 1965 and
1974, which are taken at the Yale Southern Observatory at El Leoncito,
Argentina. The goal of the project is to determine the absolute proper motions
of stars with respect to faint galaxies. The 20-year difference in the two data
sets should result in highly accurate measurements of proper motions. The
absolute proper motions will be used to determine the absolute magnitudes of RR
Lyrae stars, corrections to the constants of precession, a fixed reference frame
for the HIPPARCOS astrometric satellite, Oort's constant B, and to study the
local structure of the Galaxy. The problems associated with establishing an
inertial reference frame have occupied astronomers for millenia. With the
passage of time and improvements in measurement techniques, it was discovered
that the stars are not fixed in the sky and that it is necessary to separate the
motions of the stars from that of the Earth's pole. This separation is currently
made through the observation of Solar System objects such as the Sun, the
planets, and minor planets. However, some of the Solar System observations are
made in modes that differ significantly from those used in normal stellar
observatons, and this difference may compromise the connection between the
dynamically defined reference frame and the stellar frame. As a result,
astronomers are left with star streams, moving groups, and non-circular motions
in the Galaxy to complicate the stellar motion model and the derivation of the
corrections to the constants of precession. The initial impetus for determining
proper motions with respect to faint galaxies was to determine the corrections
to the constants of precession and thereby improve on the system of the
fundamental catalogs.
