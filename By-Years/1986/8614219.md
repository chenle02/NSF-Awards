This work is concerned with synthesizing a parallel schedule for a set of
equations in a nonprocedural specification. Two forms of parallelism will be
exploited. The first is forall parallelism, in which multiple independent loop
bodies may be run concurrently. The second is task level parallelism, in which
multiple modules (perhaps including forall loops) are active concurrently.
Previous research in program synthesis from non procedural specification has
been directed toward sequential, dataflow and distributed processing
environments. This work focuses on an increasingly important target machine
class: shared memory MIMD configurations, in which a program consists of a task
force rather than one monolithic single instruction stream task. Other research
efforts in generating parallel programs for MIMD machines have dealt with
parallelizing sequential FORTRAN programs. In this work, a very high level
language for problem description (PS) is defined. Use of such a language enables
domain experts (as opposed to programmers) to produce parallel computer
programs. The study of parallelism in programs has become an important challenge
for the affective use of multiple instruction stream computers. This effort will
add to the understanding of the topic.
