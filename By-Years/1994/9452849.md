9452849 Zuman This project develops the Sunflower Science Discovery Magazine for
Children. This is a fully bilingual English\Spanish publication designed to
encourage Latino students to develop language skills as well as turn their
interest to the world of scientific discovery. The magazine is geared towards
students in grades 3-6, and presents science information and experiments in
stimulating graphic formats and poses interesting and relevant questions for
children based on current scientific developments. In an effort to provide
positive role models for children of Hispanic descent, the magazine highlights
historical and contemporary contributions and accomplishments of Latino
scientists. The magazine also strives to foster a multicultural perspective by
presenting science and technology issues faced by selected communities in
various stages of economic development to Latino children in an attempt to
strengthen their identification with their national origin and ethnic heritage.
Initially, two issues are being produced with plans to produce fourteen issues
over a four year period. The ultimate goal is for the publication to become
self-sustaining after the development period. ***
