9403866 Lipton We address the design of composite materials and their
application to optimal design of structures. Here we investigate the macroscopic
properties for perfectly and imperfectly bonded composites as well as optimal
transport properties for multi-phase emulsions and foams. On a theoretical level
this work involves basic research in homogenization theory, perturbation theory,
and gamma convergence of nonlinear functionals. The ultimate goal is the
creation of efficient numerical methods for optimal design of structures built
from composite materials. In this proposal we treat several topics involving the
use of composites in optimal structural design. Composite materials and their
transport properties are central to the design of structures ranging from the
aeroelastic tayloring of airplane wings to optimal design of emulsions. The
design approach put forth here focuses on finding the best composite material
properties necessary for optimal structural performance. This program has
immediate application to diverse areas ranging from design of fuel efficient
transportation systems to the modeling of transport properties of biological
materials.
