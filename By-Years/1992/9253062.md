This unsolicited proposal from The Society for Advancement of Chicano's and
Native Americans (SACNAS) describes the 1992 San Antonio annual conference. The
SACNAS annual conferences are primarily designed to stimulate the interest of
underrepresented minority faculty to continue careers in the sciences and for
students to pursue doctorates in science and engineering. The conference has
components that are designed to increase the educational and professional
opportunities for faculty and students such as students sharing their research
through poster sessions and faculty presenting their research in culturally
relevant issues. These conferences serve as an important mechanism to strengthen
the national support network of individuals and institutions interested in
increasing the representation of minorities in the sciences and engineering. The
funding is requesting to support 78 students and faculty to attend the 1992
conference and to participate in a planning conference for a future symposium on
engineering. The invited faculty and students complete for the few allocated
slots available.
