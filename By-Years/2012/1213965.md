In this project funded by the Chemistry Division and the Office of
Multidisciplinary Activities of the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical
Sciences, Professors Lisa McElwee-White and Tim Anderson of the University of
Florida will work with Dr. Gary S. Silverman of Arkema Inc. on a vertically
integrated approach to developing chemistries for cost-effective and scalable
chemical vapor deposition of tungsten oxide injection layers for organic
optoelectronic devices. The researchers use mechanism-based precursor design
accompanied by computational chemistry tools to evaluate potential precursors
before synthesis. Synthesis of the precursors is followed by a rapid screening
process that sends only the most promising precursors to the film demonstration
step. Aalternative precursor delivery systems designed for all molecules
independent of volatility are also considered, thus including the full range of
possible precursors. Close collaboration with industry will facilitate process
development and optimization including reactor modeling, thus increasing the
likelihood of successful technology transfer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
brings together collaborators with complementary chemistry, chemical
engineering, materials and industrial process development expertise to address a
critical problem in the manufacture of organic optoelectronic devices. The
target application is OLED devices for general illumination, which have the
potential for significant energy savings. Through working on an
interdisciplinary project involving academic-industrial collaboration, students
will gain exposure to team-based training and problem solving skills that reach
outside their own disciplines of graduate study. Six-month internships at the
Arkema site will give students exposure to industrial practice that will broaden
their perspectives beyond academic research. In addition, participating faculty
will have the opportunity to integrate their added insight from industrial
collaboration into their courses.
