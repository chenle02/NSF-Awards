The objective of this faculty internship is to extend the current knowledge
base and technology involved in transitioning from the existing batch mode of
planning to real time planning of make-to-order printed circuit boards (PCBs).
The main concept behind this transition is that any event will be passed
directly to a server, which will be a continuously running scheduling processor,
instead of to a database. The schedules will be stored and updated utilizing an
efficient form of computer memory management termed bitmapping. Industrial
collaboration will allow the development and testing of a real time planning
algorithm using a Novell local area network (LAN) netware loadable module (NLM).
Testing will be based on planning knowledge from some of the major US PCB
manufacturers who are clients of the industrial sponsor and are currently using
the batch mode planning system.
