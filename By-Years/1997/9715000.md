This grant provides funds to support a workshop on ocean bottom seismology and
the future of this class of instrumentation. The meeting will be held at the
Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute in California. There are several goals
for the meeting which will bear upon the future of seafloor seismic
instrumentation and implementation. Current and new programs in seafloor
seismology must plan on a budget which will grow slowly, if at all. However,
imaginative schemes for supporting the development and construction of new
instruments must be considered. Currently, seafloor seismometer systems are
supported by a variety of research groups. Some questions the workshop attendees
must tackle include: How should these seafloor seismometers be managed in the
future to assure that scientists have full access for their individual program?
Is a PASSCAL model appropriate for ocean bottom seimometer management?
