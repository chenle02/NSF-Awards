The primary objective of this U.S.-Czechoslovakia cooperative research project
between Dr. Daniel Szyld of Duke University and Dr. Ivo Marek of Charles
University is to analyze the mathematical properties of pseudo-irreducible
operators and pseudo-primitive operators and to study their relevance to
solutions for singular linear systems. In particular, methods for computation of
stationary distributions of Markov processes will be examined. The researchers
hope that their collaborative study of properties of pseudo-primitive and
pseudo-irreducible operators will yield proof of a theorem similar to "THEOREM
A. An operator is convergent and irreducible if and only if it is primitive."
This project in applied mathematics fulfills the program objective of advancing
scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States and
Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool research resources in
areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
