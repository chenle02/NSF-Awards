SES-0961565&lt;br/&gt;Arthur Sakamoto&lt;br/&gt;University of Texas,
Austin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ChangHwan Kim&lt;br/&gt;University of
Kansas&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will provide insight into the nature
of rising inequality in the American labor force by investigating patterns of
labor market productivity and earnings differentials during the past several
decades. Using official data on employment, earnings, and productivity in
manufacturing industries, this investigation will study the extent to which
increased earnings inequalities are associated with improved productivity or,
conversely, may be simply aggrandizing the higher salaries of already privileged
employees with greater bargaining power which thereby depletes revenues for pay
raises among less advantaged workers. The findings will thus shed light on the
critical issue of whether rising inequality is necessary to avoid economic
stagnation or whether the decline of the middle-class is simply the result of
exacerbating salary differentials that do not commensurately promote economic
growth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the extent and sources of
underpayment and overpayment in the labor market will inform and advance public
policy debates about the efficacies of current programs and laws relating to the
regulation of the labor force. By identifying which specific groups of workers
are not fully compensated for their productivity (and which groups may be
significantly overpaid), the results will have important implications for such
issues as the minimum wage, the Earned Income Tax Credit, federal income tax
rates, industrial and trade policies, family-leave regulations, welfare reform,
affirmative action, civil rights law, and immigration legislation. &lt;br/&gt;
