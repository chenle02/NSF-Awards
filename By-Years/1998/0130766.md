Large-eddy simulation (LES) is increasingly used to analyze land-atmosphere
interactions at scales relevant to microscale and mesoscale meteorology. The
goal of this project is to improve the understanding of subgrid-scale (SGS)
motions - the turbulent velocity fluctuations too small to be resolved in LES
models, which must be accounted for by some kind of parameterization. The
approach is to use experimental data collected in the SGS2000 experiment,
conducted in the summer of 2000 in the San Joaquin Valley. The analysis will
employ novel ideas that have arisen from laboratory studies of turbulence. These
include new statistical-geometrical tools to quantify alignments between SGS
heat flux and temperature gradient vectors, the evaluation of spectral eddy
viscosities and eddy diffusivities from the data, and the study of coherent
structures such as sweeps and ejections. To extend the range of the scales that
can be analyzed, a new field experiment will be planned that combines an array
of hot-wire anemometers to measure the fine scales of turbulence with arrays of
sonic anemometers to measure the larger scales. Details of the experiment design
will depend on the outcome of the analysis of SGS2000 data. The field program
will be undertaken in collaboration with the Atmospheric Technology and the
Microscale and Mesoscale Meteorology Divisions of the National Center for
Atmospheric Research.
