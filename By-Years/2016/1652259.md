An increasing number of individuals, enterprises, and governments
&lt;br/&gt;migrate their data and applications to the cloud. Computations
delegated &lt;br/&gt;to the cloud may return erroneous results, outsourced files
may be lost &lt;br/&gt;or discarded, and sensitive information may be
arbitrarily accessed for &lt;br/&gt;advertising purposes. This project enhances
the ability of cloud companies &lt;br/&gt;to integrate advanced protection
mechanisms into their products, benefiting &lt;br/&gt;the online safety of cloud
clients. The project also aims to improve security &lt;br/&gt;education via new
undergraduate and graduate curriculum and outreach to high
school&lt;br/&gt;students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses
foundational problems on the security, availability, and &lt;br/&gt;privacy of
cloud computing by using an application-driven approach and demonstrates
&lt;br/&gt;the broad applicability of this theory in practice. The project
develops low bandwidth and&lt;br/&gt;sub-linear computation protocols for
securely recovering correct data blocks and computation &lt;br/&gt;results. The
researchers investigate practical and expressive privacy preserving
algorithms&lt;br/&gt;with reduced leakage profiles and low I/O complexity for
advanced queries on encrypted &lt;br/&gt;static and dynamic data. They also
develop new fundamental techniques for verifying &lt;br/&gt;frequently recurrent
classes of delegated computations&lt;br/&gt;
