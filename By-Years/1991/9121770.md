This project will critically analyze how the concept of sustainability functions
as a norm in three settings: within disciplines, as a social goal, and in
setting agricultural and development policy. The project is a multidisciplinary
effort involving a philosopher, a soil scientist, and an anthropologist. The
disciplinary orientations of agronomy and archeology will provide contrasting
scientific approaches to the study of sustainability. Examining how these two
disciplines compare and contrast in their approaches to the concept of
sustainability will provide a basis for understanding how sustainability
functions as a norm in disciplinary contexts. The principal investigator will
review events of the past decade to examine how sustainability has emerged as a
political norm nationally and internationally. The three collaborators will work
together to develop a strategy for integrating and constructing an approach to
sustainability that takes cognizance of both scientific and political norms, and
which uses ethical goals as a way of bridging disciplinary divisions that emerge
with respect to sustainability. They will compare alternative interpretations of
sustainability as a norm for research policy decision making, and analyze how
these norms are influenced by disciplinary interpretations and what social goals
the research policy norms are likely to achieve. Project results will be
disseminated through books, articles, and presentations at professional
associations and relevant meetings.
