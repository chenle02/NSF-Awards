In cooperation with industrial partner Amerigon, Inc., NeuroDyne, Inc., plans a
new thrust toward electric and hybrid vehicles. Previous work by NeuroDyne has
developed methods of identification and intelligent control, using artificial
neural networks (ANN) which are well adapted to work with vehicle systems. Part
of this effort (supported by NSF Grant ECS 9216530 `Reducing Pollution and
Increasing Fuel Economy Using Intelligent Control` through the University of
South Carolina) resulted in a rational scheme for identifying, with feedforward
neural networks, a class of nonlinear dynamic systems. The major problem to be
addressed is to apply the NeuroDyne identification methods to an electric energy
management system (EMS); the goal of the EMS is to optimize driving range by
budgeting power demands, while taking into account safety, driveability and
passenger comfort. An extension of this work is to provide ANN-based controls
for hybrid automobiles (fuel-burning engine plus batteries) taking into account
fuel economy, exhaust emissions, and efficiency.
