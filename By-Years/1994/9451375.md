Traditionally, software engineers have produced software products and then
passed them on to technical writers and other support staff who worked on the
information necessary to familiarize the end users with the software. Now,
however, market pressures have forced software developers to tailor their
products to a specific and well-defined niche market, deliver them in far less
time, and with far fewer defects than before. In such a market, neither
technical writers nor software engineers can afford the traditional, serial
development process. A team of planners, developers, testers, writers, and
marketing specialists must cooperate and collaborate in parallel in order to
meet these stringent market demands. To succeed, technical writers must follow
the lead of their counterparts in companies like IBM and Microsoft and
contribute to the development team before the system is delivered. The
Information Management in Software Engineering course seeks to enable students
to become information managers who not only contribute to the final product by
shaping the way it communicates with its audience but also who develop, manage,
and disseminate information the team needs to move forward in its process of
creating high-quality software. A key element in moving technical writing from
the serial-development paradigm to the parallel- cooperative-collaborative
paradigm is the equipment we request which allows writers to manage the large
volume of information generated by a software team, transform that information
into resources for the development team and instructional material for the end
user, and to deliver that information far faster than the traditional print
technology will allow.
