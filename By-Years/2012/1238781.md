This Research Initiation Award entitled - Modeling Inquiry Behaviors in Mobile
Learning Environments - has the goal to enhance the human computer interaction
(HCI) research program at Bowie State University by conducting research to model
inquiry behaviors in mobile learning environments, introducing HCI research into
the computer science curriculum, and supporting student development. This
research will produce a design framework that enables mobile learning
researchers to create environments that support sophisticated learner
interactions. The research seeks to extend the use of Intelligent Tutoring
Systems to include mobile learning environments that integrate new mobile
applications and media. The resulting models will advance the understanding of
human interaction with emerging technologies to benefit everyone interested in
modeling human interactions for learning or training
purposes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project seeks to model the behavior of users
engaged with mobile learning environments and explore children's ideas for novel
mobile learning environments. The two research questions to be answered are: 1)
Can inquiry behaviors and complex thinking in personalized mobile learning
environments be modeled? As users interact with technologies, they exhibit usage
patterns that can be used to create models of their behaviors and understanding
such behaviors is critical for making realistic learning environments. This
question seeks to understand how to both model and create meaning from these
interaction patterns. 2) How can advanced learning technologies extend and
support traditional instruction in ways that personalize instruction for various
learners? The use of children as design partners, via participatory design
sessions, will change their role from that of end user to designer and result in
mobile learning applications that extend beyond those commonly available in the
popular mobile application marketplaces.
