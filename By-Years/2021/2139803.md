The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) project is to enable innovations in wireless Internet-of-Things
(IoT), wearable sensors, and wearable products. Portable electric energy is a
key component in many technological devices. This project advances a
transformative technology that integrates energy capture, storage, and delivery
into a single device to advance the portability and utility of small electronic
devices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase II project proposes to overcome
two key challenges faced in wireless IoT, wearable, and electronic products:
battery life, and the costly inconvenience of frequently replacing batteries.
The project integrates advanced solar cell, supercapacitor, and power electronic
technologies into a single unit (Supercell) easily connected to electronic
loads. Design priorities include physical flexibility, wide operating
temperature range, heat management, ultra-low Equivalent Series Resistance and
leakage, high energy storage capacity, and good operating efficiency. The
approach pairs solar cell and supercapacitor technologies to work together, each
complementing the other. Advantages include size, weight, and installed lifetime
cost, when compared with single-use batteries, or with discrete solar cells. The
proposed work will accelerate adoption of IoT, wearable, and electronic
technologies by offering a better source of energy than field-replaceable
batteries or discrete solar cells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
