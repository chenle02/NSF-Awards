Growth, a fundamental process of all cells, is mediated by a specific
interaction between a hormone and its receptor at a specific cellular address.
In plants, growth is mediated by the specific interaction of the growth-
promoting hormone, auxin, and the auxin receptor, however, there is now
substantial evidence, although it is still indirect, that the auxin receptor and
its gene has been identified. There are several unique features of this
receptor, the most important is that most of it is found sequestered in a
cellular compartment. No other growth hormone receptor shares this properties
and it raises the question of the mechanism by which this receptor perceives
hormone on the outside of the cell and mediates growth. The following questions
are addressed in this proposal: Where in the tissue and cell is the auxin
receptor located and does this location change during cell development? Where is
the cellular site of auxin perception by the auxin receptor and is this
different than the location of the bulk of the receptor population? Does the
presence of the receptor correlate with auxin-induced growth capacity? In many
instances, growth in plants is limited by the abundance of the auxin receptor.
An understanding of how this limitation is regulated in the plant will lend
insight into how mankind can manipulate plant growth and crop yields.
