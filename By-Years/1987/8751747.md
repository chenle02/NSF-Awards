The main goals of the project are to build upon the excellent previous work
that has taken place at the Exploratorium which utilizes the resources of a
museum to offer enriching experiences to practicing teachers and develops models
of inservice programs. The plan in the proposed project is to work with 600
teachers at the middle school and high school levels from all of the school
districts in the greater San Francisco area. It is planned to emphasize
exploratory activities in physical science(70%) and mathematics(30%) by offering
the teachers an immersion into subject-oriented activities which they in turn
can adapt as possible experiences for their students. The model which is under
development consists of three basic stages. The first establishes small group
workshops which revolve around a curriculum suggested by the rich environment of
the Exploratorium exhibits. The second phase enables the teachers to learn to
use the Exploratorium as a resource center to enrich their learning and provide
a source of information and potential activities for their students as well as a
central location to share their ideas with their colleagues. The third phase in
the model develops a support mechanism for the teachers as they develop projects
and activities. The summer institute involves 100 teachers in groups of 12 to 14
working 80 hours over a four week period to focus activities on learning
extensions of subject matter content using the exhibits. The academic year
follow-up takes place during 6 Saturday morning sessions of 4 hours each and
involves 40 to 65 teachers per session. The focus during these sessions is on
the topics chosen by the teachers relating to potential topics to be covered in
the school program. There are to be special projects according to the particular
interests and needs of the teachers. For these projects ther teachers have
available to them the expert staff of the Exploratorium as well as the
facilities and materials that are resident there. The after school and Saturday
workshops occur at 12 meetings during the year for four hours each. It is
planned to arrange these in two blocks of six weeks each during which there is a
sharing of topics among the participants which encourages team teaching when
possible. The non-NSF cost sharing is approximately eighty-five percent of the
funded amount.
