Technology innovation is critical to the social welfare, health, economy, and
security of the USA and the world. A fundamental understating of innovation is
elusive. It can be observed, but it is hard to predict, and even harder to
execute. The difficulty in understanding and executing innovation rests in part
on the complexity of the technology ecosystem. For example, the invention and
development of Corning's Gorilla Glass supports the smartphone which in turn
synergizes with social media to drive new types of software development. At the
same time, observation of a single technology through time shows an evolutionary
improvement in performance. Compared to the first generation, current
smartphones store more photographs and operate longer without the need for
charging. This EArly-Concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) award
supports fundamental research to create a mathematical theory that describes
technology performance evolution and, simultaneously, ecological synergies
between technologies. The created theoretical model will have sufficient
fidelity and causal indicators such that one can predict and effect innovation.
This new theory will inform individual and enterprise-scale technology
innovation. Also, by knowing the impact and by predicting the evolution of new
technologies, policy makers can make sound investment and funding decisions for
key research initiatives. The enhanced understanding will also help public
policy officials develop appropriate regulations and incentive structures for
future technology development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technology ecosystem
model of technologies and their interaction is modeled using generalized Lotka-
Volterra (L-V) population models. The intellectual impact of this work includes
the extensions made to the general format of L-V equations to connect them to
microscale technology performance improvement (the improved performance of a
single technology). The microscale technology evolution model will follow
S-curve trends, but in fact be created with L-V equations. This general model of
technology evolution will be extended using theories from The Theory of
Inventive Problem Solving (TIPS). The hypothesis is that this multiscale,
hierarchical, L-V model will be able to capture the ecosystem type interaction
of engineered products and technologies as well as performance evolution.
