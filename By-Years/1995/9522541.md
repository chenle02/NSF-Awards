assessment, maintenance and design of civil infrastructure systems and their
role in the development of optimal methodologies for the intelligent renewal of
these systems. Research needs will be identified and prioritized. The documents
of this workshop will be widely distributed over the United States to ensure
transfer of engineering knowledge in the field of optimal performance of civil
infrastructure systems. This will enrich the bases of assessment and intelligent
renewal of the nation's civil infrastructure systems.
