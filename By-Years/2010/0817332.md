Engineering - Other (59)

The inability of incoming students to successfully advance past the traditional
freshman calculus sequence is a primary cause of attrition in engineering
programs. This project is transforming engineering mathematics education across
the nation, with the goal of increased student retention, motivation, and
success in engineering. A highly successful introductory engineering course was
developed at Wright State University with previous NSF funding and it is now
being adapted at partnering institutions on this project. The engineering
mathematics course includes lecture, laboratory, and recitation components with
content designed to satisfy prerequisites for a significant number of core
entry-level engineering and science courses. Students still complete their
required mathematics courses, but are now able to do so at a later time in the
curriculum while still making progress towards their degree. The research team
includes award-winning teachers and innovators in curriculum development at the
collaborating institutions. A total of 15 diverse institutions are adopting and
assessing aspects of the model course and are broadly reporting on their
findings.
