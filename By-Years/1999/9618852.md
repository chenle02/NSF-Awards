Abstract RODDIER, F. AST-9618852 This grant supports the upgrade of an adaptive
optics facility to be used with several of the telescopes on Mauna Kea. A 36
actuator adaptive mirror will replace the 13 actuator mirror of the prototype
system. The upgrade will also provide the system with a capability for using
infrared guide stars, a coronographic facility, and an infrared camera.
