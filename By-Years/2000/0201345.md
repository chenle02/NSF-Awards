Development and Application of 3D Measurement Methodologies at Reduced Length
Scales&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;The development and application
of measurement methodologies for quantitative determination of three-dimensional
surface deformations on planar or curved objects with spatial resolutions
extending to the nanometer scale is the focus of this research effort. A unique
aspect of the research is the emphasis on both 3D metrology and also the
development of methodologies applicable to generic imaging systems (e.g., SEM,
optical) for identification and accurate correction of complex image
distortions. Applications of the resulting methodologies will include studies of
local deformation behavior in (a) nano-structured materials, (b) micro-scale
tensile and bending tests of non-homogeneous materials and (c) this-film
blister/bulge specimens undergoing delamination.&lt;br/&gt;
