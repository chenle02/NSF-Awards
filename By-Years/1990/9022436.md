This research involves several areas of study using anodic oxidation for the
preparation of novel compounds, or compounds difficultly available via
conventional chemistry. First, the anodic oxidation of p-hydrogen and p-alkyl
anilides will be studied as a route to acylated quinone imine ketal and quinol
ethers. These compounds, which are not available from conventional routes, can
serve as key intermediates in organic synthesis. The second area, and major
emphasis of the work, is development of high-yield anodic carbon-carbon bond-
forming reactions. The initial studies will be directed at intramolecular
trapping of oxidized phenol intermediates with unsaturated linkages resulting in
carbon-carbon bond formation. The products obtained from 4-(2'-unsaturated-
aryl)-phenols are 2,5-cyclohexadienones which are important intermediates in
organic synthesis. The objectives are to understand how substituents on both the
aryl and phenol rings influence the yield of the anodic carbon-carbon bond-
forming reaction and utilize this knowledge for the efficient preparation of
useful compounds or intermediates. Another objective is to investigate the use
of the products obtained from these anodic oxidation studies in organic
synthesis. %%% With this award the Synthetic Organic Program of the Chemistry
Division will support the research of Dr. John S. Swenton of the Department of
Chemistry at Ohio State University. The research involves the study of anodic
oxidation chemistry for the preparation of novel compounds, or compounds
difficultly available via conventional chemistry. This approach using synthetic
electrochemistry is very timely since it serves as a reagentless method for
effecting oxidations, reductions, and carbon-carbon bond formation. With the
proper selection of electrode and experimental conditions, electrochemistry is
the environmental choice for conducting chemical transformations since there is
no spent oxidant or reductant to be disposed of or recycled after the reaction.
