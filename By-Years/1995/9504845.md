This award supports cooperative research between three U.S. researchers, Jerry
Bona at the Pennsylvania State University, Ohannes Karakashian at the University
of Tennessee, and William McKinney at North Carolina State University, and two
Greek researchers, George Akrivis at the University of Crete and Vassilios
Dougalis at the National Technical University in Athens. The collaboration will
occur at the Institute of Applied and Computational Mathematics (FORTH) in
Heraklion, Greece. The objective of the research concerns the numerical solution
of three types of partial differential equations that model various aspects of
wave propagation phenomena in nonlinear dispersive systems. The research is
concerned with the design and analysis of numerical schemes for the integration
of interesting and useful classes of nonlinear, dispersive wave equations. Such
numerical methods are crucially important for use in conjunction with laboratory
experiments and for the study of the detailed structure of solutions including
singularity formation. The project also includes implemen tation of the schemes
as computer codes and the use of these codes int he investigation of theoretical
and applied issues connected with this class of partial differential equations.
