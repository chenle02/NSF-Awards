The project will provide partial support to hold a Conference on Rock Magnetism
and its Applications,&lt;br/&gt;from June 21-24, 2012 in Santa Fe NM, continuing
a biennial series of such conferences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ultimate goal
of the Santa Fe Conference series is to help advance our understanding of
Earth's surface environment and its deep interior throughout in-depth and
interdisciplinary discussions of critical developments in paleomagnetism,
environmental (and bio) magnetism and rock magnetism. &lt;br/&gt;This year
emphasis of the meeting will be on the processing of iron in the biosphere and
its manifestations in magnetic records in sediments and extraterrestrial
materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Furthermore, this proposal will contribute to
the development of young scientists by providing the opportunity to meet and
interact with leading national and international researchers, gaining deeper
understanding and broader perspective of the field, and forming the basis for
future cross-disciplinary collaborations.
