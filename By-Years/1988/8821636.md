The American Geophysical Union (AGU) administers a block grant program to
support travel of US scientists in the 6th scientific assembly of the
International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy (IAGA). This Meeting will
be held in Exter, UK, July 24, to Aug 4, 1989. The IAGA is international forum
when scientists from many countries meet to discuss current problems in Aeronomy
and Geomagnetism. NSF has supported travel to there meetings in the past through
AGU. The block grant has been a successful program and well received by the US
scientific community. Many US scientists from various subfields: solar-
terrestrial, magnetospheric physics, aeronomy, earth sciences an atmospheric
science (including polar programs) will persuit their research results to
international community.
