Understanding, controlling, and harnessing increasingly complex many-body
quantum systems is an important frontier of science, and is essential for the
development of new materials and the advance of quantum information science.
Elucidating how microscale physics determines the macroscale behavior of quantum
systems is one of the grand, open questions of modern science and a physics
frontier. The Center for Ultracold Atoms (CUA) is a joint effort between the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University with the goal of
creating, controlling, and studying intentional complexity in quantum systems.
The CUA addresses this fundamental challenge in a collaborative and synergistic
manner, using systems where the properties and interactions of particles at the
microscopic scale are well understood, accurately quantified, and highly
controllable at the quantum level. The CUA will also advance education and
outreach with a broad portfolio of activities aimed at both the scientific
community and the general public. The core outreach program, EngageCUA, extends
participation in these activities to the whole CUA community.

The CUA research activities are divided into four major areas. The first area
focuses on quantum gases of atoms and molecules and aims at expanding control
over many-body systems in multiple directions, including long-range forces and
novel geometries (bilayer systems, frustrated lattices, gauge fields). The
second area is programmable arrays of Rydberg atoms and molecules. They will be
used to explore highly-entangled phases of matter, to perform fundamental
research on error correction, and to pursue new applications, e.g., to quantum
chemistry. The third area exploits atom-like and hybrid systems, including spin
defects and trapped electrons and excitons in two-dimensional geometries. These
solid-state systems will enable quantum simulations with strong interactions and
new applications in sensing and metrology. The fourth area focuses on strongly
coupled atoms and photons. The larger goal is to enable new capabilities for
engineering many-body states of atoms and photons, with applications in quantum
nonlinear optics, quantum metrology, and networking.
