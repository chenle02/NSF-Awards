This award provides continuing support for a program of research for the High
Energy Physics group at Vanderbilt University. This group proposes to exploit
the rich particle physics program at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) as members
of the CMS experiment. Since joining CMS in 2005, its established expertise in
electronics and silicon detectors, along with a long term interest in computing
and information technology, has enabled the members to make significant
contributions on the pixel tracker project and in Software and Computing,
respectively. They have also recently begun to contribute to Super-LHC design
studies as well as developing a physics analysis effort. On the pixel tracker,
they provide leadership in the operations and development of the Front End
Digitizer (FED), and have recently assumed a leadership role for the pixel slow
controls. For the software and computing project on CMS, their efforts are to
develop computing resources and grid infrastructure. Their successful
establishment of the ACCRE computing center at Vanderbilt and the NSF funded
REDDnet project are directly applicable to this effort. Finally, they are
contributing to design studies for the SLHC, studying the effectiveness of
various proposals to incorporate the pixel tracker into the first level of the
CMS trigger. In terms of broader impact, their collaborative efforts with
computer scientists are breaking new ground in the area of data logistics.
REDDnet is serving researchers from a wide variety of application domains,
including the geospatial imaging community, digital archive projects in the
Library of Congress, the fusion community, and high energy physics. Emphasis is
placed on involving undergraduate students in their research program and
reaching out to the community through the QuarkNet project.
