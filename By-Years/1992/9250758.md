A new laboratory provides juniors and seniors in Electrical Engineering
facilities for project design: modeling, prototyping, and testing in an
environment similar to that of an industrial research laboratory. Students have
the resources to complete significant projects and also become more familiar
with the environment they will encounter upon starting careers. The laboratory
includes: (1) student workbenches to provide immediate access to continuously
needed equipment (a networked PC, power supply, multimeter, oscilloscope, and
circuit board assembly tools); (2) mini-laboratories containing equipment
(printer, logic analyzer, counter, function generator, pulse generator, and
logic troubleshooting kit) often but not continually needed by each student; and
(3) computing resources served by a 486 PC networked to laboratory workbenches
and the university computer system. The laboratory equipment is supplemented by
a resource center including a component warehouse, a design library, and an
equipment pool.
