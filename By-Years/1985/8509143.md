This research is aimed at developing theoretical and experimental understanding
of the application of atmospheric optical communication links in local area
networks. In theoretical work to date, the use of a variable transmission-rate
atmospheric optical link to provide graceful network performance degradation in
the face of weather-induced optical link performance degradation has been
analyzed. In experimental work to date, development of an atmospheric optical
link/local area network test bed has been undertaken. This research will
continue the dual thrust of theoretical and experimental studies of atmospheric
optical communications in local area networks. The theoretical work will treat:
transport-layer job management procedures; topologies and control procedures for
combined atmospheric-optic/fiber-optic very high data rate networks; and optical
broadcast networks. The experimental work will concentrate on ring network
operation, featuring gateway interconnection of an atmospheric optical 2-node
network into a working ring network environment. Experimental work will also
begin on bus network applications.
