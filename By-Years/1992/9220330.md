This is a unit of DOE/NSF/USDA Collaborative Research in Plant Biology Program.
The theme of the interdisciplinary research training group is root biology, and
is designed to nurture a group of innovative and creative scientists capable of
developing and utilizing an interdisciplinary team approach to plant biology.
The three major focus areas include root ecology, root biochemistry and
root/organism interactions. The group involves 13 faculty members all interested
in various aspects of root biology from root growth, plant nutrition and
nitrogen fixation to soil chemistry/physics. Research training involves training
of graduate students, postdocs, a seminar series, retreats, an international
symposium, and internships in private and government facilities. Outreach
activities include mentoring gifted high school students and professional
improvement of high school teachers. The investigators hope to develop this
group into a inter-departmental center for root biology at Penn State
University.
