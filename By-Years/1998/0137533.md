0137533/Lelong&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project uses direct numerical
simulation to look at the effectiveness of internal gravity wave radiation from
rapidly varying almost geostrophic currents. The primary scientific motivation
is to determine to what degree such a process could explain the background level
of internal wave radiation in the ocean, away from boundaries. The work is
guided both by observations of high internal wave energy near oceanic fronts and
by numerical studies of the radiation of gravity waves during the life cycle of
baroclinic eddies in the atmosphere. The approach consists of using two types of
numerical models, a hydrostatic isopycnal model (HIM) and a non-hydrostatic
Navier-Stokes solver (S-FIT), at high spatial resolution to examine the
nonlinear evolution of instabilities on a baroclinic jet. The project includes
the use of a novel diagnostic tool for separating the internal wave component. A
balanced model will be used to invert the potential vorticity field. The
resulting balanced vortical flow will then be subtracted from the full
flow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
