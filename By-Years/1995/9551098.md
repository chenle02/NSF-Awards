Through this grant, the development of a Multimedia-Based Computer- Assisted
Learning Laboratory (MCALL) is used as a pilot project to improve the
educational quality of undergraduates in science programs. The new lab can
achieve the following educational objectives: (1) improve instruction and
learning in biology, chemistry, physics, and computer science, (2) develop
advanced skilled students in the area of multimedia, networking, and Graphical
User Interface (GUI), and (3) train faculty to do computer-assisted teaching.
The lab, MCALL, is being equipped with networked multimedia computer systems
loaded with computer-assisted learning software. It serves a selective group of
undergraduate students in biology, chemistry, physics, and computer science.
