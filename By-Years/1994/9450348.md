SSC-9450348 Cal State L.A. Univ. Los Angeles, CA Cobb, Jewel "Residential
Intensive Math and Science Academy" Residential Intensive Math and Science
Academy (RIMSA) is a 4-week residential program aimed at underrepresented
seventh grade students in Los Angeles. The Academy will serve 50 students by
offering math, science, computers and expressive writing for curricular
enrichment. Academic monitoring and follow-up will occur through 8 Saturday
Academy sessions. The program will offer an intensive experience for students
who attend school on year- round calendars and cannot participate in a
traditional summer program. The curricular focus will be mathematics, scientific
inquiry, hands-on science, computer application, and creative expression.
Students will be recruited primarily from ACCESS Center pipeline schools
representing low SES minority student populations. Faculty will be recruited
from math, science and/or equivalent Education and computer science departments
at CSU Los Angeles and schools in the ACCESS pipeline. A Program Director also
serving as the outreach coordinator will administer the program and ensure
active parent participation. ***
