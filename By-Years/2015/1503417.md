This award facilitates the participation of US scientists working in
gravitational physics in the 14th Marcel Grossmann meeting on recent
developments in theoretical and experimental general relativity, astrophysics
and relativistic field theories, to be held in Rome from July 12-18, 2015. The
Marcel Grossmann meeting is one of the two main international conferences in
gravitation. It is organized every three years and is attended by approximately
500-1000 participants from all over the world. This award provides travel
support to the most deserving participants from the US. The award will be
shared, giving priority to participants with accepted abstracts for oral
presentations and junior participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A panel comprised of
theoreticians and experimentalists in gravitational physics will be convened to
evaluate applications for travel support from qualified candidates from the US.
Priority will be given to participants with accepted talk abstracts and to
researchers with either no or reduced NSF funding. The panel will decide on the
number of awards depending on the quality and quantity of applications received.
