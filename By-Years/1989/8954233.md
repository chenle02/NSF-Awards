Activities in this project are combined with existing programs at Purdue
University to develop a Minority Engineering Comprehensive Career Academy
(MECCA) for Black American, Mexican American, Puerto Rican and American Indian
students. The new activities are directed toward two "missing links" in the
total Program--an Elementary School Out-Reach Program and an Undergraduate
Engineering Retention Program. The Elementary School Out-Reach Program is aimed
at students, their parents, teachers, alumni, community leaders, industry groups
and consortiums located in geographic areas surrounding the target participants.
The Undergraduate Retention Program actively involves minority students enrolled
in the Purdue Schools of Engineering by adding structured courses to the
sophomore and junior year. These will focus on professional school engineering
core courses designed to aid the student in making a successful transition from
the generic freshman engineering curriculum to the first level of engineering
courses specific to their major.
