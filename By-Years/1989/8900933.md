Man's understanding of his global environment increases with each advance in
his ability to measure its properties. In particular, knowledge of photochemical
transformations in the earth's atmosphere and of the wide array of chemical
processes occurring in both remote and urban areas has developed in conjunction
with research quality instrumentation capable of probing the composition of the
atmosphere with increasingly greater resolution. Several gases present at one
part in a billion or trillion play important and often crucial roles in chemical
or radiative processes in the atmosphere. In this project, a new and evolving
experimental technique will be extended and applied to the measurement of
important atmospheric gases. The technique involves the use of fixed frequency
infrared gas lasers with frequency modulation methods. A major advance expected
from this work is a laser absorption detection instrument with high sensitivity
that uses a simple laser system, thus providing the versatility, affordability,
sensitivity, and ruggedness necessary for extensive field measurements.
Development of the instrument will be directed at the measurement of hydrogen
peroxide and methane. The technique has potential for application to other
atmospheric gases since several species are likely to have absorption in the
infrared that can be probed by the gas laser system.
