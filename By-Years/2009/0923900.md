This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to develop
a family of products that will facilitate two-way CAM/CNC integration and First
Part Correct technology through: 1) Predictive tool wear monitoring, 2)
Intelligent cutting speed (feed) selection, 3) CAM/CNC Integration. The solution
integrates the above technologies, monitoring the in situ tool forces and tool
wear and using the intelligent feed rate adaptor to modify the cutting process
for optimum performance even as the tool wears.

Manufacturing is a global enterprise and, as well documented, much is now done
outside the US. But this is not a foregone conclusion. The US remains the
largest global consumer. Internally US manufacturing has a geographic advantage
with lower freight cost and just-in-time delivery requirements. If successful,
the technology developed in this project could make a significant positive
impact on US manufacturing moving forward. Other broader impacts include
graduate students who will be exposed to research of immediate interest to
industry.
