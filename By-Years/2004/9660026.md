*** 96-60026 Higgins This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project will explore a novel process for economical synthesis of inorganic
nanoparticles via microemulsion synthesis, which can be scaled readily to
industrial-scale production. There are many methods for creation of nano-sized
particles, but most synthetic techniques for nanoparticle production have rather
limited potential for scale-up to manufacturing scale due to high capital costs,
intrinsically low production rates, need for exotic/expensive precursor
materials, limited applicability to many chemical compositions, and/or
inadequate control over nanoparticle chemical and physical homogeneity. Phase I
will study the use of water-in-oil microemulsions as "nano-reactors," a
technique which has been used at a bench-scale to prepare nanoparticles in a
number of chemical compositions using inexpensive equipment and precursors. This
method of nanoparticle synthesis is thought to be free of the above limitations
and to avoid a need in nanopowder manufacture to separate and recycle most of
the microemulsion components for re-use. Commercial application of this process
is expected to enhance production of inorganic nanoparticles for use in
catalysis, structural materials, and microelectronic, photonic, and optical
devices. ***
