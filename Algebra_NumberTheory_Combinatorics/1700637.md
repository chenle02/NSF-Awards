This award supports the principal investigator's research on the theory of
automorphic forms, a special topic in the general area of number theory. Number
theory has its historical roots in the study of natural numbers. It is among the
oldest branches of mathematics. Within the last half century it has become an
indispensable tool, with diverse applications in areas such as data transmission
and processing, communication systems, and internet security. In more detail,
the project centers on the theory of automorphic forms. The main goal of the
project is to develop the automorphic descent method, which provides
construction of automorphic forms on classical groups. The PI will establish
identities relating the constructed automorphic forms to the data used in the
descent construction. The PI will also investigate the application of these
identities to a quantitative refinement of the Gan-Gross-Prasad conjecture,
which is a conjecture that can be viewed as a far-reaching local to global
principle for period integrals.
