Animals use a variety of signals to communicate with each other, and evolution
has resulted in an enormous diversity of species-specific recognition
mechanisms. Species recognition is critical, especially in mating, because
mistakes can result in loss of reproductive effort, or (in the case of predatory
animals) even death. This research concerns the question of how animals
recognize members of their own species and discriminate them from other species
using visual signals during courtship and mating. A newly developed video
imaging technique will be used to understand how visual signals function in the
mating process of wolf spiders, and how differences between species evolve.
Because spiders are potentially cannibalistic, species recognition mechanisms
are critical to survival as well as reproductive success. As a consequence,
recognition is innate and based on simple behavioral cues. In the planned
experiments, visual signals of courting males (body ornaments and behaviors)
will be altered using computer digitization and video animation, then presented
to female spiders on microtelevision screens. Responses of females to video
images of their own species and those of other species, and combinations of
video images with audio recordings of spider courtship vibration "songs", will
test hypotheses about the cues involved in species recognition. Results of this
research will allow a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in species
recognition in animals. This research will also contribute to the growing
knowledge about spiders, an ecologically important group of invertebrate
predators whose basic biology is less known than other taxa. Additionally, this
research involves the continuing development of a computer-assisted technique
for studying behavior which may be applicable to other species and research
questions in animal behavior (mate choice, agonistic behavior, visual
perception, neuroethology) and other fields (image recogn ition, artificial
intelligence).
