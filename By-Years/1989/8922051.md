The processes that cause meteorite specimens to accumulate on ice fields are now
understood based on research in Antarctica. The conditions which promote the
accumulation of meteorites and other extraterrestrial objects on the East
Antarctica ice sheet may also exist in northern Greenland. The objective of this
investigation is to verify that meteorite specimens may have accumulated near
the margin of the ice sheet in northern Greenland. The study will include: (1)
an examination of published reports and aerial photographs, and (2) visual
inspection of the ice sheet adjacent to Peary Land, Washington Land, and
Inglefield Land. The visual inspection will be done from a suitable Air National
Guard aircraft flying out of the Thule A. B. in northern Greenland. The results
of this reconnaissance flight, combined with insights obtained from aerial
photographs and reports will be used in the future to design a field program at
a selected site in the ice sheet of northern Greenland to verify the existence
of subglacial bedrock ridges in northern Greenland and to recover meteorite
specimens that have accumulated in its surface.
