The project advances the state-of-the-art of various robotics fields, including
home health care robotics, robot mechanisms and kinematics, visual servoing,
modeling and analysis, estimation and control, search and tracking, and
localization and mapping. In addition, the integration of these technologies and
its demonstration provides an opportunity to verify the capabilities and
limitations of the state-of-the-art technologies, discovering new subsequent
robotics problems to tackle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the
fundamental aspects relevant to many scientific and engineering applications and
includes experimental demonstrations, and broadly impacts teaching, training and
education. Further, the international collaboration provides graduate students
who reside in the rural Southside Virginia opportunities to observe scientific,
cultural and political similarities and differences between countries and
encourages them to continue their efforts toward research, and to establish an
international community of home health care robotics. The project contributes to
the modernization of the engineering curriculum in general and the teaching of
mobile robotics in particular.
