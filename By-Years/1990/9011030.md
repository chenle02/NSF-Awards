A major ecologically important group of marine animals are the jellyfish, or
cnidarians. They form a major part of the drifting animals living near the ocean
surface, and different species show different selection of prey animals on which
they feed. Jellyfish capture their prey animals by using the stinging cells
(cnidocytes) in the tentacles only when the prey comes into contact with the
jellyfish. So the observed selective feeding on either fish or crustaceans
requires some sensory mechanism for the jellyfish to distinguish prey. This
study will use modern neurophysiological techniques of patch-clamping on the
stinging cells, and address the important question of whether there is some
chemosensory regulation of release of the stingers. The impact of this Career
Advancement Award will enhance Dr. Jennifer Purcell's career capability
significantly, and results will be important to chemosensory science, animal
behavior, neurobiology, and marine biology.
