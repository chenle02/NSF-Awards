Research in relativistic heavy ions will be carried out making use of the
Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL).
The research will include development of a specialized detector known as PHOBOS
for use at RHIC. PHOBOS will provide a first look at the behavior and decay of
matter at the extreme energy densities that will be created in gold-on-gold
collisions with energies of 100GeV/nucleon in the center-of-mass system. This
work is aimed at characterizing the hypothesized quark-gluon plasma which is
created in such energies collisions, and in which quarks and gluons are thought
to be deconfined, unlike the case in normal hadronic matter. In addition,
research will be carried out at the BNL Alternating Gradient Synchrotron
facility. This experiment will probe the dynamics of hadron-hadron interactions
at lower energies than RHIC, where the details of the interactions are better
understood and where improved understanding will permit needed extrapolations of
the behavior of ordinary hadronic matter of RHIC energies. These data will
extend our knowledge of matter to energies and densities thought to have existed
only in the first microseconds of the early universe. This topic is a high
priority within US nuclear science, as established by the joint NSF/DOE Nuclear
Science Advisory Committee in its 1996 Long Range Plan. Education of students
and postdocs is a strong component of this experimental program.
