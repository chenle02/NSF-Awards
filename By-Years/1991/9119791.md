It is proposed to develop a global eddy-resolving thermodynamic ocean
circulation model using state of the art computational methods. This model
describes the wind-driven and upper ocean thermohaline circulations but not the
overturning "conveyor-belt" thermohaline circulation. The results of the
numerical computations will be made available to the oceanographic community for
further analysis and comparison with field data.
