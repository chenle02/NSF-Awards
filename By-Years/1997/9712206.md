Salters 9712206 During this project the investigators will determine the Nd
isotopic composition in abyssal peridotites from the Atlantis II fracture zone
and from the 11-17 degrees east location on the Southwest Indian Ridge. This
work will involve obtaining clinopyroxene mineral separates from abyssal
periodtites, then determining the Nd isotopic compositions. The purpose of this
study is to use the isotopic compositions to determine whether pyroxenitic
sources contribute to the production of mid-ocean ridge basalts and mantle plume
signatures.
