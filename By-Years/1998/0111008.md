Bruce Johnson of Rice University is supported by the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to develop and apply multiscale wavelet methods
in quantum calculations. Wavelets provide the multiresolution approach that will
be brought to bear on chemical applications where either electronic or nuclear
motions take place on more than one scale. This characteristic challenges
conventional quantum basis-set and grid-based methods over and above their
limitations as far as the number of coupled degrees of freedom that can
currently be accommodated. Applications to recent dissociative resonance Raman
spectroscopy (DRRS) experiments on nitrosyl chloride and ongoing experiments on
ozone will be the focus of the initial wavelet-Schrodinger calculations.
Solution to the technical challenges and the development of freely-distributable
code are expected to lead to novel outcomes which will be of use in other
numerical and engineering wavelet applications.

Wavelet methods have found much use in digital signal processing, and have much
unrealized potential for application to complex chemical problems. Along with
improving the understanding of fundamental chemical dynamics, outcomes from this
effort could have signal processing impacts in areas such as magnetic resonance
spectroscopy. The computer software developed in this project will be made
freely available and is expected to be useful for engineering and other
applications.
