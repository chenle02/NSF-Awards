The 115 foot WEATHERBIRD II was purchased and partially refitted as a research
vessel in 1989 with private funds by the Bermuda Biological Station for
Research, Inc. It replaced a smaller, less capable research vessel. This project
will supply funds for the ship's continued conversion into a more capable
research vessel. Funds will be used to add a deck house for laboratories,
install a bow thruster of improved maneuverability, convert unused voids into
additional state rooms and improve habitability. The project will be under the
direction of Howard S. Barnes, Assistant Director for Operations. He is fully
qualified to direct this project having considerable experience in similar work
including direction of the earlier refit.
