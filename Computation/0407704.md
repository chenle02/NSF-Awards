The overall goal of this project is the study of critical regularity associated
with different nonlinear balance laws. We focus on borderline cases, of interest
in various applications, where intrinsic features of the solutions such as
smoothness vs. generic finite-time breakdown, time decay, etc., hinge on a
delicate balance between nonlinear convection and a variety of (possibly
nonlinear) forcing mechanisms. Often this balance is maintained by global
invariants of the flow. These include spectral invariants, which in turn lead to
critical threshold phenomena, or borderline invariant regularity spaces. A main
focal topic of this project is the study of balance laws governed by Eulerian
dynamics. Such models show up in different contexts dictated by different
forcing. Previous research developed a precise framework for studying the
critical threshold phenomena for such Eulerian dynamics. Here we seek extensions
to include more realistic models driven by global and non-isotropic forcing. In
particular, this project investigates global regularity for multidimensional
Euler-Poisson equations with sub-critical initial data and persistence of
minimal regularity for Euler and Navier-Stokes equations with initial
configurations in borderline regularity spaces.

This research project pursues the development of mathematical tools for the
understanding of fundamental properties of fluid flow and other dynamical
processes. The results will have potential application for the modeling and
numerical simulation of a variety of physical phenomena, including the turbulent
flow of fluids, that are governed by the type of partial differential equations
under study.
