Trapido-Rosenthal/02-43762&lt;br/&gt;This award provides renewed funding for a
summer internship program at the Bermuda Biological Station for Research (BBSR).
This program has been active since 1991. BBSR brings eight undergraduate
students to Bermuda to conduct independent research projects within the
framework of ongoing oceanography and marine biology research programs. It is
one of two OCE-funded REU sites that is conducted during the regular academic
year, bringing students to BBSR for three months in the Fall. The students also
participate in a series of lectures, formal and informal seminars, fieldtrips,
and an oceanographic cruise. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
