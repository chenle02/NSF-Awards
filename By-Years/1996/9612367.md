9630780 Stitt Certain Escherichia coli that contain a mutated transcription
termination factor Rho exhibit faster messenger RNA degradation rates and
drastically reduce gene expression of infecting T4 bacteriophage. These
phenotypes suggest a novel function for Rho in message degradation. An in vivo
message degradation system will be used to compare the rate and pattern of
degradation of specific mRNAs in wild type and rho(nusD) mutant cell extracts.
Experiments will be performed to distinguish between two hypotheses to explain
the altered message turnover: increased nuclease activity and increased message
susceptibility to nucleases. In particular, Rho will be tested for a proposed
role in the protection of RNA from degradation. Two means of overcoming the
effects of the rho mutation have been found. First, spontaneous mutants in a new
T4 gene, goF, restore the ability of T4 to grow in rho mutant cells. Second,
introduction of the plasmid pBR322 into the rho mutant cells also renders them
permissive for T4 growth. The rop gene of pBR322 has been found to be
responsible for this phenotypic reversal, and the Rop protein is the critical
molecule. Expression of either Rop or GoF1 in E. coli lengthens mRNA lifetimes,
restoring those in rho(nusD) mutant cells to normal values and lengthening those
in rho+ cells. The in vitro message degradation system will be used to determine
the effects of Rop and GoFl on message turnover. Affinity chromatography and gel
shift techniques will be used to identify interacting molecules in this system.
The proposed work will characterize new and previously unsuspected roles for
transcription termination factor Rho and pBR322 Rop in the control of mRNA
degradation. ***
