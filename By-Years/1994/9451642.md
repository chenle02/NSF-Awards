9451642 Grodzinsky Undergraduate electrical and computer engineering students
often study electronic systems as being either analog or digital in nature. This
does not match the industrial reality where virtually all systems have both
analog and digital subsystems. It is the purpose of this project to provide this
experience by creating a new capstone electronics laboratory which emphasizes
"mixed signal" engineering. Ten experiment stations that include a 486 PC
platform, on which the design and simulation tools will run, and a modular plug-
in box are being established. The digital subsystem is being implemented with a
field programmable gate array (FPGA). Analog subsystems are being designed on PC
cards which plug into the modular box containing the FPGA and its socket, power
supply and connectors. This configuration helps to reduce the circuit
construction time and allows the student to concentrate on electronic design,
circuit simulation and debugging.
