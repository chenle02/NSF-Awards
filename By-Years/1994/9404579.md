9404579 Venkatesan Technical abstract: Focus will be on the study of electric-
field effects in high Tc superconducting thin films, a topic closely related to
the development of three-terminal superconducting devices. The objective is to
obtain a comprehensive assessment of the prospects for high Tc
Supercccconducting Field-Effect Transistors (SuFET). Based on the existing data,
two material problems have been identified as the limiting factors for the
current device performance: the quality of the SrTiO3 (STO) dielectric layer and
the quality of YBCO ultrathin films. In support of the project objective, work
will be done in these two directions to improve the device properties. In
addition to the study and optimization of the device characteristics experiments
on unique SuFET applications, such as in SQUID circuits and microwave resonators
will be continued and also extended to new device concepts. At the same time,
the basic study of the physics of field effects in high Tc superconductors will
continue. Non-technical abstract: The aim of the program is to investigate the
effect of electric fields on the properties of the high temperature
superconductors. It has been shown that by use of electric fields the transition
temperature and the maximum current carrying ability of superconductors can be
modified. Thus, one may be able to design novel devices where the device
properties are modified by the use of electric fields. In order to understand
the science as well as the full device potential of this phenomenon it is
essential to fabricate high quality thin film based structures. One of the goals
of this program is to understand and optimize the materials growth process. It
is expected that a better understanding for the potential of three terminal
superconducting devices will emerge from this program. ***
