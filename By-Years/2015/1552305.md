The intellectual merit of this proposal is that this program allows highly
educated scientists and engineers to acquire real-life research experience and
to bring the latest innovative theories and techniques from the academic
community o the country?s entrepreneurial technology sector. By working in a
cutting-edge laboratory where research and development are accomplished within a
framework of expected business outcomes and business constraints, researchers
learn to work in multidisciplinary teams and to apply their academic expertise
to the important work of product development and application in a globally
competitive environment. The small businesses benefit from the fresh insights
and most current technological skills and training that the recent postdoctoral
students would bring. The program puts those skills and that training to work at
creative and inventive research companies which otherwise would not be able to
afford such expertise. These pairings would provide active SBIR Phase II
companies the opportunity to enhance innovative collaboration, strengthen
scientific rigor, and quicken the pace of technological breakthrough. Fellows
are also encouraged to publish their work within the overall publishing
guidelines set by each participating
company.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this program is
to broaden participation of underrepresented groups such as women,
African&lt;br/&gt;Americans, Hispanic Americans, American Indians, and
Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders in small high-tech companies supported by the NSF
SBIR/STTR program. ASEE has proposed stronger outreach strategies than
implemented in the current grant to increase visibility and diversity by
reaching out to institutions that supply a high number of candidates from
underrepresented demographic groups. ASEE is strengthening its outreach by
attending postdoctoral and professional organizational conferences that
typically target women and underrepresented groups in STEM fields and by having
a proactive presence in social media.
