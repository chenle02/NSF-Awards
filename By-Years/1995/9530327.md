9530327 Willis This award provides funding to purchase shipboard instrumentation
in support of NSF-funded research. The instruments will be used aboard the R/V
WECOMA, a 177 foot vessel, which is owned by NSF and operated by the University.
Instrumentation funded includes a portable salinometer, 5-liter Niskin samplers,
an ARGOS PTT receiver, a dewpoint hygrometer, an optical rain gauge, and a core
splitter. The instrumentation is requested for support of NSF-funded cruises
aboard the WECOMA during 1996 and will enhance the scientific capability of the
vessel in the future. ***
