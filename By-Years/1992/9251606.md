Automated methods of processing geographic data is typically introduced in the
undergraduate curriculum after manual methods of map design, construction
analysis are taught. This project will provide the fundamental computer
processing equipment for introducing automated drafting and analysis of maps and
image interpretation methods in both introductory and advanced geographic
methods courses, and offer an environment for stimulating student creativity in
exploiting automated processing and display methods. Introducing automated
methods of designing and drafting maps and analyzing geographic data in
introductory cartography and aerial photo interpretation courses is a radical
departure from the traditional first stage instruction using manual methods. A
novel feature of the project involves independent student research projects that
specifically focus on the development of software for use in several other
laboratories.
