The approach of this Career Research Project is to apply weak classifiers in
machine learning systems to produce better learning rules. Weak classifiers are
those that do not allow correct concept identification all the time, but that
work better than random guesses. Alone, they are not good enough for
applications, but in combinations, they may be useful. There are two major
considerations - efficiency of learning and generalization error. Within this
approach, the goal of this research is to rigorously investigate the fundamental
problems of learning systems in supervised learning performance and efficiency
(2) to apply adaptive learning machines to intelligent network management.
