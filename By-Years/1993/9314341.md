9314341 Gallager The primary goal of the research is to develop a cohesive
theory and set of insights for wireless multiaccess communication. Attention
will be restricted to cellular type systems in which mobile or stationary users
communicate over a multipath fading environment with fixed stations that are
interconnected by wire. In the current struggle for dominance among various
approach are based on the capabilities of currently developed systems. To
provide a better guide for future systems, there is a need for a more cohesive
structure that exhibits the fundamental limitations on the different approaches.
The main thrusts of this investigation will focus on multiple access information
theory and detection theory for fading channels, random access communication,
and spread spectrum and other modulation techniques. Important topics within
each of these thrusts will be power control, the use of multiple antennas,
forward error correction, and the adaptation to varying channel conditions. ***
