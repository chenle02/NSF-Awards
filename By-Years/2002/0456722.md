BARBARA&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers funded under this grant will use
analytical and computational tools to investigate and document the instability
of two miscible fluids at low Re with annular stratification of density and
viscosity in vertical and inclined tubes. Recent research has revealed the
surprising result that miscible fluids, in contrast to their immiscible
counterparts, are unstable according to linear stability analysis. This raises
fundamental questions regarding the relationship between miscible and immiscible
interfacial fluid dynamics, which are often assumed to display corresponding
instabilities. Preliminary investigations of linear stability will be continued
under this grant, and direct numerical simulation (DNS) studies will explore
nonlinear instability. The merit of the proposed work is its investigation of
this recently identified and potentially important instability of fundamental
interest in fluid mechanics. The ability to predict behavior of variable
viscosity and density miscible fluid flows is important for a host of processes
in the chemical, pharmaceutical and oil industries. Low Reynolds number flows
are particularly relevant to microfluidics applications in the biomedical and
space areas. Students involved in this research will benefit by their
participation with an ongoing NSF IGERT program in Computational Science and
Engineering at UCSB. The PI's service at Prairie View A&amp;M University gives
strong evidence of a commitment to diversity in graduate student recruitment and
education. The active involvement of foreign exchange students in research will
enhance dissemination of the work. &lt;br/&gt;
