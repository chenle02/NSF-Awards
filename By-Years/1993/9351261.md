9351261 Ghiorso This project is transferring software technology, developed for
research in the geological sciences, into the curriculum for undergraduate
geology majors. Six "advanced" computer workstations are being used in
computationally oriented undergraduate laboratory classes. These workstations
have extensive disk and memory resources, are capable of running a multi-user
operating system (e.g. UNIX), and are being configured with sophisticated
graphical display components. In addition, an overhead projector panel is being
used in conjunction with the advanced workstations. The panel is facilitating
the integration of workstation displays into moderate size (50 student) classes.
This project is resulting in new course offerings and is changing significantly
the nature of laboratory instruction in the department of Geological Sciences.
