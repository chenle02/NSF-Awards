This award is for the support of the third joint workshop of Task Committee D
(Wind Engineering) of the U.S.-Japan Cooperative Program on Natural Resources
(UJNR). This workshop is an ongoing effort of the UJNR Panel on Wind and Seismic
Effects to bring together U.S. and Japanese researchers from academic
institutions, government laboratories and industry to discuss the state-of-the-
art of wind effects on civil engineering structures and develop strategies and
collaborative efforts that will benefit both countries. The theme of this
workshop is "Reducing Losses from Wind: Collaborative Opportunities for the 21st
Century" and it will be held in Seattle, U.S. on October 2-5, 2002. The purpose
of this workshop is to (a) discuss previous collaborative research efforts, (b)
continue mutual exchange of technical information on ongoing research, (c)
identify collaborative opportunities for the 21st century and develop strategic
planning that will benefit both the countries, (d) identify specific projects
for collaborative research, and (e) visit selected sites in the Seattle area
related to wind effects on structures.
