The Albany Conversations provide a venue for an intellectually challenging
debate of topics of current interest in structural biology. The sessions dealing
with cryo-electron microscopy and protein dynamics in the living cytoplasm will
emphasize recent technological breakthroughs in structural biology. Lectures by
young researchers (graduate students, post-doctoral fellows and starting
faculty) will be based on selection from abstracts submitted for poster
presentation.

The Albany Conversations will include about 400 participants, over 200 posters,
and ~85 oral presentations, about one third of which will be selected from the
posters. Out of all the talks, at least 34-36 will be delivered by female
scientists. The final program will contain a socially responsible mix of men and
women with wide ethnic origin. All presenters are expected to stay during most
of the conference, eat at the community tables and be available for interactions
with junior and senior colleagues.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
