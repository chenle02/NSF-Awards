9510612 Reinholtz This Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry
award will support a graduate student and a fraction of a faculty member's time
to work on a collaborative project between Virginia Tech and B&amp;W Nuclear
Technologies. The project will use different modes of motion control for hand-
to-eye coordination of an industrial robot. Vision will be the major form of
feedback for this control problem. This is an attractive approach for B&amp;W 's
application. Robots service steam generators where space and access are limited,
but the applications call for motion on the order of +/-0.5 mm with a payload of
65 kg. B&amp;W will provide in-kind support by committing the equipment,
technical support and software for the research. The results from this
collaboration will allow better maneuverability and safety in monitoring major
components of power generating plants. The technology is also applicable where
remote operation in confined spaces and hazardous areas is needed. ***
