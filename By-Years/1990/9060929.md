Real-time recognition of speaker-independent connected speech has proven to be a
difficult problem for electronic systems. Low-precision highly-parallel analog
neural networks have been shown to recognize speaker-dependent small- vocabulary
connected speech using standard components. This project will research and
develop massively-parallel custom integrated circuits that will perform this
task, using integrated delay lines and analog computing networks. Phase I will
include the design and fabrication of test chips to prove the feasibility of our
development. The approach will utilize standard readily available CMOS Bulk
integrated circuit technology so products arising from this research can be
fabricated reliably and economically by a number of vendors. The P.I. has
already demonstrated using this technology to fabricate continuous-time analog
computing networks and non-linear decision circuits. He have also shown the
feasibility of using floating-nodes to provide non-volatile storage of analog
voltages. These voltages can be used to control the operation of the chip thus
implementing the capability to learn or be trained in the field. This proposed
research addresses the challenging and important problem of real-time speech
recognition and may lead directly to inexpensive products with wide commercial
applicability.
