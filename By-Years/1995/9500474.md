9500474 Draayer This Americas Program award will support Professor Jerry Draayer
of Louisiana State University in a research collaboration with Professor Jorge
Hirsch of the Centro de Investigacion y de Estudios Avanzados del Instituto
Politecnico Nacional (CINVESTAV- IPN) in Mexico City. The investigators intend
to carry out computer shell-model calculations in heavy, strongly-deformed
nuclei with particular interest in the determination of double beta decay rates.
Ultimately, the researchers intend to obtain a better understanding of the role
pairing correlations play in deformed nuclei and how they can best be
incorporated into an expanded geometrical collective model. Through this
research, the investigators hope to develop and apply versatile and exportable
SU(3)-based shell model code that can be used to study problems of both a
general and fundamental nature, and to broaden and expand links between strong
research groups in both countries. ***
