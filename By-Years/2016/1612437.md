The geometric structure that lies behind classical Newtonian mechanics is called
symplectic geometry, where the coordinates of position and momentum, along with
the conservation laws of mechanics, are modeled in even-dimensional geometries
with distinctive structures. While the familiar geometry of Euclidean spaces
takes length and angle as fundamental notions, the structure of symplectic
geometry begins from the measurement of two-dimensional area. Much of the modern
study of symplectic geometry is devoted to understanding distinguished
structures on symplectic manifolds, a study that can reveal useful invariants
for those manifolds. The research to be pursued in this project is focused on
questions in this area arising out of string theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
research project focuses on developing the theory of microlocal categories, such
as the full sub-category of objects supported on a Lagrangian submanifold, and
on developing an appropriate ground category for the microlocal category, which
may be topological in origin. The project also aims to find a description of the
microlocal categories associated to flag varieties. Further investigations are
motivated by ideas of quantization, which is here understood in geometric terms
abstracted from concepts in physics.
