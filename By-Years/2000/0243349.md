Provenance and data derivation are important to many aspects of scientific
computation. In &lt;br/&gt;molecular biology, where data is repeatedly copied,
corrected, and transformed as it passes &lt;br/&gt;through numerous genomic
databases, understanding where data has come from and how it &lt;br/&gt;arrived
in the user's database is of crucial to the trust a scientist will put in that
data, yet this &lt;br/&gt;information is seldom captured properly. In astronomy,
useful results may have been been &lt;br/&gt;obtained by filtering,
transforming, and analyzing some base data by a complex assemblage of
&lt;br/&gt;programs, yet we lack good tools for recording how these programs
were connected and the &lt;br/&gt;context in which they were run. &lt;br/&gt;The
intellectual merit of the proposed activity lies in the new insights that it
will bring to the &lt;br/&gt;important topics of data provenance and data
derivation. &lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts resulting from the proposed activity
relate primarily to the establishment of &lt;br/&gt;new ties between distinct
disciplines that have strong interests in data derivation and provenance
&lt;br/&gt;but have not, historically, talked to each other. These new ties will
tend to accelerate both &lt;br/&gt;research and education in the participating
disciplines.
