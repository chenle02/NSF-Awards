The principal investigator pursues the representation theory of p-adic groups,
centered on the structural theory of the p-adic groups via Bruhat-Tits theory,
and the method of restriction on compact open subgroups. Specifically, combining
his work on the construction of supercuspidal representations, explicit
computations of Bruhat-Tits buildings and refined minimal K-types, the
investigator studies refined types, Hecke algebra isomorphisms, and other
related topics.

The representation theory of p-adic groups, being an amazing theory in its own
right, plays a prominent role in number theory and automorphic forms, hence is
fundamental to applications of number theory to computing and cryptography.
Recently there have been exciting new advances, including the investigator's
construction of supercuspidal representations, which was considered most
unreachable objects. These advances open up new questions, which is to be
pursued in this project.
