This project will devise methods to handle the uncertainty that often is
encountered in economic and statistical modeling. The project considers
uncertainty taking the form of (i) unobserved variables and (ii) imperfect
knowledge of the model itself. The first part of the project focuses on
nonlinear panel data models, which currently are receiving considerable
attention in economic and statistical modeling because they provide a natural
way to describe the heterogeneity present in a population. These models share
the feature of including various unobserved variables that represent factors
that are constant over time but vary over individuals. The project will combine
the ideas of entropy maximization and simulation-based estimation to handle, in
a unified framework, the unobservable variables present in a wide range of
nonlinear panel data models. The approach used aims to bypass the complex task
of establishing identification of the model without sacrificing explanatory
power. The second part of this project proposes a new, simple, approach to model
selection that relies on method of moments estimation, adapted to deliver tests
that are identically distributed whether or not the candidates models are
overlapping. Model selection historically has received a lot of attention, but
often involves the cumbersome step of "pre-testing" to first decide if the
candidate models are overlapping or not. The key to avoiding pre-testing is to
smoothly interpolate (rather than discontinuously switch) between a method valid
for overlapping models and a method valid for non overlapping models.

Given the large number of researchers focusing on nonlinear panel data models
and model selection, any new development within these fields is likely to be of
interest to a large community in virtually all fields of the social, medical,
mathematical, and natural sciences. Ultimately, this project will enable more
accurate statistical inference in these fields and permit the practical use of
more general statistical models. Computer programs implementing the methods will
be made publicly available.
