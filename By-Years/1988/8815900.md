In this project, the P.I.'s will obtain time series of shear and turbulence in
the area of the warm pool in the western tropical Pacific Ocean, where the
oceanic mixed layer regime differs greatly from other regimes, such as that in
the central Pacific observed during Tropic Heat. Local rainfall and island
runoff freshen the near-surface layer, creating a non-thermal buoyancy layer
that effectively attenuates wind-mixing of the thermal layer except under very
strong or sustained winds. Understanding mixing in this area is of fundamental
importance to sorting out the hypotheses for generation of El Nino in
particular, and for tropical ocean modeling in general. Ocean measurements will
be combined with improved measurements of air-sea fluxes made under a companion
grant.
