Trowbridge_0136088&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A field investigation will be carried
out to study the role that bubbles and their associated buoyancy play in the
energy balance of the surf zone. Existing measurements do not agree with present
models of turbulent dissipation in this region. It is hypothesized that the a
significant buoyancy flux associated with bubbles may have an important effect
on mean density and, consequently, dissipation. The vertical structure of
dissipation, void fraction, and buoyancy flux due to air entrainment will be
estimated. New theory for energy budgets and surf zone turbulence will be
defined and tested. &lt;br/&gt;
