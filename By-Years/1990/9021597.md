The long term goal of Dr. Hirsch's research is to analyze the steps involved in
nodule development, and also to unravel the genetic contributions of two very
different organisms, microbe and plant, in the establishment of a nitrogen
fixing root nodule. The nodule is a particularly interesting developmental
system because it forms only under conditions of nitrogen stress; plants grown
with sufficient nitrogen do to develop nodules. Hence, Dr. Hirsch's focuses on
the genes expressed early in nodule formation because they herald the onset of a
new developmental pathway, one which has far reaching ecological and agronomic
importance. The specific objectives of this proposal are: 1) to determine
whether bacteria free nodules differ significantly in their development from
wild type R. meliloti induced nodules, and 2) to determine whether a cell
division factor is produces independently of the root hair deformation factor.
This research project will not only extend our understanding of plant microbe
interactions, but also lay the foundation for future attempts to develop novel
nitrogen fixing crop plants.
