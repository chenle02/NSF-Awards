The focus of this project is the development of novel approaches to the total
synthesis of Annonaceous acetogenin and hydropyranone natural products. The
proposed strategies make use of elements of synthetic design (modularity,
convergency, two-directional and tandem reaction sequences) that will simplify
and provide practical routes to complex molecular structures. In addition to the
potential this research offers for the preparation of biologically relevant
natural products and analogues, these studies will also assist the ongoing
development of important chemical reactions. A particular emphasis is placed on
olefin metathesis, and the proposed research includes cross, ring-closing and
tandem metathesis processes that will broaden the scope of this powerful
methodology and provide insights into factors governing metathesis reactions.

With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting
the research of Professor Kevin J. Quinn of the Department of Chemistry at the
College of the Holy Cross. Professor Quinn's research efforts are directed at
the chemical synthesis of complex natural products, an area of long-standing
importance in the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries. This research will
provide an ideal training ground for undergraduate coworkers by exposing them to
a broad range of experimental and spectroscopic techniques and by requiring them
to develop a solid understanding of conceptual and practical aspects of
synthetic chemistry.
