9628401 Ammon This research involves the combination of receiver-function and
surface-wave information into the construction of a mutually consistent Earth-
structure model of the crust and upper mantle. Both receiver functions and
surface waves are sensitive to the shear velocity of the Earth but the
information contained in these waveforms is complementary. Receiver functions
are predominantly sensitive to the velocity contrasts, the surface waves are
predominantly sensitive to slowly-varying velocity changes. Combining this
complementary information should produce better images of the subsurface
variations in shear velocity. Work will begin in North America. The results will
help to understand the interaction between the curst and mantle during the
evolution of the continents. ***
