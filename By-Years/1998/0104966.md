This effort is designed to investigate whether galactic cosmic ray (GCR)
variations that result from variations in solar activity can affect low cloud
properties, and if so, to elucidate the physical mechanism and the magnitude of
such effects. Distinct correlations between GCR intensity and average global
coverage of low-level clouds have recently been reported. The P.I. will utilize
a basic aerosol microphysics model constrained by data from recent field
programs such as the Aerosol Characterization Experiments (ACE), and the TRACE-P
(Transport and Chemical Evolution over the Pacific) to test several hypotheses
for explaining the link between GCR and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) in the
atmosphere. The P.I. will investigate classical binary and ternary nucleation
theories as well as his own ion-mediated nucleation (IMN) hypothesis.
