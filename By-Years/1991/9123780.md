Research in theoretical physics will concern the physics of elementary
particles and other topics. Included will be novel mathematical approaches to
string theory, studies aimed at selection of the "true" string theory from among
many candidates, research on the physics of black holes, work on superfluidity,
efforts to understand the origin of the masses of quarks and electron- like
particles, and studies of quantum chromodynamics. String theories are promising
candidates for a theory of all the basic forces, including gravity. The origin
of the masses of the quarks and related particles is one of the outstanding
problems in physics. Quantum chromodynamics is the (not-too-well-understood)
theory of the strong nuclear force.
