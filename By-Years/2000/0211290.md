The effects of high pressure on reaction rates of enzyme-catalyzed reactions
will be measured as a function of substrate and inhibitor concentrations. These
reactants will be mixed, placed in a steel pressure bomb, and the progress of
their reaction will be monitored spectrophotometrically while being subjected to
hyperbaric conditions up to 3,000 atmospheres of pressure. Initial velocities of
the enzyme-catalyzed reactions will be extracted from the progress curves and
fit to original rate equations in order to quantify pressure-sensitive kinetic
parameters and to perform model discriminations between reaction mechanisms. The
results will be compared to similar effects with isotopically-labeled substrates
to determine the effect of pressure on isotope effects. These measured
quantities will document the presence, sign and magnitude of volume changes
associated with: (1) binding of substrates and inhibitors, (2) rates of chemical
transformations including the expression of isotope effects, (3) rates of
product dissociation, and (4) rates of protein conformational changes. This is a
wholly innovative technological approach to enzymology that will deliver new
information regarding the fundamental secret of life: how these modest proteins
called enzymes bring billions of orders of magnitude of rate acceleration to the
complex biochemical reactions that make up metabolism. For example, this is the
first technology to return an exact measurement of a physical parameter
associated with a transition-state, namely the activation volume. How activation
volumes change with changing conditions will provide a new window of insight
into the transition-state chemistry of enzymes. The ultimate goal of this
research is to test and challenge the dominant theories of enzymatic catalysis,
namely that enzymes accelerate reaction rates by stabilizing transition-states
and by binding substrates more tightly in those transition-states.
