Green City Data is an after-school community service project. Teams of secondary
students are trained to inventory urban natural areas selected by regional
resource planning agencies to supplement their own data collection efforts.
Representatives from seven agencies and educational institutions initiated this
project to support development of a system of greenspaces within the Portland,
Oregon/Vancouver, Washington metropolitan area. This consortium includes
expertise in resource management, geography, biology, computer
telecommunications, science education and community coordination. These and
other community professionals tech students and volunteer team leaders (teachers
or other adults) the basics of habitat identification and mapping in the context
of regional planning. ***
