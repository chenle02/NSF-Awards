Supernova remnants result when the ejecta of a supernova expands into the
ambient interstellar medium, compresses it, and mixes with it. This expansion
and mixing are extraordi.narily complex. The Principal Investigator proposes to
observe and map nearby supernova remnants and to model them computa.tionally.
The goal is to increase our understanding of the physical processes taking place
in them, in particular to find out how and where synchrotron radio emission
takes place in them and how this emission varies with time.
