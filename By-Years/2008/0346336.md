Striking climate change is occurring in the Arctic and subArctic region.
Separate analyses of atmosphere, ocean and fresh-water/cryosphere all reveal an
increasing hydrologic cycle, sea- ice retreat, accelerated incursion of Atlantic
waters, decreasing subpolar salinity and increased penetration of Atlantic
storms over the past 30 years. Realization that both natural and human- induced
climate change tend to focus on high northern latitudes, an international
program known as ASOF (Arctic-SubArctic Ocean Flux) has been developed. European
and Russian contributions are grouped as 'ASOF-East' while contributions from
the US, Canada, Greenland and Japan are grouped as 'ASOF-West.' This is a
proposal to support coordination, administration and synthesis of ASOF-West.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit. Climate research is one of the
broadest of all scientific enterprises. It involves the physics of
ocean/atmosphere circulation, yet with impacts of chemistry and biology and,
over time, geology. Beyond these domains, climate research involves a deep set
of dynamical principles of physics. While .theoretical. climate studies are not
numerous, they provide essential underpinning for the inexact activity of
numerical modelling, and for the interpretation of the many and diverse
observations. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts. The ASOF program impacts
many aspects of high-latitude climate, and global climate. The evolving changes
in our ocean, atmosphere biosphere are of central concern, because they express
the changing habitability of Earth. The proposed work will also contribute to
the training and education of graduate students, and of a much larger audience
interested in Arctic change, global climate, and the future of the physical and
biological world. New technologies being brought to bear in this research (new
satellite sensors, autonomous undersea vehicles) provide many connections with
the larger community of technically literate people, and act as a point of
interest for teaching the public about climate and environment. &lt;br/&gt;
