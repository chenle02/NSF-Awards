The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering a North Carolina State
University will purchase a low temperature probe station, capable of reaching
temperatures as low as 70 K (Degrees Kelvin), and low current switching matrix
cards which will be dedicated to support research in engineering. The equipment
will be used in research projects whose goals are to gain a fundamental
understanding of the nature of electrically active bulk oxide traps in the gate
oxides of insulated gate field transistors (IGFETs). In particular, this
equipment will provide a means of determining if the charge free regions
observed at the SiO2 interfaces of such IGFETs are defect free regions or
contain defects that can trap electron (or holes) but do not retain these
trapped carriers due to tunneling from these sites to the interface or thermally
assisted detrapping. In addition, this equipment will allow for more accurate
measurement of the density and cross section of neutral electron and neutral
hole traps by providing temperatures low enough to eliminate the detrapping
which occurs with both of these types of traps. It will also be possible to
characterize the detrapping associated with the traps using this equipment.
