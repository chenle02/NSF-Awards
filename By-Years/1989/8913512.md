Dynamic analysis reveals time constants of bottlenecks that govern responses of
microorganisms to forcing. It is proposed to identify biochemical steps which
relate to time constants that have been observed in previous research. Shifts in
existing time constants or creation of new time constants as specific inhibitors
are added in increasing amounts will indicate when a reaction becomes a
bottleneck. Another line of research will track a spectrum of frequencies with a
diode-array spectrophotometer as a biosystem is forced. Computerized analysis of
the time constant for each frequency should show that different regions of the
spectra respond with different time constants, and this should indicate the
timing of events in the control scheme. Of the many steps and reactions for
microbial growth and biosynthesis, one or two are slower than the others and are
the bottlenecks that control rates. Well-established methods of engineering
systems analysis will be combined with novel schemes for adding specific
inhibitors of biochemical steps and tracking of spectral responses to identify
these bottlenecks. When the limiting steps are identified, it may be possible to
modify the organisms or to supply crucial substrates to speed productivity.
