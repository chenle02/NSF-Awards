9305187 Mackwell Only from an understanding of the way in which hydrous species
partition at upper mantle conditions will it be possible to interpret mechanical
property measurements. This program will include static experiments on
aggregates of mantle minerals under high pressure and temperature conditions,
infrared measurements to characterize the partitioning of water-derived species
between the phases, and Mossbauer spectroscopy measurements to monitor changes
in the iron valence during uptake of water. This last technique is particularly
important in that it may allow us to use iron ionic ratios and infrared
spectroscopy on minerals exposed at the Earth's surface to infer water contents
and water partitioning at depth. Finally, the inferred effects of this
partitioning behavior will be investigated by performing deformation experiments
on multiphase aggregates under wet conditions. ***
