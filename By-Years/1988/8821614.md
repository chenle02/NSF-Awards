Commercial harvest of yellow perch in the Great Lakes region cannot meet market
demand. Additional controls being placed on commercial harvest, consumer demand,
and high yellow perch prices have generated renewed interest in perch
aquaculture. Attempts to establish commercial perch culture have faced three
major constraints: 1) seasonal supply of fingerlings, 2) feeding fry practical
feeds, and 3) providing optimum growth conditions. Stunted 8 to 13 cm perch
could be harvested from wild populations or raised in farm ponds to provide a
year-round source of larger fish for intensive culture causing waste heat.
Various loading and density rates will be tested to determine optimal rates. A
cost effective practical feed and feed management strategy will be developed for
the culture of yellow perch. Stocks of yellow perch fingerlings will be
identified or established to provide a year-round supply for a commercial yellow
perch aquaculture facility. A suitable site will be identified for the design,
construction, and operation of a yellow perch culture demonstration project. A
preliminary economic analysis will be initiated, utilizing data generated from
research results.
