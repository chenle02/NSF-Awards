Dr. Driscoll and the Co-PI Dr. Ceccio have developed a time-resolved cinema-
PIV(particle image velocity) system that is capable of acquiring 8,000 PIV
images/second. In the current proposal, they propose to use this new
instrumentation to study the characteristics of a turbulent jet, more
specifically, the temporal structure and evolution of eddies and their
relationship to the generation of subgrid stresses and dissapation. The
experiments will consist of issuing a water jet into a co-flowing stream in a
water tunnel. The broader impact of this proposal will be to improve our ability
to develop better subgrid scale models for the prediction of the characteristics
of turbulent flows, and in the training of graduate students in this advance
instrumentation technique. Knowledge gained in this research will be useful in
the development of 3D cinema-PIV system.
