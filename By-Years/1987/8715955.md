The primary goal of the proposed research is to determine the concentrations of
trace elements in atmospheric samples that were collected from the westerly wind
field over the North Pacific Ocean during two cruises in 1986. Numerous aerosol
and precipitation samples were collected during the two cruises, and this is the
only extensive set of high-quality trace element samples from the region. The
analysis of atmospheric samples that were collected from a network of aerosol
sampling stations in the South Pacific will also be completed. Special emphasis
will be placed on integrating the results of these analyses with data from prior
complementary studies. Data interpretation will involve comparisons and
contrasts among the trace element and mineral aerosol concentrations, sources,
and fluxes in the North Pacific westerlies and in the three other surface-level
wind regimes over the Pacific.
