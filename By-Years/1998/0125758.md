0125758&lt;br/&gt;Deino&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An extensive data-reduction program
for analysis of 40Ar/39Ar data is already in the beta testing phase at the
Berkeley Geochronology Center (BGC) and other laboratories. Support from this
grant add important, high-level data interpretation features, as well as
producing detailed documentation suitable for public dissemination. These
features will include: 1) an Arrhenius plotting program to evaluate argon
diffusion experiments, 2) linkage of step-heating spectra directly to isochron
analysis, so that the identification of a plateau can be based on isochron
MSWD's, and also that non-zero intercepts can be fed back directly into the
plateau program to generate appropriate plateau and integrated ages, 3) optional
text-file input of spectrometer data in a standard format, and 4) data reduction
capability for non-Ar Noble gasses. Expanded user support for this program will
include a detailed, redundantly-indexed, PDF-format manual and on-line support
in the form of help screens as well as Balloon Help on Mac OS systems up to 9.1,
and Tool Tips on Mac OS X. As envisioned, the manual will be suitable as a web-
available teaching tool for graduate-level classes in isotope
geology.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
