9624364 Espinosa A CAREER award will support research and education in the area
of nanostructured ceramics and coatings. In particular, the wear and friction
properties and the crack initiation and blunting phenomena will be studied with
varying nano-crystalline microstructures. Instrumentation employed in the work
include SEM, TEM and AFM. Also measured will be the emanating elastic waves,
resolved interferometrically with nanosecond resolution. The education plan
includes mini-design projects, outreach to high schools, and the use of team
work and of open ended problems. ***
