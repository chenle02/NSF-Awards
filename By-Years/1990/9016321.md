This award will support collaborative research between Dr. George Homsy,
Department of Chemical Engineering, Stanford University and Dr. Elisabeth
Guazelli, Ecole Superieure de Physique et Chimie Industrielles, Paris, France.
The objective of the project is to investigate the hydrodynamics of fluid
particle systems. The investigators will study hydrodynamic effects in
suspensions and fluidized beds. The behavior of such dispersed multiphase
systems is important in a number of fields of science and technology. These
include applications in handling and processing materials such as: 1) composites
and emulsions, 2) chemical processing of fluids, as in fluidized bed reactors,
3) environmental fluid mechanics, such as sediment and nutrient transport in
natural flows and 4) separation technologies, such as flotation, sedimentation
and clarification. Despite intensive study of these fields over the last several
decades, there are many fundamental aspects of the mechanical behavior of such
systems that remain poorly understood, in particular, the interactions between
the particles making up the dispersed phase. In this project, the investigators
propose to carry out: 1) theoretical and numerical studies of hydrodynamic
interactions between particles in suspension, and 2) experimental studies of the
behavior of sedimenting suspen- sions, fluidized beds, and so-called "ferro
fluids", i.e. suspensions of magnetic Brownian particles. The primary focus of
the French group will be the experimental studies, while that of the US will be
theoretical and numerical modeling. The project will benefit from the
availability of special NMR facilities for flow visualization in the French
laboratory.
