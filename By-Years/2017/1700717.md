This grant provides travel and lodging support for participants of the Eighth
Western Conference on Mathematical Finance, to be held at the University of
Washington's Seattle campus on March 24-25, 2017. The conference has two main
objectives. First, by bringing together researchers who work in the areas of
financial mathematics and insurance, the conference promotes an exchange of
ideas and facilitates new collaborations on topics of recent importance to the
global financial system, including systemic risk, security of the financial
system, sustainability of pension funding, and broader impact of financial
securities. Second, by reserving half of the speaking slots and the majority of
financial support for junior researchers and underrepresented minorities, the
conference helps develop a generation of investigators to form the future core
of the financial workforce in academia, government, and industry. The two-day
conference has 18 speakers (six senior tenured faculty, six junior non-tenured
faculty, six graduate students) and includes ample time for dissemination and
discussion of new findings among conference participants, as well as a panel
discussion to address open problems facing the financial community. The
conference provides an opportunity for junior financial mathematicians to confer
with eminent scholars in the field. The conference website is:

With the recent financial crises and the continuous introduction of new
regulations designed to safeguard the financial system, the landscape of
financial markets is changing quickly. These changes have opened up entirely new
directions for research within the mathematical finance community. It is the
goal of the Eighth Western Conference on Mathematical Finance to highlight
research in these newly developing areas. In particular, a special emphasis is
given to asymptotics for parabolic partial differential equations, robust
hedging, and stochastic portfolio theory. Cutting-edge developments in
asymptotics are required in order to solve challenging nonlinear partial
differential equations in various financial applications with market frictions
such as trading constraints, transactions costs, and asymmetric borrowing and
lending rates. Robust hedging methods are needed in order for market
participants to mitigate risk effectively in the face of model uncertainty. New
results from stochastic portfolio theory can shed light on market structure and
long-term investment choices.
