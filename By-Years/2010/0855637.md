ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery
and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). It will fund the research work
of the High Energy Group at the State University of New York at Buffalo. The
group main research activities are on the D0 experiment at the Tevatron, the CMS
experiment at LHC, and the outreach program through QuarkNet.&lt;br/&gt;The
research program plans to initially investigate the production of Standard Model
processes and than to search for the Higgs particles at the CMS experiment. The
background processes are important to themselves as they provide crucial test of
the Standard Model in areas least explored so far. The group will continue its
participation in the Forward Pixel Detector project. This participation should
allow postdocs and graduate students to acquire a balanced education by
combining activities of data analyses and detector commissioning and operation.
&lt;br/&gt;The D0 detector has recorded in excess of 4fb-1 of data to date and
is expected to substantially increase the integrated luminosity in the coming
years. The goal of the proposed research program with D0 is to study Z decay to
bbar and ZZ production processes. These analyses will greatly benefit from the
increased dataset and well calibrated and understood
detector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As for broader impact the research program will
be fostering collaboration between the State University of New York at Buffalo
group members, high school teachers and their students. They open up
possibilities for these non-traditional participants to come in close contact
with fundamental research at the frontiers of science.
