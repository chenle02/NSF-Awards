Biological Sciences (61) The objective of this proposal is to increase the
information technology literacy of students in undergraduate biology classes
through integration of bioinformatic technology in lecture, laboratories and
assignments. This infusion of bioinformatics across the biological disciplines
is adapting a model from the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. The expected
outcome is a long-term commitment to information technology within biology
curricula and a generation of students prepared to accept the challenges of
pursuing careers in research, education, health or industry. The intellectual
merit of the proposal is in providing access to computational methods and
bioinformatics at the undergraduate level. The broad impact of this project
results from bringing together information resources with biologists to solve
research problems and educate students. The expectation is that students
completing the integrated curriculum are prepared to have an impact on the
community as teachers, researchers, and professionals. Further, the project is
being made accessible to secondary education teachers and students to learn
about computers and biology and return to their home schools with a better
understanding of research and technology.
