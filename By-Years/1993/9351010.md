9351010 Velbel A suite of microscopes equipped with thermal stages is being used
to develop and calibrate a simple, innovative laboratory activity on the
temperature dependence (Arrhenius activation energy) of mineral-solution
reactions. The exercise is enabling students in undergraduate
mineralology/geochemistry courses to directly measure reaction rates at various
temperatures while simultaneously allowing them to observe the evolution of
grain-surface morphology during the reaction. This is greatly improving student
understanding of several basic principles of chemical kinetics directly relevant
to the geological sciences, including diffusion, the temperature dependance of
reaction rates, and the relationship between rate-limiting mechanisms and
crystal-surface morphology. The lab exercise is generating dynamic (real-time)
geochemical rate data which students then are using to augment traditional
quantitative homework exercises. Furthermore, the equipment is being used to
calibrate a technologically much less complicated version of the exercise. Any
geology department with microscopes, hot plates, beakers, thermometers, and
stopwatches can perform the same exercise without the necessity of massive
investments in dedicated equipment. ***y
