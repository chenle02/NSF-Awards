This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MacAyeal 0907834&lt;br/&gt;University
of Chicago&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds are provided to develop a better
understanding of the processes and consequences of surface meltwater production
on the Greenland ice sheet, particularly the development of surface lakes and
their subsequent drainage to the subglacial bed, with the aid of numerical
models designed to simulate the evolution of meltwater lakes on the Greenland
Ice Sheet. The work effort will focus on: (a) establishing a self-consistent
thermodynamic treatment that explicitly treats radiative forcing using a surface
energy balance model, and (b) investigating new approaches to the dynamics of
englacial water conduits that cause lake drainage to the subglacial bed. The
surface energy balance formulation will specify the downward radiation from sun,
clouds and clear sky in all the important wavelength bands (e.g., shortwave and
longwave), use bulk transfer formulations to parameterize sensibleand latent-
heat fluxes, and explicitly model heat transfer processes below the surface. The
new approaches to englacial water conduit dynamics proposed will involve
stochastic processes involved in activation of pre-existing crack systems
assumed to have spatial density and orientations described by probability
density functions. Two products will result from the model development and
experimentation: (i) a series of numerical simulations designed to address basic
questions concerning the formation of surface lakes on the Greenland Ice Sheet
and their drainage to the ice-sheet bed and (ii) the development of a framework
of diverse model approaches and their application to the sub-grid-scale
parameterization of large-scale ice-sheet models, thereby coupling them to
climate models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
