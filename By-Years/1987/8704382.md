Robinson proposes to continue observations of cataclysmic variable stars with
the help of post-doctoral associate Allen Shafter. Photometry of eclipse-type
light variations will be used to learn about accretion disks. Photometry of
rapid light variations will probably be interpreted in terms of dynamic
phenomena at the edges of accretion disks. Spectroscopy will yield radial
velocities. Careful subsidiary measurements will be needed to establish just
what part of the binary system the velocities refer to. Some additional projects
are listed. Many stars occur in pairs, moving around each other in hours or
days. As they age, one star may lose mass to the other, sometimes in highly
dramatic and explosive fashion. This program is to observe one category of such
binary stars with mass transfer, called cataclysmic variables. They consist of
an ordinary and an Earth-sized star plus a disk of gas slowly swirling toward
the latter. These systems are the most observable of the mass-transferring
binaries. Their observation will lay the groundwork for understanding the more
complex and more explosive systems.
