Computer networks have become more pervasive in scope and mission-critical to
businesses, scientific endeavors and other computing applications. But at the
same time, network instability and unreliability has become an increasing
problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research tackles this issue by laying the
groundwork for a new system infrastructure and an associated generation of
algorithms capable of overcoming the unreliable nature of the network using
probabilistic techniques for ensuring consistent cooperative behavior,
coordination, and coherency. The central property of the infrastructure is that
it uses probabilistic techniques (instead of absolute guarantees) but, by so
doing, obtains outstanding stability under stress, scalability, and robustness
to even extreme disruptions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will proceed in
steps, starting with a quantitative study of existing distributed system
architectures, especially focusing on (1) gossip-style data dissemination, (2)
anonymous communication, and (3) peer-to-peer networks. The next step will
explore the design of new and enhanced architectures for large-scale distributed
analysis systems. It is the ultimate goal to implement new designs in ways
compatible with prevailing platforms (Windows, Java, Unix), and release public-
domain versions of these experimental solutions, and to measure their behavior
on a large scale. &lt;br/&gt;
