0217721&lt;br/&gt;Tilton&lt;br/&gt;This award supports Robert Tilton and a
student from Carnegie Mellon University in a collaboration with Per Claesson of
the Department of Chemistry at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm,
Sweden. The project will focus on manipulation of the molecular-level structure
of adsorbed polymer layers on solid surfaces. The manipulation is achieved by
introducing surfactants hat bind with varying affinities to different segments
of the polymer as it adsorbs. Particular attention will be paid to non-
equilibrium configurations in the adsorbed layers and to the dynamics of their
transformations. The goal is to develop techniques to design long-lived
metastable layer configurations that are optimized for technological
applications. The collaboration combines the distinct, but highly complementary,
approaches taken by the Swedish and US groups: the US side uses optical and
spectroscopic methods to characterize composition and micro-environmental
aspects of adsorbed layers and the Swedish side uses surface force measurement
to characterize the structure and mechanics of the layers. A key aspect of the
collaboration is the initiation of a graduate student exchange between the US
and Swedish groups.&lt;br/&gt;
