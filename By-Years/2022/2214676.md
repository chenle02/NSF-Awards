This award supports the conference "Random media and large deviations" that will
be held October 21-24, 2022, at the Courant Institute of the New York University
in New York City. The conference has 26 confirmed speakers in these very active
and fundamental areas at the intersection of probability, analysis, and
mathematical physics. Many of the complex systems which will be discussed in
this conference aim to describe real world phenomena. Results proven for the
mathematical models will provide predictions applicable to the real systems.
Besides physical applications, complex systems have found many applications in
computer science, machine learning, data science, bioinformatics, chemistry and
even in areas like ecology and earth science. This gathering will lead to cross-
fertilization between these areas as well as inspire and inform a new generation
of researchers. It is expected that many graduate students, recent PhDs, and
other early career researchers will participate in this
conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main focus of this conference is
the rigorous study of random motion in random media. The goal is to explain how
random microscopic systems display predictable and statistically universal
collective macroscopic behavior. Large deviations are key to understanding such
problems, especially in high dimensions. Many open problems remain in explaining
how complicated energy landscapes govern the prestationary behavior of random
motion. Different approaches in this area will be represented at the conference,
including spin-glasses, stochastic partial differential equations, and random
matrix theory. The website for this conference is:

reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
