This project will precisely map and extensively sample, on an outcrop by
outcrop basis, a small number of carefully selected crustal subsections in the
Semail ophiolite between the layered cumulated gabbros and the sheeted dike
complex. The goal is too obtain comprehensive structural, textural,
mineralogical, and fluid/rock chemical information, all within a precisely
defined spatial context, related to magma-hydrothermal contacts. Knowledge of
the rates and mechanisms of mass and energy transfer across magma chamber
margins is necessary to understanding the style and vigor of submarine
hydrothermal circulation and ridge- crest magma chamber evolution. This project
will utilize models initially developed to study magma hydrothermal systems
related to intrusive plutons associated with well-characterized porphyry copper
deposits.
