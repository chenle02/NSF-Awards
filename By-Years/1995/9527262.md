This award is for support for a program to investigate the visual stratigraphy,
index physical properties, relaxation characteristics and crystalline structure
of ice cores from Siple Dome, West Antarctica. This investigation will include
measurements of a time-priority nature that must be initiated at the drill site
on freshly-drilled cores. This will be especially true of cores from the brittle
ice zone, which is expected to comprise a significant fraction of the ice core.
The brittle zone includes ice in which relaxation , resulting from the release
of confining pressure is maximized and leads to significant changes in the
mechanical condition of the core that must be considered in relation to the
processing and analysis of ice samples for entrapped gas and chemical studies.
This relaxation will be monitored via precision density measurements made
initially at the drill site and repeated at intervals back in the U.S. Other
studies will include measurement of the annual layering in the core to as great
a depth as visual stratigraphy can be deciphered, crystal size measurements as a
function of depth and age, c-axis fabric studies, and analysis of the physical
properties of any debris-bearing basal ice and its relationship to the
underlying bedrock. Only through careful documentation and analysis of these key
properties can we hope to accurately assess the dynamic state of the ice and the
age-depth relationships essential to deciphering the paleoclimate record at this
location.
