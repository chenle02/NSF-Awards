The proposed research is to continue and to expand computer simulations of new
phenomena in strongly perturbed quantum systems. Program codes to obtain time-
dependent quantum mechanical wave functions for one-electron atoms and negative
ions in very intense and short-pulse radiative environments have been developed.
These wave functions have led to new predictions and satisfactory semi-
quantitative comparisons with experiments carried out in the last few years. The
concept of these wave functions will be extended to two- electron systems in
high-intensity laser fields. These calculations will be the first exact quantum
calculations of that type which fully counts for all interactions (electron-
atom, electron-field and electron-electron) for a quantum system. They will
provide a novel opportunity for systematic tests of the range of validity of
approximations involved in traditional multi-electron radiation theories.//
