This proposal was received in response to Nanoscale Science and Engineering
initiative, NSF 01-157, category NIRT. Because of their extraordinary
properties, carbon nanotubes (CNT) in general have been extensively studied.
Local deformations of CNT's appear to exhibit combined electrical, mechanical,
thermal and even optical properties that offer particularly intriguing promise
for studying physical effects at the nm scale and for novel sensors and other
devices. A team with the requisite diverse backgrounds and capabilities has been
formed to exploit these new opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One core
proposed activity is the modeling of deformed carbon nanotubes and other
nanostructures (e.g. silicon nanowires) using atomic-scale simulation methods
ranging from classical interatomic potential to tight-binding, ab-initio quantum
simulation, and electronic and thermal conductance analysis. Quasi-static and
molecular-dynamics methods will be used to study deformation processes as well
as the indenting of polymer films using a CNT. The electronic conductance of
deformed nanotubes will be investigated using Kubo and Landauer methods with
self-consistent quantum simulations. Complementing the modeling activity will be
experimental verification of the modeling results with two eventual applications
in mind: 1) Nanoscale force and thermal sensors based on a nanotube bent in the
shape of a hairpin. Such a device might allow temperature distributions to be
mapped with a spatial resolution as fine as 10nm and also be able to respond to
fast molecular dynamic force signals, and 2) A 'turnstile' electron emitter that
employs the deformity in the shank of a nanotube to produce local band bending
to control the transport of single electrons to the tip for field-assisted
photoemission. Such a device would have significant impact on electron beam
nanolithography through the elimination of shot noise and also on ultrahigh
speed (100GHz) analog-to-digital conversion.&lt;br/&gt;
