Eigenvalue problems arise naturally throughout many areas of mathematics and
data science, and their numerical solution is crucial for understanding the
behavior of many complex systems. Applications include structural mechanics,
epidemiology, image processing, medical imaging, search-engine technology,
modeling of population dynamics, and stability of numerical algorithms.
Eigenvalue problems are often challenging to solve, as solutions can generally
only be found by generating sequences of successive approximations. This work
will develop efficient, robust and theoretically sound technologies that will
accelerate convergence to solutions of matrix and tensor eigenvalue problems. In
response to the increased prevalence of remote-learning, the integrated
educational plan will develop stand-alone apps to aid in the delivery of
standard and advanced topics in numerical analysis and linear algebra. The apps
developed will include exposition of ideas and methods closely related to the
research program.

The technical aim of this work is the development and analysis of both novel and
long-standing extrapolation techniques for eigenvalue problems. Extrapolation
techniques are low-cost methods that combine a history of iterates and update
steps to form the next approximation in a sequence. In this work they will be
used to accelerate convergence of power-type iterations for challenging matrix
and tensor eigenvalue problems. The main components of the research for matrix
problems are development of novel methods that (1) damp multiple modes
simultaneously; (2) resolve multiple modes simultaneously; and (3) extend the
target problem class to indefinite matrices. For tensor problems, the main
outcomes will be (1) development and convergence analysis of methods that
accelerate robust but linearly converging power-type iterations; (2) extensions
to accelerated versions of adaptively-shifted power-type iterations and
generalized problems; and (3) studies on stability and clustering, and the
development of fast techniques to capture complete sets of eigenvalues. This
investigation of tensor methods is expected to advance the state of the art by
introducing fast but low-complexity methods that are well suited to high-order
problems.
