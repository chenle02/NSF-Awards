9317016 Newell This Americas Program award will support the participation of
three U.S. scientists and one graduate student in an international workshop on
instabilities and nonequilibrium structures, to be held in Santiago, Chile ,
December, 1993. Dr. Alan Newell, University of Arizona will be collaborating
with Dr. Enrique Tirapegui, University of Chile. The purpose of this workshop is
to present, through courses, conferences and short seminars, an up-to- date
review of recent developments in the field of nonlinear physics. About 32 junior
scientists and graduate students from U.S. and Latin America will attend the
workshop. The subject of the conference is of great interest; the topics covered
are extremely important and the lecturers are of the highest international
calibre. This exposure to high level physics will give young and emerging U.S.
and Latin American scientists valuable added professional training and the
opportunity to interact with eminent mathematicians and physicists. ***
