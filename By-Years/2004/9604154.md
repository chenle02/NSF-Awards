9604154 Perry The protein CHD1 is associated with transcriptionally active
regions of extended (decompacted) interphase chromatin. The structural features
of this protein have been preserved over a long period of evolution, suggesting
that it performs analogous functions in organisms as diverse as yeast, flies and
mammals. These features include a chromo domain, relating it to proteins like
HP1 and Polycomb; an ATPase/helicase domain, relating it to proteins like
SNF2/SWI2 and Brahma; and a DNA-binding domain that specifically interacts with
the minor groove of A(T-rich DNA. This research is aimed at gaining deeper
insight into the roles played by CHD1 and its associated proteins in the
remodeling of chromatin structure and the regulation of gene expression.
Experiments with Drosophila, in which several target genes of CHD1 activity have
been identified, will include (i) immunocytochemical localization studies of
polytene chromosomes from flies in different developmental and physiological
states; (ii) genetic studies of the consequences of directed mutations in the
signature domains of CHD1; (iii) determination of the particular regions of
target genes that interact with CHD1; and (iv) a genetic screen for CHD1 mutants
and for enhancers and/or suppressors of these mutations. This research should
contribute substantially to the knowledge of gene regulation. In particular, it
should help illuminate mechanisms by which modifications of chromatin structure
determine accessibility to the transcriptional apparatus. %%% The protein CHD1
