CMS 9729306 Olson This project focuses on the relationship between disasters,
societal stability and barriers to policy innovation. A multivariate model
linking disasters and their possible consequences will be developed. The data
analysis technique is pooled time-series. The principal databases include a
worldwide disaster database for the years 1964-1995, the Taylor and Jodice
database from the World Handbook of Political and Social Indicators (1983), and
the Jaggers and Gurr Polity III (1996) database. Setting a criterion of all
1964-1995 disasters worldwide which affected more than 1,000 people, the project
encompasses 1,760 disaster events, which yields 54,560 data points. Other
researchers should be able to later replicate this project and extend its
findings and policy insights.
