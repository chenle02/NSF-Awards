The 2018 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) International
Conference on Communications (ICC) will be held in Kansas City, Missouri from
May 20 to May 24, 2018. This preeminent technical conference is one of the
flagship conferences of the IEEE Communications Society, and a primary venue for
presenting new research results in the area of communications and networking. It
is widely attended by researchers and practitioners in the field. Attending
conferences such as ICC is of paramount importance for the development of
graduate students. Participants have the opportunity to present their work,
attend panel and keynote sessions, and interact with hundreds of other leading-
edge researchers in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This
proposal provides travel support for approximately fifteen graduate students in
the United States to attend this premiere conference, which will be held in the
US after 15 years. The travel awards will target first-time attendees and under-
represented minority students, since attending conferences is an important part
of their educational experience, and they often have limited travel funds. The
research community and the Engineering workforce benefit from the improvement of
students in the pipeline, and the introduction of new researcher
perspectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
