This Research Opportunities for Women Career Advancement Award project is in the
general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the subfield of
electrochemistry. During the two year period beginning 1 July 1987, Professor
Miller will pursue studies in U.S. and Japanese laboratories through which she
will develop expertise in surface spectroscopy that will complement her already
robust abilities in organic electrochemistry. The new research expertise gained
in this activity will enhance Professor Miller's present NSF-supported research
program in organic electrosynthesis and should enable her to take new and
unprecedented strides in the development of electroprepared organometallic
materials as catalysts for highly selective synthetic processes. Support
provided by the Foundation for this activity is leveraged through the University
of Minnesota's waiving of indirect costs on this grant.
