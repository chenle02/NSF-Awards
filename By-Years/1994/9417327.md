Abstract SUNY Genesee Community College - K. Mead Connection to NSFNET Proposal
No. NCR-9417327 The Genesee Community College (SUNY) requests support from NSF
for connection of their campus networks to SUNYnet which is in turn the gateway
to the NSFNET. SUNYnet will provide operations management and information
services and it will give Genesee Community College a 56 thousand bits per
second connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second)
National Backbone network. The College needs greater functionality and network
speed to be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers
along with being able to implement a more reliable mail system. Students and
faculty research will benefit from the link. This is also a unique opportunity
for the schools to explore innovative educational resources.
