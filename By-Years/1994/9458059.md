Technical abstract: An experimental investigation will be carried out of low
temperature transport in mesoscopic semiconductor structures. Particular
attention will be placed on exploring the connection between randomness in
quantum transport and quantum signatures of classical chaos. Applications
include the use of feedback control of phase-coherent transport for the purpose
of developing semiconductor quantum dots to operate as low-noise magnetometers.
Nontechnical abstract: The focus of the research is to understand the physics
which governs the motion of electrons in ultrasmall devices. Recent results
indicate that when the electrons can travel distances larger than the device
dimension without appreciable scattering by impurities and other defects then
the geometry of the device becomes a significant factor in determining the
electron's motion. This sensitivity to geometry can be a useful tool to study
the underlying mechanisms of chaotic motion and to ultimately design new
devices. The proposed research will be carried out at low cryogenic temperatures
and in very high quality semiconductor structures to increase the mobility of
the electrons. :
