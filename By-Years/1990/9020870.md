The proposed research will consider several situations in which natural and
sexual selection function together and in opposition to one another, and how an
organism can behave in a way that maximizes its fitness. The research combines
field surveys, field experiments, and laboratory experiments. These experiments
will examine the interacting effects of predation risk, density, and sex ratio
in Gerris remigis, a species of aquatic insect. The research will produce new
insights into how natural selection and sexual selection interact to shape
evolution. Additional knowledge of how stream ecology may be affected by the
destruction of surrounding land should also result from this work.
