Developments in fiber-optic laser interferometry have introduced the
possibility of designing gravity meters that are cheap, portable and very
precise (better than one microgal). This Phase I award under the Small Business
Innovation Research Program provides support to develop a field-portable gravity
meter with a fiber optic sensor. If successful, the result will be a cheaper,
more precise and more portable instrument for surface gravity surveys or
borehole service.
