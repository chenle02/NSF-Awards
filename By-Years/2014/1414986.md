The problem of how stars form is one of the key questions in modern
astrophysics, with the evolution of the universe, structure of galaxies, and
creation of planetary systems all inextricably tied to star formation. All
current star formation exists within giant molecular clouds (GMCs)-the coldest,
densest regions of the interstellar medium, but the initial conditions and
specific process through which this occurs are still uncertain. One theory
posits that the dominant mechanism for star formation is through triggering via
collisions between GMCs. This project will test the cloud-collision theory by
creating detailed numerical simulations to investigate GMC interactions. Regions
of interstellar gas, hundreds of light-years across, will be evolved over
millions of years using supercomputers. The resulting structures will be
analyzed in detail to determine the likelihood of stars forming. The research
will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Fumitaka Nakamura, an expert in both
star formation theory and numerical simulation, at the National Astronomical
Observatory of Japan.

This project will be the first to rigorously implement supersonic turbulence,
magnetic fields, and complex thermo-chemical functions in order to create the
most realistic model of GMCs thus far. The numerical methods utilized to evolve
the clouds will be magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) with adaptive mesh refinement
(AMR). A state-of-the-art thermo-chemical function will also provide diagnostics
to compare with observations. Clump-finding algorithms and virial analysis will
be used to determine the ability of cloud collisions to compress material and
initiate collapse into stars. Various parameters will be explored, including
magnetic field strength and orientation, as well as collision velocity and
turbulent power spectra. This research will not only further development of
advanced numerical methods, but determine the importance of a potentially vital
mechanism "cloud collisions" in the star formation process. This NSF EAPSI award
is funded in collaboration with the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.
