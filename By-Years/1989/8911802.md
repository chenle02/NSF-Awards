The principal investigator will work on two projects. The first project is
concerned with inference for nonstationary time series. The main objective is to
study the consistency and efficiency of the model selection procedures that are
either based on information criteria or on the predictive least squares
principle. The second project is concerned with the inference for nonlinear time
series. The main objective is to establish a unified estimation theory for the
nonlinear autoregressive model and a general computation method for its
functionals. Nonlinearity tests and conditions for stationarity are also
considered. Since in applications the problems in general are nonstationary and
nonlinear, these projects will contribute not only to the field of statistics,
but also to other branches of science.
