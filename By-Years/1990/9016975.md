Proton auroral extreme ultraviolet emissions by the UC Berkeley Extreme
UltraViolet spectrometer on satellite STP-78-1 will be examined. The
relationship between extreme ultraviolet auroral emissions and the auroral
proton flux will be investigated. Proton and secondary electron energy fluxes
will be estimated from the measured emission intensities. Linear transport
models of proton and electron energy degradation and radiative transfer of
optically thick resonance lines will be used in the analysis of the data.
Doppler shifts in Lyman a emission will be used to inter precipitating auroral
proton energies. *** //
