The Education Development Center is carrying out a research and development
project related to a set of professional development materials previously
developed with support from the National Science Foundation. The materials, Math
for All (MFA), are for the professional development of teachers who teach
elementary school students with disabilities. The current project has three
distinct components. 1) Conduct a qualitative study on the way the facilitators
use the professional development materials. 2) Based on that study develop
resources for teacher leaders and other facilitators of professional
development. These resources include a Facilitator Case Book, a model for
facilitator institutes, and a model for continued on-line support for
facilitators. 3) Conduct an experimental study, using a randomized controlled
trial model, to determine the effectiveness of these resources.
