This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program and the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at Iowa State University acquire a CCD-based x-ray
diffractometer. The equipment will enhance research in a number of areas which
include programs in inorganic, organic, organometallic, solid state, and polymer
chemistry. The X-ray diffractometer is used to make accurate and precise
measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a molecule. The
information obtained gives the precise values of all the bond distances and bond
angles of a given molecule and it gives accurate information about the spatial
arrangement of the molecule relative to the neighboring molecules.
