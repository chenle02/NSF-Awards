The aim of the proposal is to conduct cutting-edge simulations of Abell 2146,
which consists of two merging, massive galaxy clusters that are viewed close to
the plane of the sky soon after their first collision. Dark matter dominates the
merger's total mass, and its distribution has been revealed. The normal baryonic
matter in the merger is hot, and its distribution is known from X-ray
measurements. Due to the merger's favorable viewing angle and youth, these
distributions differ markedly. This provides a rare opportunity to use the
proposed simulations to place strong constraints on the merger's material and
dynamics. As an added bonus, the simulations will investigate why this cluster
merger lacks radio emission, in stark contrast to its ubiquity in other
mergers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will continue her established efforts to
recruit local high school students from underrepresented groups into her
institution. She will also develop a series of software-tools workshops for
students and faculty at her institution.
