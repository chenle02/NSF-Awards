Faculty from Cal Poly, Weber State University, and Duke University are
developing materials to support new course sequences that integrate mathematics
with engineering, chemistry, and physics. These materials are intended to
support interactive learning within a World Wide Web environment. A common "look
and feel" will be developed for this material so as to promote its
transportability among institutions. As the project proceeds new faculty
developers will be recruited, and the common "protocol" is expected to enable
their contributions to be easily integrated into the larger body of material. A
workshop for these new developers will be held at Cal Poly in the summer of
1997. Various publications are planned including a text packaged with a CD-ROM
containing Web-based material.
