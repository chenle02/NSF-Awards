9319091 Hwa The primary purpose of this U.S.-Slovak research project between Dr.
Rudolph Hwa of the University of Oregon, Eugene, and Dr. Jan Pisut of Comenius
University, Bratislava, is to study the possible formation of quark-gluon
plasmas in relativistic heavy- ion collisions. In doing so, the researchers will
focus on describing the pre-equilibrium thermalization process in order to
understand: 1) the suppression mechanism causing an anomalous ratio of J
particles to Psi particles and 2) dilepton and multi- particle production.
Results are expected to improve our understanding of strong interaction in dense
media nuclear matter. This project in high energy physics fulfills the program
objectives of advancing science by enabling leading experts in the U.S. and
Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool research resources in
areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
