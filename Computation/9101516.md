This award supports the research of Professor I. Gessel to work in enumerative
combinatorics. He intends to study hypergeometric series, polyominos and Joyal's
theory of species of structures. The research is in the general area of
combinatorics. Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study how
discrete collections of objects can be organized. And, so it is extremely
important to modern communications, for example the design of large networks as
in telephone systems and the design of algorithms in computer science.
