The PI will conduct a preliminary investigation of immunity-based computational
techniques to pave the way for more complex studies of this subject in the
future. The ultimate goal of this research is to develop computational
techniques inspired by the natural immune system for solving real-world science
and engineering problems. The natural immune system is a distributed novel-
pattern recognizer which uses intelligent mechanisms to detect a wide variety of
antigens (novel patterns). From the computational point of view the immune
system uses learning, memory, and associative retrieval to solve recognition and
classification tasks. The immune system is a subject of great research interest,
not only in the hope of finding cures for many diseases but also as a means for
understanding its powerful information processing capabilities. In the current
project the PI will investigate immunological principles, explore the underlying
concepts and mechanisms, and take initial steps towards the development of
intelligent computational techniques for solving problems in the field of
science and engineering.
