The principal investigator will work on a broad class of problems from
nonlinear control theory, including local and global controllability,
observability, and minimal realizations. Special emphasis will be placed on
nonlinear stabilization and nonholonomic motion planning. The techniques of
nonlinear control have many practical applications from robotics to landing a
space probe on some distant planet. It is one example of the power and
applicability of nonlinear mathematics in the modern world.
