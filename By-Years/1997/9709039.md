This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
(CRIF) and the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program will assist junior
faculty in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Chicago acquire a
Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) spectrometer. This equipment will enhance a
multidisciplinary research program that uses defined organic monolayers found in
peptides and carbohydrates to understand the adhesion and migration of mammalian
cells on substrates. The Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) is an optical technique
that measures the index of refraction of a liquid in contact with a thin film.
This technique enables researchers to investigate adsorption of proteins and
polymers at interfaces.
