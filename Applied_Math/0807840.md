The investigator and his colleagues study mathematical problems with large
surfaces and small volumes that arise in physics (e.g., highly fragmented
electrical conductors, high voltage electric discharges, electrolytic
deposition, diffusion-limited aggregation), chemistry (catalytic converters,
surface chemistry), biology (cell membranes, vascular systems), engineering
(hydraulic fracturing in oil wells, thin ramified fibers, elastic thin bodies,
towers and bridges in open space). In all these problems a lower-dimensional
physical body -- the "surface" -- intrudes and interacts with a full dimensional
surrounding body -- the "volume." The volume is small, the surface is large,
possibly fractal and with infinite area. In this project, the mathematics of
fractal structures in space is focused on two fundamental issues: 1) second
order transmission conditions for second order operators; 2) singular
homogenization with fractal terms. New tools of analysis are developed, like
Hoelder metrics and measure-valued Lagrangeans. Finite element numerical
approximations provide the quantitative and flexible setting required by
prospective applications such as those mentioned above. The principal
investigator and his colleagues develop new mathematics aimed at meeting the
challenges and taking advantage of the new technologies of the time.

The mathematics developed in this project is motivated by, and oriented to, the
study of applied problems of unusual type, occurring in the materials sciences
and manufacturing, nanotechnology, biotechnology, and the environmental
sciences. The unusual feature of these problems consists in the presence and
interaction, within the same system, of two physical phenomena, one confined in
a "small volume," the second unfolding itself on a "large surface."
Nanotechnology can produce very fine fractal surfaces that can be assembled to
form composite materials with enhanced internal surface effects (catalytic
devices, absorbers, surface chemistry, radiators and similar). Environment-
driven fractal networks can support irrigation of large surfaces with scarce
fluid volume (as in vascular and biological systems). Interlaced thin fibers and
fractal thin structures can tune wave propagation in space. Despite their
complexity, these applications hinge on an unusual volume vs. surface relation
of the kind mentioned before. The project involves young researchers and
students -- with attention to underrepresented minorities -- who receive a
broad, flexible training that provides access to science and technology as well
to professional activities outside academic institutions.
