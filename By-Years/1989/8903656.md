The crystalline core of the North Cascades experienced Cretaceous metamorphism,
plutonism and penetrative deformation followed by Paleogene orogenesis in the
northern part. However, it is not known whether the dominant kinematic pattern
was collision-related crustal shortening normal to the orogen or strike-slip
deformation parallel to the origin, nor is it clear if the Cretaceous and
Paleogene deformation record a single progressive deformation or two separate
events. This project will study the kinematics of structural fabrics and fault
zones within the core through mapping and study of small-scale kinematic
indicators and will constrain timing of deformation by dating plutons which show
varying degrees of deformation and metamorphism. Results are expected to provide
significant insights into the Cretaceous and Paleogene evolution of the Pacific
northwest.
