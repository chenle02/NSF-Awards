The objective of this research is to define the mechanisms involved in
regulation of transcription of bacteriophage Mu. Mu early transcription is
carried out by host function; middle transcription requires Mu functions and
replication; late transcription requires the middle operon product C. This
project will involve (1) isolation and analysis of phage containing middle
operon mutations, (2) definition of the role of a transactivator protein Tam in
activation of the middle promoter Pm by cloning of the tam gene, overproduction
and purification of Tam protein, and characterization of its mechanism of action
in an in vitro transcription system and (3) determination of the role of DNA
replication, overlapping transcription termination, and specific DNA binding
proteins (Mu repressors, transposase, and host IHF) on Pm activation by S1
nuclease and Pm-lacZ fusion analysis under differing levels of replication,
termination and binding proteins. The results should provide a detailed
understanding of the mechanisms of transcriptional control exhibited by this
novel bacteriophage, and thus should enhance our knowledge regarding this
important target for cellular regulation.
