The proposed research is comprised of three areas: (a) harvesting piezoelectric
energy from beam structure flutter in air flow, (b) Palatal Flutter Model for
Snoring/Apnea and (c) unobtrusive Wind Flow Monitoring by Laser Scintillation.
The proposed method will be validated by wind tunnel testing.

Intellectual Merit

This work makes original contributions to: (a) the Continuum Theory of Axial as
well as Normal Fluid Flow over a Structure such as a thin Beam: the Flutter
speed and LCO amplitude (b) optimization theory for cantilever beam parameters
to maximize the output power generated by the piezoelectric strips spanning the
beam structure in Flutter (c) derivation of the Laser scintillation diode
detector output zero crossing rate due to crosswind.

Broader Impact

The potential impact of includes the development of renewable energy methods
based on harvesting piezoelectric energy from aeroelastic flutter. The proposed
work has potential to provide quantitative understanding of Snoring/Apnea as
aeroelastic flutter of the soft palate and possible means of remedy.
