The electrical, optical, and mechanical properties of the boron nitride and
silicon carbide films will be investigated prior to and after x-ray synchrotron
radiation. The electrical measurement will be conducted on capacitor structures
consisting of highly doped (0.0025 -cm) p-type silicon substrates with overlying
films of aluminum to serve as the base electrode, the boron nitride dielectric,
and aluminum dots evaporated through a metal shadow mask. Only compositions
deemed suitable for x-ray membranes will undergo such tests. The dependence of
current density on electric field will be examined to determine the prevalent
conduction mechanism in the material as well as the influence of radiation dose
on the potential change in the electrical behavior.
