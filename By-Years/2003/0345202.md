This project is to implement a joint US-Europe workshop on technological
frontiers of smart structures, October 2-4,2003 in Strasburg, France. The
objective is to develop specific research projects on cooperative basis in major
theme areas of wireless communication and distributed sensor networks, MEMS and
NEMS, sensors informatics, and optics. NSF and ESF, the European Science
Foundation, jointly support the workshop.

A workshop report will be made available to the research community through
special forum at international conferences; bounded proceedings and CDs will be
disseminated.

This activity is aimed to advancing the program development of CMS's program on
Sensor Technology for Civil & Mechanical Systems
