Lewis and Clark College, a predominately undergraduate liberal arts college in
Portland, Oregon, is the recipient of ARI funds for the renovation of BoDine
Hall. Constructed in 1946, BoDine Hall is home to the Department of Biology. The
current configuration of the aging facility does not readily support research
programs in molecular biology, cell biology, population biology and botany.
Funds will be used to consolidate a group of laboratories into modern functional
lab suites, creating two large laboratories that will serve three faculty
members and their undergraduate research students. Existing walls that separate
spaces into smaller compartments will be removed to create open labs with common
spaces and facilities. A small tissue culture facility will be established, and
an underused dark room will be remodeled to serve a shared equipment room. In
conjunction to the renovation effort, funds will be used to replace the
Department's dilapidated greenhouse. By increasing opportunities for interaction
among students and faculty, the renovated labs will foster an active and
collegial research environment. With the duplication of space and facilities
being reduced, available research space will be efficiently utilized. It is
anticipated that a revitalized research environment will appeal to and entice
more students to become active researchers, thus promoting the College's mission
in science by ensuring that graduates are knowledgeable concerning the methods
and ideas of modern science.
