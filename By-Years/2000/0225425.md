The University of the Virgin Islands seeks NSF support to undertake a series of
planning activities designed to identify and address the competitive research
and education challenges facing the Virgin Islands. The principal outcome of
this effort will be development of a 10-year plan for strengthening the
Territory's Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) research and
education enterprise. Specific activities will assess existing STEM research
resources and strengths; identify potential institutional and territorial
barriers to development of competitive research; develop a priority list of
research areas and disciplines for development tied to UVI's strategic mission
and the Territory's development needs; and determine the human, financial and
technological resources required to succeed.

As the only institution of higher education in the U.S. Virgin Islands, the
University of the Virgin Islands fulfills a variety of community needs - from
community college to workforce training to liberal arts education to research
university. The strengthening of the research enterprise is clearly associated
with enhancing the Territory's ability to meet its workforce training needs and
take advantage of new opportunities for technology-based diversification of the
Virgin Islands' economy. The University will build and expand on a number of
existing collaborations with institutions and private sector organizations
within and outside of the Virgin Islands. Furthermore, plans for establishment
of a research and technology park will be developed to maximize these
collaborations and to grow and sustain the science, engineering and technology
enterprise in the Virgin Islands.
