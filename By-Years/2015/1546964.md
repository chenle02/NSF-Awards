This project will establish a new virtual institute for promoting and sustaining
cognitive wireless networking related research and education collaborations
between the U.S. and South Africa. A major emphasis is on the investigation of
the fundamental challenges related to low cost, reliable wireless broadband
access technologies for traditionally underserved areas using dynamic spectrum
access/sharing/management techniques that exploit spectrum (e.g., T.V.) white
spaces (WS). By providing an umbrella that gathers the knowledge learned from
past collaboration experiences, enhances ongoing projects through cross-
fertilization, and spurs new projects through virtual and physical meetings and
activities, this project will enhance the capability in absorbing research
knowledge from other global players on the forefront of research, and will
increase the potential for the development of transformative research ideas. It
will also act as a meeting place where individuals from all the stakeholders can
locate possible partners, make announcements, and share ideas related to
wireless research, including industry organizations, federal agencies,
government laboratories and academic institutions. The focus of the institute is
on dynamic spectrum access and related technologies, which is a topic of
national priority to both countries, and will benefit from collaborative
international science research activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The virtual
institute will provide an environment for creative international collaboration
that will leverage the synergies and resources for research and education in the
two countries in order to accelerate the rate of development of research
innovations and the development of talent and work-force capable of excelling in
the a new highly interconnected world. The technical focus of the institute,
wireless spectrum efficiency, intellectually aligns along the interests of
researchers in the two countries, as well as the countries national priorities.
The institute employs a number of activities including: (a) a web portal that
provides services and content to participants, (b) physical and virtual PI
meetings, (c) physical and virtual student investigator meetings, (d) yearly
summer schools and (e) graduate student exchange.
