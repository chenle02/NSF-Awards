Rapid solidification of oxide ceramics is a novel processing technique which
can yield materials with microstructures and properties which cannot be obtained
by other processing techniques. This proposal is for the purchase of an
induction heating unit to heat oxides to their melting point and then rapidly
solidify them. These materials have enormous potential for structural, magnetic,
electrical, and superconducting applications as well as producing glasses of
unique compositions. Two classes of oxide systems, ZrO2 containing ceramics and
MBa2Cu3O7-x (M=Y,Dy,Gd) superconductors will be melted by induction heating and
rapidly solidified by twin roller quenching. These materials will be examined by
differential thermal analysis, scanning and transmission electron microscopy and
x-ray diffraction.
