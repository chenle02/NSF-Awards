The project examines the structure and function of dynamic networks by
formulating and analyzing probabilistic models for temporally evolving networks
and processes occurring on them. In addition, the project seeks practical and
efficient statistical methods for network inference. The project is primarily
motivated by national security concerns surrounding counter-terrorism and
cybersecurity, but outcomes should be directly relevant in biological, social,
and physical science applications as well as mathematical areas of probability
theory, combinatorics, and graph theory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cybersecurity and
counter-terrorism efforts motivate three main technical objectives: (I) to
establish a mathematical theory that explains both structural phenomena and
temporal dependence in real world networks, (II) to develop efficient
computational techniques for inferring networks from data, and (III) to analyze
how structural changes affect processes that occur on networks, such as spread
of disease, epidemic thresholds, and dissemination of information. Achievement
of these outcomes will rely on computational tools as well as mathematical
techniques from combinatorics, algebra, percolation theory, probability, and
statistics
