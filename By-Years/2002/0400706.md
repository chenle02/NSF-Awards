This award provides partial support for the purchase of a high-speed tabletop
ultracentrifuge in the Biology Department at Colorado State University. The
instrument will allow: (1) fast separations, (2) the separation of many small
volume samples simultaneously, and (3) analytical scale gradient centrifugation.
A number of research projects in the areas of Plant Biology, Cell and
Developmental Biology, Transport Physiology, and Phytoremediation will be
supported by this equipment. Applications for the ultracentrifuge include:
localization of transporters, receptors and regulators in sub-cellular
compartments; development of transport assays; cosedimentation assays for
cytoskeletal elements; separation of polysomal fractions; isolation of RNA-
protein complexes; clearance of cell free extracts; and gradient centrifugation
of nucleic acids. Life science education and research are at the core of the
overall scholarly activity at Colorado State University, and the equipment will
also enhance the experience of students both in REU programs and in upper
division cell biology classes.
