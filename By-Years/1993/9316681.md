This proposal has two primary segments. The first is devoted to various topics
in statistical mechanics, including photochemical experiments on DNA and
zeolite, finite size scaling, self organized criticality, directed percolation,
and nonequilibrium phenomena. The second concerns a study of the quantum
measurement problem, and also some applications of Feynman path integrals. ***
