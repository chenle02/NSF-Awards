Rubel 9320624 This project supports the research of a team of cultural
anthropologists studying how people in two Mexican communities conceive of
respiratory disease in general and pulmonary tuberculosis in particular. Using a
quantitative technique of consensus analysis, the project will interview two
cohorts of patients: TB sufferers, and patients who have not been diagnosed with
that specific disease but who exhibit respiratory symptoms. The specific
hypotheses to be tested relate to how individuals adapt their folk understanding
of a well-defined disease to the biomedical model which they are exposed to
during treatment -- whether persons more expert in their own folk theory are
better able to learn a different, biomedical theory. This project is important
because many local populations have folk models of disease; advances in our
understanding of how individuals holding these models adapt in response to
specific experiences and information can help design delivery procedures which
increase people's compliance with medical treatments. ***
