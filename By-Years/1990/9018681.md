This is an expedited award the goal of which is the development of a set of
exercises and projects to be conducted on a modern desk-top computer or
workstation to significantly improve the engineering educational process. The
proposed research will focus in the engineering subject area of signal
processing, but the techniques that could be developed will have broad
applicability in engineering education. Six highly experienced faculty members
at five different universities will collaborate in this research to organize,
write, test, and produce a book of exercises for use with a normal signal
processing course. These exercises will use the computer in a fundamentally
different way to utilize the numerical and graphical power of the computer
together with a modern interactive software system as the basis of an improve
engineering educational methodology.
