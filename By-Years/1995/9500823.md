DMS-9500823 Rauch Global regularity and short wavelength asymptotic expansions
of nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equations arising, in particular,
in the modelling of intense lasers and fluid dynamics are the central themes of
the proposal. One goal for both methods is to understand better the focussing
into long lived filaments that is observed in intense ultra brief laser pulses.
The derivations of estimates proving regularity or breakdown of solutions, and,
the study of nonlinear geometric optics expansions near focal points are key
objectives. The objective is to study the solutions of fundamental equations
describing the propagation and interaction of intense waves. These equations
cannot be solved exactly so incisive approximate methods together with rigorous
qualitative methods are developed. Two problems of particular interest are the
interaction of intense lasers with matter, and, complex fluid flows. A goal is
to develope methods related to the classical ideas of ray optics. Such methods
have already played an important role in the discovery and analysis of new
phenomena.
