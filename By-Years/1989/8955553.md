The College of Notre Dame of Maryland will initiate an 8-week, residential,
Young Scholars project in the Life Sciences for 30 girls in grade 12. In
SANDALS-TEAMS, students in Baltimore City public and private schools sample
college life and engage in laboratory activities and research. Biotechnology is
the theme of courses in microbiology, biochemistry, chemistry, mathematics,
computer science, field/career experiences, and workshops in academic skills.
Students work for three weeks in public or private research facilities, and
apply scientific methodology to research a topic in biotechnology related to
coursework. Participants earn $50/academic week, and $75/research week. A
follow-up program provides academic and motivational reinforcement activities.
SANDALS- TEAMS is a cooperative venture of the College of Notre Dame of Maryland
and the Baltimore City Schools. There is a $25 application fee.
