This research deals with the development of high speed, high precision signal
processing circuits using parallel analog circuitry. The ability of analog
circuits to achieve high speed signal processing is well known. However, high
speed has generally been achieved at the expense of low precision, making high
speed analog circuits impractical for many important signal processing
applications such as filtering and simulation. The low precision of high speed
analog circuits results from the inability to control the physical properties of
the devices, such as transistors and capacitors, that the circuits are
constructed from. In this work, parallel circuits that achieve the required
functionality independent of the device physics used are researched. These
circuits are designed to perform a large variety of signal processing functions
and are made very precise by high speed training after fabrication. Many
parallel analog designs using CMOS devices are made to demonstrate the
technique.
