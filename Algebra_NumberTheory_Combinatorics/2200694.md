Number theory is one of the oldest branches of mathematics, and is concerned
with the study of properties of the integers and their generalization, including
questions about prime numbers and their distribution. Arithmetic Algebraic
Geometry is a modern subfield of Number Theory which deals with the study of
integral solutions to polynomial equations, and their geometric properties. In
recent years, Shimura varieties have become a main object of study in arithmetic
geometry, and a crucial tool in the solution of many outstanding problems in
Number Theory, such as Fermat's Last Theorem and its generalizations. This
project pursues new applications of the theory of Shimura varieties to the study
of some central problems in arithmetic geometry. The research projects include
training opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students.

The Langlands' correspondences explore the connections between Galois
representations and automorphic forms. The research in this project will develop
new methods to establish congruences and construct p-adic families of
automorphic forms in the arithmetic setting, specifically on unitary Shimura
varieties, and will have applications to the study of the associated Galois
representations, and Serre weight conjectures. The arithmetic Schottky problem
refers to the study of Jacobians of curves among abelian varieties. The research
focuses on the study of discrete invariants of Jacobians in positive
characteristics and of their behavior as the prime varies. The theory of Shimura
varieties naturally occurs in this context when one focuses on the study of
Jacobians of curves with extra automorphisms. The principal investigator will
prove generalizations of Elkies' landmark result on the existence of infinitely
many primes of supersingular reduction for elliptic curves to Jacobians of
curves of genus 4 and higher. In the new instances, the crucial role that the
modular curve plays in Elkies' work will be played by suitable unitary Shimura
curves which are known to arise as special families of cyclic covers of the
projective line, branched at four points.
