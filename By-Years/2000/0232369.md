This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
gas permeation process and membrane to separate olefin/paraffin mixtures in
which a multilayer multifunctional membrane configuration ensures high
selectivity, high olefin productivity, good mechanical stability, excellent
impurity tolerability, and long-term operational reliability. Hollow fiber
membrane modules will be developed to enhance the olefin permeance 2~10-fold
compared to those by conventional polymer facilitated transport membranes in
addition to much enhanced olefin/paraffin selectivity. This membrane system has
long-term stability and reliability to dry feed containing trace amounts of H2,
C2H2, and/or H2S that cannot be treated by traditional membrane processes.

Compared to the other membrane processes, this process is more promising and
cost-effective. If successfully developed, it could be applied very widely to
olefin/paraffin separations.
