Under its previous NSF grant, the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)
expanded its Questionaire Design Research Laboratory and associated activities
into a national laboratory and program of research on cognition and survey
measurement. These developmental efforts were conducted in close collaboration
with university scientists working both at their home facilities and on-site at
NCHS. In addition to its central leadership role, NCHS will prepare in the next
two years to assume fiscal responsibility for the entire project. NSF, which in
turn will be phasing out its support, will direct its funding primarily to the
Visiting Scientist Program. The contributions which the latter already has made
to the advancement of survey research, augurs well for its continuing influence
as the project enters its post-developmental stage.
