Experiments will be conducted on dense laser produced plasmas embedded in a
background plasma of considerably lower density (by factor of ~ 1/1000). There
are two objectives. The first is the study of the interaction of intense
microwaves (microwave absorption and heating) with the dense plasma that can
have density gradients parallel or perpendicular to the magnetic field. The
second is a study of the deposition of energy and momentum of colliding dense
plasma blobs in the background plasma. Both of the experiments address
fundamental problems in plasma physics and also have applications to space
science such as ionospheric heating and coronal mass ejections.
