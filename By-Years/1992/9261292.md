The objective of this research is to develop a versatile simulator more multi-
phase fluid flow in porous media. A general, non-isothermal compositional
formulation allowing chemical transport in all phases will be used. The model
will incorporate state-of-the-art numerical schemes to provide solutions in a
wide variety of practical problems. The resulting simulator may be used to model
chemical spills, leaky fuel tanks, and improper waste disposal practices.
