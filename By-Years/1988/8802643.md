This project is research in mathematical physics. The main thrust is
quantization, which involves the replacement of scalar quantities of physical
interest by linear operators on an appropriate space. Professor Gutkin will
continue his work on integrable models of quantum field theory, especially on
models related to the quantum nonlinear Schroedinger equation. The emphasis of
the work will be on findiing connections between the method of intertwining
operators and the quantum inverse scattering method.
