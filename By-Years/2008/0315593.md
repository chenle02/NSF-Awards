This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
supports research by Dr. Clifford P. Kubiak at the University of California at
San Diego to study the phenomenon of dynamical averaging of infrared (IR)
spectra by ultrafast electron transfer (ET) in intervalence charge transfer
complexes. Through systematic studies of experimentally adjustable parameters
(ligands, solvent, etc) the crucial factors controlling ET rates and dynamical
averaging of vibrational spectra will be defined. Spectroscopic studies of
dynamical averaging of IR spectra by electron exchange will be undertaken to
complete a self-consistent physical picture of the phenomenon, and to test the
reliability of existing theories of electron transfer at the poorly understood
threshold between weakly localized and fully delocalized behavior. The first
studies to compare electron transfer and hole transfer within similar
coordination complex frameworks will be undertaken. New synthetic studies will
be directed toward complexes that can be used to study extremely rapid charge
transfers through supramolecular assemblies, and over extended solid state
materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the origins of electron transfer
processes, their dynamics, and the relationships that can be extended from
molecular systems to bulk materials, and vice versa, touch on several of the
important biological and technological systems where electron transfer is vital.
The research will continue to involve undergraduate men and women through the
UCSD undergraduate research mentor program. The project will also be interfaced
with existing outreach programs at UCSD for the recruitment of underrepresented
groups into Ph. D. programs. &lt;br/&gt;
