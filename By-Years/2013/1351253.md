1351253 - Gagnon

The overall goal of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program grant
is to develop inexpensive and portable biosensors for rapid, sensitive and
specific label-free multiplexed biomolecular detection. The possibility of
miniaturizing biosensing systems which use miniscule quantities of expensive
reagents and precious samples, provide faster analyses to patients and doctors,
and do not require a trained technician to operate has immediate applications in
preventing disease in developing countries, biowarfare/anti-terrorism
applications, environmental monitoring, point-of-care diagnostic testing and for
basic biological research.

A major obstacle towards accomplishing this goal is the lack of an available
biosensor that is rapid, sensitive and specific to small concentrations of
target biomolecules, yet does not require the labeling of probes or optical
microscopy, and can operate without the need for complex and bulky supporting
instrumentation. This project will address existing challenges by focusing on
the development of novel electrokinetic biosensors for biomolecular detection at
liquid interfaces.
