This project involves the dissertation research of a cultural anthropology
student from Emory University. The student will study noncompliance with medical
advice and therapy among Hmong immigrants in Fresno, California. The hypotheses
that perceptions involved in the medical encounter differ between medical
professionals and patients, and that perceptual differences and the structure of
medical practice affect outcomes of the medical interaction and patient's health
will be investigated. The project will focus on surgeons as representative of
medical professionals, and the Hmong as representative of a non-western
population. In addition to general participant observation in the hospital and
the community, a total of 50 medical encounters will be videotaped and 150
interviews will be conducted , 50 each with surgeons, Hmong patients in a Fresno
hospital, and Hmong persons in the community. Initially diagnoses of
appendicitis and bone fracture will be selected as a sample. Measures will be
recorded of Hmong patient medical decision-making and socio-economic background
as well as physician time and quality of interaction with patients. The patient
compliance as well as the health outcome will be recorded, and the student will
look for patterns of variation according to age, gender, education, past
experience, acculturation, physician's age, gender, training and past
experience. This research is important because medical practice is becoming more
dependent on high technology which is more difficult for patients to understand
without more extensive preparation and interpretation. Advances in our
understanding of misunderstandings between patients and physicians in this
extreme case of surgeons and immigrants is likely to provide good ideas for
investigating the more general situation of doctor-patient communication.
