This project will provide a summer's research experience for eight
undergraduate geology majors. Of the participants, three to four of the students
and two of the faculty involved, will be from schools other than Furman. These
outside participants will be drawn from the geology programs of schools that
belong to two consortia of which Furman is a member. Faculty involved will work
with one or two students to direct them in a 9-week research effort. As the
summer progresses, the student will be encouraged to become increasingly more
independent. The goals of each effort will be to produce valid verifiable
results that will contribute to the body of knowledge in geology and that can be
presented to the scientific community in the form of a presented paper or
journal article.
