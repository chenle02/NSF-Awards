A group of institutes, centers, and universities throughout the country will
sponsor a summer school in Santa Fe, New Mexico during June 1990. The goal of
the summer school is to provide graduate students and postdoctoral fellows with
an introduction to the study of "complex" behavior in mathematical, physical,
and living systems. The themes for this year's summer school will be: (i) the
nature of chaos, disorder, or randomness in a variety of physical and
mathematical systems; (ii) pattern formation in physical, chemical and
biological systems; and (iii) cognition and computational approaches to brain
and cognitive function. The four-week school will consist of short courses
together with seminars, computer workshops, and laboratory projects
supplementing the lectures. The material presented at the school is intended to
be appropriate for advanced students with graduate-level training in the
mathematical, physical, biological, or computer sciences and a strong
mathematical background.
