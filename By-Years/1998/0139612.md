This award provides funding to the University of Florida for a renewal of a
three-year, REU Site in Design and Construction of Autonomous Robots and Machine
Learning, under the direction of Dr. Antonio Arroyo. This thirteen-week summer
program will involve twelve students annually in individual state of the art
research projects in autonomous robots and machine learning. In addition, the
participants will receive training in technical presentations and writing, give
weekly semi-formal design reviews, bi-weekly progress reports throughout the
summer, write a final research report, and learn about ethics in research
through seminars and industry field trips. .
