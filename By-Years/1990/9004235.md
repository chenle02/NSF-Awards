Howard University will host and jointly organize with Santa Clara University
Third International Conference on Amorphous and Crystalline Silicon Carbide and
Related Materials. It follows the successful first and second ICACSC at Howard
and Santa Clara Universities respectively. The primary sponsors are the National
Science Foundation, The Office of Naval Research, and IEEE Washington Section-
Electron Device Group. This conference will bring together distinguished
American and foreign researchers in the growth, characterization, and
fabrication of crystalline and amorphous SIC devices and related materials.
These workers will present their current research and exchange new ideas on
various approaches to current problems in the realization of wide bandgap
devices and circuits.
