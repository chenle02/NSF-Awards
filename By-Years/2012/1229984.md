This award supports the Univeristy of North Carolina Greensboro Regional
Mathematics and Statistics Conference which will be held at UNCG on November 3,
2012. The main goal of the UNCG Regional Mathematics and Statistics Conference
is to provide a venue for students at all levels to share and experience
research in the field of mathematics and statistics. This conference started as
an annual undergraduate student conference in 2005 and has now expanded to
include graduate researchers since 2009. The conference is completely focused on
student research. We showcase this aspect of the conference by having only one
plenary speech by an expert faculty and rest by students. The conference has
established a tradition of attracting active student researchers and their
faculty mentors from North Carolina and Virginia. The NSF support will allow us
to attract participants from the entire Southeastern Atlantic region. The
conference website
is:&lt;br/&gt;http://www.uncg.edu/mat/rmsc/.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
opportunity for personal interaction among students and between students and
faculty is a hallmark of our conference. These interactions enhance the research
infrastructure and are essential for the success of student research and for
training a new generation of mathematicians and statisticians. Moreover, due to
the funding of NSF we have been able to support women and minorities, currently
underrepresented in mathematical research. Students from these underrepresented
groups accounted for about half of the supported participants.
