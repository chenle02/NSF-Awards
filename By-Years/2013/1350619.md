The basic nature of encryption has always been all-or-nothing: anyone who is
privy to the secret key can decode and recover the entire data; but, without the
key, nothing can be revealed. In other words, the only useful action that could
be performed on encrypted data was decryption using the secret key. In the
modern world of cloud computing, we store much of our personal data in the
cloud, and perform computations on them remotely. The numerous security concerns
with cloud storage and computation raise a number of challenging questions: Can
we encrypt data and run computations on it without decrypting? Can we encrypt
programs and allow users to execute them without discovering any details about
their internal operations, other than the eventual result?

This project is dedicated to the study of the paradigm of computing on encrypted
data and programs, and the design of fundamental cryptographic primitives
underlying this broad goal. Specifically, it focuses on three major
cryptographic primitives: (i) fully homomorphic encryption, which enables
computations on encrypted data; (ii) functional encryption, which enables
expressive access control; and (iii) program obfuscation, which lets us hide the
structure of programs while preserving their functionality. The overarching goal
is to develop constructions of these cryptographic primitives that achieve a
high degree of efficiency, but also guarantee security under well-studied
cryptographic assumptions. Towards this end, the project explores both software
and hardware techniques, and the use of novel mathematical tools from algebra,
geometry and number theory.
