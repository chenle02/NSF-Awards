Problems in Complex Analysis

ABSTRACT

The investigator plans to continue his research in complex analysis. This has
two parts, several complex variables and complex dynamics.

The investigator has several graduate students who will perform research on and
write their Ph.D theses on projects related to the proposal. His current
students are Alina Andrei, Krastio Lilov, Han Peters, Feng Rong and Marie
Snipes. Two of these are females. As in the past, the investigator also plans to
involve undergraduates in REU projects related to his research. The last two of
these, from the summer of 2003 were Bryan Abbe and Ben Ward, two undergradutes
from the University of Michigan.
