The project is concentrated around the following topics: 1.Conformal
superalgebra encodes an axiomatic description of the operator product expansion
in conformal field theory. 2.Representation theory of finite Lie pseudoalgebras.
The next goal is representation theory of finite simple Lie pseudoalgebras and
the corresponding cohomology theory. 3.Representation theory of linearly compact
Lie superalgebras and the Standard Model. The next challenge is to build their
representation theory. 4.Integrable representations of affine superalgebras and
near modular functions.

This is a proposal in the area of mathematics known as Lie Algebras. Lie
algebras are one of the tools mathematicians use to study all kinds of
symmetries that occur in nature. In recent years, infinite-dimensional Lie
algebras have been used to describe the symmetries of subatomic particles. The
main objective of the project is to explore connections of the theory of
infinite-dimensional symmetries to other fields of mathematics and to
theoretical physics. It is hoped that this will lead to a better understanding
of the structure of quarks and leptons
