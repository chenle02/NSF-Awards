The Introductory University Physics Project (IUPP) is designed to develop and
promote new models for the calculus-level introductory physics course. Key goals
are a reduction in the number of topics covered and the integration of
contemporary physics into the course content - all of which is organized around
a coherent "story line." Phase III of IUPP is directed towards model development
and classroom testing. Five models are being tested in classrooms of 2-year
colleges, 4-year colleges, and universities that have expressed an interest to
be test centers. As these models are tested, each is being evaluated by a group
specifically organized for this purpose. When the formal activities of the
project come to an end, the IUPP Steering Committee will publicize the results
and encourage the use of the finished models in other institutions until
commercial textbooks and other materials are finished and become available.
