One of the great scientific challenges of this century is to describe accurately
complex processes such as climate change, contaminant flow, genomics, and even
social media and finance. The main obstacle to one's understanding of these
processes is that they depend on many parameters or variables. This not only
complicates their mathematical description but also inhibits the use of modern
computational tools for their accurate prediction. This research puts forward
new mathematical ideas based on sparsity and model reduction to determine the
importance of the various parameters and derive simpler models that still
accurately describe the underlying process. This in turn leads to more accurate
and less costly computational models that can be implemented with today's
computational resources. It also studies how to assimilate observational data to
improve models and even suggests the most effective new data sites.

The development of numerical methods for such high-dimensional problems faces
the so-called curse of dimensionality, which says that traditional methods are
doomed to fail. This has led to the development of myriad new techniques in
analysis, computer science, and numerical computation based on ideas such as
sparsity, compressed sensing, variable reduction, anisotropic smoothness, sparse
grids, discrepancy theory, hashing, tensor approximation, reduced modeling, and
manifold learning. This project describes the family of parametric functions to
be numerically recovered as a high-dimensional manifold and then seeks to
develop techniques for querying the manifold that lead to low-dimensional
approximations of the manifold described either by reduced bases or by high-
dimensional polynomial expansions. It also seeks to describe how high-
dimensional observational data on a state of the manifold can be fused with the
reduced model leading to an even more accurate description of the state. The
successful completion of this program will lead to numerical methods which can
be implemented on-line for executing a fast query of the manifold for any
prescribed set of parameters.
