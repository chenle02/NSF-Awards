9358452 Curtis This award will focus on the scale-up of chemical production from
plant tissue cultures. The potential of plant tissue cultures as sources of
biologically active chemicals is exemplified by taxol, an anti-cancer drug
recently approved by the FDA for treatment of ovarian cancer. Taxol is isolated
from the bark of the Pacific yew tree. The yields from this tree are relatively
low and several trees are required to treat a single patient. The tree is also
slow growing, ie., it requires 100 years to mature, and has a very limited area
of distribution. Plant cell cultures may provide an alternative for the
production of taxol as well as other plant derived products, and thus provide a
means of overcoming limitations in natural resources. ***
