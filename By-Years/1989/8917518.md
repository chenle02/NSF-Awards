The resource potential of deep-water marine minerals has been brought into focus
with the establishment of 200-mile offshore Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) by
the world's coastal and island nations. A variety of programs is currently
underway in the United States and several other nations for evaluating the
potential deep seabed mineral resources that exist within national
jurisdictions. Collection of outcrop samples from consolidated seabed mineral
deposits is essential for deposit characterization but is a tedious and
inaccurate process with presently available technology. Dredging, which is still
the only common method, is notoriously imprecise and biased toward collection of
protruding and loose rocks rather than representative in-place material. The
project proposed here has the potential to replace dredging for reconnaissance
surveys of hard seabed mineral deposits with a precise, rapid and unbiased
method based upon an untethered free-fall sampler.
