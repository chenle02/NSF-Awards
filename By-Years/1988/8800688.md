There is a dearth of measurements on the dynamics and chemistry of the
mesosphere and lower thermosphere, which are the regions in the 70 to 120Km
altitude range, because the region is too low for satellites and too high for
balloons. The region is closely coupled to the stratosphere below and the upper
thermosphere above, and is strongly affected by tides and waves propagating up
from the lower atmosphere, and particle precipitation and electric currents
originating in the magnetosphere. An opportunity to obtain measurements of the
winds, waves and temperature structure of this region has arisen, using an
advanced optical interferometer on loan from the University College London, to
be set up at a mountain site in Utah. The measurement will be supported by
global numerical modelling activities in the USA and UK.
