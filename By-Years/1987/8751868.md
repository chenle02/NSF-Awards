The Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History will design, construct and
circulate a 3,000 square foot travelling natural history exhibition on the
biology of sharks to 15 museums and more than 1,000,000 visitors nationwide. The
exhibition will include mounted specimens, artifacts, models and replicas, and
interactive exhibition elements. It will provide visitors with a picture of the
undersea world of sharks, their diversity and abundance; with an understanding
of the basic biology of sharks, including sharks' differences from bony fish,
their fossil and current natural history, reproduction, and behavior; and with
an appreciation of the interaction between sharks and humans in history, in
myth, and in man's current intensive use of ocean environments. A teacher's
guide and school loan study kits of objects and artifacts will be available in
each museum location. Substantial prior analysis of visitor misconceptions about
sharks has been done, and formative evaluation will be used to select exhibit
components and interactive technologies. The $400.00 cost share is 52% of the
project total.
