The Cornell University Biological Field Station is located on one of the
Northeast's largest freshwater lakes and is internationally recognized for
research on the role of fish predators in ecosystem structure and function. The
facility has been designated as part of the Experimental Ecological Reserve
network of field sites dedicated to long.term experimental research. Research
designed to quantify the role of fish predation in structuring the aquatic
community spans nearly three decades at the Station and represents one of the
longest records of its type in North America. A combination of a well.equipped
facility, a commitment to long.term research, and a dedicated research staff has
resulted in numerous peer.reviewed publications and a 28.year data set on Oneida
Lake. This project will provide funds to replace a vessel on loan from the New
York State Department of Environmental Copnservation. The vessel is key to the
continued development of multidisciplinary research on Oneida Lake and is
necessary to maintain the long.term commitment to determining indices of fish
abundance that was begun in 1957.
