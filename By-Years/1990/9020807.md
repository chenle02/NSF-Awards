Current theories emphasize that perceivers rely heavily on their general
knowledge in making judgments about specific people. For example, stereotyping
is thought to involve the application of general knowledge about characteristics
of a social group as the perceiver makes judgments or forms expectations about
an individual who is a member of that group. However, this perspective requires
additional assumptions to account for observations, and does not account for
perceivers' judgments about an individual who is a member of two or more
distinct groups about whom stereotypes exist (e.g., a female Marine). This
proposal outlines four laboratory experiments and computer simulations to
develop and test a new theory of social judgment. This theory holds that
perceivers flexibly access and apply their knowledge about specific persons--in
addition to their general knowledge--to make judgments about other people. The
use of such exemplar information depends on aspects of the perceiver's goals,
past experiences, and group memberships as well as the current social situation.
This theory promises to shed new light on previously problematic aspects of the
stereotyping processes, and suggests a new set of directions for research on
person perception and social judgment in general.
