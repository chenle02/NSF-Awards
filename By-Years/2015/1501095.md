This project belongs to the field of dynamical systems, which aims to understand
long-term behaviors of movements that take place over time in a geometric space
and are governed by a fixed set of mathematical rules. The theory of dynamical
systems has its roots in celestial mechanics and has become an important tool in
many other scientific fields. The proposed research deals with a special class
of dynamical systems, where the rules governing the movement form a sufficiently
large group so that a point is allowed to move in one of several possible ways
in each step. In such cases, there is often a small collection of possible
structures that remain unchanged over time. The goal of this project is to
determine such structures. The PI will conduct research on the topic,
collaborate with other researchers, work with graduate and undergraduate
students, and disseminate ideas developed in the project. This research will
study dynamical systems of group actions. The principal objects are actions on
tori, nilmanifolds and other homogeneous spaces by higher-rank commutative
groups or by lattices in higher-rank semisimple Lie groups. These actions are
often expected to have rigidity, a phenomenon characterized by the scarcity of
invariant structures under the action. The main objective is to classify such
group actions under suitable assumptions, as well as invariant structures under
these actions. The method of the research will combine tools from ergodic
theory, smooth dynamics and representation theory.
