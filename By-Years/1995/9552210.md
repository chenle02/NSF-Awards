This project is enhancing the school's Parallel Processing Laboratory by
supporting students' laboratory activities for undergraduate courses related to
parallel processing. The laboratory supports parallel processing on different
parallel architectures and in different parallel programming paradigms. The
laboratory is equipped with a multiprocessor that provides efficient support to
symmetric multithreaded parallel processing, a new technology in developing
massively parallel processors. In addition to the existing multitransputer
system for practicing message-passing programming, this machine enables students
to practice shared-variable programming as well. The laboratory is also suitable
for graduate students to conduct independent study, graduate projects, and
research. The dissemination plan features a workshop attended by the faculty of
all interested colleges and universities.
