The International School of Cosmic Ray Astrophysics (ISCRA) is a biannual summer
school designed to provide an overview of the field to graduate students and
young postdoctoral scholars through both lectures and informal discussions with
Particle Astrophysics experts. This is the only regular Particle Astrophysics
summer school in the world and it has an excellent history of training future
leaders in the field. The 21st ISCRA course will take place in Erice, Italy,
from the 1st to the 7th of August 2018. The sessions will include discussions of
new experiments, new experimental results and the new understanding of those
results, emphasizing the multi-messenger approach to astrophysics. This award
will support the participation of US graduate students and young postdoctoral
scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theme of the 21st ISCRA is "Astroparticle
physics: yesterday, today, and tomorrow." Topics for discussion will include
neutrino astrophysics, gravitational waves, acceleration and interactions of
high energy particles and radiation, measurements of cosmic rays and gamma rays,
and future space- and ground-based experiments. Proceedings are published to
more broadly disseminate the results.
