This project will attempt to advance our fundamental understanding of Hopfield
neural networks - - a class of artificial neural network designed to minimize
complicated functions of a large number of variables. Hopfield networks solve
these problems very quickly, and have been applied to problems like the
traveling salesman problem (i.e., efficient routing systems), the N-queen
problem, bearing estimation, robot path finding, robot arm positioning, content
addressable memory, and others. Unfortunately, Hopefield nets are only
guaranteed to converge to a local minimum. Other techniques have been developed
to explore the solution space stochastically, to look for better solutions far
away from this local minimum; however, these techniques may be expensive. The
P.I. here will be extending his recent work on a different approach - - to find
conditions which insure that the Hopfield net will in fact find a global
minimum, and exploit these conditions in applications such as radar and sonar
detection.
