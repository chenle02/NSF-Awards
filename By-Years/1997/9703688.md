9703688 Mahowald The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables U.S.
scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty four months of research
abroad. The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the
use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions
abroad. This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research visit by
Dr. Natalie M. Mahowald to work with Dr. Knut Henning Rodhe at Stockholm
University in Sweden. Dr. Mahowald will construct and apply a coupled model for
the sources, entrainment, atmospheric transport and deposition of atmospheric
dust, driven by a combination of results from atmospheric general circulation
and ecosystem models for the last glacial maximum. The concentrations of mineral
dust in ice-cores exhibit large variations between glacial and interglacial
periods with higher concentration occurring during glacial periods. Atmospheric
dust may play an active role in the control of global climate change on the
glacial-interglacial time scale. Such control can be brought about by the
scattering of solar radiation back to space, by altering nutrient balances in
the ocean, and by lowering the albedo of snow and ice surfaces. ***
