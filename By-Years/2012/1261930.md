This early concept project seeks to build a partnership between two US
universities who are currently creating learning environments to support engaged
learning in STEM disciplines. This award will allow these researchers to begin a
collaboration with Finnish researchers at Turku University. The collaborative
partnership will allow the research team to collaboratively understand the
nature of engagement in complex STEM learning environments to develop better
methods for creating authentic learning systems across many settings and
contexts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this
project arises from how it informs our knowledge of how to retain and engage
students in learning tasks. These types of environments extend across the
learning spectrum from early years into college and also into the workforce. The
international collaboration serves to expand the network and skills of students
involved in the project. This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of
transforming the frontiers by helping the United States be globally competitive
through international partnerships. Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for
society is enabled by supporting the development of innovative learning systems.
