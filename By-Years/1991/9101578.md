Integer and mixed-integer programs arise in a wealth of applications ranging
from logistics to very large scaled integration design. Recent cutting plane
techniques have proven remarkably successful in the solution of integer
programs. Unfortunately, cutting plane techniques have not been applied with the
same frequency or success to mixed-integer programs. The goal of this research
is to develop the theory surrounding this technique as it relates to mixed-
integer programming and to implement algorithms that generate cutting planes for
mixed-integer programs. Ultimately, the goal is to solve large mixed-integer
programs using these algorithms. Applications of mixed-integer programming are
so extensive that advances in techniques for their solution will have far
reaching consequences extending across many disciplines. Additional objectives
include establishing a public domain library of mixed-integer programs and
providing developed algorithms to researchers.
