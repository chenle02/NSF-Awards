This award supports summer research by undergraduates at the Whitney Laboratory
of the University of Florida. Students pursue research related to ongoing
faculty research programs that study the physiology, anatomy, biochemistry and
molecular biology of various marine invertebrates and fishes. Students also
participate in weekly seminars and informal research presentations, as well as
discussions of scientific ethics and lectures and field trips that expose
students to the ecology of nearby marine ecosystems.
