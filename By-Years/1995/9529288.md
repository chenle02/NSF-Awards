9529288 Randolph The objective of this project is to study the mechanisms by
which pressure affects nucleation and growth in protein crystallization systems.
The goals of this research are to: (1) determine the generality of the favorable
rate and yield phenomena that have been observed for a limited set of proteins;
and (2) probe the roles of protein and solvent physical properties in the
crystallization process. ***
