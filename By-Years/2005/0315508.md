Zlatko Bacic of New York University is supported by the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to develop computational techniques for the
accurate quantum treatment of the vibrational dynamics of hydrogen-bonded
systems. Using Fermi's golden rule for bound-continuum transitions, lifetimes of
dissociating dimers and their final rotational and vibrational state
distributions will be calculated. A second focus is the vibration tunneling
dynamics of hydrogen-bonded dimers microsolvated in helium clusters, which will
be treated using quantum diffusion Monte Carlo simulations. Specific
applications include dimers of water, HF, and HCl.

This research will contribute to a detailed understanding of hydrogen-bonded
complexes in the gas and condensed phases. In extending our knowledge of
intermolecular interactions, better models of complex systems such as biological
assemblies can be developed.
