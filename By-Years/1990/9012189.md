With the development of complex information systems, the integration of
heterogeneous systems, and the availability of numerous online computer data
sources, it has become increasingly important that methods be developed that
consider the meaning of the data used in these systems. For example, it is
important that an application requiring financial data in US dollars does not
receive data from a source that reports in another currency. This problem is
further complicated by the fact that the meaning of data may change at any time.
To deal with this problem, information systems must have the ability to
represent data semantics and detect and automatically resolve semantic
conflicts. This research focuses on the representation and manipulation of data
semantics (i.e., metadata). This research develops: (1) a rule-based approach to
metadata specification, (2) query processing techniques that identify semantic
conflicts, (3) methods that use conversion routines to automatically resolve
these conflicts. When applied to source-receiver systems, these techniques
create a dynamic system environment that permits changes in data semantics.
Similarly, in heterogeneous information systems these techniques define a
dynamic schema integration environment where the integrated system can continue
to operate as the component systems independently modify data semantics.
