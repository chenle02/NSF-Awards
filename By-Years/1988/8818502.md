The abundance, community composition and feeding activity of zooplankton
determines the amount of organic matter which is either recycled within the
mixed layer or is transported to depth (non-utilized phytoplankton, fecal
pellets, carcasses, molts, mucous material or migrating animals). Past plankton
studies have focused on particular taxonomic classes or size categories of
zooplankton, thus missing the full complexity and trophic relationships of the
epipelagic zooplankton community. This research will comprehensively
characterize and quantify the entire epipelagic community and its consumption of
primary production in the open ocean in order to provide accurate assessments of
the flux of photosynthetically derived carbon.
