This three-year project is designed to develop a statewide network of K-4
mathematics specialists in Kentucky. A series of four extended in-service
seminars in the areas of number sense, geometry, measurement, and statistics,
will be developed and field tested. The seminars will be designed to be
consistent with the vision of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics
Standards, and will be disseminated widely. Regional teams of university
faculty, school supervisors, and K-4 teachers of mathematics will develop and
pilot the materials. These teams will also initiate inservice activities in
their region with local support, with the intention being to prepare 240
mathematics specialists throughout the state to conduct school-level inservice
using the project materials. The evaluation component focuses on changes in
teacher beliefs and classroom practice resulting from project participation. All
eight state universities in Kentucky are participating in the project. Cost
sharing will be provided by the University of Kentucky and local schools as 38%
of the NSF award.
