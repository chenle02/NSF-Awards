Abstract Girshick CTS-9529568 A request has been made for funding to support
fixed conference fees for invited speakers at the 1996 Gordon Research
Conference on Plasma Processing Science, to be held at New Hampton School in New
Hampshire during August, 1996. The meeting is expected to be attended by leading
figures in plasma processing, as well as by students and researchers who are
relatively new in their careers. The meeting will focus on the fundamental
science of plasmas in the context of industrial processes where they are used.
The emphasis will be on basic phenomena and research techniques rather than on
applications.
