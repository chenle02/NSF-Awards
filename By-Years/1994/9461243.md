This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses the important
area of programming support for high performance parallel computing. At present,
message-passing systems are the most widely used software systems for parallel
computing, particularly for scientific and engineering applications. Message
passing is conceptually quite straightforward and should be relatively easy to
apply. Unfortunately, however, the fact that today's message-passing systems are
based on the use of subprogram libraries, rather than on language-level
constructs, makes them much harder to use than they should be, particularly when
handling heterogeneous or unstructured data. In this research Scientific
Computing Associates Inc. seeks to develop suitable compiler technology to
handle many of the details of message-passing systems automatically, while still
preserving the ability of sophisticated users to control the low-level details
when that is required. They propose to investigate language-level front-end
systems that will, among other things: offer much cleaner syntax; handle many
general situations automatically; provide semantic support for compile-time or
link-time error checking; and reduce the amount of detailed understanding
required from the user.
