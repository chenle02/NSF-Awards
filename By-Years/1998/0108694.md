This project addresses basic issues of materials at nanoscale dimensions. The
research will investigate thermodynamic properties of Si nanostructures and
silicide interfaces using a new and highly sensitive calorimetric device. For
example, the phenomenon of melting point depression for surface-supported
particles can be measured for particles as small as 1000 atoms.&lt;br/&gt;The
focus is on understanding unique properties and behavior of nanometer-sized
materials. The approach is to measure thermodynamic properties of Si
nanostructures and silicide interfaces including structural stability and heat
capacity to establish a more complete picture of the material physics of
structures at these dimensions. Earlier investigations of magic number(integers
of atomic layers) nanostructures from metals to semiconductor Si nanostructures
will be extended by measuring the specific heat, melting temperature, and
associated enthalpy, as well as particle size using TEM. &lt;br/&gt;%%%
&lt;br/&gt;The project addresses basic research issues in a contemporary topical
area of materials science with high potential significance and technological
relevance. An important feature of the program is the integration of research
and education through the training of students in a fundamentally and
technologically significant area. The project is expected to provide unique
opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students to develop strong
technical, communication, and organizational/management skills through unique
experiences made possible by a forefront research environment. &lt;br/&gt;
