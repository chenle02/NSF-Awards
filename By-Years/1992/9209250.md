The objectives of this Career Advancement Award are to facilitate the principal
investigator's career transition from industry to a university environment;
enhance her research capability in computer-aided concurrent engineering; and to
support exploratory work on artificial intelligence based decision support for
cooperative design. The exploratory work will involve the design of a testbed
for simulating and analyzing the cooperative design process and for
experimenting with strategies for its decision support. The domain for this work
is the simultaneous process selection and design for manufacturability of thin-
walled parts. Interaction with industrial sponsors will be used to extend the
work to other environments.
