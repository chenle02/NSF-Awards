The University of Missouri-Columbia requested support from NSF to connect three
satellite campuses of Southwest Baptist University, a MOREnet higher education
member to the Internet. These campus sites are located at Springfield, Mountain
View and Salem. These sites will be connected through the Missouri Research and
Education Network. Combined, these campuses have an enrollment of nearly 1000
students. The campuses needs the Internet connection to be able to access
information resources throughout the state, the nation and the world. The
connection will benefit the faculty, staff students of these institutions as
well as the community in general. The award provides partial support of the
project for two years.
