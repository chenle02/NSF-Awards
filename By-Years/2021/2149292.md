This study uses process modeling to investigate the impact of the Agulhas
Current on the southern African shelves, the connectivity between the
circulations in the Agulhas Bank and the southern Benguela upwelling region, and
the sensitivity of these shelf regions to climate related changes of the wind
forcing. The central hypothesis is that shelf and deep-ocean interactions are
modulated by the transit of Agulhas eddies. The project will advance
understanding of the impact of these interactions on the Agulhas Bank and extend
it to the Benguela region. Understanding shelf and deep-ocean interactions in
the southern African region will contribute to the forecast of the impact of
climate change on the regional ecosystems and the potential feedbacks that those
ecosystems will have on the changing climate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
uses process-oriented modeling to characterize the shelf and open-ocean
interactions between the Agulhas Current, Agulhas Bank (AB), and Southern
Benguela Upwelling Region (SBUR) and to evaluate their sensitivity to climate
variability and climate change. The investigators hypothesize that the AC
controls the thermohaline structure of the AB and that it is the main driver of
the circulation in the outer- and middle-shelf regions. Wind stress forcing
controls the circulation in the inner shelf as well as the exchanges between the
AB and the SBUR. The project will investigate eddy-driven interactions between
the AC and the African continent and their effect on mixing and water mass
transformations along the AC path. It is anticipated that climate change will
increase the impact of shelf/open ocean interactions on both oceanic
realms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
