The objective of this research is to develop semiconductor laser sources of
terahertz radiationbased on GaAs/AlGaAs quantum-cascade superlattices. The first
goal is to realize lasers that can operate above room-temperature, which do not
exist presently. The approach is to utilize new design methodologies for
temperature-robust electron transport in quantum-cascade structures. The second
goal is to demonstrate the first hole-based quantum-cascade laser and
investigate hole-hole intersubband transport in valence band of semiconductors.
Hole-based intersubband lasers and detectors will allow surface-normal coupling
of radiation with enhanced quantum efficiencies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
intellectual merit is in new schemes of carrier transport for quantum-cascade
semiconductor superlattices. For electron-based designs, injectorless and
scattering-assisted injection schemes will be utilized that are expected to be
more temperature robust than the presently used resonant-tunneling injection
methods. For hole-based designs, radiative transitions between light and heavy
holes would be explored that enable light emission in the surface-normal
direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Room-temperature semiconductor terahertz lasers
will fill a critical gap for the underdeveloped terahertz spectrum, in
applications related to health, medicine and security. Outcomes of this research
will enable development of low-cost and compact instruments for terahertz
sensing and spectroscopy of chemical and biological species, such as drugs,
explosives, vaccines, proteins, pharmaceutical compounds, and terahertz imaging
for disease diagnosis as well as remote screening for defense and security. The
project will lead to interdisciplinary educational and research opportunities at
the undergraduate level. At the community level, concepts in photonics and
quantum-mechanics would be introduced in an annual optics workshop for
elementary/ middle-school students.
