"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5)." &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Nanotechnology Undergraduate
Education (NUE) in Engineering program entitled "NUE: Creating a Hands-On
Nanoscience and Technology Minor", at Florida Institute of Technology (Florida
Tech), under the direction of Dr. James Brenner, will create a unique and
innovative Nanoscience and Technology (NST) Minor program with the following
three objectives.&lt;br/&gt;1) Developing three new laboratory courses that
integrate research experience and a self-paced format,&lt;br/&gt;2) Creating
new, application-based experiments for the nanotechnology laboratory courses,
and&lt;br/&gt;3) Involving local high school students and their teachers in an
NSF program of research and outreach. This outreach program will impact five
hundred high school students annually.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project builds
upon Florida Tech's 2003 NUE award that funded the development of a novel
introductory nanotechnology laboratory course, which is currently in its sixth
year.
