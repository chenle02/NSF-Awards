9316133 Mackenzie The main goals of the proposed research are to evaluate
responses of the coupled carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur biogeochemical
cycles to climate and global change in the land- coastal margin system on
decadal to millennial time scales, and the contribution of this system to global
environmental change. This system will be in the future one of the world's most
disturbed because of human activities. Because of the great complexity of the
land-coastal margin system, it is necessary that observational programs for
individual ecosystems be complemented by data synthesis and modeling of behavior
of the system on a global scale. Herein we propose a research program to "aid"
in the accomplishment of this task. Carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur are
the four main building blocks (excluding oxygen and hydrogen) of organic matter,
and they are incorporated within certain proportions, known as the Redfield
ratios, by marine plankton and terrestrial vegetation. Thus, study of these
elemental components of the Earth-surface system is important in the context of
global change and biotic responses to change.
