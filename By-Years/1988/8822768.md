As part of her doctoral dissertation research, Ms. Melinda Allen will conduct
an archaeological and geological survey of the West coast of Aitutaki Island in
the Southern Cooks Islands. She will lay out transects running from the coast
inland, and conduct test excavations as well as an auger survey. Additional
excavation will take place in areas discovered to have high archaeological
potential. The data collected will permit a reconstruction of the geological
history of Aitutake and provide information on the island's earliest
inhabitants. The Polynesian islands, many separated from each other by long
stretches of water, were rapidly colonized from West to East by a seafaring
people. While the general outline of the colonization is clear, many of the
specifics remain unresolved. In particular it is not known whether the ocean
between Western and Eastern Polynesia provided a major barrier and if so, how
long it took to cross. The Southern Cooks lie at the Western extremity of
Eastern Polynesia. Although they have not as yet yielded relevant sites Ms.
Allen believes that a variety of geomorphological processes would have led to
deposition of sediment in the most likely areas of early habitation and thus
sites are buried. In this research she will determine depositional history of
Aitutaki and try to locate early remains. This research is important because it
will increase our understanding of the role mobility and migration play in human
adaptation. If successful it will also provide archaeologists with clues of
where and how to look for such sites on other Pacific islands.
