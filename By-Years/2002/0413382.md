Low-order models (LOMs) have played an important role in understanding of basic
mechanisms of atmospheric dynamics through a focus on key elements and retaining
only minimal number of degrees of freedom. LOMs are low-order systems of
nonlinear ordinary differential equations derived from basic equations of
atmospheric dynamics, commonly by the Galerkin method. Despite a number of
highly attractive features, the method does not prevent a LOM from violations of
fundamental conservation properties of the original equations, which often
results in unphysical behavior. In previous studies, the investigators have
developed a modular approach to constructing physically sound LOMs of
atmospheric circulations, in which classical mechanical systems, the Volterra
gyrostats (the simplest one being the celebrated Lorenz model of two dimensional
Rayleigh-Benard convection), serve as elementary building blocks. Systems of
coupled gyrostats avoid unphysical behavior by always conserving energy in the
inviscid, unforced limit.

At the same time, because the conservative part of most models in atmospheric
dynamics (e.g., the primitive, shallow water and quasi-geostrophic equations) is
Hamiltonian, maintaining the Hamiltonian structure in a LOM is viewed as an
effective way to retain in it the fundamental conservation properties of the
original system. As demonstrated in the Principal Investigators' preliminary
studies, the gyrostatic approach is particularly promising in this endeavor.
Under this project, an attempt will be made to develop useful Hamiltonian LOMs
for important fluid dynamical systems, beginning with Rayleigh-Benard convection
that provides the principal mechanism for mesoscale shallow convection.

Relatively simple gyrostatic (particularly Hamiltonian) LOMs inherently
possessing fundamental conservation properties of the fluid dynamical equations
will provide a new effective tool to further a scientific understanding of
essential mechanisms and their interaction in atmospheric dynamics.

From the Broader Impacts perspective, eventually this research could lend new
insights into issues of atmospheric predictability and, hence, limits to
forecasting.
