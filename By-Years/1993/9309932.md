9309932 Coulombe The nervous system is a communications network made up of
billions of individuals nerve cells. Signals are passed between individual nerve
cells within the nervous system and to other cells, such as muscle cells, by the
release of chemicals called neurotransmitters. More than 40 different
neurotransmitters have been identified and each of these chemicals has very
distinct effects within the body. In order to form a functional nervous system
it is essential that each nerve cell contain and release only the specific
neurotransmitters that are appropriate for it's particular function. The goal of
this project is to understand some of the ways that the body controls what
neurotransmitter substances are made by developing nerve cells. Earlier studies
examined one set of nerve cells that normally make a neurotransmitter substance
called somatostatin. When grown in culture, these nerve cells only produce
somatostatin when grown together with a specific type of muscle cells. These
particular muscle cells produce a substance called activin. Activin released by
cultured muscle cells appears to govern the nerve cell's production of the
neurotransmitter somatostatin. The experiments proposed here will further
investigate the role of activin in controlling neurotransmitter production
during normal development of the nervous system. Results of these experiments
will allow a greater understanding of how cell-to-cell interactions are used to
control neurotransmitter production in the developing nervous system and by
extension will contribute to an understanding of the basic mechanisms which
control dev elopment. *** ! !. !. F ( Times New Roman Symbol &amp; Arial j j j "
