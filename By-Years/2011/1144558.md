The PIs propose to measure and interpret U-Pb crystallization ages of a varied
suite of volcanic and plutonic rocks recovered from water depths of 300-3500m at
several hundred sites on the submerged and previously unsampled rifted
continental crust that underlies most of the southern Gulf of California. Many
samples were collected along traverses up fault scarps and across volcanic
features by a remotely operated vehicle; 50 dredge hauls also recovered igneous
rock. All relevant samples have been petrographically described and
geochemically analyzed. These samples record a long and complex magmatic history
in this region, which in the past 20 Myr has changed from a volcanic arc to a
subaerial intra-continental rift, been flooded by a marine incursion, and
developed a chain of axial basins growing by seafloor spreading. Radiometric
dates are needed to define this history, and to test hypotheses that up till now
have been solely derived from still-subaerial outcrops at the margins of the
rift. Existing dating show striking discordance between the age estimates,
hinting at interesting cooling histories with likely tectonic implications.
Targeted zircon (U-Th)/He and K-feldspar 40Ar/39Ar thermochronologic analyses
and modeling will constrain thermal histories, thereby contributing to
understanding rift tectonics including continental uplift and subsidence in the
gulf rift.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work will very likely deepen our
understanding of rifting history of the southern Gulf of California. Funding
will also provide research opportunities for graduate students, foster
collaboration with Mexican scientists and the results will be used in ongoing
education and outreach programs, such as SDSU's K-8 project.
