Adaptive control systems automatically adjust their controller settings to
compensate for changes in the process or environment. It is attractive for
difficult control problems where the process is poorly understood and/or changes
in unpredictable ways. One type of adaptive controller uses self-tuning control
(STC) mechanisms, which estimate model parameters on-line and adjust controller
constants based on the current parameter estimates. Much work has been done in
this area using linear models but little using non-linear models. A priori
knowledge of a particular system's nonlinearities will be used to design STC
strategies. The algorithms will be experimentally verified using a pilot size
distillation column. Another complex area is systems which have multiple inputs
and multiple outputs. Designing STC for such systems contitutes the second part
of this work.
