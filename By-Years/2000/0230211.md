The proposed research addresses the question "How will the coupled arctic
climate system respond to changes in riverine discharge of freshwater, and how
to the temporal and spatial variability of freshwater discharge and changes
therein interact with the dynamics of high latitude climate?". The project
proposes to perform a series of numerical simulations using existing models that
incorporate sea ice, atmosphere and ocean processes. Science questions will be
posed through model runs in which sea ice, ocean, and land surface models are
run off-line, and aspects of the off-line climatologies will be prescribed in
partially coupled runs of the fully coupled system. The results of the partially
coupled runs will be compared with results of fully coupled, ensemble climate
simulations in order to isolate the effects of interactions among the land, sea
ice, ocean and atmosphere.
