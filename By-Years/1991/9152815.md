The Electronics Engineering Technology (EET) department at Oregon Institute of
Technology offers Bachelor degrees in two programs: EET and L0ET (Laser Optical
Engineering Technology). This project equips a laboratory, shared by EET and
LOET, with two comprehensive, computer controlled, fiber optic measurement
systems. These systems provide for both optical and communication
characterization. The EET students use a realistic communication system complete
with a kilometer or more of channel length. The L0ET students use the same
communication system plus the ability to accurately and quickly measure the
optical properties of fibers. Computer automation of the system shortens the
data acquisition time and allows for more creative student activities.
