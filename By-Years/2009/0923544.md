This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award is awarded to the University of
Colorado for the development of a novel ultrastable atomic force microscope (US-
AFM) designed to address the pressing need in structural biology for an
atomically precise tool to study protein structure and conformational dynamics.
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is limited by unwanted mechanical drift between
the tip and sample. This limitation is exacerbated by environmental
perturbations, which occur in biologically relevant conditions (room temperature
in liquid). To be broadly applicable, operation and control of US-AFM needs to
be user-friendly, robust, and reliable for room temperature operation in liquid.
The resulting instrumentation allows the atomic sensitivity of AFM to be fully
exploited for a range of disciplines, including biology, physics, chemistry, and
nanotechnology. Student participation in this project is an outstanding research
and educational experience because of its multi-disciplinary nature. Results
from these studies will be presented by students and faculty at regional or
national meetings, and published in peer-reviewed journals.
