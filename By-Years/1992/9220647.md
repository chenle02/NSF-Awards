Many bacteria are able to move over solid surfaces (often these are biological
polymers such as agar, cellulose, chitin, pectin, or xylan) by a process termed
gliding. This is an important aspect of these organisms' central role in the
mineralization processes which so many "higher" forms of life are unable to
effect, but upon which they are dependent. The mechanism by which the gliding
bacteria accomplish this translocation remains a mystery; however, the
sulfonolipids first isolated and described in this laboratory are the first
molecules to be recognized as necessary (in the cytophagas an flexibacters) for
gliding motility. A cell-surface polysaccharide also plays an accessory role.
The current focus on the features of the cell envelope that are important in
cell translocation will include a peptidoglycan-associated protein and other
cell envelope features that change when a particular nongliding mutant regains,
reversibly, the ability to glide. %%% The question of how gliding bacteria glide
has been one of the most intractable problems in microbiology. There are no
morphological clues to the mechanism of gliding. A number of laboratories have
been working on the problem for many years, using both genetic and biochemical
approaches, with minimal success. The Leadbetter laboratory made a breakthrough
discovery when it was found that a particular nongliding mutant of Cytophaga
johnsonae had a defect in the pathway of biosynthesis of a novel sulfonolipid,
and that the nongliding phenotype could be reversed by the addition of the
appropriate metabolic precursor (cysteate) to the culture medium. This project
is a biochemical followup to that seminal discovery, and holds the promise of
actually deciphering the nature of the bacterial molecule(s) involved in the
gliding mechanism.
