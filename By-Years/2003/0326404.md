Proposal: 0326404&lt;br/&gt;PI: Lynette Hirschman&lt;br/&gt;Title: Evaluation
Bioinformatics Technology&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
focus of this effort is to put in place an international "challenge evaluation"
for text data mining, modeled after the successful CASP evaluations (Critical
Assessment of Techniques for the Protein Structure Prediction). An evaluation
will be implemented focused initially on two tasks: identification of
biologically significant entities; and extraction of relation information such
as interactions or identification of Gene Ontology terms in the literature. A
gold standard of training and test corpora will be obtained by using expert
annotated data from BIND, SWISS-PROT and other model organism databases. These
data sets will be made available to a wide community through a website.
Organizations in computational linguistics and information retrieval will also
be involved. The overall strategy is to focus on problems of importance to
working biologists, such as improved curation tools for biological databases,
and better access to textual information in both the literature and in curated
databases. This approach provides infrastructure and support to multiple
research groups. It also supports creation of training and test corpora to
support many machine learning and statistical pattern recognition
experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
