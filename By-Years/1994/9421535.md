9421535 Murdoch The University of California, Santa Barbara, proposes to
establish a Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (CEAS). The rational
for the CEAS is to carry out collaborative research on the major fundamental and
applied problems facing ecology, as defined by the nation's ecologists. The
Center will develop new techniques, especially in mathematical modeling,
intensive computation, visualization of ecological systems, and digital
representation of geographic variation in complex ecological phenomena. It will
provide special educational opportunities in new techniques and advances to
students and young scientists, and will disseminate the results of its research
to a broad class of potential users, including decision-makers and those
involved directly in resource-management and other environmental areas. The
Center will accomplish these goals by fostering individually based and
collaborative research projects, and by conducting workshops and conferences. It
is estimated that approximately 150 research ecologists will spend extended
periods of time at the Center, and a further 600 researchers and students will
participate in its conferences, workshops and training courses each year. The
CEAS will be managed by a Director, a Scientific Advisory Board comprised of
active members of the ecological community, and an External Liaison Committee
with membership drawn from academia, state and federal agencies, and the public
sector. Cost sharing with the California Trade and Commerce Agency and the
University of California is approximately $4.03 million over five years. The
University of California, Santa Barbara is an ideal setting for the CEAS because
it provides an intellectually stimulating environment, exceptional technical
expertise and facilities, and a physically attractive location and facility. In
addition, the UCSB proposal provided the strongest vision for a creative,
forward-looking Center that was designed to be highly flexible in order to meet
the needs of, and be high ly responsive to, the nation's ecological community.
