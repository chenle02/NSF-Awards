The primary goal of this research effort is to improve the effectiveness of
skill transfer, rehabilitation, and collaboration via haptic devices. To do so,
the PI will formulate requirements for shared control between humans and robots
in haptic systems designed for training, rehabilitation, and collaboration. An
experimental test-bed comprised of two commercial haptic devices with force
sensing capabilities will be employed throughout the project. The PI will study
two shared control system architectures for skill transfer. In the first, the
human acts as the novice or patient, and the robot serves as the expert. Control
schemes for the expert system (the haptic device) will be designed and analyzed
theoretically and experimentally. The second phase of the research effort will
explore human-robot-human interfaces. Here, the PI will focus on expert-novice
and therapist-patient teams, with a robotic system acting as the mediator
between the two. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this research
and education plan is that human factors and control system design will be used
to develop effective human-robot systems for skill transfer and rehabilitation.
A set of fundamental human-robot interaction issues will be addressed
theoretically and experimentally: (1) the design of system architectures for
effective skill transfer between humans and robots, (2) skill transfer between
human-human teams as a model for human-robot interaction, and (3) the design and
implementation of control algorithms that promote efficient skill transfer by
effectively controlling feedback to each member of the system.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this work are improved health care
through more efficient and effective robot assisted rehabilitation practices,
enhanced skill training for defense and surgical applications, and improved
understanding of human-robot interactions for skill transfer. Specific education
goals are to create innovative laboratory modules using haptic devices to
enhance student learning of important engineering concepts, reinvigorate an
introductory robotics course to include hands-on experiments with haptics and
robotics, and high school outreach that includes internships, days-on-campus,
and demonstrations using haptics to encourage students to pursue careers in
science and engineering. Each of these educational goals ties closely to the
PI's existing NSF support for curriculum enhancement, and further supports her
commitment to combining research and education into a cohesive and integrated
career plan&lt;br/&gt;
