Single crystal x-ray crystallography is the most powerful analytical method for
structure determination of solids. In synthetic inorganic, organic, bioinorganic
and organmetallic chemistry, single crystal x-ray diffraction is an invaluable
tool to characterize molecular structure. The information gained from the
knowledge of the molecular composition and structure helps to develop new
reactions of potentially general interest in catalysis or synthesis. This award
from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will help the Department of
Chemistry at the University of Louisville acquire an upgrade of their computing
facilities and the x-ray diffraction laboratory. Among the areas of chemical
research that will enhance by the acquisition are the following: 1. Sulfur
Chemistry within a Sulfidomolybdenum(v) complex 2. Dinuclear Iron Complexes of
Polyimidazole Ligands 3. Molecular Recognition: The Electrostatic Factor 4.
Bimetallic Complexes with Bridging Oxygenates 5. X-Ray Studies on Peptides and
Pseudopeptides 6. Single Crystal and Powder X-Ray Diffraction Studies of Mineral
Structures.
