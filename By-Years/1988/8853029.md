Economics is a difficult subject to learn. Undergraduates often fail to grasp
the fundamental concepts and relationships of the discipline and seldom develop
the basic skills of economic anaalysis. The three major reasons for this are the
mathematical nature of the discipline, the perceived abstract nature of the
subject and the level of statistical sophistication necessary to perform even
fairly simple analysis. This project exploits the educational capabilities of
the microcomputer to minimize these obstacles. Software and data bases tailored
to the level of sophistication of the students are used in a twenty one
workstation laboratory purchased by this award for the introductory courses,
four specialized upper division courses, and, in the future the bulk of the
remaining upper division coursers. In addition an entirely new course has been
developed using the work stations. Drill and practice are avoided, economics
skills are developed throughout the entire undergraduate economics curriculum.
The award will be matched by an equal sum from the grantee.
