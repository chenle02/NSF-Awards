This project partially supports printing costs - shared with other North
American Research Strategy for Tropospheric Ozone (NARSTO) member agencies - for
a 700 page NARSTO report entitled "Particulate Matter Science for Policy Makers:
A NARSTO Assessment." This Assessment is a comprehensive peer-reviewed document
providing a state of the science account of atmospheric particulate matter,
authored by a group of distinguished and expert North American scientists. This
document will be available for wide distribution and provide a robust scientific
resource to the science community, while in parallel being a cornerstone
foundation for regulatory decisions and implementation spanning international
boundaries across the North American continent. The broader impacts of this
activity are in the distribution within the science and policy communities of an
important and high profile document dealing with an important interdisciplinary
area of atmospheric science.
