In previous research, the PI and colleagues found that faces that are of the
same race as participants trigger greater neural activity in face processing
regions of the brain than faces that are of a different race. This difference in
brain activity occurs for both Black and White participants encoding Black and
White faces. The purpose of the current proposal is to examine how social
representations might affect the visual processing of faces and objects using
both behavioral and functional magnetic resonance imaging techniques. The PI
will examine the specific representation of Black Americans as criminal. For
well over a half century, social psychologists have demonstrated that Black
Americans are stereotyped as violent and criminal. Given the strength of this
representation, might it influence how people visually perceive and attend to
the stimuli with which they are confronted in their environment? Specifically,
to what extent might this stereotypical representation alter: a) the perceptual
threshold at which Black faces and crime-relevant objects can be detected, and
b) the brain activity in face and object selective areas of the brain as
participants are exposed to Black faces and crime-relevant objects? Researchers
have long suspected that social beliefs and expectations might influence visual
processing, however, the possible mechanisms of this influence are not clearly
understood. Using a combination of behavioral and neuroscience methodologies,
this research aims to address longstanding social psychological questions that
focus on the interplay of social and visual processing. Because the current
project focuses specifically on the stereotypical representation of Blacks as
criminal, this work also could have practical implications in the areas of
crime, policing, and public policy.
