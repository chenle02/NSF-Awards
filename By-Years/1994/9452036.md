9452036 Drossman The Colorado College Chemistry and Physics faculty are building
a modern laboratory program to support our strong undergraduate curriculum.
Unfortunately, we do not currently study laboratory applications of lasers in
chemistry and physics. Our goal is to introduce all of our physical science
students to lasers. In this proposal, we request funds for laser and optical
equipment to alleviate curricular deficiencies in the chemistry and physics
laboratories. A corridor display will be constructed in the main entrance to the
science building to capture visiting students' interest and to build familiarity
with lasers. Laser-based labs will be added to supplement current offerings in
general chemistry, analytical chemistry, physical chemistry, chemical
instrumentation, modern experimental physics, modern optics and in classes in
our new interdisciplinary majors in biochemistry and environmental chemistry.
Fundamentals of optical design will be added as a laboratory topic in
instrumental analysis. Student instrumentation projects incorporating lasers
will provide new opportunities for them to develop and evaluate their own
instruments. Projects in flash photolysis, thermal lens calorimetry, fast
chemical lifetime measurement, and Raman spectroscopy will be added to enhance
the lab curriculum in physical and inorganic chemistry. Experiments in phase
conjugation and two photon absorption will be added for physics majors. Projects
in thermal lens and fluorescence detection, flow cytometry, ligand binding and
fluorescence polarization will be added to the new laboratories in biophysical
and bioanalytical chemistry. Experiments in remote sensing and photolysis of
organic pollutants will be developed for use in the recently upgraded
environmental science program. Finally, new experiments will be developed for an
experimental "Topics in Lasers" class. The proposed laser equipment will also be
used for senior student research projects.
