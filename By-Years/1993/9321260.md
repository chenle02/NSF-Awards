This project, supported by the NSF Theoretical and Computational Chemistry
Program, extends the principal investigator's recent development of
semiclassical approximations to treat the time evolution of quantum mechanical
systems such as tunneling and other classically forbidden processes. A large
sample of classical trajectories is generated and used to compute the Van Vleck-
Gutwiller propagator by integrating over initial momenta by the cellular method.
Four specific topics will be studied: (1) fundamental aspects of the theory, (2)
applications to atomic and molecular scattering, spectroscopy, and reactive
scattering, (3) processes governed by small Franck-Condon factors, and (4)
multiple scattering of electrons off surfaces with applications to the theory of
scanning tunneling microscopy. This fundamental theoretical research project
attempts to incorporate the essential quantum mechanical features of molecular
dynamics into a simpler classical mechanical formalism. The theory, still in the
early stages of development, has a very wide range of potential application.
This project further develops fundamental aspects of the theory, and explores
applications to molecular spectroscopy, elementary chemical reactions, and to
the theory of scanning tunneling microscopy.
