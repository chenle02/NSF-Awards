This project involves two related empirical projects aimed at examining the
dynamics of employment, hours, and compensation in U.S. labor markets. The link
between the studies is the presumption that the costs of hiring and training new
workers encourages firms to retain workers once they have been hired. The first
study examines expected patterns in union contracts when there are costs
associated with adjusting employment. This analysis will be undertaken with data
on major bargaining agreements in the U.S. from 1965 to 1985. The second study
focuses on measuring cyclical movements in labor costs taking into account
workers' turnover behavior. A major component of this analysis is to match
industry data on employment and hours to individual data on employment turnover
in order to estimate the impact of firms' decisions on labor turnover. This
project is important because it will provide a better understanding of the
behavior of the labor market and the impact of labor contracts on labor
mobility.
