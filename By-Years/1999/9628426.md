9628426 Hirshon The AAAS is developing and testing a pilot phase of an on-line
website science club for youth. Kinetic City Cyberclub will engage youth in
episodic adventures to promote both group and independent exploration. Users
will receive carefully crafted, paced challenges as they wind their way through
a mystery or other related activity. The adventures will be presented over time
in a series of episodes that require users to use science toward solving an on-
going mystery or problem. Components of the on-line club will include: Story
Pods which set up the problem and inform users of what has been learned to date;
Clue Pods which include information and activities that users can add to their
individual electronic notebooks; Experiment Pods where users will be able to try
out different theories to solve immediate problems; Discussion Pods where
questions will be posed to which users are encourage to respond; and a Voting
Pods where users get to vote on the next direction the science exploration
should take or on possible solutions to problems. Components of the web page
will be updated on a regular basis with most of the content being changed weekly
and, in some instances, daily. The PI will be Robert Hirshon of the AAAS who has
been the key developer of The Kinetic City Super Crew, the radio series on which
the Kinetic City Cyberclub is based. The Senior Producer responsible for
developing and maintaining the website will be Kimberly Amaral. Ms. Amaral
previously been a writer/web developer for the Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution's Coastal Research Center and Sea Grant and she has worked as a
researcher/writer for Bill Nye the Science Guy. Dissemination and outreach will
be a joint effort of the AAAS and the National Science Teachers Association.
Evaluation will be conducted by Arthur C. Johnson, an independent evaluator and
instructor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education.
