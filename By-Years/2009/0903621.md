This award is for continued support of the International Global Atmospheric
Chemistry (IGAC) Core Project Office (CPO). The role of the IGAC CPO is to
facilitate project administration and communications under the IGAC umbrella.
IGAC provides an international framework for planning and implementing
scientific activities on atmospheric chemistry that demand human, technological,
or monetary resources beyond the capacity of single nations.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Particular activities of IGAC include the oversight and
guidance of endorsed research tasks; starting up new Initiatives to fill in gaps
in knowledge and understanding; providing scientific oversight, organizational
support and limited funding for workshops; facilitating linkages between
disparate projects or research groups which would mutually benefit from
collaborations; hosting biennial conferences; and communication with the
community via a web page and the IGACtivities Newsletter.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the award are found through the
increased participation of underrepresented groups in IGAC conferences and
workshops, international and interdisciplinary network-building, facilitation of
integrative activities, dissemination of knowledge, and educational outreach.
