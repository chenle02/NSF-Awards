The project is aimed at simplifying the task of programming machines like the
Intel iPSC/2 and the BBN Butterfly in which local memory operations are much
faster than inter-processor communication. Currently, programmers must worry
about exploiting spatial locality of reference when programming these machines.
This system will shoulder much of that burden. A first version of this software
is almost complete. SIMPLE, a large scientific benchmark from Los Alamos, was
run on the Intel iPSC/2. The code, yielded 2 MFlops from a 32 processor iPSC/2
(without vector boards).
