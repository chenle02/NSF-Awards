This research explores the implications of multilevel security on database
concurrency control. Transactions management that provides transparency to
concurrency and to failure is vital for Multilevel Secure Database Management
Systems (MLS/DBMSs). Concurrent execution of transactions may lead to contention
among users for access to data, which in MLS/DBMSs may lead to security
problems. Data Conflict-Security (DC-Security) identifies a class of covert
channels that are caused by contention for access to shared data. This work
formalizes the notion of Data Conflict-Security through the use of a formal
security model (Theory of Noninterference) and formal models of database
concurrency control. Necessary and sufficient conditions are derived for DC-
Security, and a new DC-Secure scheduler for MLS/DBMSs is developed in order to
examine related implementation and performance issues. The resulting rigorous
theoretical framework for verifying claims of security for transaction
schedulers provides a method for determining the security properties of a
concurrency control method in a wide area of database applications where both
security and fast, reliable transaction processing are of primary concern.
