This research award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry
program of the CHE division and in the Molecular and Cellular Biosciences
Division supports work by Professor James Larrabee at Middlebury College to
carry out fundamental studies on metallohydrolase enzymes using magnetic
circular dichroism spectroscopy. Four enzymes that are in the study are
methionine aminopeptidase metallo beta-lactamase, glycerophosphodiesterase, and
phosphotriesterase; these enzymes all share the common active site structural
motif of two metal ions bridged by carboxylate and water (or hydroxide) ligands.
These enzymes are studied in the cobalt(II) form. This approach provides an
especially strong magnetic circular dichroism signal that is used to monitor
changes in the metal environment as inhibitors are bound to the enzymes. These
changes are used to gain insight into the enzyme mechanisms, which are expected
to be similar because of the structural similarities of the enzyme active sites.

This research study at Middlebury College is conducted by undergraduate research
assistants as collaborators. This type of research experience encourages
undergraduates to pursue careers in science and to further their science
education by attending graduate school. This research award is supporting a
total of nine undergraduate research assistants.

Understanding how enzymes function is generally important to science; however, a
better understanding of these four enzymes has potential benefit to society.
Methionine aminopeptidase has been identified as the target enzyme of anti-
angiogenesis drugs; therefore, inhibitors are drug candidates to treat solid
tumor cancers, arterial sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis. Metallo beta-
lactamase hydrolyzes beta-lactams, a process which is the major cause of
bacterial resistance to beta-lactam therapy. The esterases hydrolyze a number of
organophosphates and have potential in bioremediation of organophosphate
pesticide contamination and detoxification of organophosphate nerve agents.
