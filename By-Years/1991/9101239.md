The Campanulaceae is a widely-distributed flowering plant family that contains
many important and attractive garden ornamentals. Determination of phylogenetic
relationships within the family has been problematical due to reliance on
morphological characters that have undergone repeated convergent and parallel
evolution. This project will use chloroplast DNA data to generate the first
modern phylogeny of the family. The molecular research has two major phases: 1)
characterization and delimitation of the distribution of chloroplast DNA
structural rearrangements (inversions) throughout the family and their possible
mechanisms; and, 2) sequencing ORFK from the chloroplast DNA of representative
species in the family and related taxa. Phylogenies generated from rearrangement
and sequence data can be used to compare systematic results generated from these
two different types of molecular approaches. The resulting DNA phylogenies will
enable an independent assessment of morphological, chemical, and chromosomal
evolution in the Campanulaceae. Sequence comparisons will also provide
information regarding relative rates and patterns of chloroplast DNA evolution.
