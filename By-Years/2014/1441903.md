The goal of the grant is to encourage the research interests and involvement of
students who&lt;br/&gt;would otherwise be unlikely to attend HPDC due to a lack
of funding, underrepresentation in&lt;br/&gt;the field, lack of institutional
tie to the HPDC community, or other reasons. The impact on&lt;br/&gt;these
students? education and enthusiasm for research in high-performance computing
and distributed&lt;br/&gt;systems will be high. They will have the opportunity
to witness first hand cutting edge research,&lt;br/&gt;presentations, and
discussions, an experience they would likely not
otherwise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HPDC seeks to increase student participation in
the symposium as well as the field in general.&lt;br/&gt;The funding will
support the travel of eligible US students to the symposium.
Recipients&lt;br/&gt;will be able to attend the main conference and associated
workshops. Travel grants will encourage&lt;br/&gt;the research interests and the
involvement of students in the field who are not well funded&lt;br/&gt;and those
who are just beginning their participation in the field or are interested in
entering&lt;br/&gt;it. A special effort will be made to reach out to women and
under-represented minorities.
