AST 0307668&lt;br/&gt;PI: Butler&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the last 7 years
roughly 100 extrasolar planets have been discovered, all from the precision
Doppler velocity technique. The planets detected to date have profoundly
challenged theories of planet formation and evolution, and motivated major space
missions. The PI will continue this work in the southern hemisphere through the
Anglo-Australian Planet Search program. This is the only southern hemisphere
program to achieve the level of precision required for the detection of genuine
"Solar System analogs", that is Jupiter and Saturn-mass planets beyond 4
astronomical units (the earth-Sun distance). With increased telescope access
based on their successes the PI will increase their target list to include the
250 nearest and brightest southern hemisphere stars providing the first
planetary census of nearby stars. This work has been credited with providing the
motivation for the new disciplines of Astrobiology and extrasolar planet
studies, and it is routinely reported in the popular
press.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
