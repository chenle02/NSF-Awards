9415422 Fillo ABSTRACT Manufacturing Experts/Instructional Video Modules The
State University of New York at Binghamton, in partnership with Cornell
University, proposes to develop video-based instructional materials (modules and
"video textbooks") with industrial experts in the classrooms to educate students
in dual-use electronic packaging technologies. The project will be closely
linked with two university-industry consortia and utilize industrial and faculty
expertise available through the State/Industrial University Cooperative Research
Center on Electronic Packaging. It is open to graduate students and advanced
undergraduates as well as defense and commercial industrial workers. ***
