A combined experimental/numerical simulation approach will be applied to study
the onset of chaotic mixing phenomena in strongly viscous flows where ordinarily
turbulence will not occur. This phenomenon is known as chaotic advection, and a
number of cases have been studied in two-dimensional geometries with time-
varying forcing of the flow. The present research is to conduct experiments and
perform numerical simulations in three-dimensional geometries. The cases to be
considered are a novel helical annular mixer and a partitioned pipe mixer in
which the fluid is periodically reoriented as it flows down the pipe.
