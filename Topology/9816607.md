9816607 Suciu This award will provide partial support for speakers and others at
the Conference on Hyperplane Arrangements, held at Northeastern University in
Boston, Mass., June 12-15, 1999. The focus on hyperplane arrangements includes
their relations to a surprising number of other areas of mathematics,
particularly topology, algebra, algebraic geometry, combinatorics, and analysis,
with applications in coding theory, computer science, spline functions, and
physics, among others. The study of arrangements is a relatively new branch of
mathematics that has rapidly attained an international following, and it is
highly appropriate and valuable for continued progress to have a meeting of this
kind bring together in one location a substantial number of those engaged. The
Boston conference has attracted participants from Japan, several countries of
Western Europe, and Israel, as well as the more numerous contingent from the
U.S. The results of the conference will be distributed in a volume of abstracts
prepared by the organizers, and an electronic version of this volume will be
made available on the web site devoted to the conference
