The research entails methods of non-commutative differential geometry to study
the topological and analytic invariants of partially elliptic pseduodifferential
operators. In this way local analytic formulas can be obtained for topological
characteristic classes. Also intended is a study of the higher- eta invariants
relative to index theorems on manifolds with boundary.
