This SBIR Phase I project will develop and evaluate the feasibility of a
proprietary centrifugal froth flotation process for continuous harvest of algae.
A test prototype will be built and evaluated in Phase I. Both technical and
economic feasibility will be investigated for this low-cost microalgae
continuous harvesting and dewatering system, which will be critical for third-
generation alternative biofuel processing.

The broader/commercial impact of the proposed project will be the development of
a prototype algae separation device. This could lead to successful equipment
development that has uses beyond algae separation.
