9321043 USC Postel The major project elements for the routing arbiter include
advancement of Internet routing algorithms with respect to scaling and stability
issues, routing information registration and dissemination for the network
service providers serving the Internet, deployment of route servers to aid in
the dissemination and real time maintenance of the global Internet routing
system, and coordination and sharing of technical information in support of the
Internet operations community. A key task for the routing arbiter will be to
enhance the use of new switched services offered by the telecommunications
carriers, sucy as ATM, in place of dedicated point to point technology that is
widely deployed in wide area internets. This proposal is a part of a
collaborative effort with Merit. Although both Merit and USC teams will
collaborate in all areas, USC will take the lead with the route servers,
advanced routing development, provision of a testbed and routing engineering and
Merit will take the lead for management and coordination, transition, and
operations. While Merit will take the lead in overall coordination, USC will see
that apprpriate collaboration is accomplished in research and development.
