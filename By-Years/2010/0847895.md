This SGER proposal concerns the accumulation and representation of skills and
control knowledge by robots that interact with unstructured environments. There
has been comparatively little work on representations that capture re-useable
knowledge in robotics---an issue that lies at the heart of many future
applications. Thus, this SGER represents a potentially transformative technology
and addresses significant gaps in the state-of-the-art for which the payoff,
despite the risk, is extremely high. We aim our 1 year study on learning
techniques that accumulate knowledge related to grasping and manipulation. We
shall extend pilot studies and build prototypes for self-motivated learning
techniques and generative models for manipulation and multi-body contact
relationships. The approach relies on learning to discover and exploit structure
over the course of several staged learning episodes; from sensory and motor
knowledge concerning the robot itself, to controllable relationships between the
robot and external bodies, to multi-body contacts involved in tasks like
stacking and insertion. The project has three principal technological goals: to
advance the state-of-the-art of robotic manipulation and knowledge
representation; to extend machine learning methods toward intrinsically
motivated, cumulative, and hierarchical learning; and to advance computational
accounts of the longitudinal processes of sensorimotor and cognitive development
in humans and machines.
