Abstract

Numerical simulation of the microscopic details of wave propagation in random
media is still beyond reach of modern computers: a typical propagation distance
may be of the order of hundreds of wavelengths and as many correlation lengths
of random fluctuations. This necessitates the use of various approximate
macroscopic effective models in practice. The passage from the stochastic
microscopic equations modeling a particular physical system to the large-scale
model is a highly non-trivial problem in itself. The goal of the first part of
the project is to develop new tools and better understanding of such effective
limits, especially in the regime when random media have long range correlations
that lead to multiple temporal and spatial scales for various physical
phenomena. The second part of the project investigates the qualitative behavior
of solutions of reaction-diffusion equations, in particular, those that arise in
stochastic particle systems, such as branching Brownian motion, and other
Brunet-Derrida systems. Another set of problems involves reaction-diffusion
equations that arise in biology, such as chemotactic models, and ecology
involving population dynamics in heterogenous environments.

This project carries out mathematical studies of physical systems, and wave
propagation in cluttered environments and of reaction-diffusion processes. These
studies are relevant to several branches of science, ranging from biomedical
imaging questions to geophysics, fluid dynamics, and biology. Imaging in a
cluttered environment, whether it is a human body, earth interior, or foliage,
is inherently unstable because of media complexity. One objective of this
project is to develop imaging methods that are less sensitive to unpredictable
fluctuations of the clutter. Another area of this project concerns the
mathematical description of the mixing effects of a fluid flow on chemical and
biological reactions. Turbulent fluid flow plays an important role in many
reaction phenomena: it may drastically enhance the rate of reaction, leading to
higher efficiency, or, in some situations, extinguish the chemical process. The
project will address these issues in simpler mathematical models to illuminate
the mechanisms present in the full problem.
