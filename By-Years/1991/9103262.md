Three principal investigators will continue their present achievements of
multidimensional images of chemically interesting system by electron
paramagnetic resonance (EPR) imaging. The work will focus on obtaining a
decrease in the data acquisition time, on developing improved algorithms for
image reconstruction, on preventing magnetic field gradient interference with
magnetic field control, and on pulsed EPR imaging. These studies promise to
enhance the possibilities for the application of EPR imaging to a number of
important systems in chemistry, materials, and medicine. %%% The research, in
the general area of Analytical and Surface Chemistry, focuses on an extension of
the investigators previous work on electron paramagnetic resonance imaging. The
usual electron paramagnetic resonance experiment reports a spectrum averaged
over the sample and the magnetic field. The spectrum provides information about
the unpaired electron spin density in the sample. In imaging experiments this
spin density is mapped over the sample to give a three dimensional image showing
the location and intensity of the paramagnetic molecules. The approach has
potential in materials science, biometical studies and in the chemistry of non-
uniform materials.
