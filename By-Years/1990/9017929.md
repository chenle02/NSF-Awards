Abstract Using visible light reflectance spectra, ocean sediment cores can be
analyzed rapidly for semi-quantitative determination of sediment composition. At
present, four minerals (goethite, hematite, chlorite and smectite) and organic
carbon contents have been derived from the spectra, and the present study will
seek to expand the data processing techniques. Using these refined techniques,
cores from the tropical Atlantic will be analyzed to see the relative influence
of glacial climate on the Amazon Basin and on the extent and velocity of winds
off the Sahara.
