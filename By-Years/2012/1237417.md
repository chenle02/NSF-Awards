The cost of writing data from a computer's processor to its storage components
remains a bottleneck for modern computing systems. The speed of the processor
continues to improve, more processing units are packed into a computer chip, but
these advances only cause more data to be written to storage per second. The
speed of storage subsystems has not kept pace with the processor?s ability to
produce data for storage, and this difference in performance is likely to
continue. Moreover, the trend in building storage subsystems for computers is to
utilize technologies such as flash memories whose contents can be changed a
relatively small number of times before the memory wears out. These technologies
are cheaper and pack more storage into a given area, but care must be taken to
avoid writing to memories made from such technologies at rates usually seen from
a processor to memory.

This EAGER project aims to discover mechanisms that reduce or eliminate traffic
from a processor to the storage subsystem. Elimination of such traffic increases
the speed of the overall system and saves wear on storage components. This
research finds data that would otherwise be sent to storage from the processor
and eliminates such writes to memory. This technique is based on finding that
such data cannot subsequently be referenced by an application. This effort
focuses on a preliminary study to validate the technical approach, namely
investigating the consequences of eliminating stores of data that has been
explicitly deallocated by an application.
