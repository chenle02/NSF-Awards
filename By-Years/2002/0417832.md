SES-0417832 Roberta Spalter-Roth American Sociological Association

This grant allows the National Science Foundation (NSF) to continue its
partnership with the American Sociological Association's (ASA) Fund for the
Advancement of the Discipline (FAD), a highly successful joint supported small
grants program that ASA administers at a minimal cost. Through their dollar-for-
dollar match, the ASA and NSF have been able to double their investment in new
science under the auspices of the FAD program. The award represents steady state
funding from the previous (2001-2004) cycle and provides support an additional
six rounds of competitive grants. During the 2001-2004 cycle, FAD received 110
applications, and awarded 30 peer-reviewed grants to a larger percent of young
investigators at a wider array of institutions than in previous cycles. These
small grants (with a maximum of $7,000 per grant) represent a strong record of
intellectual merit. The 2001-2004 cycle advanced sociological theory and
concepts. New areas that were explored included connections between global
integration and social movements, globalization and gender regimes, geographic
space and inequality, and identity and institutional structure. FAD projects
also re-conceptualized and refined sociological methods and techniques. Some of
these advances included new techniques for measuring and analyzing wealth,
household structural, geographic space, the constructions of social problems and
public policy, and the impact of technology on communities. Some of the
indicators of the merit of these projects include an average of 2.7 publications
and 4.0 presentations per project. For every $1.00 spent through ASA/NSF
funding, award-winning projects subsequently received an additional $5.33 in
research funding from other organizations. The broader impact of these projects
includes substantial student training, curriculum modification, and media
attention. The scholarly and educational impacts of FAD projects far outweigh
the cost of these small grants. In addition, ASA will increase its outreach
activities by disseminating findings that result from FAD awards to the media.
