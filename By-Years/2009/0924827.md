This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). This Science, Technology, and Society project supports
scholarship that will result in a book about ethics and ecology, in particular,
the concept of harm to nature. The conceptual and normative analysis will focus
on the recent history of attempts to identify, measure, and regulate harms to
the natural environment--harms not necessarily tied to or ultimately analyzable
in terms of human health, safety, or welfare. The goal of the project is to
provide philosophical context for conceptions of the value of nature that arise
in controversies such as: disputes about ecological risk assessment, the
measurement of damages for losses of wildlife caused by industrial accidents,
the regulation of genetically manipulated organisms, the cloning of endangered
species, the control of invasive species, and the intentional relocation of
organisms in anticipation of climate change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;People may
perceive activities as harmful to nature even if these activities are not
harmful to human beings. The project analyzes the conceptual and normative
problems scientists have encountered when they have sought to help policy makers
define ecological endpoints for regulation and to identify ecological "services"
that are not primarily economic but aesthetic or spiritual ways of valuing
nature. The project examines the democratic and deliberative processes though
which scientists and citizens engage each other in understanding conceptions of
intrinsic value that apply to the natural world. In this way, the research seeks
to clarify and explain ways people attach value to the course of natural history
for what they regard as its intrinsic aesthetic, ethical, spiritual, and moral
properties and thus for reasons that reflect more on their obligations toward
the natural world than on the uses they may make of it. Thus, the project stands
to have broader impacts for public participation in discussion of climate change
and other ecological issues.
