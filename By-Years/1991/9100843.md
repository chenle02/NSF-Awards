This project uses time series analysis on a national sample of employed adults
to assess differing explanations for the increasing inequality of incomes. Human
capital and status attainment explanations focus on characteristics of
individuals such as their education. This project compares those perspec- tives
to effects produced by changes in the structure of jobs (e.g., movement towards
a U.S. service economy, and movement of manufacturing to other countries) and
wages (e.g., rapid creation of low-wage jobs). PI anticipates finding important,
perhaps primary, effects of these structural changes. The project permits
comparing predictions of all three perspectives. Out- comes of the research will
contribute to sociological and econo- mic analysis of changes in income
distribution. Applications of the information would include design of
intervention programs either at the individual (e.g., training programs) or the
struc- tural (e.g., international trade laws) levels. //
