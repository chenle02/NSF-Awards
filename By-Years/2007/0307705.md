AST-0307705 Burles In this project, the investigators will embark on a large
survey of the high redshift intergalactic medium (IGM), by measurement of Lyman
alpha absorption towards individual distant quasars. Current results from this
method agree very well with large numerical simulations and semi-analytic
models, and to extend this progress, a large number of quasar pairs and groups
in close proximity on the sky will be targeted for deep follow-up spectroscopy.
Such a large sample can now be identified because of the results from the two
largest redshift surveys, which are currently being completed. In addition to
their use for this plan, the spectra will be reduced, analyzed and made
available to the community. The foremost goal of the project is the geometrical
distortion of the observed correlation function of the IGM, the classic Alcock-
Paczynski (AP) test, which should measure the density of dark energy in the
universe to a precision of five percent. Combined with other datasets in
preparation, the three-dimensional statistical correlations to be measured will
introduce complementary constraints on cosmological parameters.

This research involves significant infrastructure enhancement, considerable
student training, and broad dissemination of results of cross-disciplinary
interest via MIT's OpenCourseWare initiative. The investigators have preferred
access to cutting edge facilities at the Magellan Observatories, whose influence
on education they will try to maximize. ***
