Dr. Gregory Voth is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program to perform theoretical studies of quantum mechanical activated
rate processes in complex systems. This work provides an important theoretical
background for understanding the energetics of chemical reactions which occur in
solution. Dr. Voth's research will be directed at developing a theory for the
transmission coefficient which accounts for the additional tunneling and
multidimensional dynamical effects which can influence the value of the quantum
rate constant. The quantum rate theory will be applied to the study of proton
transfer reactions in condensed phases and to thereby obtain a better
understanding of the influence of solvent polarization free energetics,
intramolecular motions, and isotopic substitution on the value of the rate
constant. The theory will also be used to examine the fundamental role of
nonlinearity in condensed phase quantum activated rate processes.
