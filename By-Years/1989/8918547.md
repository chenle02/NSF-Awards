The long-term goal of the proposed research is to understand the genetic
control of growth and development of higher plants. The investigation focuses on
the genetic control of morphogenesis in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana.
The major objective of the present study is to determine the specific roles of
individual tubulin genes and tubulin isoforms in the microtubule complexes
centrally involved in the processes of cell division and cell elongation that
govern the morphogenesis of plant tissues and organs. The specific aims of the
proposed investigations are 1) to characterize the spatial and temporal patterns
of expression of individual tubulin genes by northern blot and in situ
hybridization experiments, 2) to localize, spatially and temporally, the
individual tubulin isoforms in developing plant tissues and organs by western
blot analyses and immunofluorescence microscopy carried out with isoform-
specific antibodies, 3) to use immunofluorescence microscopy and isoform-
specific antibodies to determine which isoforms are present in microtubule
containing structures such as preprophase bands, mitotic spindles,
phragmoplasts, and the cortical arrays, 4) to identify the cis-acting sequences
and trans-acting proteins and genes that control the tissue specific expression
of Arabidopsis tubulin genes and 5) to utilize "overexpressed" antisense gene
specific sequences in transgenic plants produced by Agrobacterium tumefaciens Ti
plasmid mediated transformation to probe the function of individual tubulin
genes. %%% Microtubules are filamentous polymers that play central roles in
several basic processes of the cells of higher organisms. In plant cells they
are involved in cell division and cell expansion, processes key to plant
morphogenesis. This project is represents a detailed molecular study of the
components of microtubules in plants.
