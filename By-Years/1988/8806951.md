This equipment grant provides a diesel research engine and essential exhaust
gas analyzers to the existing engine combustion facilities. This equipment will
be used for basic studies of engine heat transfer, combustion and emissions. The
initial studies will focus on these combustion characteristics of low-heat-
rejection diesel engines. Internal combustion engine research has been quite
active for nearly 40 years at the University of Illinois. Yet most of the
current laboratory facilities date back to the 1930's. This equipment grant is
part of a major upgrade program to provide a modern research facility with high-
speed data acquisition and emissions monitoring capabilities. The goal of the
current research is to make a substantial contribution to the successful design
of low-heat-rejection, or adiabatic, diesel engines.
