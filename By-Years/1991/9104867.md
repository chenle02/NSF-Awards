This award supports the research of Professor A. Zelevinsky to work on
applications of multivariate hypergeometric function to algebraic, geometric and
combinatorial structures. In particular, he intends to use these techniques to
study algebraic varieties, convex polytopes and constructive representation
theory. The research is in the general area of combinatorics. Combinatorics
attempts to find efficient methods to study how discrete collections of objects
can be organized. And, so it is extremely important to modern communications,
for example the design of large networks as in telephone systems and the design
of algorithms in computer science.
