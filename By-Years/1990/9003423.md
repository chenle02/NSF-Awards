Boolean categories provide a framework for programming language semantics. In
contrast to the syntax-driven style commonly employed in theoretical computer
science, there is but one primitive, program- chaining, in terms of which all
other constructs must be expressed; extensive work by category theorists in the
past four decades has demonstrated the feasibility of this approach. The
abstract theory of Boolean categories and some of its specializations have been
developed by the proposer and his close colleagues in the past ten years. This
work has studied fundamental control structures including recursion. Further,
all Boolean categories have an intrinsic theory of predicate transformation
which provides a high-level specification language of logical assertions. It is
a theorem that this specification language follows the lines of classical
nondeterminism. By contrast, the choice of model is flexible enough to allow the
hidden state to be arbitrarily complex, it being possible to represent very
general forms of nondeterminism. The research centers on incorporating fairness
and unbounded nondeterminism into the Boolean category framework.
