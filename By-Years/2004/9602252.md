9602252 This award renews support for a Research Training Group in Linking
Levels of Ecological Organization at the Kellogg Biological Station of Michigan
State University. During the period of the award, NSF support will be gradually
phased out as other sources of funding are identified. The faculty group
currently has 8 members drawn from 5 departments. The funds awarded will provide
stipends for graduate students, for trainee travel to other institutions for
specialized training not available at Michigan State, and to bring investigators
from other research and academic institutions to the Kellogg Station for
seminars and workshops. During the initial 5 years of funding, a number of new
courses in both basic and applied aspects of ecology. Several of these have now
become a standard element of graduate training in ecology and evolution at the
University. In addition to the funds provided by this award, institutional and
other resources help extend the program to include the participation of
elementary and high school students, and a separate NSF award for an REU-site
activity supports the participation of undergraduate students during the summer.
The need to train scientists who can attack research problems across levels of
ecological organization is significant and growing. The problems of global
change and of maintenance of biological diversity combine to make such training
increasingly important. This program will provide such training, taking
advantage of the techniques and concepts of researchers who address a variety of
evolutionary and ecological problems at the level of genes, individual
organisms, populations, communities, ecosystems or entire landscapes.
