This project undertakes research on numerical methods for parameter estimation
in distributed parameter systems. Several important topics are addressed.
Parameter estimation problems are typically formulated as optimization problems,
which are solved using gradient methods. The first topic is the efficient
computation of gradients using costate methods coupled with time-Galerkin
methods. The second topic is the choice of regularization (i.e., stabilization)
parameters in the optimization formulation. Related to this is the topic of
choosing system inputs and observations to maximize information content. These
numerical methods are used to develop computer models that describe ion flow in
instruments used in analytical chemistry. These techniques may also be applied
to a broad range of disciplines that use mathematical models to describe similar
phenomena. Examples include the modelling of flow through porous media, which
has important applications in the cleanup of polluted groundwater and in
enhanced oil recovery.
