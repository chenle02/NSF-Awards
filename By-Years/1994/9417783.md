This RUI grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports undergraduate studies
of Professor Curran at the College of the Holy Cross. The studies focus on the
role of enforced proximity on intramolecular reactions as models for enzyme
catalysis. Structural analogues of Kemp's triacid (a cyclohexanetricarboxylic
acid) with variation in the third axial and equatorial groups will be used as
molecular templates for ten projects. These independent projects are designed to
unravel how changes in the steric and electronic nature of neighboring
functional groups affect the rate of the acylolysis reaction. In this synthetic
project Dr. Fendler will study the steric and electronic effects of neighboring
groups on the rate of acylolysis of Kemp s triacid to model such effects on
enzymatic reaction rates. The studies clarify important structural effects and
will provide undergraduate students with an excellent experimental training in
interdisciplinary chemical research.
