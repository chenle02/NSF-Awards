9512241 Henderson The proposed project is to acquire an SGI Power Onyx graphics
engine front end, and a SGI Power Challenge computational engine for large-scale
computational steering. Computational steering permits users to interactively
change boundary conditions, model geometry, and computational parameters via a
graphical user interface. It allows the visualization to guide or steer the
design and computation phases of the simulation or computation. The
computational steering model is applicable to a wide range of applications
including medicine, genetics, image analysis, CAD/CAM, telerobotics, and virtual
reality. Software is being developed in different application areas to "close
the loop" to replace the typical simulation model in which the user manually
sets input parameters, computes results, stores data, visualizes the results via
a separate visualization package, and then starts again at the beginning. The
proposed equipment will permit interactive modeling and scientific visualization
supported by parallel computational systems. ***
