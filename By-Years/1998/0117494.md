This research focuses on the use of sonification to increase trust between
humans and automated systems. Sonification is analogous to visualization and
surpasses traditional auditory warnings by conveying a rich array of continuous
dynamic information. The concept of trust provides a theoretical basis for using
sonification to reveal the capabilities of automated systems and promote
appropriate reliance. There are four objectives, 1) identify how sonification
can calibrate trust, 2) expand the understanding of trust and its role in human-
automation partnerships, 3) apply dynamical systems theory to describe human-
automation coordination, and 4) evaluate the generality of sonfication for
settings in which multiple people share control of automated systems. The
proposed work contributes to the scientific basis of sonification and its
relation to group dynamics and should benefit society by increasing human safety
in automated environments.
