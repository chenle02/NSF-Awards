There has recently been a great deal of theoretical econometric work in
semiparametric and nonparametric estimates that converge at or near parametric,
root N rates. These estimators generally consist of estimating as finite number
of parameters in the presence of an infinite dimensional nuisance parameter (the
nonparametric component). The goal is reasonably precise estimation and testing
of parameters of interest while minimizing or eliminating arbitrary function
form restrictions. This project contributes to this body of econometric theory
in ways that are particularly relevant for empirical work. The project applies
the theory empirically to a range of problems in consumer demand analysis. More
specifically, the project has four closely interrelated parts: 1) Refining and
extending existing techniques of estimating finite dimensional expectations of
unknown functions and their derivatives at root N rates; 2) Constructing moment
based consistent, nonparametric hypothesis tests of regression, density, or
derivative constraints; 3) Constructing a semiparametric, "no search," root N
Converging estimator of multiple linear index models that can handle discrete as
well as continuous regressors, and can deal with general forms of
heteroscedasticity including random coefficients; 4) Applying the above to
nonparametric estimation of Slutsky substitution matrices, nonparametric testing
of homogeneity and Slutsky symmetry, semiparametric estimation of discrete or
multiple limited dependent variable choice models, and other cross sectional
demand applications.
