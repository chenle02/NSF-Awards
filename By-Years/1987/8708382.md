This project continues the analysis of magnetic data from the EMSLAB
(Electromagnetic Study of the Lithosphere and Asthenosphere Beneath the Juan de
Fuca Plate) experiment. Approximately 30% of the Queen's data will be digitized
using a new video digitizing system, the rest will be done when funds allow more
work. The data digitizing algorithm for the Univ. of Alberta data will be
modified. Egbert (Oregon State) will continue his analysis on the Gough Reitzel
array data. The central transect of EMSLAB will be inverted using the completed
two-dimensional inversion program. All the EMSLAB data will be rerecorded onto
compact disc which will allow wide dispersal and fairly permanent archiving of
the data. A special issue of the JGR (Journal of Geophysical Research) devoted
to the EMSLAB results will be published.
