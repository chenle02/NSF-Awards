1996; Pasadena, California. The emphasis of this meeting is the study of all
facets of magnetic storm research, including causative phenomena at the Sun and
interplanetary space, magnetospheric processes and dynamics during storms,
storm/substorm relationships, ionospheric-thermospheric effects, ground effects,
and a session devoted to storm forecasting.***
