This work will study formal series (the umbral calculus) with the aim of
applying the results to special functions, orthogonal polynomials, and related
problems in numerical analysis. The research lies at the interface between
special functions, numerical analysis, and combinatorics. Formal series will be
used to construct explicitly the limits of sequences satisfying renewal
equations. The use of formal series to explicitly solve non-homogeneous
difference equations with constant coefficients when the right hand side is
itself given by a formal series will also be considered. Formal Chebyshev
polynomial solutions for such equations will be developed. Difference equations
are a key tool in the numerical solution of partial differential equations which
model important physical processes in science and engineering.
