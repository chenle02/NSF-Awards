This award supports the research on the geometry and analysis of locally
symmetric spaces and manifolds of negative curvature of Professor Svetlana Katok
of the University of California at Santa Cruz. Dr. Katok's project consists of
two main parts: first, she intends to study the cohomological equations
associated with geodesic flows on compact negatively curved surfaces; and
second, she will generalize spanning theorems that she has already proved for
automorphic forms on Fuchsian groups to locally symmetric spaces of dimension
greater than two. Non-Euclidean plane geometry began in the early nineteenth
century as a mathematical curiosity, but by the end of that century,
mathematicians had realized that many objects of fundamental importance are non-
Euclidean in their basic nature. The detailed study of non-Euclidean plane
geometries has given rise to several branches of modern mathematics, of which
the study of modular and automorphic forms is one of the most active. This field
is principally concerned with questions about the whole numbers, but in its use
of geometry and analysis, as exemplified by the work of Professor Katok, it
retains connection to its historical roots.
