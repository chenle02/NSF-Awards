For the first out of four topics, the main goal is to understand the typical
sphere, where "sphere" here means a two-dimensional Riemannian manifold that is
topologically a sphere, and "typical" means chosen according to a canonical
"uniform" probability measure. The approach is to consider a limit of measures
on discrete structures, where the concept of uniformity is meaningful. The co-
investigator intends to construct a limiting measure for the graph metric
induced by uniformly chosen planar graphs on n vertices. Experimental and
heuristic evidence suggests that the limiting measure will have the structure of
a continuum tree. For the second topic, the co-investigator intends to study the
implications of previous work on the relationship between random walks and
geometry on graphs in the context of Brownian motion on Riemannian manifolds.
The third topic concerns the stochastic Loewner evolution, introduced by Schramm
as a conjectured scaling limit for percolation and loop-erased walk. These and
several other conjectures concerning this process have been proved and yet
others remain open. The fourth topic is probability in groups. The co-
investigator intends to continue to work on automorphism groups of regular
trees, which are fundamental objects of study in the theory of p-groups. All
four parts of the project involve more than one area of mathematics, increasing
understanding between fields. The common motivation is to understand better
fundamental mathematical objects that are often of utilitarian use. In
particular, the second part concerns random walks on graphs, a topic which has
been applied in the design of efficient computer algorithms. The fourth part
concerns randomness in groups, a topic which has been used successfully in the
telecommunications industry for encryption and error-correction.
