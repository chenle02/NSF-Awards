Drs. Mayer, Nowell and Jumars will undertake several complementary studies to
determine the relationship between sediment transport in coastal environments
and the quality and quantity of food for benthic animals. They will focus on
particulate food quality for deposit feeders, although many of our results also
should be useful for suspension feeders, heterotrophic bacteria, and
heterotrophs in general. The studies will range from field measurements of food
quality, to laboratory experiments of feeding responses with engineered food
materials, to laboratory flume experiments testing the relationships between
sediment dynamics and food quality variables. With species conveniently
available and these estimates, they will investigate the ideas that deposit
feeders benefit from horizontal sediment transport as an increase in rate of
food supply due to simple lateral homogenization of the resource, that surface
deposit feeders benefit from the vertical hydrodynamic sorting produced by
resuspension and redeposition, and that deposit feeders benefit from stimulation
of microbial growth due to transport.
