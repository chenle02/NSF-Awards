This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY 2009
and is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public
Law 111-5). The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host
laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in
biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Hugo
E. Cuevas is "The development of nearly isogenic lines and the fate of the
duplicated genome regions in Brassica oleracea." The host institution for this
research is the Plant Genome Mapping Laboratory at University of Georgia-Athens
and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Andrew H. Paterson.

Most differences among individuals are inherited in a quantitative manner
indicating that many genes are involved in these traits. However, only few such
genes have been identified, therefore, understanding of the inheritance of such
"quantitative traits" is incomplete. Nearly isogenic lines, which are plants
differing by only a single well-defined chromosomal region, allow one to measure
the effects of gene differences in such a single chromosomal region. This
research is focusing on developing a panel of nearly isogenic lines which
collectively cover the entire genome of Brassica oleracea. This species is an
outstanding model to study quantitative traits due to its extraordinary range of
morphological variation (from cabbage to cauliflower); and to its complex
genome, with some chromosomal regions duplicated and others triplicated.

Training objectives include improving previous genetic knowledge and skills as
well as learning new molecular techniques. Broader impacts include increasing
the number of Hispanics in graduate biological science as well as scientific and
educational impacts. The resulting nearly isogenic lines will be a research
resource for the scientific community and applicable to a wide range of
biological questions. They will be publicly-accessible and a valuable
educational tool for high school and college students interested in the biology
and genetics of plants.
