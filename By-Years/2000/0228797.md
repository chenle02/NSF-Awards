Professor Kevin Lehmann of Princeton University is supported with an SGER grant
from the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program to develop an optical fiber
version of chemical ring down spectroscopy that will allow measurement of trace
species in gases and possibly liquids. The method takes advantage of the long
pathlength involved in cavity ring down, as well as evanescent properties of the
light wave in the fiber. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this sensor could
be used to detect chemical and biological species over distances, e.g. using
fiber optic cables through buildings or reservoirs. Fiberoptic bundles can be
used to multitask the sensing. The use of available communication equipment
potentially makes this a viable cost-efficient system. The applications include
national security, environmental monitoring, and possibly in vivo medical
monitoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
