Richard Damm, Student; Dissertation topic: "Scientists and Statesmen: President
Dwight D. Eisenhower's Science Advisers and National Security Policy." Mr. Damm,
under the direction of Professor Hogan, is undertaking doctoral dissertation
research into the history of President Eisenhower's science advisers and their
influence on national security policy making during the 1950's. The research is
taking place at the Eisenhower Library in Abilene Kansas and at the National
Archives in Washington D.C. The information obtained from these two
depositories, together with information garnered from current research in
contemporary periodical literature on science and national security issues, will
be used to develop a corporatist analysis of Eisenhower's science advisers,
showing how professional and institutional ties affected their outlook and
performance. This project will provide the first detailed historical study of
the role of Eisenhower's science advisers in shaping national security policy,
and will utilize an important set of records neglected to date: the Records of
the President's Science Advisory Committee. This project will also illustrate an
important theme in the development of the Cold War and the rise of the "national
security state" that is still relevant today: the permanent mobilization of
American science and scientists. Finally it will highlight one of the most
important trends in modern American history: the exercise of public power by
private elites.
