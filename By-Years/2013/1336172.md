Abstract&lt;br/&gt;#1336172&lt;br/&gt;Martirosyan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The XII
International Symposium on Self-Propagating High Temperature Synthesis is hosted
by University of Texas at Brownsville at South Padre Island, TX, October 21-24,
2013. Graduate students will have an opportunity to present their research
results and to interact with experts from academia, government agencies, and
industry across the United States and from abroad. The "off-the-record" format
presentation and discussion led by the topic experts also offers the exchange of
the emerging ideas of the field. The proposed funding is to provide support for
registration for both GRS and GRC to student presenters.
