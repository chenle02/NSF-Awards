This award will promote the progress of science and contribute to the
advancement of national prosperity and health by introducing new computational
methods to guide the design and control of modern manufacturing facilities, such
as complex bio-manufacturing processes that produce personalized medical
treatments. High-fidelity simulation models that can be used to evaluate the
performance of a manufacturing system are computationally intensive and often
require expensive data collection, limiting their use. On the other hand,
queueing models use less computation time but are less accurate. There is a
substantial gap in understanding how to effectively make use of both high- and
low-fidelity models to design and control such systems. This award supports
advancing theoretical foundations and algorithm development for large-scale
global optimization enabling the use of multiple models of varying accuracy and
computational effort. This research will have broad impact on the growth of bio-
manufacturing in the U.S., and will provide a diverse population of students
with the education and training needed to deploy and extend these tools,
advancing the national economic welfare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will
create a new Multi-fidelity Accelerated Global Search (MAGS) framework for
stochastic global optimization that will intelligently combine high- and low-
fidelity models to dynamically allocate computational effort guided by
statistical analysis of solution quality. The goal is to reduce the number of
high-fidelity simulation evaluations by taking advantage of low-fidelity models,
thus integrating model approximation (learning) with optimization (search). This
research addresses algorithmic design, scalability, and finite-time stochastic
analysis of MAGS. The project will provide a theoretical foundation for
computational complexity and aid in deriving a dynamic and adaptable
decomposition scheme to realize large-scale optimization. The design and
operation of an individualized bio-manufacturing system will be used to test and
refine MAGS throughout its development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
