The mechanism by which estrogen induces proliferation of its target cells is
poorly understood. Three hypotheses have been proposed: (1), that estrogen acts
directly upon the responsive cells; (2) that estrogen induces growth factors
which in turn stimulate the responsive cells; and (3) that estrogen neutralizes
the action of an inhibitor which blocks the responsive cells from going through
the cell cycle. The goal of this proposed research is to explore the third
hypothesis. Evidence has already been presented that such a postulated inhibitor
exists in mammalian serum, and that it can be specifically neutralized by
estrogen. The specific objectives of this proposal are: (1) to at least
partially purify and physicochemically characterize the putative inhibitor; (2)
to search for the body organ which secretes the inhibitor, and evaluate the
relative usefulness of that organ as a starting material vis-a-vis serum for
purification; and (3) based on this information, to design a purification
protocol for the inhibitor. Long-range plans are to test the validity of the
inhibitor hypothesis using purified inhibitor and defined medium.
