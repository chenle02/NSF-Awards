This project concerns the distribution and structure of irreducible models of
equational theories of algebras. The chief goal is to determine the structural
implications for the models of a theory which arise from the assumption that the
theory has a bounded number of irreducible models. The projected results have
applications to the decidability, finite axiomatizability, categoricity, and
equational completeness of equational classes of algebras. Algebraic structures,
or algebras, are mathematical objects which are used as devices for calculation.
A typical example of an algebra is the number system we use for counting,
although more exotic algebras find application in physics, chemistry, logic, and
most branches of mathematics. Basic questions in algebra, such as the question
of whether one number divides another, are solved by reducing the question to a
related question about irreducible factor algebras. This research will advance
the understanding of methods of calculation in irreducible algebras, and
consequently in general algebras.
