&lt;br/&gt;The 50th Annual Maize Genetics Conference will be held February
27-March 2, 2008 at the Marriott Wardman Park Hotel in Washington, DC. At this
conference, members of the maize community present and discuss their most recent
research results covering a wide range of topics including classical genetics,
molecular genetics, and genomics. In addition, the conference celebrates the
history of and success of Maize Genetics with special sessions that include a
historical perspective offered by veteran maize geneticists, a genomics session
unveiling a draft sequence of the B73 genome, and a session highlighting the
translation of basic maize research to crop improvement. The Maize Genetics
Conference provides an outstanding opportunity for graduate students to meet and
interact with scientists in the field, to discuss their research ideas as talks
or posters, and to begin to establish the scientific networks that will prove
invaluable throughout their careers. The funding provided by NSF helps defray
the costs of participation of students from the U.S. scientific community.
