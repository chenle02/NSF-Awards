9301522 Avignone This U.S.-Argentina Cooperative Science award will support
travel and related expenses for collaboration by Frank Avignone of the
University of South Carolina and Daniel Di Gregorio of the TANDAR nuclear
laboratory in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The project aims to install a detector,
shielding, and data acquisition system for exploring cold dark matter in the
universe. According to recent research, the effects of elastic scattering of
cold dark matter candidate particles in the Earth imply that repeating existing
searches at southern latitudes would render them far more sensitive. Also, for a
significant range of cold dark matter mass and coupling strength, data from
detectors sensitive to cold dark matter by nuclear recoil from elastic
scattering will have observable diurnal modulations. This award will support two
senior investigators, one recent doctoral recipient, and one graduate student on
the U.S. side to participate in installing and obtaining data from a cold dark
matter detector facility in southern Argentina. Both sides will benefit from
training of junior investigators, access to fundamental research data in the
Southern Hemisphere, and exchange of technologies. ***
