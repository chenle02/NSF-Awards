Past research has developed suitable parameterizations for edges, planes,
circular and cylindrical features that, in combination with linear and nonlinear
least squares fits, allow statistical estimates of many geometric tolerances
(form position, orientation, location) as well as conventional direct
tolerances. In addition, offline programming capability from a CAD data base for
2D inspection tasks has been developed. This research will now be extended to
accomplish the following objectives: develop a sequential sampling methodology
and a cost model for determining acceptability of a part; develop methods for
correctly estimating part datums; incorporate systematic feature deviations and
machine error; extend the methodologies to other features such as sculptured
surfaces and composite tolerances; develop methods for probe selection, part
fixturing and orientation; investigate the use of the PDES/STEP standards in
support of automatic offline programming; and implement and test the methods
utilizing the tactile and optical CMM's in the Manufacturing Quality Lab, and
apply them to both part inspection and process control.
