This proposal addresses the area of dependable grids through an approach that
allows for degradation and failure scenarios of primary grid services in the
presence of alternate services restricted to covering selected classes of
failures. These services will be developed and specified under a custom notation
permitting dependability characteristics to be defined and shared. The resulting
survivable grid implementation will be prototyped on a foundation of the OGSA-
based framework using existing grid resources at UVA and
NCSA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work promises to forge new ground in the research
and development of survivable and dependable services in distributed systems,
specifically the emerging web service-based grid environment. By adopting a
framework and methodology, and in large part through the creation of a new
language for specifying and sharing dependability requirements and
characteristics among services (called DESL), the concept of feasible and
dependable grid services may come to fruition in prototype form. Such an
accomplishment will have immediate impact on a class of critical infrastructure
applications. In addition to strong graduate level student involvement, the
project includes significant support for undergraduates and direct involvement
of UVA's Office of Minority Programs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
