The development of oligodendrocytes has many of the hallmarks of other
developmental paradigms. Predetermined proliferating stem cells exit their
birthplace, the embryonic subventricular zone, and migrate into the brain
parenchyma, where, by mechanisms not understood, they cease migration and
proliferation, and begin the process of myelination, i.e., the enwrapment of
neuronal axons and the correlated expression of numerous myelin-associated
genes. Although advances have been made in this area of research, large gaps
remain in our understanding of oligodendrocyte development, in part reflecting a
scarcity of well-defined cell-surface differentiation markers. To address this
concern, Dr. Gay has made twenty-six monoclonal antibodies against cell-surface
molecules on mouse oligodendrocyte precursors. These monoclonal antibodies bind
oligodendrocyte precursors but not fibroblasts, T cells, B cells, macrophages,
or astrocytes, suggesting that most recognize molecules specific to
oligodendrocyte precursors. In addition, several monoclonal antibodies
distinguish subsets of oligodendrocyte precursors, suggesting heterogeneity
within a lineage of cells previously considered homogeneous. The purpose of this
study is to characterize these novel markers specifically to increase our
understanding of oligodendrocyte development and broadly to develop a well-
defined developmental system that may be applied to basic developmental
questions. Specifically, Dr. Gay will determine the expression profiles and
functions of some of these new oligodendrocyte markers, determine the
biochemical nature of these markers, and isolate the genes that encode them.
