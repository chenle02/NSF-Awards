An informal study revealed that new graduates in materials-related fields had
problems relating fundamental engineering principles to manufacturing. At
present, the study of ceramic machining is virtually unavailable nationwide to
undergraduates in manufacturing as well as ceramic engineering and must be
learned on the job at the employer's expense. With machining contributing
30%-60% and sometimes up to 90% of the total production cost of a finished part,
the Manufacturing Engineer should be familiar with the intricacies of machining
ceramics. The objective of this project, Machining of Ceramics, is to show
undergraduates the relationship between material properties and machinability.
Machining exercises are performed using a surface grinder and ultrasonic drill.
Variables, such as feed rate, grit size, type of grinding wheel, as well as
material characteristics, are investigated. Students learn how material
characteristics and machine performance interact to produce different surface
finishes and what variables are responsible for diminishing the structural
integrity of the machined ceramic.
