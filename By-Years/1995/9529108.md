Support for a Workshop on Reinforcement Learning This is support for a workshop
that will bring together researchers in one of the most actively studied
paradigms in the study of human and machine learning, reinforcement learning
(RL). A three-day meeting of up to 30 leading researchers from a variety of
fields, including machine learning, neural networks, artificial intelligence,
robotics, and operations research, will attend the meeting. The goals of the
meeting include (1) Understanding limitations of current RL systems, and
defining promising directions for further research; (2) Clarifying the
relationships between RL and existing work in fields such as operations
research; (3) Identifying potential industrial applications of RL research. A
10-15 page report on the findings of the workshop will be produced, along with a
summary suitable for WWW posting. It is intended also to discuss the
establishment of an electronic newsgroup to facilitate communication among
disparate groups working in RL-related areas.
