This project is developing, refining and evaluating a suite of simulations and
systems-thinking exercises which enable students to investigate earth's climate
and human-energy systems and their complex responses to changes in forcing
factors. Scientifically sound and easy-to-use software models provide rapid
feedback as students grapple with system responses over time to a variety of
input assumptions. The ability of students to assume the roles of multiple
stakeholders and quickly explore 'what if' scenarios as climate sensitivity and
forcing factors are varied promotes understanding of underlying systems
concepts. The intellectual merit of this project lies in its well-grounded plans
for active engagement of students which confronts them with common
misconceptions of complex systems and promotes more-robust understanding of
system dynamics. The broader impacts include ready availability of the software
and approaches for adoption elsewhere and wide applicability of the approach
across a range of disciplines.
