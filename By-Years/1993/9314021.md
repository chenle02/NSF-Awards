9314021 Knopoff This two-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in
seismology between Leon Knopoff of the University of California at Los Angeles
(UCLA) and Didier Sornette of the University of Nice. The objective of the
research is to study a fuse model of precursory seismicity prior to strong
earthquakes. The U.S. investigator and the group at UCLA brings to this
collaboration significant expertise in adapting crack fusion models to
earthquake problems. This is complemented by the French group's expertise in
evaluating the physics of a thermal fuse theory of earthquake prediction. The
proposed model involves the relationship between fault geometry and earthquake
space-time distributions. The research can be applied to problems of earthquake
prediction. It is of potential benefit to the petroleum production industry in
that it will enhance understanding of the relationship of seismicity to
hydrofactures. ***
