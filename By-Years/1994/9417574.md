Bruenn, Stephen AST 94-17574 The main topic of this investigation is convection
and its relation to the supernova explosion mechanism. Other workers have
identified three convective regimes: prompt postshock convection, neutron
fingers, and larger macroconvection. In each case the convective regime has been
claimed to be crucial for the supernova explosion mechanism. The PI and
collaborators will continue to carefully evaluate each of these claims. ***
