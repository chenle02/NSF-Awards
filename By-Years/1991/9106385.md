In this project, PI's from three institutions will carry out sampling on a
transect in the Southern Ocean along 65 degrees South latitude across the Ross
Sea. The sampling will be carried out on the USSR vessel, R/V IOFFE. Scientists
from Oregon State University will provide overall coordination and contribute to
the overall data analysis and integration, while scientists from Lamont-Doherty
will acquire and analyze samples for the tracers, Tritium, Helium, Oxygen-18,
and Carbon-14. The Scripps Institution of Oceanography (this project) will be
responsible for hydrography and nutrients. This section constitutes a joint
contribution by the USA and the Soviet Union to the International World Ocean
Circulation Experiment (WOCE), specifically, Hydrographic line S-4.
