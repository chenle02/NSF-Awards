Nontechnical Abstract Context Dependence of Learning and Memory Processes Memory
is usually best when the act of remembering takes place in a presence of the
background stimuli ( contextual stimuli ) that were also present when learning
occurred. However, this is not always true; memory for some types of material is
not very context- dependent. This project seeks to understand why some memories
are context-dependent and others are context-independent. It will study the role
of contextual stimuli in classical conditioning, a fundamental example of
associative learning that is connected with many aspects of cognition and
behavior in animals and humans. Rats will learn that one stimulus, such as a
tone or a light or a distinctive flavor, signals the occurrence of another
stimulus, such as a food pellet or a mild footshock or malaise. The signal comes
evoke behaviors that indicate that learning (and also remembering) have taken
place. The project will test the effects of changing the context on various
forms of this kind of learning. Some, but not all, are context-dependent. For
example, if a signal is associated with different stimuli (e.g., shock and food)
at different times, the second association, but not the first, is typically
context-dependent. The project will test several ideas of why this should be so.
It will also study several different kinds of cues that can provide a context.
This research will have major impact on theories of learning, memory, and
acquired motivation. It will also be relevant to research on the neurobiology of
learning memory. And the results may help us design better cognitive- behavioral
therapies of human behavior disorders (e.g., drug dependence and anxiety), which
may be successful or not depending on whether the learning they involve is
context- independent.
