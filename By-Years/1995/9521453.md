9521453 Brazeau Fertilization success among sessile, marine invertebrates is a
largely unknown variable bridging those factors which field ecologists can
measure (fecundity, organism size, population abundance) and one often difficult
to estimate (reproductive success). Using the Caribbean octocoral Baiareum
asbestinum as a model animal, this project will examine temporal and spatial
variation in reproductive success for male and female colonies. The reserach
will test the specific prediction that female fertilization success is directly
proportional to the nearby abundance male colonies. This information is crucial
for understanding the abundance and growth of invertebrate populations in coral
reef ecosystems and will provide important information for the successful
restoration and management of coral reefs worldwide. ***
