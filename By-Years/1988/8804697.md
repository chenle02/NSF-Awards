Dr.Levinson is seeking to ascertain how early American aircraft manufacturers
dealt with the matter of the selection and, possibly, design of airfoil profiles
(wing cross-sections) for their machines. The major work to be done is the
examination of remaining archival materials of early firms such as Boeing,
Martin, and Curtiss-Wright. Dr. Levinson will start with a study of Boeing
Airplane Company materials in the area of Seattle, Washington close to the host
institution, the University of Washington. Other material of interst is held in
the "Old Wright Brothers Windtunnel" archive at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. The significance of this work is twofold. First, it will provide a
major piece in the structure of an ongoing project, a comparative study of early
American and German airfoil work. Second, the project also will provide
understanding of how an emerging American industry dealt with a fundamental
question important to the design of its products. The study will provide one
more window on the matter of how American industry and engineers came to accept,
or fight, the ever increasing importance of science and theory to the
development of technology in the twentieth century.
