9312231 McClure The focus of this research is the development of pentavalent
organophospholene chemistry as a new synthetic method for the production of
phosphonate-containing compounds. The oxophospholenes will be condensed with a
variety of electrophiles to give highly substituted phosphonates. The
phosphonates, in turn, will provide intermediates for the production of inositol
phosphates, sphingomyelins, carbohydrates and C-nucleoside analogs. %%% With
this award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr.
Cynthia K. McClure of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Delaware.
Professor McClure will focus her work on the synthesis of simple phosphonate
analogs of biologically active phosphates. The target compounds are of potential
interest as antimetabolites and enzyme active- site probes. ***
