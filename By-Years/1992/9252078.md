Students in the Systems Engineering Laboratory of the North Carolina A &amp; T
State University are learning human-machine interaction principles, as part of
their industrial engineering education, using a teleoperated robot. Working in a
human- machine interaction environment is a newly accepted paradigm, shifting
from manual-supervisory to cognitive-supervisory tasks involving the complexity
of the human-machine interface. This laboratory allows the incorporation of
modern technologies associated with human-machine systems in a modern industrial
engineering curriculum. Among those, the laboratory (1) exposes the graduate and
undergraduate students to a human- machine environment that supports modern
engineering design theories, (2) provides the students with an environment to
experiment with multi-agent systems (robots, computers, cameras, human
operators, etc.), and (3) improves quality of instruction in a cost/effective
manner by providing resources for student projects and direct laboratory case
studies.
