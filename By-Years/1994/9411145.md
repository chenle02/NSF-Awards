9411145 Schwartz The control of systems modeled by nonlinear differential
equations is an important topic to study because of the prevalence of these
models in manufacturing, chemical process, automotive, power, and aerospace
industries. Normal form techniques have been successfully applied to simplify
the state space expression of nonlinear ordinary differential equations. Here we
propose to study the stabilization of nonlinear control systems using normal
form techniques. Thus, we are interested in systems whose linearizations possess
at least one uncontrollable critical mode. From some preliminary analysis, it
can be inferred that there is a great advantage to using the normal form as a
method to reduce the dimension of the system whose stability is to be analyzed.
We propose to study this dimensional advantage in detail as it may be applied to
various problems. One question of interest is to understand and characterize the
decoupling of the critical and stable modes of a nonlinear control system in
normal form. Another line of proposed study is to examine how the normal form
characterizes the Lyapunov function associated with the nonlinear system. We
would also estimate the region of attraction of stability for nonlinear systems
using the normal form. We will study the relationship between the normal form
and the center manifold techniques which have been previously used in
stabilization analyses. Full and Partial feedback linearization, and approximate
feedback linearization will also be studied, to see if these objectives can be
achieved more simply using the normal form. Time scale techniques have been
applied to control systems in order to simplify analysis and obtain stability
results. A further direction of the research herein proposed will be to derive a
deeper understanding of the relationship between stability and time scale, and
the relevance of time scale techniques to existing center manifold and normal
form techniques in stabilization of nonlinear control systems. ***
