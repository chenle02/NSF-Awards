Pierce 9626774 This is an award to support conduct of a conference to consider
advances in the knowledge-base supporting environmental engineering practice
that have been made by investigators who have been supported by the National
Science Foundation's "young investigator" programs. Starting with the
Presidential Young Investigators (PYI) initiative in 1984, NSF has supported a
total of 36 PYI's, NYI's (National Science Foundation Young Investigators) and
PFF's (Presidential Faculty Fellows) for a total investment including matching
funds from industry of almost $5 million. The diversity of research that has
been conducted by these investigators reflects the program's objectives to
restore contaminated environmental resources to useful quality and to reduce
adverse effects of solid, liquid and gaseous discharges into land, water and air
that impair their usefulness. The product of this conference is expected to be
used in planning operation of the Environmental Engineering Research program as
it addresses outstanding issues in environmental engineering practice. Results
are also expected to assist in advancing the National Science Foundation's
commitment to the core strategy of integrating research and education as
articulated in its strategic plan.
