Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IIS - 0836181 &lt;br/&gt;Framework for a General
Multimedia Workbench&lt;br/&gt;Byrd, Donald, Indiana
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SGER project will pursue the development of
a general framework for exploring and editing time-dependent multimedia using a
variety of coordinated visualizations and sonifications. It enhances
contemporary methods of content-based searching and retrieval of musical
information from online databases and stored in a variety of formats ranging
from encoded score files to digital audio. The type of system proposed would for
the first time make it possible for scholars to compare relationships among
musical works and among versions of the same work in a new flexible ways. The
underlying general problem addressed in the project of a framework supporting
combinations of visualizations and sonifications in a modular framework allows
the results to apply to temporal phenomena generally across disciplinary
domains.&lt;br/&gt;
