Western Washington University will acquire instrumentation which will provide
students in our Optics Concentration with hands-on exposure to modern methods of
laser spectroscopy, optical detection, signal processing, and computer-based
data acquisition. The Physics Department will purchase a PRA LN120C2 Combination
Nitrogen/Dye Laser System, a Stanford Research Systems Model SR400 Gated Photon
Counter, and an IBM PC/XT Compatible Computer. These instruments form a
versatile combination which will enable the students to perform a wide variety
of laser spectroscopy experiments in absorption, fluorescence, Raman, opto-
acoustic, opto-galvanic, and photothermal deflection spectroscopy. In addition,
the nitrogen/dye laser system will serve as a teaching tool for the study of
these important laser types. This project is significant because it brings to
the undergraduate laboratory, devices and techniques which are routinely used in
graduate, government, and industrial research laboratories. It will enable
students to understand and utilize laser spectroscopic techniques for the
analysis of matter at an earlier stage of their careers. Finally, it will serve
other institutions through the publication of student lab experiments which will
be developed. Western Washington University will match the NSF grant with an
equal amount of funds.
