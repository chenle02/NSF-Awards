Students are using a new computational mathematics laboratory to gain a better
understanding of mathematics and its applications. Macintosh computers are
running Mathematica, a package that combines symbolic algebra routines and
graphics capabilities, to allow students to do numerical calculations, symbolic
algebra, and two- and three- dimensional graphics. The projects began with third
semester calculus and is being integrated into the entire sequence. The
university will match the award with an equal amount of funds.
