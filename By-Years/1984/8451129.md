With the advent of recent advances in VLSI prototyping, it is now practical to
think about the implementation of rather complicated, computationally intensive,
adaptive, time-varying, and non-linear control schemes. Such schemes are a
matter of necessity in the control of new generation aircraft, submarines,
missiles, and robot manipulators which have rather severe nonlinearities in
their dynamics. In this research, methodologies for adaptive, linear, and
nonlinear control systems are examined which will generate algorithms that can
later be implemented in custom VLSI format. One specific application which will
be of focal interest to the work will be the real-time control of robot
manipulators. The advantages of focusing on the application to robot
manipulators are two: First, manipulators are available in this laboratory on
which to try out the control laws; and second, the dynamics of robots are
complicated, non-linear, and imprecisely known, resulting in the necessity for
non-linear, adaptive, and pre-view control schemes which make this application a
good benchmark for the algorithms.
