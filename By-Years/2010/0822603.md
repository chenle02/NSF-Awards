Proposal to acquire seven items of shared-use scientific instrumentation for use
on R/V Savannah, operated by Skidaway Institute of Oceanography as part of the
University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet. The
7 items requested, as prioritized by the PI, are: &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;1)
RS-232 &amp; Navigation Interface box for SBE 21&lt;br/&gt;2) Replacement Water
Sample Bottles for carousel with repair kits&lt;br/&gt;3) Underwater
pinger/transponders and interrogator device.&lt;br/&gt;4) Dive
Package&lt;br/&gt;5) Fluorometers for flow-through system&lt;br/&gt;6) Backup
sensors for CTD carousel&lt;br/&gt;7) Backup meteorological
sensors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts:&lt;br/&gt; In the present
proposal, the items recommended for support provide an important shared-use
infrastructure capability for basic instrumentation that is cost-effective, and
will significantly improve capabilities for users of R/V Savannah, which
services a diverse group of investigators from around the U.S. The Skidaway
technical support group has the expertise to operate and support the recommended
systems on the vessels&lt;br/&gt;
