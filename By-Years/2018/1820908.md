This award funds the research activities of Professor Xi Dong at the University
of California, Santa Barbara.

Many of the deepest issues in physics are rooted in the difficulty of unifying
quantum mechanics with Einstein's general theory of relativity into a quantum-
mechanical description of gravity. Finding such a theory of quantum gravity will
solve some of the biggest mysteries surrounding black holes and the origin of
the universe, and will undoubtedly lead to a deeper understanding of nature from
the largest to the smallest scales. As a result, research in this area advances
the national interest by promoting the progress of science in its most
fundamental direction: the discovery and understanding of new physical laws. As
part of this project, Professor Dong will use the latest techniques from quantum
field theory and the field of quantum information science to address some of the
foundational questions about quantum gravity. This project is also envisioned to
have significant broader impacts. Professor Dong will involve graduate students
in his research and thereby provide critical training for junior physicists
beginning research in this field. Through a wide range of forums, Professor Dong
will also communicate and disseminate the findings of his research to a broad
audience.

More technically, Professor Dong will develop new theoretical tools and ideas
for studying the structure of quantum entanglement in holography and quantum
field theory. Equipped with these entanglement tools, he will further explore
the connection between quantum information and quantum gravity. He will then
leverage these results in order to investigate the black hole information
paradox and quantum gravity in the accelerating universe.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
