During the FY11-12 academic year, various directorates/offices across the
National Science Foundation (NSF) host nineteen (19) K-12 science and
mathematics teachers as Fellows of the Albert Einstein Distinguished Educator
Fellowship (AEDEF) program. The AEDEF program is a congressionally-mandated
program under the auspices of the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE). NSF
participates in AEDEF through a grant to the Triangle Coalition (TC) that
manages the program for DOE.

The objectives of the program are to: (1) provide outstanding STEM teachers the
opportunity to bring to Congress, and appropriate branches of the Federal
government the insights, extensive knowledge, and practical experience of
classroom teachers; (2) increase the understanding, communication, and
cooperation between Congress and Federal agencies; (3) increase the
understanding, communication and cooperation between the Federal government and
the science, technology and mathematics education community; and (4) gain
insights and an understanding of national educational issues which can then be
transferred back to the classroom. While at NSF, each Fellow gains general as
well as discipline-specific knowledge based on their placement within
Foundation.

During FY11-12, Fellows engage in a wide range of STEM activities both internal
and external to NSF. These activities offer a wealth of experiences likely to
advance the STEM knowledge base of participating teachers. Representing 11
states (California, Colorado, Florida, Indiana, Louisiana, Michigan, Ohio,
Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Utah, and Virginia), Fellows serve their 11-month
fellowship under a specific sponsor who oversees the day-to-day activities of
the individual Fellow.

Other agencies participating in the program include NASA, NOAA, and DOE.
