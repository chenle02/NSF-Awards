The National Alliance for Doctoral Studies in the Mathematical Sciences ("The
Alliance") is an alliance of mathematical sciences faculty and students with the
following goals:

1. To increase the number of doctoral degrees in the mathematical sciences among
groups that have been traditionally underrepresented in these fields. 2. To
improve placement of students from these groups in doctoral programs in
disciplines that recruit undergraduate mathematics majors. 3. To increase the
number of Ph.D.s from these groups who enter the professoriate in the
mathematical sciences as well as other appropriate professions. 4. To increase
funded research collaborations among faculty members at universities with
mathematical sciences doctoral programs and faculty members at colleges and
universities focused on undergraduate students. 5. To foster the growth of a
community of mathematical scientists that promotes a diverse workforce.

The Alliance brings together more than 200 faculty from colleges and
universities that serve large percentages of undergraduate students from
underrepresented backgrounds and nearly 100 of their counterparts at masters and
doctoral granting mathematical sciences departments. It serves more than 400
undergraduate and master's level students from families, regions, and ethnic
backgrounds that have had little prior contact with the culture and profession
of research in the mathematical sciences. The Alliance has had initial success
and it is growing rapidly, in numbers, in programs, and in its ties to other
parts of the profession. This proposal provides funds to support Alliance
programming and personnel to allow the organization to create an appropriate
governance structure and infrastructure to support this growth as well as to
begin the critical evaluation and research that will guide the Alliance in its
growth and provide data and outcomes to those who would develop such programs in
other STEM disciplines.
