Scientific societies are a critical stakeholder and leader in bringing about
cultural change toward open data across the sciences. The American Geophysical
Union (AGU) has played a key role in being a change agent in open science
specifically by leading the Earth and space science communities in enabling
research data to be findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR).
The AGU proposes to host a workshop and one-on-one follow-up conversations with
targeted societies within the Earth and space sciences and in adjacent
disciplines. The goal of the proposal is to engage and empower more scientific
societies on their way to adoption of open science principles through education,
tools, materials, and consultation. The intellectual merit is in evaluation of
the effectiveness of the open and FAIR data tool suite for societies and their
members and in moving societies forward in open
science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
