9409429 Zhang The research proposed in this RIA is a computer simulation study
of the respiratory flow and transport processes within the entire human upper
airways, including nasal and oral airways, laryngeal airway, and first three
generation of tracheobronchial tree. Airways will be cascaded and computer
simulation will be conducted in the integrated respiratory system. Flow patterns
within the airway system will be investigated by numerically solving the
corresponding full Navier-Stokes equations in a three- dimensional curvilinear
coordinated system. Body-fitted grids in conjunction with the grid block-off
method will be employed to mimic the complex airway geometry. A unified
trajectory mapping approach will be used to compute particle trajectories. ***
