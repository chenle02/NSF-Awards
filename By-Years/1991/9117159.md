This grant supplies logistical and field support to make millimeter wavelength
radio measurements of the stratospheric gases, ozone, nitrous oxide and,
especially, chlorine monoxide. The measurements will be made from McMurdo,
Antarctica. The purpose is to provide "ground truth" for the similar microwave
emission spectrometer on NASA's Upper Atmospheric Research Satellite (UARS). The
PI has been making similar measurements from Antarctica to study the annual
ozone hole phenomena for several of the past few years. The necessary support
funds for the PI are being supplied by NASA.
