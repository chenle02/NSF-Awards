In this project, the PI will conduct research on a type of inverse problems in
which the desired unknown is a discrete variable. This work represents a
departure from classical inverse problems where the unknowns are continuous
variables. One way to describe the unknown is to call it a "word" consisting of
a number of letters. In these problems one is given measured data which is
related to the unknown word. The object is to determine the word from the data.
Given a set of characters that are permitted in forming a word, the number of
possible n-letter words that can be formed is still very large. However, it is
finite. The approach taken in this work is to exploit the structure of how a
word is formed. The goal is to devise specialized algorithms which are fast and
robust. Target applications for this work include bar code reading and RFID
(Radio-frequency identification) where the hidden words are product codes
consisting of ASCII characters. This class of inverse problems requires new
approaches and development of new techniques. Ideas from sparse representation
using dictionaries, coding theory, and signal processing will be employed in
this work. The aim of this effort is to develop practical algorithms that have
desirable mathematical properties. The ultimate goal of this work is to create
new technologies that will make a difference in industry and commerce.

Bar codes and RFID, used to identify products in stores and warehouses, are
important elements in supply chain management. They are also used to track the
life-cycle of products. There is a need for algorithms for hand-held laser
scanners that can read bar codes that are damaged or dirty, and work in poor
conditions. There is also a need for RFID reading methods that can deal with
multiple tags that are near each other. The products of research from this
proposal have the potential to make a difference in commerce. The methods may
improve identification and tracking of products at points of sale and in
warehouses, and may be able to improve inventory control and supply-chain
management. It is hoped that the work being proposed will have a measurable
economic impact. The PI plans to use bar code decoding as exemplar of industrial
mathematics in the classroom at the undergraduate level. The subject is
perticularly exciting and accessible, and involves a breadth of knowledge, from
coding theory to signal processing, from measurement science to modeling. Bar
code decoding demonstrates the utility and importance of mathematics in our
daily lives. The PI has a track record of working with high-school students and
undergraduates, and intends to engage students at these level, and at the
graduate level, in the proposed work.
