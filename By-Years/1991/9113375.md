It is planned to develop coherent phase models of Langmuir waves turbulence
driven by field aligned electron beams in the moderately magnetized lower
auroral region and compare the numerically determined time-dependent solutions
of these equations in two and three spatial dimensions with current rockets and
planned satellite high time resolution measurements of Langmuir turbulence. ***
