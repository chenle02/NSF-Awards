GRADUATE TEACHING FELLOWS IN K-12
EDUCATION&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PROPOSAL #:
0809317&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Alan Christian&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION:
Arkansas State University&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: ?Land Use, Land Cover, and
Biodiversity in the Mississippi Embayment? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mississippi
Embayment is one of the most modified ecosystems in North America, being
converted from forested wetland ecosystems into highly productive row crop
agriculture. The conversion has left a highly fragmented and modified ecosystem.
Biodiversity, defined here as genetic, species, and ecosystem diversity, is
highly influenced by spatial and temporal changes in land cover and land use and
has led to extensive hypothesis generating research on atmospheric, soil, and
water resources at ASU. A GK12 theme was developed based on Environmental
Sciences Graduate Program faculty research addressing regional biodiversity
across ecosystems and organisms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project places 8
doctoral Fellows per year in 5 east Arkansas schools to teach 6th ? 8th grade
students lessons based on the Fellow?s research. The four main goals of the
project are: 1) Fellows will receive training in best practices pedagogical
methods and will gain experience in teaching to a broad range of education and
age levels. The Fellows will receive in-depth training in inquiry based
education methods that can be applied across the K16 curriculum; 2) Teachers
will receive professional development via workshops covering pedagogical
methods, development and implementation of lesson plans and gain a deeper
understanding of science content and inquiry based teaching and learning; 3)
Students? will become more interested in STEM and STEM careers and receive an
enriched STEM environment; 4) Partnerships between ASU and school districts will
be strengthened. The intellectual merit and broader impacts of the proposal are:
1) Fellows also will receive training that will add greatly to their skill set
increasing their success of future outreach and educational activities; 2)
increase STEM interest, excitement, and career choice of K-12 students; 3)
provide teachers exposure to the Fellows? methods and analyses exposing them to
the latest techniques; and 4) linkages between higher education and school
districts being strengthened and becoming more accessible, especially to
underserved populations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&
