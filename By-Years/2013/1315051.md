This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project fills a key
technological gap in development of biological and chemical sensor development.
There is an unmet need for tests that easily detect molecular, cellular, or
clinical responses that indicate disease onset or predict which candidate drugs
will have harmful side effects. In this project, we are addressing this need by
innovating and commercializing a reliable, sensitive, and accurate test that
simultaneously monitors and quantifies levels of multiple proteins in biological
fluids (plasma, urine, serum). These target protein biomarkers indicate disease
onset, disease progression, or drug efficacy. The test is simple and can be
performed using existing laboratory equipment, allowing for easy adoption in
academic labs and pharmaceutical companies. Furthermore, this test is the only
test that reliably prevents false positive signals, which typically result from
nonspecific binding between non-target protein-detection agents. Preventing
false positive signals is crucial because it enables more accurate measure of
proteins in biological fluids. An initial test panel of proteins to be tested
will be for cardiovascular disease management and drug development.

The broader impact/commercial application of this project is in the $1 billion
life science research market that today is served mainly by tests that can only
detect a single protein at a time. Measuring proteins one by one is time- and
labor-intensive. The proposed research has tremendous potential as a research
tool for highly accurate detection and analyses of protein biomarkers, leading
to better understanding of disease pathogenesis and therapeutic response. The
innovative, new test also has potential applications in the $36.6 billion
contract research organization market to improve drug safety and efficacy
testing, decrease clinical trial costs, and decrease time to market. This
proposal advances the fields of Biological and Chemical Technologies (BC) as
well as of Nanotechnology, Advanced Materials, and Manufacturing (NM)
