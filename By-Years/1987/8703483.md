This project is in continuum fixed-point theory, an area of geometric topology.
The central topic is the following classical unsolved problem. Does every plane
continuum that does not separate the plane have the fixed-point property? Recent
attempts by the principal investigator to answer this question led to the
establishment of several fixed-point theorems for deformations and arc-
component-preserving maps. These results suggest a new concept involving the
decomposition of a continuum into uniquely arcwise connected sets. One of the
principal investigator's goals is to establish a purely topological theorem
based on this concept that will generalize the Poincare-Bendixson theorem. It is
surprising that an easily formulated question about the plane has defied
solution for many years. Techniques developed for its solution can be expected
to be basic, illuminating, and employable elsewhere.
