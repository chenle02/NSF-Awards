Much of the weather that is life threatening or disrupts economic activity
(e.g. tornadoes, heavy rains, hail heavy fog, severe snowfalls) occurs on what
meteorologist term the mesoscale. Recently, the atmospheric sciences community
has placed an increased emphasis on improving our understanding of mesoscale
phenomena. In a Phase I SBIR research award, the Principal Investigator showed
through theoretical and numerical analyses the viability of an airborne remote
sensing device for retrieving vertical profiles of temperature and moisture in
the clear air both above and below the aircraft flight level. Due to the great
mobility of aircraft, such measurements would be of substantial benefit in
mesoscale research. In Phase II, the Principal Investigator will fabricate and
field test this remote sensing device.
