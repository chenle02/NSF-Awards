This research is to do a broadband seismic study of the Earth's mantle using a
combination of ScS reverberations and traditional passive-seismic methods, such
as fundamental and higher-mode surface-wave dispersion, regional phase, and
mode-converted phase analyses. Digital data sets from the IRIS, GDSN, Chinese
digital seismic network, RSTN, and Geoscope networks will be utilized. The
transition width and lateral continuity of mantle discontinuities will be mapped
and applied to questions of the extent of the continental roots and how
discontinuities are dominated by chemical versus phase change transitions.
