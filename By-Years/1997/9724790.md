9724790 Etges This U.S.-Mexico award will support Dr. William Etges of the
University of Arkansas in a research collaboration with Dr. Miguel Armella
Villalpando of the Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana (Iztapalapa campus) in
Mexico. The researchers plan to study patterns of host use among insect species
to analyze resource associations and degree of host plant switching among
ancestral and derived groups. In particular, they plan to study the host
relationships of the D. repleta group species, a cactophilic large group within
the genus Drosophila thought to have originated in New World deserts, including
the cactus-rich arid lands of central Mexico. This collaboration will allow the
location and identification of cactus hosts of D.repleta in the deserts of
central Mexico and will increase our understanding of the evolution of this
particular group species, which, despite concentrated research efforts over the
last 50 years, remains poorly understood. Using phylogenetic relationships among
these species, currently derived using molecular approaches, the researchers
propose to use patterns of host use to gain insight into the processes of
biological diversification that have given rise to this large species group. ***
