Hwang will work on two areas in statistics: a theory concerning the conditional
analysis and a theory about prediction based on a measurement error model. In
the first part of the proposal, the principal investigator proposes to examine
the estimated confidence approach by applying it to the Fieller's problem and by
relating it to Fisher's exact tests for contingency tables. The second part of
the research will focus on construction of prediction intervals based on
measurement error models, which arise in many applications. The examples that
motivate the principal investigator in this research are about the prediction
problems of compressive strengths of concrete based on nondestructive tests. The
principal investigator will work on two areas: conditional inference and
prediction. For the first area, Hwang shall determine which statistical
procedures for evaluating the probability of a particular event can take
advantage of lucky data better than others; in other words, which procedures
work better conditionally. The event involved refers to whether a particular
interval (based on data) covers some ratios of unknown parameters. In the second
area, Hwang's focus will be on prediction by intervals, where the studies are
more applicable to U.S. society. The aim of the research is to construct a
prediction interval for the compressive strength of a wall, a bridge, or a
building based on a nondestructive method such as pulse velocity of penetrating
sound waves. Success of this project may help to determine, without destroying
any part of the bridge, whether the bridge is weak enough that it causes
concern.
