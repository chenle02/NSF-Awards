Abstract 9614912 Wefel This award provides funds to continue the analysis of
data acquired from the Japanese American Cosmic-ray Emulsion-chamber Experiment
(JACEE) experiment over the past several years. JACEE has flown balloon borne
payloads for long periods, up to 2 weeks, from McMurdo on paths which
circumnavigate the pole. The experiments consist of stacks of photgraphic style
emulsions which record the paths and interactions of energetic cosmic rays. The
emulsions are developed once they are recovered from the ground, and by
measuring the tracks, the isotopic mass of the elements which made them are
determined. JACEE is one of the few experiments which is providing data on the
elemental constituents of cosmic rays with energies near 10^15 eV, which will
provide important information on the origin of cosmic rays. JACEE is a
collaboration of NASA/MSFC, the Universities of Washington and Alabama,
Louisiana State University and several institutions in Japan and Poland. The
balloons, launch services and tracking were provided by NASA while the
logistics, housing and payload recovery were provided by NSF's Office of Polar
Programs. ***
