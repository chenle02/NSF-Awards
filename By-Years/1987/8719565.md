The purpose of this research project is to develop a system to measure, record,
and transmit hailfall data, including the time evolution at the ground of the
hailstone size distribution, the kinetic energy of hailfall, and the accumulated
hail mass. It is expected that existing hail momentum sensors, based on 20-year-
old technology, will be updated using a new technology such as piezo film. This
project will be carried out by a consortium of undergraduate institutions, and
will be worked on primarily by undergraduate students in electrical and
mechanical engineering design courses, and undergraduate research courses.
