This Small Grant for Exploratory Research will enable a young investigator to
prove whether she can feasibly do studies on paternity on a very interesting
group of monkeys using DNA derived from their dung. Because the techinque is
very new, because there is not yet a published body of work that exemplifies its
application, the research must be regarded as risky and exploratory - yet the
potential pay-offs are very great. A second objective, beyond the establishment
of her abilities to extract and verify paternity for these monkeys from their
dung, is to collect behavioral data and field samples. This is an exciting and
`cutting-edge` project in animal behavior. It will also encourage a young woman
investigator in her development.
