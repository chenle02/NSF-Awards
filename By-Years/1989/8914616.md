Graduate student Paul Manos proposes an analysis of the evolutionary
relationships among oak species in the western U.S. using morphological
characters, pollen features, enzyme electrophoresis, and chloroplast DNA
sequence data. Hybridization among oak species has obscured the delimitation
among species, and this project addresses the problem by studying pairs of
parental species in the western U.S. and narrow pair-wise hybrid zones on the
Channel Islands. Higher-level relationships with other members of the family
Fagaceae will also be explored. The proposed analysis will clarify our
understanding of oak classification, and will provide new insight into
relationship between morphological and molecular evolution in woody plants. Oaks
have a rich fossil record, and the proposed research will shed new light on the
significance of evolutionary changes recorded in fossils.
