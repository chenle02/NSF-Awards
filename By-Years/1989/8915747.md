Aminostratigraphic analysis of Quaternary mollusc samples from subsurface
samples of the submerged and emerged portion of the Atlantic Coastal Plain in
North and South Carolina will be conducted. These results will aid in the
testing of two mutually exclusive aminostratigraphic models for Coastal Plain
Quaternary correlation. These models require either that the region between
Norfolk, VA and Charleston, SC has preserved an unusual late Quaternary sea-
level/tectonic record or that some U-series coral dates for the region are
incorrect. Currently available data from the Pleistocene of the Cape Lookout, NC
region indicate that this area marks the boundary between two distinctive types
of preserved stratigraphic records, with the Quaternary record northeast of Cape
Lookout being more complete. The implications of this contrast in preserved
records for Coastal Plain aminostratigraphic and U-series data, and for regional
thermal, sedimentologic and tectonic histories will be evaluated during the
proposed research.
