This REU Site will allow ten talented undergraduate students to enroll in an
intensive six-week summer program at Northwestern University. The Site focuses
on Culture, Language, and Cognition and will utilize a multidisciplinary
approach. Student research projects will explore such topics as culture,
language, cognition, categorization, reasoning, learning, and social
behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Activities in the program will include a lecture
series, research conducted closely with a faculty mentor, and a conference at
the end of the program in which students will present their research. The
objectives of the program include educating students to think about culture from
a multidisciplinary perspective as well as familiarizing them with some of the
broader conceptual and methodological tools required in the social
sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Site is supported by the Department of
Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program and contributes to the
Foundation's continuing efforts to attract talented students into careers in
science through active undergraduate research experiences.&lt;br/&gt;
