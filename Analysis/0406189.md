ABSTRACT

A basic problem in several complex variables is to understand the interplay
between the analytic and geometric natures of a domain. The principal
investigator plans to address this problem by studying the d-bar-Neumann
problem, invariant metrics, and automorphism groups. More specifically, the
principal investigator plans to study compactness and eigenvalue spectrum of the
d-bar-Neumann operator. He will investigate necessary and sufficient conditions
for compactness of the d-bar-Neumann problem in geometric and potential
theoretic terms. He will also study eigenvalue spectrum of the d-bar-Neumann
problem by investigating, among other problems, the several complex variables
analog of Mark Kac's question: ``Can one hear the shape of a drum?''. In
addition, the principal investigator plans to study invariant metrics, in
particularly, the Bergman and Kobayashi metrics. He will consider boundary
behavior and the zero set of the Bergman kernel function, as well as
completeness of the Kobayashi metric. Another problem to be studied is the
theory of automorphism groups and its relationship with the regularity of the
d-bar-Neumann problem.

Complex analysis is a key tool in many areas of sciences and engineering. For
example, the Laplace transform is essential in the study of mechanical
vibrations and electric circuits. The Laplace equation has important
applications to hydrodynamics, electrostatics, and heat conduction. The problems
under investigation in this project are not only intrinsically interesting, but
also have implications in areas such as complex geometry, operator theory,
potential theory, mathematical physics, and quantum mechanics. Many tools to be
used in this project come from other branches of mathematics and sciences. Some
problems may even rely on computer programming. The investigator will also
contribute to the development of human resources by supervising a graduate
student.
