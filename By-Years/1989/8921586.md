The objective of the proposed research is to develop techniques that would allow
a building equipped with an energy management system to be operated in a cost
efficient manner. These techniques would be implemented in the energy management
system and automatically utilize operating data to perform a number of important
functions including on-line optimal control, performance monitoring and fault
detection. Methodologies for optimal control strategies would be developed to
allow the plant to operate at minimum cost. These methodologies would involve
development of simulation models for the plant and the components, with
parameter estimation techniques employed that utilize operating data. Fault
detection would allow assessment of changes in plant performance and
identification of the sources of the change. Both analytical and experimental
approaches will be employed to test the validity of the methodologies. The
results of the research will be algorithms that can be directly incorporated in
energy management systems.
