Still's research is supported by the Synthetic Organic Program. A professor of
Chemistry at Columbia University, Still is studying how to prepare and computer-
model structures and reactions of complex organic molecules. His work has
already had impact on how chemists design and analyze molecular structure, and
his studies continue to lead the way in this very important area. The objectives
of this project are: 1) to prepare a series of conformationally restricted host
molecules with three- dimensional binding sites, 2) to study their geometries
and binding properties with guest molecules, and 3) to use the data obtained to
test and evaluate a computational method for predicting binding properties.
