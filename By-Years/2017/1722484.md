The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is a genetically
engineered strain of copepods (small aquatic crustaceans) that hyperproduce the
natural red carotenoid, astaxanthin. Astaxanthin is an especially economically
important pigment used in the aquaculture, nutraceutical, and cosmetic
industries. Astaxanthin can be made synthetically but there is increasing demand
for naturally sourced astaxanthin. Currently, the market value of natural
astaxanthin for aquaculture feed is approximately $2000/kg and the nutraceutical
market value for natural astaxanthin is alomst $15,000/kg. Recent estimates of
the global astaxanthin market size are at more than 250 tons in 2014 and a
projected compound annual growth rate of over 7% from 2016 to 2023. This
technology provides two main benefits to customers: a natural source of
astaxanthin at a potentially lower cost than current sources and potential for
future engineering to further increase astaxanthin production and reduce
production costs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project will explore the
market potential of genetically engineered lineages of the marine copepod
Tigriopus californicus that produced up to 80% more natural astaxanthin than
wild copepods. Copepods are tiny crustaceans related to shrimp and are natural
component of marine fish diets. This technology is an improvement over the
current sources because copepods potentially produce more red pigment at a lower
production cost, and it has been demonstrated that genetic engineering for
increased astaxanthin production is feasible. This I-Corps project aims to
evaluate the market opportunities for the technology through customer discovery
interviews that will result in customer feedback that provides a better
understanding of the requirements for commercialization. Additionally, this
project has the potential to lead to significant progress in research on natural
pigment production for commercial applications.
