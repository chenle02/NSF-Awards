Taking inspiration from nature to solve design problems has the potential to
lead to major advances in almost every conceivable sphere of design and
innovation. Thus, there is a growing global movement of designers interested in
the practice of biologically inspired design (BID). However, the adoption and
growth of the movement is limited by the fact that most designers are novices in
biology. This causes two major issues: (i) slow, tedious search for biological
analogues relevant to design problems, and (ii) slow, inaccurate and imprecise
understanding of biological systems. Thus, there is a need for (a) information
systems that provide access to biological knowledge from a design perspective,
and (b) interactive tools that support the process of making biological
analogies in conceptual design. Over the last several years, researchers have
developed a suite of tools centered around an approach to semantically
representing, indexing, retrieving, assessing, and delivering biological
information relevant to design problems. This approach can form the basis for
providing a range of information services to BID professionals and contribute to
the growth of the movement.

BID not only offers innovative solutions, but it can also help drive trends in
sustainable design. Since nature does not take the "heat, beat, and treat"
approach often taken by human produced technologies, innovation that mimics
biological systems fosters sustainable design. Thus, in the long term,
researchers believe that this project can help lead to measurable progress in
sustainable design. The practice of BID is becoming widespread, encompassing
emerging disciplines like biotechnology, robotics, nanotechnology, synthetic
biology, etc. Thus, researchers expect that these information services can
potentially accelerate the growth of emerging technologies in all these
disciplines.
