Theoretical and computational methods are developed to study the interaction of
intense laser light with atoms. The main focus is to use the zero-range model to
explore the large variation of physical results with field strength, laser
frequency, intensity and polarization. By exploring these parameters one hopes
to be able to control the course of the reaction process.
