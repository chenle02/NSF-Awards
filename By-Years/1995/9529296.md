9529296 Kyu This primary objective of the present project is to elucidate phase
equilibria and self-organization behavior of crystallizable polymer blends
containing rigid-rod molecules. To account for the coupling of phase separation
and mesophase ordering, they have combined Flory-Huggins theory for isotropic
mixing and Maier-Saupe theory for nematic ordering of binary nematic mixtures by
taking into consideration the two orientational order parameters having two
nematic-isotropic transitions. Customarily, the effect of molecular orientation
has been ignored in the conventional thermodynamic or kinetic theory of
crystallization of flexible homopolymers, although it has been generally known
that flexible molecules indeed align among themselves during chain folding. They
will incorporate the effect of chain orientation on the crystallization which is
missing in the current crystallization theory of flexible homopolymers. The
coupling between crystallization kinetics and phase separation dynamics of
rigid-rod mixtures will be investigated by time-resolved scattering. %%% This is
an important proposal that raises the potential for incorporating various
theoretical predictions from different families of materials into a coherent
picture with particular emphasis in advanced polymer and blends. ***
