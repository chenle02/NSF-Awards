The University of Minnesota Bell Museum's research and teaching collections of
birds total over 40,000 specimens and represent a scientific resource that is
both national and international in scope. Of particular importance are series
from the Upper Midwest and Southwestern U.S., Mexico, Philippines, and both
polar regions; the collection also contains significant series of seabirds,
hybrids, known-age individuals, and rare and extinct species, many with
historical information dating back into the past century. An important Bell
Museum goal, now nearing completion, is the protection of these valuable
specimens through security measures and the replacement of deteriorating
specimen cases. The primary goal of this project is to make the research
collection more readily available to the scientific community through modern
computerization methods and equipment. Following a comprehensive survey of fifty
North American museums, many already with computerized collections, the Bell
Museum will develop a computerization program for its bird collection based not
only on the most recent computer hardware and software technology, but also on
the advice and experience of these many institutions.
