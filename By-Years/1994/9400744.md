9400744 Housner This project provides partial support of the First World
Conference on Structural Control (1WCSC)which is planned for convening in Los
Angeles during the period 3-5 August 1994. The US Panel on Structural Control
Researches co-sponsoring the 1WCSC with the Japan Panel on Structural Response
Control. The Panel. which was established in 1990, is charged wit the following
responsibilities: (1) facilitating the transmission of information concerning
state-of-the-art developments in the field; (2)identifying and prioritizing
needed research and development; (3) developing preliminary plans for analytical
and experimental advancement in the field; and (4) developing plans for the
performance of full-scale testing and demonstration. The Panel has assisted in
convening several major workshops to define the research directions and in NSF's
Structural Control Initiative. The convening of 1WCSC will maintain the
leadership of the U.S. Panel in the international arena that is related to the
field of smart materials and systems an essential technology area for the U.S.
scientific community to be competitive in. Furthermore, the joint funding and
sponsorship of the Conference with Japan will strengthen and develop new, major
collaborative efforts between the U.S. and Japan researchers in the emerging
fields covered by the Conference. ***
