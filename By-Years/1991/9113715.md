This project will explore methods for developing efficient parallel
multiplatform array algorithms and implementations. The research will mainly
focus on decomposition in preparation for the solution of a number of important
problems in computational linear algebra. The decomposition will be implemented
on a variety of SIMD and MIMD machines, both with and without shared memory,
under various interconnection schemes. Formal methods based on a functional
language with arrays for deriving/developing array algorithms.
