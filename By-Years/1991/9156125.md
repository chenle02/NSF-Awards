Two existing core-curriculum, non-science-majors-oriented classes (approximate
total enrollment 400/year; 2 natural science, 1 social science) will be modified
in the following ways: small discussion sections focused on "ill-structured
problems" will be incorporated into existing laboratory periods, lecture styles
will be modified to encourage more student involvement during class, and
existing wet laboratories will be modified to include more computer assisted
exercises. These changes are modeled after Perry's theories of "cognitive
development." Faculty and student teaching assistants assigned to the course
will receive prior training (a workshop led by Dr. Craig E. Nelson of Indiana
University, a recognized authority in the field) in the methods to be used.
Assessment of student pre and post course critical thinking skills and attitudes
towards education and towards science and scientists will be by interviews of
students and a paper and pencil test to be selected. An educational consultant
interested in developing critical thinking skills will conduct the testing phase
of the proposal and will advise concerning appropriate forums for dissemination.
