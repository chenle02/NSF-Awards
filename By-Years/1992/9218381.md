Extension along the continental margin of southwestern North America was in
progress before the modern plate boundary in the Gulf of California became
established. This project will investigate these early extensional structures in
an area of Baja California where Late Miocene to Quaternary volcanic and
sedimentary rocks are well exposed and contain evidence of extension. The work
involves field mapping, magentostratigraphy and radiometric age dating, and will
be done in association with Mexican colleagues. Results will be relevant to
generic models of Gulf of California rift initiation and may be applicable to
other rift systems in the geologic record.
