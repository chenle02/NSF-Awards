The work will continue to develop the algorithm of the LOQO &lt;br/&gt;interior
point code for general continuous mathematical &lt;br/&gt;programming problems,
and expand the range of problems to &lt;br/&gt;which it can be applied. Areas of
research include better&lt;br/&gt;detection of infeasibility and unboundedness,
better detection &lt;br/&gt;of linear dependence of the constraints, and better
estimates &lt;br/&gt;of initial estimates to the optimum point. Work on higher
&lt;br/&gt;order methods, which can greatly improve algorithmic efficiency,
&lt;br/&gt;will be continued, with particular interest in applying filter
&lt;br/&gt;methods. In an attempt to expand the scope of the types of
&lt;br/&gt;problems that the algorithm can solve, the research will be
&lt;br/&gt;concerned with solving discrete problems using interior point
&lt;br/&gt;methods. On type of problem considered will be mixed integer
&lt;br/&gt;quadratic programming. Problems of this type commonly arise in
&lt;br/&gt;finance. Mixed integer linear programming problems will also
&lt;br/&gt;be studied, with an initial focus on quickly finding feasible
&lt;br/&gt;solutions. Further work will be concerned with general
&lt;br/&gt;complementarity problems, especially those that arise in
&lt;br/&gt;economics and engineering. In all cases, appropriate collections
&lt;br/&gt;of problems arising from real applications will be modeled
&lt;br/&gt;in AMPL. These will be made available via the internet, as will
&lt;br/&gt;extensions to the LOQO program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The LOQO code
for solving a variety of types of mathematical &lt;br/&gt;programming problems
has been under development for the past &lt;br/&gt;four years as a joint
research effort of the principal investigator &lt;br/&gt;and Professor Robert
Vanderbei of Princeton University. The code &lt;br/&gt;is made freely available
via the internet, and to date has been &lt;br/&gt;downloaded several thousand
times. It is used to solve problems &lt;br/&gt;as diverse as engineering design,
portfolio optimization, airline &lt;br/&gt;scheduling problems, and is currently
being adapted for various &lt;br/&gt;projects in medical research. The proposed
research is &lt;br/&gt;concentrated both on improving the efficiency of the code
and &lt;br/&gt;increasing the set of problems for which the code can be used.
&lt;br/&gt;The new types of problems for which it is hoped the code can
&lt;br/&gt;be adapted efficiently are problems with variables that must be
&lt;br/&gt;an integer, generally 0 or 1. These problems are extremely common,
&lt;br/&gt;and of great practical value. For example, when assigning aircraft
&lt;br/&gt;to routes, a whole plane must be assigned to a specific route,
&lt;br/&gt;not some fraction of a plane. Including integer variables within
&lt;br/&gt;the context an algorithm of this type is very new, and will be
&lt;br/&gt;approached initially through important specific applications.
