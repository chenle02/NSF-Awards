A three-axis numerically controlled mill and a computer-aided manufacturing
system is integrated with an existing computer- aided design capability to give
undergraduate students the ability to design and manufacture complex parts. This
capability is directly incorporated into at least two courses in the form of
manufacturing experiments. One laboratory experiment insures that every
undergraduate has at least once, prior to graduation, designed, manufactured,
and tested a component part. The second manufacturing experiment is used to test
a student's ability to design optimal parts. The manufacturing capability will
further enable prototyping and construction of complex aerodynamtc models that
have been conceived of, in any of the presently offered design and student
project courses.
