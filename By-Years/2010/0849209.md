This proposal is for continued NSF support for an important interagency grants
program led by the Fogarty International Center of the National Institutes of
Health. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Science
Foundation (NSF) have, since 1993, jointly supported International Cooperative
Biodiversity Groups to address the interdependent issues of biodiversity
conservation, economic capacity, and human health through discovery and
development of therapeutic agents for diseases of importance in developing
countries as well as those important to developed countries. Other current
partners with NIH and NSF include the U.S. Departments of Agriculture and Energy
(USDA and DOE, respectively). Innovative and integrated approaches to access
genetic resources and benefit-sharing with host country stakeholders and
participants is an important component of the overall program. Projects that
work on marine coral reef organisms, endophytic fungi, extremophilic bacteria
and other poorly understood groups are particularly encouraged. The following
cross-cutting approaches guide the research and capacity-building efforts toward
these goals: a) assisting with the discovery and development of drugs that
address priority health needs of the participating developing country(ies) and
of the United States; b) assisting with research on other natural products-based
materials, such as locally used botanical medicines; c) developing biological
inventories of native species and, where relevant, indigenous knowledge; d)
training targeted toward achieving the research goals of this program and
meeting the needs of the participating country; and, e) enhancing the scientific
infrastructure within the host country. &lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the
ICBG program are central to its design and execution. In addition to
dissemination of the scientific results in traditional academic channels, the
projects engage in extensive outreach to host country organizations that support
research, conservation and education and those that make policy on access to
genetic resources. Research training of developing country scientists is a
required component of each project, as is the Internet posting of flora and
fauna data from conservation parks. Finally, a central goal of the projects is
the identification of molecules that will be developed into drugs to treat
globally important diseases.
