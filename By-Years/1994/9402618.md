9402618 Ramesh A fundamental investigation of the initiation and growth of
adiabatic shear bands will be made in a combined theoretical- experimental
program. Specifically the influence of microscopic mechanisms, geometric defects
and material properties on shear localization will be examined. The recovered
specimens will be examined using transmission electron microscopy in order to
characterize the microscopic mechanisms. ***
