This development and research project from Vanderbilt University, Facet
Innovations, and Filament Games, designs, develops, and tests a digital game-
based learning environment for supporting, assessing and analyzing middle school
students' conceptual knowledge in learning physics, specifically Newtonian
mechanics. This research integrates work from prior findings and refines
computer assisted testing and Hidden Markov Modeling to develop a new
methodology to engage students in deep learning while diagnosing and scaffolding
the learning of Newtonian mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project uses a
randomized experimental 2 x 1 design comparing a single control condition to a
single experimental condition with multiple iterations to test the impact of the
game on the learning of Newtonian physics. Using designed based research with
teachers and students, the researchers are iteratively developing and testing
the interactions and knowledge acquisition of students through interviews, pre
and post tests and stealth assessment. Student learner action logs are recorded
during game-play along with randomized student interviews. Students'
explanations and game-play data are collected and analyzed for changes in domain
understanding using pre-post tests assessment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project
will afford the validation of EGAME as an enabler of new knowledge in the fields
of cognition, conceptual change, computer adaptive testing and Hidden Markov
Modeling as 90 to 300 middle school students learn Newtonian mechanics, and
other science content in game-based learning and design. The design of this
digital game platform encompasses a very flexible environment that will be
accessible to a diverse group of audiences, and have a transformational affect
that will advance theory, design and practice in game-based learning
environments.
