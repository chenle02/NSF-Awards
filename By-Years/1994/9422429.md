9422429 Hamermesh How much people work has been a central focus of labor
economics during most of the last 50 years. When people work -- the timing of
work during the day -- has received almost no attention. This neglect is mainly
due to the paucity of data on this issue. That is unfortunate, since changes in
the distribution of work and leisure over time affect households' well-being.
This project will use the only available data to examine a variety of issues in
the timing of work. It is motivated by the apparent substantial changes that
have occurred even during the last decade in the United States in the
distribution of work hours over the work day, and by some simple cross-section
evidence for the U.S. and Germany on the importance of young children in
affecting spouses' joint decisions about timing leisure. The project involves an
entire research agenda of studies in the general area. It includes examining: 1)
how the timing of work changed between 1973 and 1991. The focus will be on
decomposing changes into those produced by changes in industrial structure,
demographic characteristics, and unmeasurable effects. 2) Life-cycle variation
in the timing of work and how it has changed among successive cohorts of
workers, using artificial cohorts of workers constructed from an 1 8-year
succession of Current Population Survey data; 3) how changes in a households'
demographic structure affect timing, with a particular concentration of the
roles of marriage and fertility and with applications to the availability of
child-care arrangements, using two-year panel data; 4) how timing varies over
the business cycle, and what these changes imply about the welfare effects of
unemployment; and 5) the impact of urban crime and urban disamenities generally
on timing, with a focus on how changes in measurable and unmeasurable
characteristics of urban areas have altered the timing of economic activity. ***
