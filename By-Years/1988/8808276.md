Econometrics provides the statistical tools for estimating economic
relationships from real world data. These estimates are used to test economic
theories and for policy analysis. But econometric practice also tends to impose
strong assumptions as a prelude to estimation. The objective of this project is
to improve current practice by developing econometric methods that require less
restrictive assumptions and, for problems where restrictive assumptions are
inescapable, measuring the trade-offs between estimability and the strength of
the assumptions. The specific econometric methods studied by this project
involve analysis of dynamic choice. The usual approach to dynamic decision
making is backwards recursion, i.e., the agent should begin by solving each of
the terminal problems that he might face and then work backwards to determine
the optimal action today. But direct analysis of dynamic choice by backward
recursion poses formidable modelling and computational problems. This project
develops an exciting new approach to dynamic choice that does not require
restrictive assumptions about the future. The project shows that inference can
be based on a relatively, simple, partly-reduced form static representation of
backwards recursion. This approach is applied to versions of the life- cycle
consumption problem, repeated games and sequential sampling. The methods are
used in a major empirical study of schooling and career choice.
