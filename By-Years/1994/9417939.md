9417939 Miller The northern Basin and Range province is a 700 km wide region of
distributed Cenozoic extension between the unextended Colorado Plateau and the
Sierra Nevada. This project will employ FT analysis to examine the temporal and
spatial details of this extension to discern how many phases of extension
occurred and whether they were synchronous or diachronous and how the extension
may be related to and how the extension may be related to other geologic
phenomena such as magmatism or plate interaction. Results may help develop a
more complete picture of how regional extensions proceeds, which in turn may
contribute to the assessment of various competing models for the fundamental
causes and processes involved.
