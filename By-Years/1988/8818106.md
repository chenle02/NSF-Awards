The regulation of ferritin mRNA translation in mammalian cells by iron will be
investigated in detail. Attention will be focused on two recently identified
components, the iron responsive sequence element within the 5' UTR of the mRNA,
and the repressor. The mechanisms by which these interact to inhibit translation
of ferritin mRNA will be defined. The possible roles of additional factors
(loosely defined as "co- repressors") or additional elements of mRNA sequences
and structure in the repression process will also be investigated. Finally, the
mechanism by which iron causes the de-repression of mRNA translation will be
explored. The results of these projects, if successful, will completely define
the mechanisms by which ferritin translation is regulated. While this represents
the first and best characterized example of translational induction/repression
in eukaryotes, it is clearly by no means unique. Previous investigations have
indicated the existence of many other genes whose expression appears to be
similarly regulated. Perhaps this work will serve as a model system which will
be generally useful in guiding explorations of other translationally regulated
systems. Dr. Thach has done some very good on initiation factor functions which
makes him well qualified for these studies.
