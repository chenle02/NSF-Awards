This proposal represents and ROW research planning grant. The research proposed
will continue comparative studies on the mechanical response of invertebrate
worm tentacles, when exposed to forces encountered during the feeding process,
and how the responses relate to the structure of the tentacle and to the
microscopic organization of the tissue of which it is composed. The relationship
between the mechanical properties and the tissue organization of invertebrate
feeding tentacle are of particular interest because tentacles capture food in
diverse ways ranging from removal of suspended matter from moving water to the
removal of particles from a substratum. This project addresses important aspects
of cell and tissue structure and function and should lend considerable insight
into what mechanisms can permit some cells and tissues to undergo large
deformations and to recover their prestrained shapes.
