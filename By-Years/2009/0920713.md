Intellectual Merit The development of renewable energy sources to supplant
fossil fuels is of utmost importance. Plant biomass, chiefly lignocellulose, has
great promise as a renewable source of energy. Exploitation of lignocellulose is
likely to involve the use of microorganisms that can convert it into fuels like
ethanol, butanol, or biodiesel derived from triacylglycerols and wax esters.
Streptomyces bacteria, a large genus of soil-dwelling actinobacteria, have great
potential as lignocellulose biorefineries because they are known to metabolize
components of lignocellulose and can produce biofuels. While much is known how
streptomycetes degrade cellulose and hemicellulose, comparatively little is
known about the genetics and biochemistry underlying their catabolism of the
lignin component of lignocellulose. An understanding of lignin depolymerization
and catabolism is essential for exploitation of Streptomyces bacteria for the
production of lignocellulosic biofuels. The project will employ molecular
biology and microbiology methods to shed light on lignin degradation and lay the
groundwork for microbial conversion of plant biomass into biofuels. Lignin
degradation is well understood in fungi, but it is poorly characterized in
bacteria. Thus, the project will enable compelling comparisons of this
fundamental biochemical process in different kingdoms of life.

Broader Impacts. The principal investigator is a member of an under-represented
group and has recruited women and under-represented groups to join him in his
research. To further involve individuals from under-represented groups, he has
formed a partnership with his alma mater, Morehouse College, a historically
black college. During the project, he will host a student from Morehouse in his
laboratory for mentored research. The principal investigator is also integrating
research and education through an unusual partnership with teachers and their
students at East Providence High School. He is jointly working to discover new
lignocellulolytic streptomycetes. The collaborative project will expose students
to research methods and raise scientific literacy.
