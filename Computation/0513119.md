The investigator and his colleagues develop numerical methods for scattering

problems, and perform a detailed analysis of these methods. Specifically, they
develop boundary element methods for integral formulations of the Helmholtz
equation, in which the basis functions are asymptotically derived. Each basis
function is the product of a smooth amplitude and a highly oscillatory phase
factor, like the asymptotic solution. The phase factor is determined a-priori by
geometrical optics and the geometrical theory of diffraction, while the
amplitude is a smooth function. This choice of oscillatory phase factor, ensures
that the number of unknowns is virtually independent of the frequency. The basis
functions being studied are designed in a way that the matrix, resulting from
the discretization, has a number of significant entries which is proportional to
the number of basis functions, in the large frequency limit. Hence, this matrix
can be approximated with a sparse approximate matrix. The investigator and his
colleagues explore the use of the sparse matrix instead of the original matrix,
in order to obtain an approximate solution to the problem, and they study the
solution of the approximate problem with iterative methods, and multi-grid
methods. In addition they study the use of the sparse matrix as a
preconditioner. This new methodology is being developed by studying problems of
increasing complexity, such as convex domains with corners in two dimensions,
and convex three dimensional domains. The impact of this research is therefore
in the development of discretization schemes for the Helmholtz equation in which
the number of unknowns is virtually independent of the frequency, and the design
of optimally fast algorithms for solving those discrete problems. This
transforms problems which are computationally exceedingly difficult if not
intractable, into ones which are readily solved.

The solution of scattering problems has many applications in technology.
Applications include remote sensing, ultra-sound imaging of tissue, non-
destructive testing, geophysical prospecting, the design of reduced radar
signature airplanes, and the determination of the acoustic signature of
submersible vehicles. For the current configurations of interest, geometrical
complications and/or compositional complexity in the underlying structure make
manual solutions practically impossible. Moreover, in the mid to high frequency
regime, standard computational approaches require an exceedingly large amount of
calculations, leaving some problems computationally intractable. The fast and
efficient algorithms for scattering problems developed by the investigator and
his colleagues will broadly impact design and discovery tools in the application
areas mentioned above.
