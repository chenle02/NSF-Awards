ECS9358309 Zhu The Principal Investigators research focuses on the magnetic
aspects of future ultra-high capacity magnetic data storage systems. Combining
supercomputer aided micromagnetic simulation studies with experimental
fabrication techniques, they are developing magnetic thin film media with
advanced microstructures which are capable of storing data at densities of two
order of magnitude higher than that in current high-end hard disk drives. The
P.I.s have developed a technique which uses a magnetic force microscope as a
micromagnetometer with superior magnetic sensitivity to directly measure
magnetic switching properties of a single nano-scale magnetic particle for the
first time in this field. They are using this new technique to study ultra-fine
magnetic particles for developing the medium in future Tera-Byte magnetic data
cartridge. ***
