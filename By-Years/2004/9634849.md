9634849 Hearn This project involves modeling and analysis of congested networks.
Congested networks are encountered in a variety of scenarios, including
vehicular traffic flow, routing of calls in telecommunications systems, natural
gas distribution, water distribution. The research is concerned with two
distinct problems: (1) optimal toll pricing in congested networks, and (2)
determination of flows in bounded congested network flow models. The
investigators will develop algorithms to efficiently solve these problems and
will carry out a large-scale numerical implementation of the approaches
developed in the research. In the case of congestion toll pricing, these
algorithms will be based on an existing two-stage approach for determining tolls
known as MINSYS. New research will focus on efficient specialized methods to
exploit the network structure of the problem, and extensions to the case where
the system objective function is convex but each of the components of the cost
map is concave. In the case of bounded networks, these algorithms will represent
enhancements to the principal investigator's non-linear, multicommodity
congestion network code, which uses the affine scaling with centering bundle
method (ASCBM). In particular, the method will be extended to handle non-
differentiable objective functions and ill-conditioned problems. Pricing of
tolls on congested networks to guarantee that the "user" equilibrium is close to
the "system" equilibrium is a problem faced by organizations as diverse as city
traffic planners and telecommunications engineers. The theory and algorithms
developed in this research have great promise to improve planning and decision-
making functions in these networks. Moreover, the research should open up new
avenues for the analysis of network flows in general.
