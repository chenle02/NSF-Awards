The University of California at Davis has been awarded a grant to design and
develop a web enabled database combining an extensive amount of butterfly
occurrence data collected over 30 years with local environmental data for an
area of northern California. Representations to XML and EML (Ecological Metadata
Language) will be available from the Darwin Core based schema which will also be
DiGIR enabled. This will make the data broadly useable and easily integrated
across the internet with other data from various fields.
