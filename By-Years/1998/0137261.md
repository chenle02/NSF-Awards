Laboratory studies of heterogeneous uptake and chemical reactions on model
particles representing atmospheric dust will be carried out. The apparatus used
will be a newly developed Knudsen cell flow reactor equipped with a mass
spectrometer for monitoring gaseous reactants and a Fourier-transform infrared
spectrometer for detection of the condensed phase species. The experiments will
be carried out at temperature and relative humidity conditions representative of
the middle/upper troposphere. Specific reactions that will be studied as a
function of relative humidity, temperature, particle mass and grain size include
the hydrolysis of dinitrogen pentoxide (N205), the uptake of ozone, and the
uptake and possible reaction of small organic molecules such as
methanol.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work is important because it will provide
direct measurements for processes long believed to be important in the
atmosphere. Atmospheric aerosols affect the Earth's radiative budget and air
quality.
