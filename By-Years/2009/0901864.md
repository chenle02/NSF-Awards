ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this
research is to investigate mechanical energy scavenging by electrospun
piezoelectric nanofibers. The approach of this project is to orderly deposit
piezoelectric nanofibers using the near-field-electrospinning process. These
nanofibers, when deposited and arranged in the right manner and put into the
right places, could convert mechanical energy into electricity. Specifically, a
self-powering system that harvests its operating energy directly from the
environment is an attractive proposition for sensing, personal electronics and
security technologies.&lt;br/&gt;This proposed in-situ stretching and poling
process by the near-field-electrospinning for the production of orderly
deposited piezoelectric nanofibers is the key innovation of the project.
Placement, polarity and direction of these nanofibers are well-controlled to
enable nanopower energy generation applications. This project will investigate
process protocols of electrospun piezoelectric nanofibers, including viscosity,
conductivity, surface tension of the polymer solution, applied electrical field,
tip diameter of the spinneret, the size of the droplet, and ambient parameters
including temperature, humidity and air velocity to have optimized deposition
and piezoelectric energy conversion efficiency with a large area energy
harvester demonstration as the goal.&lt;br/&gt; The demonstration of electrospun
nanofibers as possible power generators could have a profound impact in various
application areas, including energy harvesting, strain sensing, and actuation
sources. It will benefit the general Microelectromechanical Systems community to
inspire new device development. The synergy of research and education
interaction and integration between manufacturing, material sciences and
mechanical energy conversion will be an engine for the multidisciplinary fusion
in research/education expertise for the next-generation scientists and
engineers.&lt;br/&gt;
