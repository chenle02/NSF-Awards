A three-day workshop on automated reasoning is proposed. The workshop will be
held at Argonne National Laboratory on June 3-5, l991 and will be coordinated by
Argonne National Laboratory and by the Institute for New Generation Computer
Technology (ICOT) of Japan. The objective is to provide an open forum for
discussion between American and Japanese researchers on current achievements and
recent advances in automated reasoning. The workshop will feature presentations
on such topics as classical automated theorem proving, rewriting systems, prolog
technology, special-purpose reasoning methods, and open problems. Participants
will also be given ample time for informal and open discussions. After the
workshop is over, joint research projects will be undertaken. Thus, the workshop
will have a long-term benefit of promoting scientific advances in a spirit of
healthy cooperation.
