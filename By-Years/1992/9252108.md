This project will provide equipment to establish a distributed computer system
laboratory using several workstations in a local area network. This laboratory
will be used to teach network communications and distributed control concepts.
In the computer networks course the students will design and implement
interprocess communications between peer processes on different nodes, interface
between adjacent layers of communication systems, interface between the kernel
and the communication system and network performance analysis. In the
distributed computer systems course, they will implement file servers and
compute servers (processor pool) using the client- server model of computing.
