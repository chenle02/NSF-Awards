Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number 0935841&lt;br/&gt;PI: Karl
Gebhardt&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is making enhancements to two
existing websites, the Black Hole Encyclopedia and the Spanish version
Enciclopedia de Agujeros Negros. The original websites were created by the PI
under his NSF CAREER grant. The enhancements include 20 additional black holes
in the Directory section, new listings in the Popular Culture section, profiles
of six leading black hole researchers (including the PI), audio podcasts, a new
section on the history of black hole research, and extensive graphics and
animations. The evaluation of the website is expected to add to the informal
science education community's knowledge of how the internet is being used to
support science learning.
