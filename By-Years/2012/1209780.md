This action funds Lauren Neala Holder of Texas A&M University to conduct a
research project, entitled "Arsenic availability in Taiwan soils as a function
of the underlying changes in geology," during the summer of 2012 at National
Taiwan University in Taipai. The host scientist is Dr. Dar-Yan Lee.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to determine the impact of
weathering upon arsenic speciation in soil. Arsenic concentrations are expected
to change as a function of the underlying geology and the soils should reflect
the mineralogy of geologic units to produce varying arsenic speciation.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
