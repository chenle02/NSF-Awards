9526225 It is Proposed to use interfacial dynamics, a specific implementation of
the boundary-integral method, and statistical mechanics to simulate non-dilute
deferrable suspension flow, and on this basis evaluate the effective rheological
and transport properties of suspensions. Three-dimensional numerical studies
will be performed using local analytical solutions and code vectorization at the
San Diego Supercomputer Center. The resulted code is applicable to a large range
of dispersed two-phase flow phenomena, and is computer time-efficient. The
research will provide better understanding and a numerical tool for suspension
flow simulations useful in biotechnology, chemical and petroleum industries.
