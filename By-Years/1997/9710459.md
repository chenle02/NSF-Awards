ECS-9710459 Qiming Zhang The objectives of the proposal are: (a) To investigate
structure/property relationships governing electromechanical properties or
polymeric materials. (b) To provide understanding of
electroprocessing/microstructure relationships in order to control design of
electroactive polymers with optimized properties for end-use applications. (c)
To develop new electroactive polymers with unique electromechanical properties
leading to rapid technological development. (d) To shorten the time period
between research concept, to increased scientific understanding, and new
technologies and devices by close collaborative studies involving Rutgers
University (Polymer Electroprocessing Laboratory) and Penn State (Materials
Research Laboratory), combined with the chemical synthesis work of Allied Signal
and end-use applications expertise of AMP, Inc.
