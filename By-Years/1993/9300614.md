The objective of the research is to develop a closed loop control system for
induction plasma deposition in order to improve manufactured material quality
and also expand the processing capabilities. Such a system will also provide new
capabilities to examine the structure/performance relations achievable by plasma
deposition. The research is focused on the following areas: 1) experimental
verification of a low order model of the process and its refinement, 2)
development of control structure, control implementation, and preliminary
processing/materials property studies, and 3) extension to related systems.
Plasma torches are used to melt and accelerate metallic and/or ceramic particles
in order to form dense coatings at high production rates. Plasma deposition is
used in a variety of different applications including corrosion, thermal and
wear resistance coatings, near net shape manufacture, and production of metal
matrix composites. Successful modeling and control of the process will reduce
variations in material quality in induction plasma deposition processes.
