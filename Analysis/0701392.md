This project is to study a number of topics about the regularity, and level
sets, of solutions of certain elliptic and parabolic partial differential
equations. Also some questions about the domains for which the Calderon-Zygmund
inequalities hold, parabolic equations are well-posed and the solvability of
some degenerate elliptic equations.

The degenerate elliptic and parabolic equations to be studied arise as models in
geometry, finance and fluid dynamics. The level surfaces are the central subject
in the study of phase transitions, geometric evolutions and the free boundary
problems. Some special level surfaces appear as the boundary of crystals and the
wave fronts of shock waves. The problems to be studied under this project will
provide basic information about the solutions of the equations for these various
applications.
