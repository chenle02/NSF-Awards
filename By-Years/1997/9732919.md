Bill Reinhardt is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program to study many-body processes in chemical physics. The major
portion of this effort is aimed at condensed-phase simulations, with emphasis on
sampling improvement and the controlled calculation of entropy and free-energy
differences. As the methodology is developed, it will be embedded into
widespread simulation packages. A secondary effort concerns large amplitude
dynamics in Bose-Einstein condensates. This work will involve semiclassical
modeling of dark solitons in multiple dimensions for both attractive and
repulsive condensates, employing the nonlinear Schrodinger equation. Knowledge
of free energies and free energy differences are of central importance in
chemistry and biophysical chemistry, yet progress toward their efficient
computation has been slow. Algorithmic developments that allow for rapid free
energy computations will have a major impact on theoretical simulations of
protein folding and enzyme-substrate binding. The recent experimental
realization of Bose condensation opens a new window into the behavior of
macroscopic quantum systems, which in turn inspires new efforts into theoretical
underpinnings of this phenomenon.
