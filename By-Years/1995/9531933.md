Proposal Number: ECS-9531933 Principal Investigator: Robert Peale/University of
Central Florida Title: Mode-locked high power semiconductor FIR/sub-mm laser
Abstract This research will develop a mode-locked high power semiconductor
FIR/sub-mm laser, using p-Ge. The p-Ge laser is tunable for 70 to 200 mm where
no other solid state laser is known. A clearer understanding of the carrier
dynamics responsible for lasing will emerge via new experimental tests,
especially a new and unusual temperature effect and the connection between
cooling rate and emission dynamics. Development of a practical table-top high
power laser in this source-poor region will have important ramifications for
advancement in many fields, such as molecular and solid state spectroscopy,
remote sensing and plasma diagnostics. High tunable tunable sources, other than
FELS are especially lacking. Development of this laser as a compact source, made
possible by replacing superconducting magnets with permanent magnets, is also
important for practical applications.
