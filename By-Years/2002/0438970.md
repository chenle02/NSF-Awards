University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Design of Incremental
Change&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Incremental change (IC) is at the core of many
software engineering processes, including maintenance, iterative development,
iterative enhancement, agile development, software evolution, and so forth.
Design &lt;br/&gt;of IC assesses IC alternatives and helps prevent the software
decay. This research addresses design of IC in a novel way through combination
of classical static program analysis and information retrieval. This
&lt;br/&gt;proposal builds on and brings together existing results from program
analysis, information retrieval, classical object oriented design, and case
studies of IC in order to explore techniques for IC design. It
&lt;br/&gt;involves validation of the proposed techniques through case studies
on the evolution of a large and widely-used academic bioinformatics software
system. The research will contribute to the Science of Design by producing
design techniques for proposed IC of existing software and by obtaining new
insights into the IC design. It will contribute directly to the improvement of
software quality and to the reduction of software maintenance costs. It will
build a software engineering foundation for the emerging agile development
processes.&lt;br/&gt;
