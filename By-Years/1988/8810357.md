Modeling and estimation of economic time series primarily concern making
inferences about the intertemporal law of motion of economic variables. The
general objective of this project is to refine and apply the seminonparametric
approach (SNP) for estimation of the underlying law of motion of a stationary
process. The SNP approach was initially developed by Tauchen and Gallant for an
asset pricing application. It can accomodate just about any arbitrary deviations
from linearity and normality and, unlike other methods, provides a compact
summary of the data in the form of a fitted parametric density which can be used
for the purpose of the formal testing of interesting economic hypotheses. The
project consists of a methodological section and an empirical section. The
methodological work is aimed at gaining further understanding of the statistical
properties and the reliability of SNP estimators. This work entails both Monte
Carlo simulation and derivation of analytical results. The empirical work
entails application of the SNP methodology to issues related to labor market
dynamics, short-term price movements on financial markets, and nonlinear
causality between money and income. The main research tool for the empirical
work is nonlinear maximum likelihood estimation. The results of the project are
expected to be useful to empirical economists and to econometricians and
statisticians interested in time series density estimation. Their particular
appeal is that they are not linked to a specific family of nonlinear models;
rather the approach is nonparametric, in the sense that the procedures are in
principle capable of capturing a wide variety of nonlinearities that have
previously been examined only parametrically or only with very limited tools.
