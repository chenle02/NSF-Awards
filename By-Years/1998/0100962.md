This is a Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER) award. The project will
allow a rapid follow-up to the PI's discovery of a new class of materials, the
so-called left-handed materials (LHM). In normal materials, both the electric
permittivity and the magnetic permeability are observed to be positive
quantities. LHM are composite materials constructed so that the permeability and
permittivity are simultaneously negative. The properties of LHM are quite
different from ordinary materials. Some of the most important and non-intuitive
properties of LHM are exposed when electromagnetic radiation propagates through
such a LHM medium. For example, Snell's law is reversed. In work to date,
materials have been constructed that behave as LHM in the microwave region. This
SGER award will allow the exploration of theoretical and experimental work to
determine if LHM materials can be fabricated at optical frequencies. If this can
be achieved, and it is not known with certainty whether this will be possible,
the potential impact of LHM in photonic materials, laser applications and other
technical areas would be substantial.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a Small
Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER) Award. The Principal Investigator and co-
workers have produced a new class of composite materials with physical
properties that scientists theorized might be possible, but had never before
been produced. The materials are called left-handed materials (LHM) because they
reverse many of the physical properties observed in ordinary materials in
response to electromagnetic radiation. The new class of materials has the
ability to reverse properties such as the Doppler effect, the principle that
changes the frequency of waves as the source of the waves moves. Thus, a train
whistle sounds higher in pitch as the train approaches and lower as the train
recedes. Maxwell's equations, which describe the relationship between magnetic
and electric fields, suggest that microwave radiation or light would show the
opposite effect in this new class of materials, shifting to lower frequencies as
the source approaches. Similarly, Maxwell's equations suggest that a lens made
of such materials, instead of dispersing electromagnetic radiation as usual,
would focus it as it passes through. This SGER award will allow the exploration
of theoretical and experimental work to determine if LHM materials can be
fabricated at optical frequencies.&lt;br/&gt;Such materials would have strange
properties such as a flashlight shining on a LHM slab would be focused at a
point on the other side. Students and post-docs working on this project will
received excellent training in a new area, and will be qualified for a range of
employment in academe, industry and government.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
