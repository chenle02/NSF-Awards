This award provides funding for the PI to study life history evolution in marine
systems by combining biogeographical, biochemical, morphological and
paleontological approaches to examining egg size evolution in a family of marine
bivalves relative to a major biogeographic event, the rise of the Central
American Isthmus (CAI) at 2.8-3.1 million years ago. The rise of the CAI
separated the Atlantic and Pacific oceans and isolated populations of
previously-continuous species (known as geminate species pairs). The presence of
multiple closely-related species offers a unique, replicated natural experiment
that can shed light on evolutionary forces. The PI will study the egg size
evolution of bivalves in the family Arcidae to determine the rate and timing of
the evolution relative to the rise of the CIA. This research will provide the
first descriptive data on egg size in the past, and will add a new approach for
exploration of oceanic change and evolutionary response to geologic events. In
addition, funding will support research experience for five undergraduate
students.
