With this Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) award, the Organic
Synthesis Program supports Professor Thomas Shawe's studies in the Department of
Chemistry at Bucknell University of the asymmetric synthesis of cycloalkenones.
Alkylation of chiral enaminones followed by Grignard reagent addition affords
access to cycloalkenones with good stereocontrol. The role of chiral auxiliaries
in the transfer of chirality is assessed through modification of the chelate
ring size and number of chelate sites provided by the chiral auxiliary,
alteration of the nature of the chiral auxiliary, and examination of additive
effects. Addition of other organometallic nucleophiles in place of Grignard
reagents permits further synthetic generality, while the use of metal hydrides
offers promise for the formation of cycloalkenones unsubstituted in the
3-position. The products of these reactions are elaborated synthetically, both
to permit unambiguous assignment of stereochemistry and to generate
intermediates for further synthetic applications. Preparation of molecules of
demonstrated or potential biological activity often requires control over the
three-dimensional arrangement of atoms or groups of atoms in the target
molecules. In particular, one often desires a molecule which differs from
another only in the manner by which a right hand differs from a left hand,
namely as non-superimposable mirror images. Professor Shawe develops new
chemical approaches for the selective synthesis of such molecules through the
use of sequential addition of reagents to precursor molecules bearing
chemically-attached `auxiliaries` which direct incoming reagents to the desired
position for reaction. The resulting compounds offer promise as synthetic
building blocks for further elaboration into molecules displaying important
biological activity, such as the prostaglandins.
