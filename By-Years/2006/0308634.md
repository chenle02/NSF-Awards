ABSTRACT

In the past twenty years, wavelet theory has developed into a fundamental area
of mathematics and applied science. Intimately related are frame theory and
sampling theory, all with a connection to harmonic analysis. The proposed
research will investigate group representations as a unifying theme since they
appear in the settings of wavelet, frame, and sampling theory. The research of
Weber will use existing tools from functional and harmonic analysis, while also
developing tools related to group cocycles and maximal abelian self adjoint
algebras as models of these objects.

The proposed research is theoretical in nature, though much of it is motivated
by problems in applied mathematics. The goal of the research of Weber is to
establish a solid mathematical foundation of wavelet and frame theory. However,
the research will potentially impact problems in applied mathematics and signal
processing, such as digital signal multiplexing, redundant communications and
secure communications.
