This award supports a new Research Experiences for Undergraduates site at the
Catholic University of America (CUA). The site will provide internship
opportunities for eight undergraduate students to carry out independent physics
research in the Nation's Capital. The goal is to reach out to and engage
students in research who would otherwise not have the opportunity for research
experiences, as well as to educate students about the path to becoming a
researcher including graduate school and careers in academia and
beyond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CUA REU research projects include several
nuclear and particle physics experiments, data analyses, and detector
construction projects that are carried out on campus and benefit from CUA's
strong expertise in materials. The interface between basic research in nuclear
and particle physics and applied science is a particularly rich and exciting
area for attracting undergraduate students into the field. CUA has a unique
position because of its proximity to and collaborations with flagship national
laboratories. The REU program will build on CUA's demonstrated experience of the
mutually beneficial involvement of undergraduate students in cutting edge
research projects, including some that have led to the successful construction
of detectors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
