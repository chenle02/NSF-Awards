This project is the continuation of our research on the question of how
intuitive and concise linear model concepts and techniques can be extended to
nonparametric settings and on the development of nonparametric techniques for
model diagnostics, dimensionality reduction, and assessing adequacy of
particular classes of models. Some of the procedures considered in this research
are based on conditional versions of the familiar regression, covariance, and
correlation coefficients, where the conditioning is on covariates restricted to
neighborhoods. The size of the neighborhood serves as a resolution scale, and
dependence of the response on the covariates is measured and summarized at
multiple scales. Other procedures are curve or surface estimators and estimators
of integral functionals of distributions. Many of the estimators to be
considered depend on smoothing parameters needed in estimation of curves and
surfaces. A large part of the research addresses the problem of developing
reliable data-based methods for smoothing parameter selection. Properties of
estimators are studied using both asymptotic methods and Monte Carlo
simulations.

Computer data bases of unprecedented size and complexity and the dramatic
increase in computer power makes possible the development of more flexible
models, concepts, and procedures, which can be used to study relationships
between variables and to construct models without relying on rigid global
assumptions. Much of the recent work in statistics has addressed this need for
more general and flexible methods. This research further extends this work with
a special focus on procedures that are counterparts of many commonly used linear
model concepts and that expose important features in the data using intuitive
and familiar ideas. The developed procedures are applied to financial, economic,
insurance, medical, and other data.
