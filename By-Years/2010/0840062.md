With the growth of the elderly population, finding a way to enhance quality of
life and safety with minimum human assistance will become critical in the next
few decades. Japanese robotics researchers have been focusing on research and
applications in these areas in light of the aging Japanese population. U.S.
robotics researchers have also been working on the same areas but from different
viewpoints. Even though both Japan and the U.S. are conducting research on the
same areas, there has been virtually no collaboration between U.S. and Japanese
researchers in these research areas due to the lack of appropriate funding
structures and mechanisms.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The goal of this workshop is to
initiate and facilitate collaborations between Japanese and U.S. researchers in
the areas of robotics for safety, security and society. The proposed workshop
will bring 16 Japanese researchers and 16 U.S. researchers together to discuss
their research, and to explore mechanisms for joint collaborations to advance
research in and improve Safety, Security, and Society. As the collaborative
research evolves, enhanced research results will be published as collaborative
work, applications will affect society, and ideas will be generated for future
collaborative structures.&lt;br/&gt;
