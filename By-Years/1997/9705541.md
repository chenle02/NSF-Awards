Abstract Proposal No: 9705541 Proposal Type: Investigator Initiated Principal
Investigator: Meilin Liu Affiliation: Georgia Institute of Technology This grant
is awarded through the Interfacial, Transport and Separations Program, and the
Chemical Reaction Processes Program of the Chemical and Transport Systems
Division. The principal investigator is Dr. Meilin Liu of the Georgia Institute
of Technology. The objective of the research is to develop ceramic membranes
based on mixed ionic-electronic conductors for methane conversion. Lanthanum-
ferrate materials are primarily considered as candidate systems. The research
will involve studies of methane conversion kinetics, characterizations of
product distributions, and characterizations of membrane microstructure and
transport properties. These studies have the potential to develop materials that
will facilitate the electrocatalytic conversion of methane to cleaner fuels, to
higher-valued hydrocarbons, or to other transportable liquid products to reduce
transportation costs. In addition, the acquired knowledge will advance our
ability to design new materials for related applications, such as electrodes for
solid oxide fuel cells using natural gas as fuels, solid-state gas sensors for
monitoring and control of combustion processes, and the removal of noxious
pollutants from combustion exhausts. Successful development of new materials for
these applications will therefore have significant impact on energy efficiency,
environmental quality, and a new generation of vehicles powered by cleaner fuels
or fuel cells.
