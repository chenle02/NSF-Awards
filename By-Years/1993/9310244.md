9310244 Chester We propose a program of Monte Carlo Simulation studies of phase
separation, domain growth and surface phenomena. The aim of this work is to
apply the new Monte Carlo algorithm to a variety of physical phenomena and to
exploit the power of our parallel machines to allow us to simulate large systems
which display complex inhomogeneous phenomena.
