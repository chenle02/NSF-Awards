This project takes advantage of the major coastal extra-tropical storm,
Hurricane Sandy that came ashore in New Jersey on November 6, 2012. The proposed
research will evaluate the properties and processes in the coastal salt marshes
immediately after and in the year following Sandy to compare with existing pre-
storm data. The relationship of short-term hurricane induced flooding and
sedimentation to marsh elevation change, accumulation rates of plants and dead
material, and changes in soil and water chemistry will be determined for three
salt marshes of the Delaware Estuary and three salt marshes of Barnegat Bay, New
Jersey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal addresses fundamental questions about
the influences of major coastal storms on ecosystem structure and function.
There are opportunities to directly observe effects of this severe disturbance
on processes that have been monitored over time in the past with other funding.
This proposal is a good fit for the RAPID funding mechanism because it addresses
important and fundamental questions related to coastal marsh ecosystem dynamics,
will enable new and additional sample collection and analyses, and is time-
sensitive. It is critical to get plots re-established, baseline samples taken,
and initial measurements made before the systems are further altered by the
usual winter weather of this region. The prospect of future storms of this
magnitude suggests the need to understand their effects on ecosystem dynamics as
part of a new-normal for the East Coast. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Information from
this project about the impacts of Hurricane Sandy on local salt marshes will be
of use to local wetland managers (e.g., U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Island
Beach State Park) and to the coastal communities in the area. The information
gained will also be extrapolated to predict future storm event effects, will
serve as a case study applicable to other Atlantic coast wetlands, and will
advance our understanding of storm effects on wetland ecosystem processes in
general.
