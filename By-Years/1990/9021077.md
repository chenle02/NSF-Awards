The Microelectonics Center of North Carolina (MCNC) comprises three centers:
the Center for Communications, the Center for Microelectronics, and the North
Carolina Supercomputing Center. The MCNC Center for Communications will render
program planning and logistical services in coordinating an Orientation and
Training Workshop for Minority Institutions and other Primarily Undergraduate
Institutions that have recently obtained a connection to the NSFNET. The
Workshop will allow computer networking experts and users to present instruction
on internet technology, major protocols, and applications with hands-on
experiences provided to educators/researchers and technical specialists of
minority institutions that can readily benefit from the NSFNET connection.
