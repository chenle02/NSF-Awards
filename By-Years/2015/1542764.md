This project is focused on developing an integrated educational model that will
motivate Native Hawaiian graduate students to seek academic careers. Native
Hawaiians are significantly underrepresented in the STEM workforce, even more so
that other racial and ethnic minorities. Native Hawaiians comprise 23% of the
state's population, but only 12.8% of the student body and 3.8% of the faculty.
More compelling is that of the 1500+ STEM faculty, only 4 are Native Hawaiian.
To encourage more Native Hawaiian students to pursue engineering and other STEM
fields, role models have a highly visible role, particularly within the
educational environment. A diverse faculty provides a rich learning experience
for the student as well as significantly enhancing the research enterprise
through diversity of thoughts and ideas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will
gather information from the Native Hawaiian students and community, utilizing
surveys and interviews to research and understand why students are not likely to
pursue engineering graduate studies. Using the results, the team will develop a
model to provide teaching and research experiences as a pathway to an academic
career. The research projects will be focused on the Pacific region, thus
enhancing their relevance to the students. A mentoring program will be
implemented utilizing engineering faculty and a virtual network that evolves
from the establishment of a national Society for Native Hawaiians Engineers. The
intellectual merit of this activity is the identification of what might be
responsible for impeding the enrollment of Native Hawaiians in engineering
graduate studies and their academic/professional careers. The results will
enable the development and implementation of interventions that will increase
the numbers of Native Hawaiians in all academic levels of engineering. The
broader impact of the project is the formation of a national Society for Native
Hawaiian Engineers, which will be instrumental in disseminating the results of
the efforts.
