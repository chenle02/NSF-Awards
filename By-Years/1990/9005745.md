A workshop entitled Spliceosome Assembly and Alternative RNA Splicing will be
held in France in September. The meeting is being organized under the aegis of
the European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO) and will be limited to 70-90
participants, at least half of whom will be Americans. A great variety of
cellular and viral genes rely on a regulated program of alternative splicing for
appropriate tissue and stage-specific gene expression. This meeting will focus
on the molecular mechanisms of regulated alternative splicing and, as such, is
the first to be devoted to this important level of gene regulation. Rapid
preliminary progress is now being made in understanding the biochemistry of
alternative splicing in a number of specific systems. Three sessions of the
meeting will focus on new developments in splice site selection and four
sessions will deal with the mechanisms of alternative splicing in viruses and
cellular genes. The meeting will end with a workshop on practical aspects of
establishing tissue-specific splicing extracts, so that the systems can be
studied and manipulated in vitro.
