The purpose of this work is to clarify the mechanism of sulfuric- acid-
catalyzed alkylation of isobutane with light olefins, and to apply the knowledge
obtained to modify alkylation processes to improve product quality and/or reduce
operating expenses. Alkylates (produced by alkylation) are blended into gasoline
at refineries to improve octane rating, increase volatility, and decrease
viscosity. Both one-step (the present standard) and two-step alkylation
processes will be investigated. Among the variables to be considered are
temperature, composition of the acid phase (water, polymer, surfactant, and
other additives), and viscosity.
