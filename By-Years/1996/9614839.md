Abstract EEC-9614839 Magee The Industry/University Cooperative Research Center
for Hazardous and Toxic Substances is a multi/university Center involving the
New Jersey Institute of Technology, Rutgers University, Stevens Institute of
Technology, Princeton University, and the University of Medicine and Dentistry
of New Jersey. This award provides funding for the first year of a five-year
continuing award adding Tufts University to the multi/university consortia as a
seventh division to study monitoring and assessment. The Center has obtained an
unprecedented level of success in its twelve-year history, generating in excess
of $100 million in support of its programs. The expanded research agenda
associated with Tufts University addresses "IR/Fiber-Linked In-Situ Multi-
Dimensional UV Fluorescence Spectrometer for Cone Penetrometer," "Field Portable
Microwave Induced Plasma/Mass Spectroscopy (MIP/MS) for Analysis of Inorganic
Contaminants," Electrochemical Sensor for Heavy Metals in Ground Water" and
"Cross-Reactive Optical Sensor Arrays for Detection of Organic and/or Metal
Contaminants."
