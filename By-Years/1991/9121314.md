The project is a collaborative effort between Clemson University, Bowdoin
College and University of Connecticut to investigate two modifications to the
first two years of the undergraduate computer science curriculum. The first
modification broadens the focus of these courses from primarily software
development techniques to consider the breadth of the computer science
discipline. The second change blends the use of scheduled, structured
laboratories with the traditional lecture approach. This approach follows the
recent ACM '91 curriculum recommendations. Project activities will include the
development and class-testing of lecture and text materials, and laboratory
materials. The laboratory exercises will be developed for a variety of
educational settings. The results of the curriculum and materials development
will be disseminated through summer workshops, publications, and presentations
at professional meetings.
