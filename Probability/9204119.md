The principal investigator will support graduate students working on problems in
the areas of geometric probability, interacting particle systems and queueing
theory. Problems of multifractals and Hausdorf dimension of sets of Lebesgue
measure zero are to be studied. This award provides support for graduate
students. The award will help develop the infrastructure of basic mathematical
research in the area of statistics and probability.
