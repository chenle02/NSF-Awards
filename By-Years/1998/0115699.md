The project is a partnership between the Concord Consortium, Harvard,
Northwestern, University of Michigan, the Center or Learning Technologies in
Urban Schools (LeTUS) and the Firtchburn, Hudson, and Lowell Public Schools to
study the impact of modeling on secondary science learning. Tools called CIE
models incorporate core science content that students learn through interaction
and exploration. The project will explore the hypothesis that students learn
more through such models by testing it in real schools. Data will be collected
from Pedagogica (the technological environment), annual administration of a
project-generated assessment, extensive interviews, and standardized tests.
