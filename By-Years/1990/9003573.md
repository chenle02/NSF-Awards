This project focuses on lessons that can be learned from the October 17, 1989
Loma Prieta Earthquake. The proposed research deals with the economic and social
aspects of the Loma Prieta earthquake, focusing on earthquake insurance issues,
impacts of the earthquake on the behavior of individuals, and changes in
perception of the earthquake hazard following the earthquake. It involves a re-
survey of California homeowners whose attitudes towards the earthquake hazard
and insurance purchase decisions were assessed in May of 1989, as well as a
supplemental survey of residents of Santa Clara county. In this project, the
impacts of this earthquake on shifts in attitudes towards earthquake hazards in
general and the purchase of earthquake insurance in particular will be tested as
well as the impact of geographic location of the household with respect to
recent property damage on subsequent insurance purchase.
