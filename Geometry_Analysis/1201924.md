The proposed research is concerned with problems in the field of geometric
flows, in particular the Ricci flow and the mean curvature flow. Specifically,
we plan to study the evolution of symplectomorphisms under the mean curvature
flow. In particular, we want to find condition that guarantee that the mean
curvature flow evolves a given symplectomorphism to a biholomorphic isometry.
The PI also plans to study self-similar solutions to the Ricci flow. The PI has
recently obtained a uniqueness result for the Bryant soliton under a
noncollapsing assumption. It seems interesting to try to construct self-similar
solutions which are collapsed, but not rotationally symmetric. Finally, the PI
plans to study the gap between the first and second eigenvalue of a Schroedinger
operator, building on recent work of Andrews and Clutterbuck.

The main goal of this project is to approach problems in differential geometry
using tools from analysis, especially partial differential equations. This
approach has been successful in the past, and has led to the solution of several
major open in the problems in the field, including Min-Oo's Conjecture, the
Compactness Conjecture for the Yamabe problem, and the Differentiable Sphere
Theorem. The Lagrangian mean curvature flow offers potential applications to
mathematical physics, due to its connection with the Strominger-Yau-Zaslow
conjecture.
