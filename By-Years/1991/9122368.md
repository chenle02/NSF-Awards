This is a proposal to study the how participation in political activism and
social movements affects people's decisions about work, education, marriage, and
childbearing. All applicants to the 1964 Mississippi Freedom Summer Project will
be compared to a matched comparison group. The investigators propose to update
the life histories of participants in the Freedom Summer Project previously
surveyed in 1988, to obtain comparable life-course data for a sample of
individuals who did not participate in the Freedom Summer Project, and to
develop and administer a questionnaire focusing on the subjective dimensions of
the relationship between political activism and the life course. One of the
central questions in the study will be how participation in social movements
such as the Freedom Summer Project have influenced life choices and career
trajectories. An equally important question will be to understand how and why
major life events such as marriage and childbearing often serve to constrain
political activism. This project will contribute to our understanding of the
interrelations between political activism and the life course, and it will also
provide insights into the life patterns of a cohort of people who lived through
young adulthood during the turbulent decade of the 1960s.
