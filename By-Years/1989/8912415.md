The Mammal Collection of the University of Utah's Museum of Natural History
comprises 28,000 specimens, most of which represent the fauna of the western
U.S. After a period of very low research activity, Dr. Eric Rickart, Curator in
charge of the collection, has instituted an aggressive program of research and
curatorial improvement in the collection. A computer catalog has been prepared,
physical facilities have been renovated, and an inventory and reorganization of
the collection will be initiated. Curatorial improvements to this collection
will have significant impact on zoological research and education in Utah.
Natural history collections such as this are irreplaceable libraries of data
concerning life on earth, and they form the foundation for research on
systematics, evolution, ecology, and other facets of biology. This collection
provides an excellent record of an important vertebrate fauna, against which
future changes will be measured. Future generations of research will depend on
its continued care and growth.
