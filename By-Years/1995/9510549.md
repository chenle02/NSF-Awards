DMR-9510549, PI-Storm: "1995 Gordon Research Conference on High Temperature
Corrosion, July 16-21, New London, NH." The Conference will be held on July
16-21, 1995 at Colby Sawyer College in New London, New Hampshire. This
conference is focused on recent advances in understanding the fundamentals of
oxidation/corrosion of oxidation-resistant alloys and ceramics, with emphasis on
their role in high-temperature applications. Individual sessions are: corrosion
aspects of solid oxide fuel cells; catastrophic corrosion at intermediate
temperatures; stress effects in oxidation; integrity of the scale/metal
interface; thermal barrier coatings: applications and degradation resistance;
oxidation of multiphase alloys; design of laboratory experiments for industrial
applications; and contrasting aspects of silica-forming materials. NSF support
is directed toward young scientists and students. ***This conference has values
to the application of materials used at high temperatures such as gas turbines
and reactors. Discussions on protection of corrosion with carbon-containing
gasses, sulphur- and chlorine- containing gases at intermediate temperatures,
and the ceramic coating that is influenced by high temperature will be very
useful in the industry. The fundamental principle of growth and relief of stress
on scale, scale-metal interface, oxidation of multiphase alloys, and protection
of silicon and silicon carbide ceramics will be very important in understanding
the phenomena of the developing technology in corrosion protection.***
