Description: This award is for support of a cooperative project by Dr. R.I.A.
Malek of the Materials Research Laboratory at Pennsylvania State University and
two Egyptian researchers: Dr. Hanaa Y. Ghorab of the Chemistry Department at
Helwan University, and Dr. Assem K. Abdelalim of the Faculty of Engineering at
Zagazig University. The main objective of this research is to expand upon the
existing knowledge contributing to the fundamental understanding of the reaction
process, microstructural evolution and microstructure-property relationships of
the alkali-activated aluminosilicate binders (geopolymers). Another objective is
to explore the detailed structural characteristics of the ancient mortars, where
Egypt provides a unique archeological site, and to provide sound scientific
knowledge using angle spinning NMR. Scope: This research project will be useful
in promoting the scientific knowledge on geopolymeric binders, and in providing
new knowledge on old geopolymers. It involves US and Egyptian scientists with
complementary expertise in material sciences, chemistry and engineering, as well
as complementary field and laboratory facilities at the three participating
universities. The project will also involve a US graduate student who will have
access to an international experience that should help in his/her career. This
proposal meets INT objective of increasing U.S.-foreign collaboration in areas
that benefit both sides, and in enhancing junior scientists' international
experience. This award includes partial funding by the Division of Civil and
Mechanical Systems.
