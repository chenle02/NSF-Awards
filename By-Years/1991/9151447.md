This project establishs a laboratory for studying computer networks using a
small local area network. In the past five years, both the pervasive use of
networks throughout our society and the proliferation of local area networks in
the business and industrial community demand that technology graduates be
provided access to resources and instruction in computer networks. A laboratory
dedicated to the study of networks by both engineering technology and computer
science technology students is being developed that consists of a 10-
workstation local area network, a local area network analyzer computer, a remote
access computer, operating system software and the necessary development
software required for instruction. Five different network courses will use the
laboratory. Students perform experiments which include network stress testing,
collecting and analyzing network statistics and server application program
design using client- server database.
