The Cascade Topology Seminar is a cooperative effort among mathematicians in the
Pacific Northwest United States and Southwestern Canada. An advisory committee
works by consensus to decide meeting sites and serve as and consult with local
organizers. Local organizers consult with the advisory committee and interested
parties to select a list of speakers. The lecturers do not necessarily have to
speak on a topological topic. Due to the interests of the organizers, most talks
do touch on topological subjects, hence the title of the seminar. Typically two
or three of the speakers are from outside the region. Recent presentations in
the Seminar included such topics as Geometrization in dimension 3, the Orbifold
Theorem, Topological Robotics, Cryptography and the Braid Group, Finiteness
Properties of Groups, Integral Structures in Topological Quantum Field Theory,
Representation Varieties, Embedding n-complexes into 2n-space, Skein Theory in
knot theory and beyond, Quantum Representations of Mapping Class Groups, and the
self homotopy equivalences of 4-manifolds.

The Cascade Topology Seminar is designed in part to keep its participants
abreast of recent developments in their own and related fields, and no attempt
is made to limit the topics covered in the lectures. However, the interests of
the various organizers tend to be mirrored by the interests of the speakers. The
lectures therefore usually concern algebraic, geometric, or low dimensional
topology, differential or algebraic geometry, or combinatorial group theory. The
Seminar also strives to enable graduate students and topologists in the Pacific
Northwest and Southwestern Canada to hear, consult, and possibly collaborate
with the outside speakers and members of other institutions. Efforts are made to
accommodate special needs of participants and to encourage members of
traditionally under-represented groups to participate. The Cascade Topology
Seminar organizers also make a consistent effort to include younger and/or women
speakers in its programs and to provide opportunities for local people to
lecture on their own work.
