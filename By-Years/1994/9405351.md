9405351 Anderson The PI will compile a global map of crustal and uppermost
mantle properties and test the effect of this structure on derived properties of
the deeper mantle. He will use the digital seismic data from the Landers
earthquake, including the TERRAscope data at the pode, to test and refine
crustal and mantle models, and will attempt to model the new W-phase which can
be thought of as a superposition of longer period high-group velocity modes or
as a superposition of whispering gallery phases. Anelastic and anharmonic theory
will be extended and applied to bound the temperature variation in the lower
mantle, and a Monte Carlo technique will be used to correlate tomography with
other geophysical and geochemical fields. ****
