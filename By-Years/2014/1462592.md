Delivery mechanisms are the processes by which firms sell their products and
services to customers. For example, in online marketplaces, some sellers choose
to sell their products at a fixed posted price, whereas others solicit bids and
sell to the highest bidder. There have been many studies comparing the benefits
of different delivery mechanisms to sellers and customers under the assumption
that sellers offer their products through a single delivery mechanism. However,
firms increasingly offer their products and services through multiple delivery
mechanisms in parallel, allowing their customers to choose among the delivery
mechanisms. The goal of this project is to develop models and algorithms to help
sellers choose which delivery mechanisms to operate in parallel, what prices to
charge in each delivery mechanism, and how to allocate limited service capacity
among the different delivery mechanisms. The models and algorithms developed
within the scope of this project will enable sellers to maximize their revenue,
while providing more effective service to their
customers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A key difficulty in the analysis of parallel
delivery mechanisms is that the customers are strategic, and their decision to
make use of a particular delivery mechanism depends on the decisions of the
seller and of other customers. This dependence requires analyzing the
equilibrium resulting from customers' and seller's decisions by using tools from
game theory and stochastic models. Computation of equilibria is provably hard.
This project will identify conditions under which equilibria exist and will
characterize the structure of strategies employed by customers in equilibrium.
This characterization will be used to identify the features of customers who
make use of a particular delivery mechanism, make design decisions on prices and
service capacities used in different delivery mechanisms, and to find the
optimal amount of information sharing between the seller and the customers.
