0311983 Batista This is a proposal to investigate and evaluate the hypothesis
that cyanobacterial toxins can be biologically removed during drinking water
filtration. Under bloom conditions, some species of cyanobacteria are capable of
producing and releasing toxins at levels that impose considerable health risks
to animals, livestock, and humans. The specific focus of this project will be to
determine whether biodegradation of toxins occur in drinking water filters, for
short detention times.
