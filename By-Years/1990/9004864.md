A central element of the theory of the general circulation of the ocean is the
overturning in the meridional plane. This proposal, an element of the World
Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE), will deploy mid-depth floats in the Brazil
Basin as part of the Deep Basin Experiment (DBE). The investigators will obtain
displacement and velocity, as well as temperature and conductivity from floats
tracked acoustically for up to 2 years. The data will be analyzed in concert
with fixed moorings, hydrographic measurements of the density field and tracers,
and numerical models. Major components of the DBE will be done by other
countries.
