The research will investigate how human operators interact with automated
manufacturing systems, with a view to developing models to support the rational
design of the role of human operators in such systems. In particular, it will
investigate the conditions which lead to human intervention in the control of
automated systems. A real time interactive simulation will allow operators to
experiment with different modes and strategies of intervention, and discover
when to take control and when to hand it back. Particular attention will be paid
to the human role under two system control policies. The first is hierarchical,
where the human interacts with the system through one central controller. The
second, which has not been empirically investigated in this context before, is
heterarchical, where control is distributed among all the machines in the
manufacturing cell and the human is just one of many entities. This research
will further our understanding of human-machine symbiosis, and will lead to
improvements in advanced manufacturing systems which, having a sound scientific
basis, will help to make such systems more productive and competitive.
