This award will provide half the funds needed to acquire a laser-ablation
sampler for the inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometer system installed in
the Department of Geological Sciences at Cornell University. The addition of
this laser device will significantly enhance capabilities for trace element
analysis. Laser ablation provides the opportunity for microanalysis and in situ
analysis with excellent spatial resolution. This laser device will be used in
trace element partitioning studies in both natural and experimental rock
systems. Analytical studies of mantle and crustal xenoliths are also planned.
