9420205 Ngo In order to understand how Monolithic Magnetics operates and how it
is used, a physics-based modeling methodology will be developed for the large-
signal analysis and simulation of both field-related and terminal
characteristics of Monolithic Magnetics - while the device functions in a
switched-mode power converter. (The modeling methodology can also be used to
implement large-signal models for conventional magnetics in standard circuit
simulators.) A design methodology and a library of standard cells will be
established to facilitate Monolithic Magnetic design. Switched-mode dc-to-dc
converters employing Monolithic Magnetics will be fabricated and tested to
verify the theory and to assess the usefulness of Monolithic Magnetics. ***
