We will continue to operate a research site for undergraduates at Mount Holyoke
College. Each summer for the years 1998 through 2000 we will engage ten students
drawn from U.S. colleges and universities in mathematical research. The students
will work in groups of five, each group carrying out a different project under
the supervision of a faculty member. The projects will involve extensive
computer experimentation and be directed at mainstream areas of mathematical
research in which experimental evidence promises to illuminate, and possibly
even overcome, current impasses in purely theoretical attacks. The groups will
meet separately several times a day but ample opportunity will be provided for
students in different groups to exchange ideas. The projects for 1998 are codes
and Kloosterman sums (Davidoff) and polynomial representations of knots
(Durfee).
