Ice shelves are the floating portions of glaciers that terminate in the ocean.
They are common around the periphery of Antarctica. The accumulation of surface
meltwater on or near the surface of ice shelves can play a role in ice-shelf
collapse, which leads to accelerated loss of grounded ice and sea-level rise.
Recent studies have showed that present-day meltwater generation and movement
across the surface of Antarctica is more widespread than previously thought and
is expected to increase. Consequently, there is a growing need to address the
role of surface water in forecasts of ice-shelf behavior. While much progress
has been made, understanding of the role of water in ice-shelf collapse is still
in its infancy. This award supports a workshop that will bring together experts
from multiple disciplines that, together, can advance understanding of Antarctic
surface hydrology and its role in the future stability of ice shelves.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will bring together U.S. and international
scientists with expertise in ice-sheet dynamics, glacial hydrology, climatology,
and other disciplines to identify critical knowledge gaps and move the community
towards answering fundamental questions such as: What climate dynamics are
responsible for surface meltwater generation in Antarctica? What controls the
spatiotemporal distribution of meltwater ponds on Antarctic ice shelves? Where
is meltwater generated, where does it pond today, and how will this change this
century? How will meltwater impact ice shelves? How will surface hydrology
impact sea-level this century? The deliberations will be captured in a workshop
report and review paper that will be broadly distributed.
