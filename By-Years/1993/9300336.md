Dr. Philip DeShong and other members of the Chemistry Department of University
of Maryland are being supported for a Research Experiences for Undergraduates
(REU) site in Chemistry. For the period 1993-5, eight undergraduate students
will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in a variety of research
projects. Projects cover the traditional areas of chemistry-analytical,
inorganic, organic, physical and biochemistry. A unique feature of this program
is targeting of schools within a 200 hundred mile radius with special emphasis
on women and minorities.
