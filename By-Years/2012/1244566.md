Intellectual Merit Syntrophy among microbial partners involves the exchange of
metabolites, making processes possible that cannot be accomplished by either
organism alone. These mutually beneficial relationships are now known to make
essential contributions to the global carbon cycle. However, while syntrophic
metabolism is found in nearly all anaerobic environments in nature, little is
understood about the molecular, biochemical, or physiological basis of this
important ecological process. The Syntrophomonas wolfei-Methanospirillum
hungatei co-culture is the historical model for thermodynamically-limited
syntrophic associations because both organisms are syntroph specialists that
operate near the thermodynamic equilibrium, and that evolved by niche-associated
interactions. This project will delineate the metabolic and regulatory systems
involved in syntrophic metabolism in a well-defined model system. Syntrophic
consortia are also excellent model systems to probe the mechanisms by which
multispecies microbial communities interact because much about the metabolites
used and the roles of each syntrophic partner is understood. Therefore, this
project will serve as a paradigm for study of metabolism and gene expression in
other multispecies microbial communities in key ecological habitats. The
research will open up the next levels of study to decipher basic principles of
this poorly understood biological process.

Broader Impacts This project will deepen understanding of the interesting
phenomenon of syntrophy, of biological contributions to the global carbon cycle,
and more broadly of the underlying molecular mechanisms at play in microbial
communities. It will support training of graduate and undergraduate students in
laboratory research involving anaerobic microbiology, microbial physiology,
enzyme analysis, and analytical chemistry. The PIs will continue to be actively
involved in developing undergraduate educational materials at their respective
institutions. These include web-based materials that provide access for a wider
audience. Existing programs are targeted for expansion to include institutions
having significant underrepresented minority enrollments and students with
disadvantaged backgrounds. In addition to educating, a goal is to promote
interest in and enthusiasm for microbiology. Both PIs will also assist in
judging local and/or national science fairs.
