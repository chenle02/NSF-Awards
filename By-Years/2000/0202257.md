This research program will test current theories and models of the radiation
belts by comparing the theoretical and model results with observational data
obtained from the NASA Polar satellite and the GPS satellites. It will develop
statistical descriptions of the particle pitch angle distributions for different
L-shells and different local times as a function of the phase of a magnetic
storm. This will make it possible to distinguish among competing theories for
the transport and loss of relativistic electrons. It will also determine which
mechanisms dominate the transport and loss processes under different conditions.
In addition, the project will develop time-dependent phase space density
profiles for the events selected for study in the Geospace Environment Modeling
campaign on the inner magnetosphere and magnetic storms. These profiles will be
made available to the space physics community to help establish an understanding
of when and where relativistic electron acceleration is occurring. The profiles
will also be useful in constraining the theoretical work currently being done.
