The contribution of this project comes from the development of semiparametric
estimators for models that have not previously been considered, as well as new
estimators for models that have been considered in the statistical and
econometric literature. A great deal of research in econometrics has been
devoted to the development of semiparametric methods because these methods
permit analysts to obtain results from data even if very little is known about
the underlying processes that generated the data. This project develops semi-
parametric estimators for a number of different models. These include partially
linear Tobit models, partially linear logit models, partially linear Poisson
regression models, partially linear duration models, and Tobit models with
sample selection. These estimators are defined by minimizing objective functions
that are based on comparing all pairs of observations. An investigation of the
asymptotic properties of estimators that are defined in this way will be
conducted. Previous research on Tobit models with fixed effects will continue.
The possibility of estimating fixed effects versions of the so- called Type 3
Tobit model will be addressed, and a two-step estimator is developed. Software
will be developed to permit others to use these techniques.
