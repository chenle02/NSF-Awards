The 2013 IEEE INFOCOM Conference on Computer Communications will be held in
Turin, Italy, April 14-19, 2013. This preeminent technical conference is the
primary venue for presenting new research results in the area of computer
communications, and is widely attended by researchers and practitioners in the
field. Attending conferences such as INFOCOM is of paramount importance for the
development of graduate students. Participants have the opportunity to present
their work, attend panel and keynote sessions, and interact with hundreds of
others performing leading-edge research in the field. This proposal requests
funding to support approximately 20 graduate students in the United States to
attend this premiere conference. The travel award will target graduate students,
in particular, women and under-represented minority students, since attending
conferences is an important part of their educational experience, and they often
have limited travel funds.
