This research employs on a novel time-resolved spectroscopy for specular thin
films and surfaces based on ellipsometry. Rapidly evolving thin films and
surfaces can be characterized in real time with sub-monolayer sensitivity and
resolution. The technique differs from alternative methods because of its speed,
it requires no in vacuo instrumentation, it operates passively during
deposition, and it can probe surfaces even in the most adverse environments such
as chemical vapor deposition. The technique is being applied to a number of
growth processes in group IV semiconductors. %%% This project continues the
development and application of a technique to measure the deposition of atomic
layers. The technique is unique in that it measures the growth atomic layer by
atomic layer. In addition, it is very fast and robust and can be used to monitor
growth of semiconductor layers in the chambers that are used commercially. The
technique is based on reflection of light from the surface that is growing. The
technique is being applied to a number of materials, primarily semiconductors.
