This project in the area of analytical and surface chemistry involves the study
of interfacial protein electrochemistry. It is a renewal grant which will extend
Professor Bowden's research program into the area of fundamental investigations
of electron transfer mechanisms on gold electrodes coated with organothiolate
self-assembled monolayer films. The goal is to further our understanding of
long-range electron transfer processes in biological systems. The adsorbed
proteins proposed for study will serve as the electrochemical analogs of
protein/protein compexes. Thus, the experimental results will help to elucidate
electronic coupling mechanisms between enzymes and electronically conducting
materials. %%% Professor Bowden and his students will use both electrochemical
and spectroscopic techniques to study biological electron transfer processes
with electrodes coated with a thin film of organic material. The objective of
the research is to model protein/protein interactions in biological systems. The
results will be of value for the design of new biological probes and sensors.
