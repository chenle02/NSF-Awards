This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry
Research Instrumentation programs. The University of Dayton is acquiring a 400
MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer equipped with an automatic
sample changer to support Professor Jeremy Erb and colleague Vladimir Benin.
This spectrometer allows research in a variety of fields such as those that
accelerate chemical reactions of significant economic importance, as well as
those permitting study of biologically relevant species. In general, NMR
spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the
elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown
substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and
to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the
solid state. The NMR spectrometer is an integral part of teaching as well as
research and research training of undergraduate students in chemistry and
biochemistry at the University of Dayton and nearby Sinclair Community College.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award of the NMR spectrometer is aimed at enhancing
research and education at all levels. The acquisition especially impacts
discovery of stereospecific reactions for the synthesis of chiral
organophosphates and their derivatives of relevance to pesticides. The
instrumentation is also used for studying biological mechanisms of cold-
acclimation in the southern gray tree frog dryophytes chrysoscelis. In addition,
the instrument provides information to aid the design, preparation, and studies
of flame retardants. The spectrometer is also used to explore polymer synthesis
and biodegradation mechanisms and the use of polyenes in biodegradation.
Finally, the NMR spectrometer is also utilized to identify synthetic fluorescent
dyes having boron dipyrromethene.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
