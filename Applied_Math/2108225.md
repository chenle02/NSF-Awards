This fluid dynamics study is aimed at improving the theoretical understanding of
turbulent atmosphere ocean processes at small scales, which are unresolvable in
today's global-scale computer models. The key components of the project are the
improved understanding of turbulent energy transfers between large and small
scales in the fluid. This involves vigorous interactions between current systems
like the Gulf Stream and fast wave motions that cannot be seen by current global
ocean computer models. Overall, the proposed work has broad impacts within fluid
mechanics, physical oceanography, and its training aspects include both graduate
and undergraduate students.

The fluid dynamics of these complex systems is characterized by a nonlinear
jigsaw puzzle of intermingling turbulent waves and vortices, especially at small
scales, such as those relevant to submesoscale oceanography, for instance. Here
classical wave-mean interaction theory fails, direct numerical simulation of the
fluid motion with global computational models is not possible, and theoretical
innovations for diagnostic and predictive models are needed. In this connection
the present proposal seeks to break new ground with a multi-pronged approach
that combines theory and numerical modelling. First, the long term evolution of
turbulent internal wave spectra under refraction by the balanced mean flow is
studied using a novel wave action advection-diffusion theory. Second, vigorous
two-way interactions between internal waves and the balanced mean flow are
studied using new wave-mean interaction equations derived from generalized
Lagrangian-mean theory. These equations allow for strong interactions that cut
both ways: the waves feel the mean flow and vice versa. This is an important but
understudied regime for submesoscale oceanography.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
