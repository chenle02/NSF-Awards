The focus of this project is model theory and its interactions with and
applications to other areas of mathematics. Model theory is a part of
mathematical logic, and studies the manner in which mathematical objects or
classes of objects are defined linguistically. Consequently, model theory has
developed various ways of measuring the simplicity and complexity of classes of
functions or sets. Among the other areas of mathematics that the PI will study
using model-theoretic methods, is combinatorics, in particular graphs, also
informally called networks. Important results in combinatorics are "regularity"
results, showing how networks can be decomposed into a small number of pieces,
each such piece behaving "almost randomly". The PI will use model theoretic
methods to extend and improve such regularity theorems, sometimes under a
simplicity assumption.

The core part of the proposal has three aspects: The first is to use methods
from topological dynamics to obtain new invariants for first order theories and
definable groups. The second concerns applications of model theory and
nonstandard methods to arithmetic regularity theorems as well as the formulation
of new regularity statements in a "tame" environment such as stability theory in
continuous logic. The third involves the formulation of the notion of an
approximate subgroup in a general model-theoretic context and giving a
classification in the absence of invariant measures. Other parts of the proposal
include describing p-adic semialgebraic groups and developing a model theory of
affine group schemes (or pro-linear algebraic groups).
