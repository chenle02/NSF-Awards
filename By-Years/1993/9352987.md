9352987 Woods Southwest Oklahoma State University will initiate a 5-week
residential Young Scholars project in mathematics for 36 students entering
grades 10 thru 12. Emphasis is placed on inquiry and exploration. Students learn
to use powerful and exciting computer software such as Derive, Mathematica, and
Geometric Supposer to explore topics from linear algebra and applied
mathematics. Career/ethics of science discussions and field trips to local
industries and universities complete the project activities. ***
