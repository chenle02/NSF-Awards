Basic research will be conducted on advanced parallel computer architecture and
the implementations of real- time, high performance, intelligent systems and
knowledge-based information processing. These processing techniques will be used
to accomplish the excessive computations involved in solving algorithms for
state estimation and contingency analysis at almost real- time speed. The
results of this work will be used to optimize the on-line operation and control
of electric power systems.
