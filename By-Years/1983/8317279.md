This research is directed toward increasing the scientific communities'
knowledge of base isolation systems, which offer potential for protection of
structures from earthquakes. The project is directed toward optimal use of base
isolation devices to achieve maximum protection from earthquake hazards. The
research will use the results of previous studies to project
furtherunderstanding of base isolation systems. Consideration will be given to
the realistic characterization of the ground excitation and the supporting soil,
the effects of friction in the base isolation system, the effects of hysteretic
damping, the effects of torsion, the development of simplified procedures
directed toward engineering practice, and the effects of mechanical properties
of the system.
