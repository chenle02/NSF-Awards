A theoretical study of the dynamics of tropical instability waves (TIW) is
proposed. The investigation will involve two numerical models, a reduced gravity
model and a spectral process model. The sensitivity of the wave dynamics to the
model's parameterizations of physical processes will be investigated. The
dynamics of TIW and their relevance to the equatorial budgets of heat, momentum,
vorticity and energy will be evaluated.
