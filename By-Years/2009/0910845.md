The Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program of the Division of Chemistry at NSF
will support the research program of Prof. Robin McCarley of Louisiana State
University. Prof. McCarley and his students plan to investigate how to prepare
stimuli responsive liposomes with the capability to deliver molecules that are
internalized in the liposomes as a result of liposome destabilization. They will
investigate the mechanism and kinetics associated with liposome opening by
chemical reducing agents and enzymes. The project could have significant impact
on various industries that focus on environmental remediation, chemical analysis
and drug delivery. The project will provide excellent training opportunities to
graduate and undergraduate students in a highly multidisciplinary research area.
It will also support the participation of Prof. McCarley and his students in the
Louisiana Board of Regents "Speaking of Science" program for K-12 students and
in the LSU's ChemDemo K-12 outreach program, which has already impacted 60,000
Louisiana students.
