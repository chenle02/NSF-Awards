9314911 Smith Our knowledge of the origins, history and distribution of the
chemical elements rests on measured elemental abundances in stars and
interstellar gas. Key clues are found in the abundance patterns of certain
elements. Detailed abundance analyses of the heavy elements will be carried out
for stars in globular clusters. This yield crucial evidence on the early
chemical evolution of the galaxy and the time scale for the formation of the
globular clusters.
