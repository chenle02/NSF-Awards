The 1988 Aspen Winter Physics Conference, Condensed Matter Physics portion, will
be on "Theoretical Foundations of High Temperature Superconductivity." The goals
are to identify the most promising theoretical models, to distill the most
critical experimental results which bear on the superconductivity mechanism and
to establish the crucial experimental tests of the theories.
