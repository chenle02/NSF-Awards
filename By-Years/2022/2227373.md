The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the potential
development of an eye drop that may protect the surface of the eye against
oxidative stress from common sources such as UV exposure and contact lens wear.
Oxidative stress can cause redness, irritation, and inflammation of the eye.
Ongoing, these issues can potentially lead to significant damage to the eye as
well as dysfunction including dry eye disease, corneal swelling, contact lens
intolerance, and the need for eye surgeries. There are 45 million contact lens
wearers, 16.4 million dry eye disease patients, and 9.4 million individuals with
other ocular disorders at risk for these conditions that may benefit from the
use of a product that blocks oxidative stress from becoming a problem for eye
health and their vision. Commercially, this product could be offered on its own
or as an additive to other products that cause oxidative stress as a side
effect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the potential
development of a unique formula of a complexed ubiquinol that can be highly
dispersible in water and potentially stable. Complexed ubiquinol compounds have
been shown to be able to penetrate through the entire thickness of the cornea
and can be delivered directly into corneal endothelial cells more efficiently
than the free form of ubiquinol. Surpassing the hurdle of delivery to the eye by
using a water-based solution may allow for topical use of ubiquinol, rather than
orally, potentially offering a wide range of ocular treatment
strategies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
