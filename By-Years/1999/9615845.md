ABSTRACT OPP-9615845 OBERBAUER, STEPHEN FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY This
project is an extension of a previous research program to investigate the
effects of potential global warming on Arctic tundra. This project is one
component of a larger US. effort to contribute to the International Tundra
Experiment that is examining the possible impact of global climate change on
tundra growth. The results of this research will contribute to a coordinated
international effort to determine if a warming climate will result in an
increase in carbon dioxide flux from the tundra into the atmosphere. The
contribution of this particular project to the international program is to look
at the effect of climate warming on the length of the growing season. A longer
growing season could result from a warmer climate and a concomitant increase in
carbon uptake in the tundra root system. These results are critical to consider
along with other experimental results on climate impacts on the tundra so that
researchers may be able assess all of the factors that could lead to fundamental
changes in the tundra ecosystem as a result of global change.
