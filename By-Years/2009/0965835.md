This project is recruiting, retaining, supporting, and placing students pursuing
Associate, Baccalaureate, and Graduate degrees in General Science, Computer
Science, Math, Natural Resources, Biology, Chemistry, Engineering, and other
eligible STEM fields. A minimum of 30 total scholarships are being awarded over
the lifetime of the project. S-STEM scholars are provided an array of support
services to improve chances of success, and successful participants are placed
in jobs or provided opportunities for further education. Scholar support is
offered through natural cohorts, an American Indian Science and Engineering
Society (AISES) chapter, and by providing Elder Mentors for the scholars for
cultural relevance and to improve student retention rates. Other student support
elements include: student tracking, internal evaluation, dissemination, cohorts,
research and internship opportunities, mentorships, strong faculty support, and
a commitment to infrastructure improvements. This project is expected to serve
as a model for other similar projects, especially at other Tribal Colleges and
Universities.
