This project supports three years of MIT Talbot workshops. This is an annual
event organized by graduate students. The 2014 MIT Talbot Workshop took place
March 16-22 in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee. Professor Marc Levine of the
Universitaet Duisburg-Essen led the workshop, which was entitled Motivic
Homotopy Theory. Since their initiation in 2004, the MIT Talbot Workshops have
provided a unique opportunity for some thirty young researchers - graduate
students and postdocs - to spend a week with an expert in their field in an
intimate and informal setting. Each workshop is on a different topic, chosen for
its broad interest and currency. Qualities of clarity, leadership, and
generosity are important in the selection of mentor. Numerous strong research
relationships have had their origin in these workshops over the years.

Motivic homotopy theory, the subject of the 2014 workshop, is a vibrant and
rapidly expanding research area with origins in the solution of the Milnor
conjecture about algebraic K-theory by Vladimir Voevodsky (who won the Fields
Medal for this work). It has attracted an increasing number of participants from
both algebraic geometry and algebraic topology, because of its intrinsic beauty
and its proven power as a tool for attacking problems in algebraic K-theory and,
more recently, in homotopy theory. It provided an ideal subject for the Talbot
Workshop, bringing together very bright and motivated young researchers from
distinct fields in a context which encouraged deep learning and collaboration,
under the inspired leadership of Marc Levine, one who has made profound
contributions to the subject.
