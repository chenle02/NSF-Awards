This award will support a twelve month long-term visit by Professor Larry J.
Miller, Department of Biology, Gannon University, Erie, Pennsylvania, to Japan
for a cooperative research project with Professors Tsuneo Moriya and Yoko
Miyashita, Department of Biology, Sapporo Medical College. The researchers plan
to undertake immunocytochemical investigations of AVT and CRF immunoreactive
perikarya and fibers in the brain of juvenile salmon and to correlate changes in
AVAT and CRF immunoreactivity with physiological markers indicative of seawater
readiness. The research will be carried out on the Chum salmon which is an
important commercial species in Japan. Professors Moriya and Miyashita have an
established research program using Chum salmon. The researchers will be looking
at the timing of the salmon's migratory phase, the environmental and hormonal
control of migration and the control of certain accompanying physiological
changes such as effects on skin pigmentation. The research results should
provide answers to important biological questions fundamental to an
understanding of salmonid physiology which are of real significance to salmonid
aquaculture. The Sapporo Medical Laboratory is well equipped for the
experiments. They stock salmon in both fresh and salt water and have also
devised a circular tank to create simulating current flow. Because Chum salomn
are unique in that they mature to smolt phase within three months of hatching it
allows enough time for all the planned experiments to be completed during
Professor Miller's visit to the Sapporo Laboratory. All of the researchers are
anxiously looking forward to this project and it is believed that this is the
beginning of a collaboration that will continue past this formal agreement.
