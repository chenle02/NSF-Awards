This proposal supports the first step in the Proteus Media Project, a project to
design and build a computer-assisted political war-game. In particular, the
Proteus gaming environment will be designed to provide participants with
experience in political, economic, operational, cultural, and temporal
dimensions of post-war Iraq. This first phase will develop a preliminary design
for the system. The Proteus system will address issues in temporal reasoning and
adaptive agents.
