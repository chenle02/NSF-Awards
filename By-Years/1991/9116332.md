This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of organometallic electrochemistry. During the tenure of this
three-year continuing grant, Professor Geiger and his students will pursue
fundamental investigations of one-electron and two-electron transfer reactions
that are designed to elucidate mechanistic aspects of these technologically
important types of chemical systems. Electrochemical and spectroscopic
techniques will be used in conjunction with well designed molecular frameworks
containing multiple metal redox centers to test through-space electron
delocalization, the cooperative reactivity of adjacent redox centers, and long
distance interactions between weakly coupled redox centers. Also, a sound
experimental approach will be developed for comparing the distance dependence of
homogeneous electron transfer processes with their heterogeneous analogues. %%%
This research builds upon results obtained under Dr. Geiger's previous NSF
grant, CHE-8603728, to provide basic insights into fundamental aspects of
conducting materials and of photosynthetic and other biological electron
transfer reactions. Additionally, these studies are important to further
understanding the behavior of mixed-valent compounds that function as
industrially important catalytic systems.
