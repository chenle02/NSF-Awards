The work to be performed in this program is the spectroscopy of alkali clusters
at the rotational level using resonant two-photon ionization and optical-optical
double resonance spectroscopy. The goal of the experiments is to probe the
dynamic behavior of the vibronic states through the influence of ro-vibronic
coupling on the rotational levels. Clusters form the bridge between gas phase
atomic physics and condensed matter physics, and the information which is sought
at this detailed level is fundamental to understanding the transition from one
phase to the next.
