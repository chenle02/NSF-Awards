This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is aimed at the
development of a network of miniaturized, intelligent, addressable sensing
modules (ASM's), that can be embedded within a composite structure, remotely
powered, and interrogated by a personal computer through a non-contacting
inductive link. The inductive power link is also used for bi-directional
communications. A computer based interrogation system will transmit a data
request to a specific ASM on the embedded network. This data request will be
encoded by frequency shift keying the AC waveform that delivers power to
embedded electronics. Once addressed, the embedded ASM will power up its strain
sensing elements, and data conversion components. The strain data will be
sampled and encoded as pulse code modulated (PCM) data. The PCM serial data then
modulates an RF carrier for transmission out of the embedded material, back to
the interrogating computer. The system will be designed to allow a variety of
sensing devices to be used interchangeably on the network, this will allow smart
structures sensing means to be tailored for a specific application. Development
of the system will be accompanied by thorough testing along the way to insure
target specifications will be met. Structures with a broad variety of
capabilities may be developed by embedding intelligent sensing networks of
temperature, strain, crack propagation, pressure, magnetic fields, etc.
Applications include health monitoring of thick composite structures, bridges,
dams, and buildings. Military and commercial potential for these systems is
significant.
