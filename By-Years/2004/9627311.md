Dr. Bunny C. Clark's research in nuclear theory represents an extension of
ongoing efforts to develop relativistic descriptions of a wide range of nuclear
reactions and nuclear structure (e.g., global optical potential, nuclear
densities, meson-nucleus scattering, inelastic reactions). The results of this
work have already proved useful to experimental groups around the world.
Interactive activities include working with the internationally recognized
physics education research group, P.E.G., headed by Professor Lillian McDermott;
and participating in the activities of the group including the inservice teacher
program and the innovative inquiry-based tutorial program for calculus-based and
algebra-based physics courses. In addition, Dr. Clark will organize a series of
seminars and meetings with women faculty, postdocs, graduate and undergraduate
students at the University of Washington.
