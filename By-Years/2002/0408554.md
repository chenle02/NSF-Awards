Abstract&lt;br/&gt;CHE-
0408554&lt;br/&gt;George/Colorado&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project,
supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, addresses the
fundamental aspects of atomic layer deposition chemistry of SiO2 and SnO2
layers. Using a novel viscous flow reactor coupled with multiple surface
analysis probes, Professor George and his collaborators at the University of
Colorado, are investigating the detailed mechanisms of these important
processes. The combination of infrared spectroscopy, electrical measurements,
quartz crystal microgravimetry, and gas phase reactant and product analysis
provides an effective tool for determining surface reaction kinetics and
mechanisms. Results of this work will find application in electronic materials
processing and in the development of new gas sensor systems.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using a combination of surface spectroscopic probes,
Professor George and his coworkers are examining the detailed mechanistic
chemistry of atomic layer deposition (ALD). This work concentrates primarily on
the deposition of semiconductor and metal oxide layers using ALD. The results of
this work are applied to the design of semiconductor process chemistry, and to
the fabrication of gas sensor devices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
