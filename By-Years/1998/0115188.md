It has been shown that replication forks formed at the origin of replication in
Escherichia coli are not likely to circumnavigate the chromosome and finish a
round of synthesis during normal cell growth. Replication forks are apparently
derailed by endogenous DNA damage, and these forks must be reactivated in order
to ensure cell division and bacterial cell survival. Reactivation requires
homologous recombination functions and a replication restart primosome. The
nature of the lesions that are formed under normal growth conditions are not
well defined and may be either base lesions or strand breaks. Preliminary data
suggest a connection between purine nucleoside metabolism and a form of DNA
repair that results in stalled replication forks. The purine analog
hydroxylaminopurine (HAP) will be used to mimic the effects of mutations that
disrupt a repair pathway in E. coli. It is suggested that the endogenous lesions
that block replication forks in E. coli under normal growth conditions arise
from purine analogs that are converted into nucleoside triphosphates and then
incorporated into DNA by replicative polymerases. This hypothesis leads to many
predictions and raises many questions. Is it possible to identify the specific
mechanism for HAP-induced cell killing? Can HAP be used as a probe of the
enzymatic processes that remove endogenous aberrant purine nucleotide
triphosphates from the replication precursor pool? Is it possible to identify
the nucleoside triphosphates in E. coli under normal growth conditions that
trigger replication fork arrest and restart? In order to answer these questions
all the genes involved in the formation of nucleoside triphosphates containing
base analogues and the subsequent removal of these compounds from nucleoside and
nucleotide pools and from DNA will be identified.
