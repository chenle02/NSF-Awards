With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at SUNY-Buffalo will acquire a multi-user laser system
for the direct excitation of lanthanide (Ln) (III) luminescence for biological,
inorganic, and materials chemistry. This equipment will enhance research in the
following areas: a) protein-doped xerogels; b) solvation of Ln(III) ions in room
temperature ionic liquids; c) Ln(III) polyoxometalates as building blocks for
new materials; d) de novo artificial nucleases basded on helix-turn-helix DNA-
binding motifs; e) Ln(III) complex catalysts; and f) Ln(III) probes for metal
ion RNA interactions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This instrumentation will be used
not only by faculty at the University at Buffalo, but also researchers at the
University of Iowa and Hunter College. These studies will use Ln(III)
luminescence to study materials and catalysts and probe metal ion binding sites
in proteins and nucleic acids; therefore, they will have an impact in numerous
fields, including materials chemistry and biochemistry . &lt;br/&gt;
