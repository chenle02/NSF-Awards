This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on the
implementation of a Terahertz (THz) module that can emit coherent and tunable
Terahertz waves. This project naturally follows the recent result obtained by
the Project Investigator. Recently, coherent Terahertz radiation was generated
at room temperature, which could be continuously tunable from 56.8 mm to beyond
1618 mm (5.27 to 0.18 THz), in Gallium Selenide, based on difference-frequency
generation. The peak Terahertz power can be as high as 69.4 W at 196 mm. The
corresponding photon conversion efficiency reaches 3.3%. This value has been
greatly improved owing to the combination of extremely low absorption
coefficients in the Terahertz domain and a large second-order nonlinear
coefficient for Gallium Selenide. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated
that optical parametric oscillator in Lithium Niobate can be used to generate a
Terahertz wave tunable in the range of 110-460 m (2.7-0.7 THz) with a peak power
of 300 W. However, Lithium Niobate suffers from photorefractive damage. One
needs a much higher laser intensity to achieve parametric oscillation.

The Terahertz source will dramatically impact molecular spectroscopy. Such an
instrument can be eventually used to control pollution and to identify toxic
chemicals, for remote sensing, bio- medical imaging, and security screening.
