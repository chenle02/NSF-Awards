Abstract (Volberg/Nazarov/Treil: 0758552/0800243/0800876)

The proposed research is at the intersection of Geometric Measure Theory and
Harmonic Analysis. The main objective of Geometric Measure Theory is to find
structures in seemingly unstructured, fractal-like patterns. The classical
Harmonic Analysis studies wave propagation, and investigation of singular
integral operators is a crucial part of the modern approach. Our continuing
research, as well as the work of several other groups of mathematicians in the
US and abroad, has demonstrated that new knowledge can be obtained by exploring
the interaction between these two areas.

As a result of our proposal we expect to solve several important problems in
Geometric Measure Theory as well as in Harmonic Analysis. The pattern
recognition (i.e., problems in Geometric Measure Theory) would be advanced by
using methods originating in Harmonic Analysis, and vice versa. We also expect
to develop new methods to study both patterns and waves. It is expected that
these newly developed techniques will have impact to adjacent areas of
engineering and computer sciences such as image processing and data compression.
