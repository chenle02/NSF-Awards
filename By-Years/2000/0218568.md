Mathematical and Algorithmic Analysis of Natural and Artificial DNA Sequences

The PI is developing tools that play an important role in understanding the
properties of both natural and artificial genomes and thus, elucidates how such
DNA evolves under natural and artificial conditions (in vitro or in vivo). The
ultimate applications range from building error-resilient biological computers
all the way up to understanding how genome structures (e.g., genes, gene
families, synteny groups, haplotype blocks, chromosomes, etc.) have naturally
evolved.

With this goal in mind, the PI is developing several modeling and statistical
algorithms with efficient implementations in order to solve design problems in
genomics, biosensors, biocomputation and evolutionary biology. The final "tool
box'' design contains: a software environment and language that allows users to
visualize and analyze long DNA or RNA molecules, a "gene grammar" to model
various genome-wide evolutionary processes, statistical analysis of the
structures of various natural genomic DNAs evolving under replication and proof-
reading processes and finally, a physical annotation of the genome that can be
used in designing genomic microarrays or aptamers for biosensors.
