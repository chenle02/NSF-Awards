9404312 Yang The topics proposed in the research entail curvature estimates on
classes of four-dimensional manifolds. This also includes a study of the
geometry of actions of the integer modulo p-group where for p equal to a prime
number it is intended to prove a homeomorphism classification theorem for
nonnegative sectional curvature. Deformations of exotic differentiable
structures on the 7-sphere will also be analyzed. The research has potential
applications to topology and gauge field theory in mathematical physics. ***
