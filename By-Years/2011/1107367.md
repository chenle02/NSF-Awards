GEometric structures And Representation varieties
(GEAR)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a Research Network in the
Mathematical Sciences. The GEometric structures And Representation varieties
(GEAR) network encompasses mathematicians with backgrounds in diverse areas such
as classical Teichm√ºller theory, discrete subgroups of Lie groups, 3- manifold
topology, harmonic maps, dynamics, and moduli spaces of Higgs bundles and gauge
theory. In recent years researchers in these areas have converged on common
problems clustered around locally homogeneous structures on manifolds and moduli
spaces of representations of finitely generated groups. New techniques and tools
in one area have led to advances in another, and the contrasting points of view
have highlighted new questions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the GEAR
network are to spur cross-pollination of ideas from one area to another, to
build a research community transcending current divisions, to train students and
researchers to cross traditional boundaries, and by these means to advance the
mathematics targeted by the network. The main programs of the network include
visits and exchanges among researchers at different locations, focused meetings
and workshops designed to bridge gaps between targeted subspecialties or to
address specific problems, network-wide retreats to help forge a common research
community, graduate student internships and summer research experiences, and
cyber-networking activities. Spread over 46 locations in the US, Canada and
Europe, the nodes of the network cover a wide range of institutions, including
several with historically low levels of resources for research. The nodes are
arranged around central hubs at The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,
The University of Maryland, and Stanford University, with the lead hub in
Urbana-Champaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GEAR Research Network home page:
