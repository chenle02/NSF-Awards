Hinds 9724743 This award supports a 24 month Japan Society for the Promotion of
Science (JSPS) Postdoctoral Fellowship for Dr. Bruce Hinds at the Tokyo
Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan. Dr. Hinds will work with Dr. Shunri Oda,
Professor at the Research Center of Quantum Effect Electronics, on a research
project entitled, "Novel Single Electron Coulomb Blockade Transistor as Probe in
the Study of the SiO2/Si Interface." The proposed research will focus on the
design of a single electron Coulomb blockade transistor and will be specifically
directed toward lower gate control voltages (required for logic applications)
and systematic control of interfacial oxides. Current research on Coulomb
blockade transistors suggests that the charge of a single electron (in a
floating gate) controls the state of the transistor (the flow of electrons
through the channel). The proposed research will examine a novel transistor
design that will allow for variations in interfacial oxides (SiO2/Si) present at
the floating gate, modify the flow of electrons through the channel, and lower
the control voltages that determine the efficacy of logic operations.
Anticipated results of the research is the effective utilization of lithography
with feature sizes near 10 nanometers, representing a significant advance in the
scaling down of electronic device structures. The results of the proposed
research will be critical to the advancement of nano-scale electronics and the
conventional metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) fabrication, which is the basis of
the present microelectronics industry. ***
