This project will supply shipboard scientific support equipment for the
research vessel MOANA WAVE, operated by the University of Hawaii, and dedicated
to use in support of ocean science research. The Shipboard Scientific Support
Equipment Program and safe conduct of ocean science research. This Program
provides support for such items as deck equipment including winch systems for
the deployment and retrieval of scientific instruments, navigational equipment
such as radars, gyroscopes and earth satellite receivers to pin point the
location of research sites, communications equipment including radio
transceivers and satellite transceivers for voice and scientific data
communications and other equipment such as motorized workboats for transporting
scientists to and from data retrievel sites. The Project Director, Dr. Charles
Helsley is fully qualified to direct this project having had considerable
experience in overseeing the acquisition and installation of shipboard
equipment. The project will allow the institution to increase the speed of the
hydro winch for improved wire handling, and to
