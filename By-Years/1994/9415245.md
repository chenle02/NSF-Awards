Abstract Nunez Community College - S. Chalona Connection to NSFNET Proposal No.
NCR-9415245 Nunez request support from NSF for connection of their campus
networks to LaChen and from there to SURAnet. SURAnet is the midlevel network
located in the southeastern United States. It will provide operations management
and information services and it will give Nunez Community College a 56 thousand
bits per second connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits
per second) National Backbone network. The College needs greater functionality
and network speed to be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file
transfers along with being able to implement a more reliable mail system.
Students and faculty research will benefit from the link. This is also a unique
opportunity for the schools to explore innovative educational resources.
