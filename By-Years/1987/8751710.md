A network of outstanding biology teachers from Iowa participated in all the
design aspects of this proposal which will offer the opportunity for 25 well-
prepared biology teachers from central Iowa to participate in a three-week
workshop on biotechnology followed by six full day Saturday sessions. Laboratory
activities, computer applications including simulations, the bioethics of the
use of this technology, actual teaching strategies for this current topic and
the development of a set of 25 lessons will be the objectives of this program.
These teachers will conduct inservice sessions for their fellow teachers based
on these activities and the materials developed, present workshops at
professional meetings and are encouraged to write articles for professional
science teaching journals. The Iowa State University and the school districts
from which the participants will be selected have cost-shared close to 20% of
the cost of the project, in addition to the University supporting the
establishment of the Iowa Biotechnology Center for Instruction.
