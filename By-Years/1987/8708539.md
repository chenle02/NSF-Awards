Dr. Browning will study hormone and second messenger-stimulated phosphorylation
of the astrocytic cytoskeletal intermediate diameter filament proteins vimentin
and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Past studies identified neurohormone
and cyclic AMP-stimulated multiple phosphorylations of these two proteins in
intact cultured astrocytes. Recent studies have initiated the localization of
the phosphorylation sites within the primary structure of the two proteins. The
proposed research will further define these sites and test if manipulation of
other regulatory parameters of the cultured astrocytes which change the
phosphorylation of these proteins do so by phosphorylation of the same or
different sites within the proteins. The protein kinase and protein phosphatase
activities that are responsible for these phosphorylations will be identified.
Affinity purified antibodies will be prepared against the phosphorylation sites
and these antibodies will be used to localize the phosphorylation sites within
the astrocytes with reference to gross cellular structure and other structural
elements.
