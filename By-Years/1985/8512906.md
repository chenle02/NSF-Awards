The cross-sectional shape of the bridge roadway deck for cable-stayed and
suspension bridges is an essential feature of the bridge behavior with respect
to the aerodynamic forces which act on the structure. It is of major importance
to design a cross-sectional shape to have minimum effect due to wind actions.
This study will determine the basic considerations involved with the shape of
the bridge cross section for future initial designs but, more importantly, for
an evaluation and possible modification of existing bridges. The safety of
existing bridges with long spans may be determined from a better understanding
of the aerodynamic effects produced under various wind loadings.
