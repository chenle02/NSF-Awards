9704613 Novikov This project lies in the interface of analysis,
topology/geometry, and applied mathematics. Hamiltonian theory of hydrodynamical
systems, and exactly solvable Schrodinger operators are to be investigated. The
techniques to be used include solitons, asymptotic methods in nonlinear wave
theory, Kac-Moody type Lie algebras, topological quantum field theories, and
nonstandard symmetry for the spectral theory of low-dimensional Schrodinger
operators. Hamiltonian systems are systems composed of many particles moving
without friction and are governed by a complicated system of differential
equations. Hamiltonian theory simplifies these differential equations by first
looking at the total energy of the system and often reveals hidden symmetries in
the system. Dynamical systems model various phenomena in nature such as water
waves and weather systems.
