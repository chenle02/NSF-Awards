9523323 El-Sharkawi Using twin signal signature sensing, we propose a method to
monitor, detect and localize shorted turns in power system equipment with
windings. This equipment class includes synchronous turbine-generators, rotors,
transformers and motors. There has, to date, been no effective way to do so.
When implemented, the technology will be invaluable for enhancing device
performance through periodic on-line shorted winding monitoring and diagnostics.
The technology will be especially effective when applied to aging power
equipment whose reliability is uncertain. The proposed project will be
undertaken with the cooperation of Southern California Edison who will provide
in- kind support. Southern California Edison is particularly interested in the
monitoring of shorted turns of the field circuit of turboalternators. Successful
deployment of the proposed technology will save millions of dollars by
decreasing direct maintainability expense and (1) by saving the added cost of
alternate more expensive energy sources (e.g. nuclear) required during the
rotor's down time and (2) by increasing the operational life of the machine,
through, for example, avoidance of damage due to buckling. ***
