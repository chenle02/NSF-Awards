This project is for the support of undergraduate student participation in
ongoing research programs in the Department of Physics. Research experience is
available in the experimental research areas of atomic and molecular physics,
quantum electronics, and quantum optics; elementary particle physics; low
temperature physics and nuclear physics. In addition to working under the
supervision of faculty members in the research groups, the students are
participating in a weekly seminar. This project is supported under the Program
of Research Experiences for Undergraduates to help ensure an adequate supply of
scientists for the future.
