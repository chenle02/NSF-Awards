The goals of this research project are: (1) to build computer-based mathematical
models that explicitly incorporate the assemble-to-order nature of a system; and
given a fixed model, (2) to develop efficient computational procedures for
evaluating order-based performance measures under any given inventory-control
policy, and (3) to explore the form of the optimal policy in the order-based
sense. The research will consist of modeling, mathematical analysis, and
computation. The basic methodologies underlying the approaches include the
analysis of multivariate stochastic processes, dynamic programming, and the
stochastic comparison techniques, especially those based on notions of
correlations of random variables. The analyses and results of the investigation
will contribute to the understanding of the intricate relationships underlying
the system and therefore will provide constructive suggestions on how to manage
such systems effectively. This, in turn, will enable manufacturers and
distributors to respond more quickly to customer needs at lower cost.
