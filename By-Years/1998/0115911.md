Apomixis, defined as asexual reproduction through seed, is widespread among
angiosperm families although 75% of the apomictic species are found in three
plant families, Poaceae, Rosaceae, and Asteraceae. The plant materials examined
in this proposal are members of the Poaceae family, the most important crop
plant family in the human food chain. All crop plants in this family reproduce
sexually, although wild relatives of maize, wheat, and pearl millet may undergo
asexual (apomictic) reproduction. Seeds formed on an apomictic plant contain
genetically identical embryos, thus the trait has significant potential for
preserving hybrid vigor from one generation to the next in highly productive
crop plant genotypes. In Pennisetum squamulatum and Cenchrus ciliaris meiosis
typically aborts and unreduced aposporous embryo sacs form from nucellar cells.
Genetic mapping studies in Pennisetum have revealed that the locus for the
formation of unreduced embryo sacs resides in a chromosomal region with a low
recombination rate. Based on genetic map information, positional cloning of
gene(s) responsible for apomictic reproduction in Pennisetum is in progress.
Transcriptional mapping will use the tools that have been developed for physical
mapping of this region and will also use the well developed molecular tools from
related diploid model species such as sorghum and rice. The exploration of
colinearity in this region between two model diploids and two apomictic species
will focus on highly conserved gene sequences. Candidate reproductive or novel
genes in this region will be compared for their expression profiles among
apomictic and sexual genotypes/species. This research will provide an example of
the transfer of genomic information from small-genome grasses to non-recombining
regions of large-genome species.
