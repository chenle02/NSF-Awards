This project is designed for high school teachers of physical science to improve
the quality of their instruction, particularly in the laboratory. To achieve
this objective, participants will attend a three-week summer workshop dealing
with wave motion, sound, and light. Instruction by staff will be provided in the
lecture and laboratory mode. Throughout the workshop, participants will focus on
the development of their own materials for use in their respective classrooms.
Participants will also engage in an academic-year follow-up program intended to
determine and enhance the classroom impact of the preceeding summer's
activities. This program will include school visitations by the project director
and an evaluation meeting of all participants in the spring of the year.
