To support large currents in multifilamentary superconductors based on niobium-
titanium alloys, a fine scale substructure is required within the superconductor
wire. To produce substructure of the order of 100A, the conventional
multifilamentary superconductor fabrication technology requires a rather large
number of tedious processing steps. Typically a 5 inch diameter niobium-titanium
alloy ingot is mechanically worked through extrusion and wire drawing, until 5
micrometers diameter filaments are obtained. The chemical inhomogeneity in the
starting ingots that arises due to segregation of alloying elements during
solidification is often deleterious to the superconductor properties. An
altogether new manufacturing route for the preparation of multifilamentary
superconductors is proposed, which has the potential of producing
superconductors with improved characteristics, and significantly lower cost. The
approach involves preparing continuous superconductor filaments, typically 40
micrometers thick, directly from the melt. Such thin filaments, when extracted
from the melt experience high solidification rates. The high solidification
rates lead to a chemically homogeneous microstructure with extremely fine grain
sizes and sub-structures of the order of 100A. This project will address the
feasibility of obtaining desirable microstructures for flux pinning and high
critical current density. This development will obviate all the processing steps
requiring extensive mechanical deformation. Approaches to incorporate the
superconductor filaments prepared directly from the melt, into composite wires
will also be explored. The work will result in significant property improvements
in fine multifilamentary composite niobium-titanium superconductors, and
considerable cost reduction in the production of such wires. The material will
be suitable for a wide range of applications including dipoles and quadrapoles
for future high energy accelerator magnets.
