In this Doctoral Dissertation Research Grant, Eric Findeis, working under the
direction of William Bemis at the University of Massachusetts, proposes an
integrated study of the anatomy, development and functional morphology of the
cranium in a primitive group of fishes, the sturgeons. Data from all of the
studies will be used to reconstruct the phylogenetic history of the sturgeons
and in analyses of evolutionary trends in the group. The family Acipenseridae
(sturgeons) comprises 24 living species divided into four genera in two
subfamilies. The Acipenseridae, in turn, are part of a higher taxonomic grouping
of fin-rayed fishes termed the Chondrostei which includes the apparent sister
group of the Acipenseridae, the paddlefishes (Polyodontidae), gars and the
bowfin. Findeis will use the paddlefishes as the "outgroup" for determining
which traits are primitive and which are evolutionarily advanced. The study of
primitive vertebrates such as the sturgeons is important in gaining an
understanding of the evolutionary history of the modern vertebrates.
