The Compass project is charting a course towards cooperative compiler and run-
time support for applications that manage large bodies of long-lived, shared,
structured data. The project integrates programming language and database
functionality to provide orthogonal data persistence, enabling the construction
of more reliable data-intensive applications, but without compromising
performance. Performance is obtained through application of modern compilation
techniques to the problems of persistence, including static analysis and run-
time profiling, to derive knowledge of application-specific behavior which can
then be exploited by both the compiler, for program optimization, and the run-
time system, for efficient data management. Compass project goals include
development, integration and evaluation of new language-independent compiler
analyses and optimizations for persistence, with associated run-time strategies
for persistent object management. These techniques are being evaluated
empirically through development of prototype persistent languages and systems,
compilation of benchmark persistent applications, and measurement of application
performance. The compilation and run-time strategies derive much of their power
from treatment of the entire persistent application system, consisting of both
stored persistent code and data, for "whole-application" analysis and
optimization.
