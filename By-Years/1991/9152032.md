The objective of this project is to expose the students to advanced technology
used in quantitative investigation of plant hormone and secondary compounds in
plants, problems in water relations in plants, and in the computer assisted
monitoring of plant growth. Students learn the principles of chromatography
using a gas chromatograph and conduct quantitative determinations of hormone
concentrations in plant tissues under varying conditions. A water relations
package gives students the opportunity to probe a field of science which is
often neglected in most plant science classes due to a lack of equipment and
expertise. Computer and video digitization technology allow students to examine
the factors that influence both the rate and directional component of plant
growth. The equipment is used in courses taken by students majoring in the
sciences and non-science majors, allow students to actively participate in self-
designed independent student research projects.
