Depositional and diagenetic models developed by the PI for cyclic sedimentation
in the Midcontinent Pennsylvanian involve periodic eustatic fluctuations in sea
level and the hydrologic consequences of repeated marine withdrawal and
inundation. Increasingly refined conodont biostratigraphic control has corrected
several miscorrelations of stratigraphic units along outcrop, and has produced
detailed correlations with the cyclic sequences in Texas and Illinois. NSF funds
will support one of 3 interactive projects within this research program:
detailed study of a biostratigraphically constrained coeval paleosol interval
from Texas and Nebraska to the Appalachians, to determine both the geographic
patterns of climate during a sea-level low-stand and the succession of climate
changes related to minor sea-level fluctuations during this time of low stand.
This work is designed to lead to delineation of the geographic and temporal
patterns of climate change during lower stands of sea level.
