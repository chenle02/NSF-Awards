This award is to provide support for the 7th International Symposium on Water-
Rock Interaction (WRI-7). The NSF funds will be used to provide complete or
partial expenses for the travel, registration and accommodation of graduate
students and aspiring young scientists, and also a few foreign keynote speakers.
The WRI-7 Symposium will be held in Park City, Utah, July 13-18, 1992. The
symposium will consist of 4 days of oral and poster sessions and a mid-session
field trip on July 16. The WRI-7 meeting is expected to attract about 600
scientists and accompanying members from about 40 countries with about half
coming from the USA.
