The purpose of this project is to study what engineers in manufacturing
actually do. In addition the study will attempt to better understand what
educational experiences would better prepare engineers for their jobs. The study
will document the activities of these engineers so that the information could be
utilized by two main groups. The first will be a group restructuring the
undergraduate engineering curriculum at the university. The second will be the
engineering research center for net shape manufacturing. In the latter case
there are two main benefits. The first would be to help create a new model for
technology transfer from the center to industry. Manufacturing problems might be
better understood as a result of knowing what engineers in manufacturing
actually do. The second would be a model for doing research on site at various
industrial plant facilities. The study will be conducted at a large local
company that is engaged in most all major net shape manufacturing processes
involving steel, plastics and aluminum. This project has the potential to
enhance manufacturing curriculums and the flow of technology from the university
to industry.
