Climate-related shifts in phytoplankton assemblages may have profound
implications for oceanic feedbacks on the atmosphere, and for human use of
marine resources. Particular algal groups are largely responsible for crucial
processes like vertical carbon export, biogenic calcification and
silicification, production of climatically active gases like dimethylsulfide
(DMS), and for sustaining food webs that lead to economically valuable higher
trophic levels. The Drs. Hutchins and DiTullio will investigate potential
climate change impacts on algal community structure and biogeochemistry during
the North Atlantic Spring Bloom, a regime that is ideal for determining how
changing ocean conditions may affect both calcareous and siliceous algae.
&lt;br/&gt;The PIs will work closely with CarboOcean a major European Union
funded activity led by investigators from the Alfred Wegener Institute. This
will include exchanges of cruises between the two groups, collaborative
shipboard experiments, and modeling efforts using joint results. Graduate
student and post-doctoral training will be included as part of the
interdisciplinary and international activities.&lt;br/&gt;
