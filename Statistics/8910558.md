This project is a mathematical development of a broad class of models of time
dependent failure processes arising from sequential sampling schemes. The
particular models considered are modifications and extensions of Polya-
Eggenberger urn models. This project is concerned with sequential sampling
designs. Sequential sampling designs are widely used in situations where
observations are made in sequence, such as objects arriving on conveyor belts,
or objects appearing in clinical experiments.
