9706489 Williams The proposed research aims to apply and further develop
microlocal methods (localization in phase space; Fourier analysis;
pseudodifferential, Fourier integral, and paradifferential operators) for the
study of several types of nonlinear wave problems: rigorous nonlinear geometric
optics for continuous and discontinuous (shock) solutions of quasilinear
boundary problems, new mechanisms for blowup, and semilinear diffraction of
generic singularities by smooth obstacles. The work on shocks has the closest
connection to real-world applications. Shocks arise in many contexts involving
the flow of some type of "fluid", which usually means a gas like air or a liquid
like water. They form in connection with flights of jets, reentry of space
shuttles, and as a result of combustion or explosion, for example. Geometric
optics is a mathematical method that can be used to obtain qualitative
information and make predictions about shocks, which is based on constructing
and analyzing "approximate shocks". In the past there has been uncertainty about
whether the approximate shocks really behave like the exact physical shocks. Our
work aims to understand precisely when the approximate shocks are and are not
close to exact shocks.
