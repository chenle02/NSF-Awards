Odors are complex mixtures of substances. It is difficult to predict behavioral
or physiological responses to odor mixtures from the responses to the individual
componentsof the mixtures. Mixtures are often significantly less stimulatory
than predicted, a phenomenon called mixture suppression. This is at least partly
due to poorly understood interactions that occur when multiple odorants activate
the olfactory pathway simultaneously. This project addresses this problem by
considering several possible mechanisms in mixture suppression: namely, mutually
interfering mechanisms of transduction by the receptors and inhibitory synaptic
connections in the olfactory part of the central nervous system. The research
animal is the spiny lobster, in which it is known that receptor and central
events both contribute to mixture suppression in olfaction. Electrophysiological
methods are used to determine if different odor components activate opposing
transduction processes inreceptor cells. Similar methods as well as cell
staining and special techniques to localize the various substances by which
nerve cells communicate with each other are used to identify inhibitory cells in
the central nervous system and their connections in its olfactory areas. Mixture
suppression provides a specific context in which to interpret the role of these
inhibitions in recognizing odor quality. Since basic molecular and cellular
processes tend to be conserved in evolution, the results can be expected to
contribute to the general understanding of how complex odors are recognized in
animals other than lobsters, including humans.
