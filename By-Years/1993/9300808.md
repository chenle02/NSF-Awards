In this research project, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
Program, Professor Grassian will study the photodissociation and photodesorption
of adsorbates from oxide supported metal particles, using both tunable pulsed
laser and broadband light sources. Infrared and mass spectrometry will be used
to monitor the reactions of methyl halides and CO adsorbed on Pt/SiO2 and
Pt/Al2O3 surfaces. The results of this research will help researchers to
understand the dynamics of surface photochemistry. Measurements on high surface
area supported particles will be compared with results obtained for similar
systems on single crystal metal surfaces in ultra high vacuum. %%% The
interaction of light with catalytic systems may be an important route to the
catalytic synthesis of novel molecular species. In order to investigate the
possibility and promise of photocatalysis, a detailed understanding of
photoinitiated chemistry on highly dispersed oxide supported metal particles
must be obtained. This research project addresses the fundamental questions
underlying photocatalytic processes.
