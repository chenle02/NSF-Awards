This action would commit continued funding for the Cornell Electron Storage
Ring (CESR) for the period 1 November, 1990 through 31 October, 1993. The funds
would be used to support the operation of the CESR facility for research in
elementary particle physics (and for parasitic use for synchrotron radiation
research), experimental physics research by Cornell faculty and staff at CESR,
improvement of the capabilities of CESR to deliver more luminosity, operation of
the computing facility at CESR, provision of a support environment for
collaborators, and accelerator physics research and development. The staff
includes 18 faculty, 22 Research Associates, 18 graduate students and 69
Technical Support personnel. About 20 Cornell undergraduates (plus
undergraduates from collaborating institutions) are associated with the project
during the course of a year.
