The top quark is by far the heaviest of the six types of quarks we know to
exist. Since it is so heavy, it can currently only be produced at the Fermilab
Tevatron. The PI is a leader in the efforts to understand the decays of the top
quark. This research program will allow him to continue his focus on studying
the decays of this particle, and will enable him to work on upgrading the CDF
detector so that a much higher statistics sample of top quark decays can be
accumulated. This will allow the Standard Model to be probed in a new energy
region and may reveal new physics. In addition, the PI is working on a project
to use Java to set up a series of interactive physics demonstrations on the
World Wide Web.
