This is an award to provide renewal support for research that was conducted
under NSF Grant No. 85-14832 results of which established the surface rate
corrosion constants and effective diffusion coefficients for several types of
marble when exposed to concentrated levels of sulfur dioxide in air. The
objective of this renewal project is to continue a study of the conditions under
which marble deteriorates when subjected to sulfurous and nitrogenous
atmospheric pollutants, both categories of which are produced by combustion of
fossil fuels. The investigator is determining the composition of crusts formed
on marble exposed to air pollutants under laboratory conditions and comparing
them with natural crusts obtained from locations in the U.S. that are subjected
to high levels of atmospheric pollution. This research is likely to lead to a
better understanding than now exists of the role played by air pollutants in
accelerating the deterioration of materials and structures that are exposed to
air pollutants. This knowledge is likely to be applied in engineering design for
minimizing the effects of air pollutants on structures that are subjected to air
pollutants from combustion processes and to establish the value of pollution
abatement measures in comparison with the cost of structural deterioration from
exposure to air pollutants.
