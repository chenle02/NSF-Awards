The central theme of this project is the creation of a computer laboratory in
which students will do exercises, projects, and experiments designed to
strengthen and deepen their understanding of concepts of linear algebra and
vector calculus. An increased emphasis on numerical and graphical techniques
will build upon students' recent experiences in single-variable calculus. A
laboratory-enhanced Linear Algebra/Vector Calculus sequence will benefit
students by: (1) making them active learners of the material instead of passive
listeners, (2) encouraging cooperative learning, (3) placing more emphasis on
writing, (4) empowering students to use computers as natural tools for
visualizing and exploring mathematical ideas, (5) strengthening the connection
between Linear Algebra and Vector Calculus, and (6) introducing realistic
applications. The PC-Lab contains 20 networked Pentium PC's and supporting
devices. The primary software is MATLAB and the Symbolic Math Toolbox.
