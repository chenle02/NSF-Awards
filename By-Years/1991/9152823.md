This project is providing specialized optical analysis equipment for use by
advanced optics students at the University of Rochester Institute of
Optics.Optical fabrication technology relies upon the unique skills of master
opticians for the production of specialized optics. Small, ultra-thin crystal
windows, glass prisms with sharp edges, aspheric germanium lenses or optically-
contacted elements are made to sub-micron tolerances by these craftsmen, who
traditionally have learned their techniques in extensive apprentice programs at
trade schools in Eastern Europe.The hands-on fundamentals of optical fabrication
are being passed on to undergraduates by two master opticians at the University
of Rochester in a laboratory course initiated by the principal investigator
three years ago. Projects take students through glass melting, casting,
annealing, and into hand fabrication of precision lenses, flats, and prisms.
Students and their employers find this course to be valuable, because it teaches
just how costly it can be to improperly tolerance optical elements when
designing products.With the non-contacting surface profiler and phase- shifting
interferometer acquired through this project, students are being trained to use
modern instrumentation for studying fabrication issues ranging from sub-surface
damage to optical inhomogeneity created by stirring of the glass melt. This new
instrumentation is comparable to that currently found in most industrial
laboratories and quality-assurance departments.NSF grant funds are being matched
with funds from non-federal sources.
