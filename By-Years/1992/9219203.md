Vicillin (or 7S) seed storage protein genes are expressed specifically in the
apical and central regions (cotyledons, shoot apical meristem and hypocotyl) of
dicot plant embryos after the periods of cell division and morphogenesis. THey
are good markers for the late stage of cotyledon maturation. Necessary and
sufficient information for apical expression in transgenic tobacco embryos is
contained within a fragment of DNA (UAS1, -295 to -109) from a bean 7S gene
(B-phaseolin). We have used electrophoretic mobility shift assays and
methylation interference to identify UAS1 nucleotide motifs which are directly
contacted by bean nuclear protein(s) in vitro. In order to understand how the
UAS2 element regulates gene activation during development we are cloning cDNA
sequences that code for UAS1 binding proteins. We will complete cloning of cDNA
sequences coding for bean nuclear protein(s) that bind to the Vb1 and Vb2
segments of the seed-specific enhancer. We will also study the interactions
between individual protein factors and their target sites on the DNA and how
they affect spatial regulation of gene transcription in tobacco plants. %%% The
rational design of improved agricultural crops regquires targeting novel gene
activities to specific plant tissues and organs. In order to accomplish that
economically important goal, a thorough understanding of the factors that
regulate plant development must be achieved. These studies on the interaction
between specific DNA sequences and nuclear regulatory proteins leading to
developmentally controlled and tissue specific gene expression will enhance our
understanding of those mechanisms.
