9406030 Selverstone Considerable progress has been made in understanding
proterozoic terrane assembly in Wyoming and New Mexico, however an important
spatial gap in information prevents on overall synthesis. This project in
focused on exposures in the Big Thompson River area, Colorado where an unusually
good opportunity exists to obtain pressure-temperature-time information by
virtue of variable metamorphic grade and suitable lithology. Results should
provide a more comprehensive account of the processes involved in the assembly
of crustal blocks and their addition to cratonic North America.
