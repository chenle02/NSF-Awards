Modern society is increasingly reliant on large scale, distributed,
interconnected, and complex systems, such as the Internet, smart grids,
intelligent buildings or highways. Furthermore, much of the information now
being generated is also interconnected in complex ways (e.g., the Web). While
these systems and datasets can be monitored by recording relevant data, the
volumes of such data make it difficult to address critical tasks, such as
anomaly detection, in a timely manner. These datasets often exhibit a natural
graph structure, with graph nodes representing measurements or information
(e.g., the temperature of a sensor or data from a web page), and graph edges
representing the relationships between nodes (e.g., distance between sensors or
links between webpages). This project develops novel methods for sampling of
very large scale graph datasets, with the goal of making it possible to measure
only a small fraction of carefully selected nodes, while preserving the ability
to analyze the whole system. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sampling theory is a major
element of signal processing theory and applications, but has only recently been
considered for graph signals. While recent progress has been made under the
assumption that the graph is fully known, these techniques are prohibitively
expensive for practical datasets of interest. This project addresses fundamental
questions for the challenging problem of sampling when only partial graph
information is available (e.g., decisions based on smaller subsets of connected
nodes). For example, given local graph connectivity information and assumptions
about the graph signals of interest, such as their frequency localization, the
goal is to identify the best set of vertices to sample locally in order to
obtain a reliable estimate of the corresponding global graph signals.
