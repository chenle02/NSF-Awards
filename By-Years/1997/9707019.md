9707019 Pinsky This award provides funds to partially support the Midwest
Probability Colloquium. This meeting is held annually at Northwestern University
during the month of October. The Principal Speaker gives a series of two
connected lectures, while two Hour Speakers give one talk each. The colloquium
serves also as a regular meeting ground for 75-100 probabilists from the greater
midwest area, and allows graduate students and other young investigators a
chance to interact scientifically with specialists of similar interests.
