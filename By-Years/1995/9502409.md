9502409 Lusk This CAREER type grant will combine theory and experiment to study
the influence of applied strain on the morphology of mechanically induced phase
inclusions. The modelling effort will be a continuum one which includes the role
surface effects on phase transformations. In the experimental component of the
project, single crystals of CU-Al-Ni will be subjected to a bending moment and
the role of the loading history on interface movement will be observed. The
educational plan will emphasize open ended design problems which combine
interdisciplinary training, computational modeling and multi-tier research. ***
