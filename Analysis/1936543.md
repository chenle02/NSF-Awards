This award provides funding for US participation in the conference "Midwestern
Workshop in Asymptotic Analysis" that will be held October 4-6, 2019 at Purdue
University Fort Wayne. The conference focuses on recent developments in
analysis, especially in the areas of applied analysis, approximation theory,
potential theory, and complex analysis.

A number of distinguished mathematicians have agreed to participate in this
conference. This award gives early-career researchers, members of
underrepresented groups, and others an opportunity to participate in the
conference. The organizing committee will strive to advertise this widely
through a number of different activities. More information will be made
available at http://mwaa.math.iupui.edu/.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
