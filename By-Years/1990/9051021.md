This project enables undergraduate computer engineering and electrical
engineering students to perform far more realistically scaled digital control
systems experiments. Using TMS-320 Digital Signal Processing (DSP) workstations
makes it possible to practice the design of digital control of very wide
bandwidth dc servo systems utilizing high sampling rates. This is crucial to the
experimental study of sophisticated control systems. The TMS-320 hardware will
be utilized for control system implementation as well as for senior projects.
The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal investigator's
institution.
