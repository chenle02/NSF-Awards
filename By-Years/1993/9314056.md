9314056 Amer Motivated in particular by multimedia applications, a Partial Order
Connection (POC) service/protocol is proposed for end-to-end communication.
Unlike classic transport services that deliver objects either in the exact order
transmitted or according to no particular order, POC provides a service that
requires some, but not all objects to be received in the order transmitted. Two
versions of POC are proposed: reliable, which requires that all transmitted
objects are eventually delivered, and unreliable, which permits the service to
control the loss of a subset of the objects. In the unreliable version, objects
are more finely categorized into one of three reliability classes depending on
their temporal value. Further understanding of POC is accomplished by using
Estelle (ISO Standard 9074) and Estelle development tools to formally specify a
protocol that provides POC service. The expected performance gains of a POC
service will be studied both analytically and with an OPNET simulation. To be
studied are the expected memory/bandwidth/delay performance improvements using
POC when compared with an ordered service for various combinations of: (1)
different partial orders and loss tolerances, (2) different distributions of
disorder and loss supplied by the underlying service and (3) different sized
sender-receiver buffers. ***
