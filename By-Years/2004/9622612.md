9622612 Fussell This project will integrate three types of machining models:
geometric models for determining chip loads, mechanistic models for predicting
forces and deflections from chip loads, and inverse mechanistic models to find
the feedrate needed for a specified force or surface finish. The technical
approach will use a variable mesh Z-buffer to determine chip loads, both
volumetric centroid and discrete volumetric centroid mechanistic models to
predict milling forces and cutter deflection, and will develop numerical
techniques that determine a feedrate to maintain a specified deflection and
surface finish limits. These are the modeling elements needed to automatically
select feedrates when machining contoured surfaces. Using these predicated
feedrates, experiments will be conducted at Turbocam, a firm that will provide
time on a five-axis machining center. Results of this research, which include
modeling, computation and experiment, will be a feedrate optimization method
that is computationally efficient, so as to be transferable to industry,
allowing improved productivity and workpiece quality in complex multi-axis
Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machining.
