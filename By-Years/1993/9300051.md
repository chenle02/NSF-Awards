This award provides funds to the College of Biological Sciences are the
University of Minnesota to continue a successful REU Site. Each summer, 10
undergraduate students will be selected from a pool of 500-700 applicants to
spend ten weeks completing an independent research project under the direction
of one of the 27 faculty mentors affiliated with the program. At least half of
the participants will be students of color and at least half will be from
institutions other than the University of Minnesota. mentors in this program are
basic scientists who have a common interest in research using Recombinant DNA
technology. The students' research experience will be supplemented by weekly
student seminars and a concurrent mini-course in Molecular Biology. The course
will cover basic principles of prokaryotic and eukaryotic gene regulation and
will provide students with the most current information on specific topics as
well as background terminology and concepts. All students will prepare a summary
of their research project in the form of a display for a poster session at the
conclusion of the program.
