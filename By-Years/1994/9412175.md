9412175 Manley A program of electromagnetic nuclear physics will be carried out
at the MIT/Bates, SLAC, and CEBAF laboratories. Principal focus will be on
measurement of the neutron charge form factor. A measurement of the spin
structure of the neutron and proton will be carried out at SLAC. In addition, a
program of studying nucleon resonances will be initiated at the CEBAF lab. All
these measurements will provide important constraints on the quark sub-
structure of nucleons. Lastly, a series of nuclear structure measurements at
other labs will be brought to completion. ***
