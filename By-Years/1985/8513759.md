The project will identify and critically appraise the concepts and methods of
measurement and evaluation in planning and management of water resources
developed by the social and behavioral sciences, with a major emphasis on
bridging the gap between the engineering/physical sciences and the
social/behavioral sciences. Two documents will be prepared: first, a review and
assessment; second, specific papers prepared and presented at a national
conference, to be held in October of 1986, that will illustrate the topics
presented in the first monograph. A steering committee broadly representative of
the disciplines concerned with water resources management issues will be
responsible for the preparation of the first document, the organization of the
conference, and the preparation of the proceedings of the conference. The final
product will be an assessment and illustration of what has been accomplished and
implemented, and an identification of future research needs in water resources
management.
