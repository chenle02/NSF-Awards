Semiconductor manufacturing technologies now enable the placement of up to 50
million devices on one die, and allow clock speeds to approach the GHz range.
These advances, however, are accompanied by larger yield losses (both
catastrophic and parametric) and lower reliability. This project is on the
development of techniques for improved yield-reliability estimation and
enhancement. These techniques include hierarchical yield estimation and
enhancement, minimum perturbation approach for yield and reliability enhancement
and new methods for crosstalk and electromigration minimization. The tradeoffs
among yield, reliability and other optimization goals such as speed and area,
are being investigated as well. This research emphasizes the integration of the
yield and reliability enhancement objectives with the primary goals of
performance and area, while keeping design data volumes manageable. A major
focus of the project is on proving the advantages of the new techniques by
implementing and integrating them into existing design frameworks.
