Many difficult problems require the analysis of a large number of subproblems
and the subsequent combining of the results to form an overall solution. The
quality of the solution depends both on how well and how fast this analysis is
done. A fast and effective method for performing such analyses in the domain of
chess has been described and a prototype implemented in the Hitech chess
machine. Hitech, which has surpassed all previous efforts in computer chess by
more than 150 rating points, has demonstrated the power of this method in a
limited problem domain. However, there remains the open question about the
applicability of this evaluation method to other problem areas. The focus of
this research is to better understand the power and generality of this
architecture with respect to other problems in Artificial Intelligence and on
its development of the tools with which new instances of this hardware can be
built for other problems. The first goal is being pursued by performing case
studies in a number of promising problem areas and proposing solutions based on
this architecture. At the same time a general evaluation chip is being designed
and implemented that will be targeted for Hitech, but will include the features
common to any evaluation chip. The second phase of the research is taking a
solution proposed in one of the case studies and constructing a prototype using
the tools developed during the design of the first evaluation chip. The project
focuses on generalizing a problem solution approach found effective in one
problem area to a broader class of problems and evaluating its effectiveness in
these new areas. The approach combines this powerful solution approach with
modern VLSI technology to produce a unique problem solution capability.
