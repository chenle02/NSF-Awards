This project aims at studying imaging and inverse problems where nonlinear
effects in physics play significant roles. Nonlinear physics could either help
us image objects that could not be imaged with only linear physics or prevent us
from imaging objects that we would have been able to image in the absence of
such nonlinear effects. In either case, understanding the impact of such
nonlinear effects would help us improve the quality of the underlying imaging
modalities. The goal of the project is to perform detailed mathematical and
numerical analysis to characterize the effects of nonlinearity on image
reconstructions in such cases.

The main research efforts in this project include, but are not limited to: (i)
developing efficient reconstruction algorithms for imaging through nonlinear
dispersive media; (ii) developing mathematical theory and computational methods
for imaging two-photon absorption and second harmonic generation in optics; and
(iii) analyzing quantitative photoacoustics with nonlinear absorption and
developing corresponding computational image reconstruction algorithms. The
mathematical ideas developed in this project are expected to provide insights on
future studies of similar imaging and inverse problems related to nonlinear
partial differential equations. The research is also expected to have impact on
the development of practically useful methods for imaging through nonlinear
media as well as imaging nonlinear physical properties of given media. This
project involves an integrated educational component that aims at training
advanced undergraduate, master and PhD students.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
