One of the most tragic results of current conflicts is the deliberate targeting
of civilians. Not only is this practice violative of the civilian immunity norm,
one of the pillars of international humanitarian law, it also contradicts
popular opinion about appropriate behavior during armed conflict. Despite the
reaction to such acts, this practice continues. Scholars and policymakers have
made inquiries into the reasons for the deliberate targeting of civilians during
armed conflict. Many suggest such violations occur for utilitarian reasons or
ignorance of international legal obligations. However, many of these studies
suffer from a common flaw: they assume a consensus exists on the composition of
legitimate and illegitimate targets. This study takes this assumption as its
starting point: does a consensus on the distinction principle contained within
the civilian immunity norm exist? Utilizing a variety of qualitative methods
(including conducting interviews with former belligerents and humanitarian
practitioners and case studies), this study compares established theoretical
frameworks, such as norm noncompliance and norm diffusion, against an emerging
theoretical framework, norm contestation, to determine which has the strongest
explanatory effect regarding deliberate civilian targeting.
