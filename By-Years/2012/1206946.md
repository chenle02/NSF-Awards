The PI intends to study two basic problems about the large-scale geometry of
arithmetic groups: classical arithmetic groups such as SL(n,Z), S-arithmetic
groups such as SL(n,Z[1/p]), and function-field-arithmetic groups such as
SL(n,F[t]) where F is a finite field. The first problem is to identify the Dehn
functions and higher dimensional isoperimetric functions for arithmetic groups.
The second is to determine that the cohomology of non-cocompact function-field-
arithmetic groups is virtually infinitely generated in the dimension given by
the geometric rank of the arithmetic group. The PI also plans to investigate
basic open questions for universal lattices - such as SL(n,Z[t]) - and solvable
arithmetic groups concerning finiteness properties and word metrics. An
investigation of which lattices on CAT(0) complexes are finitely generated is
also planned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Matrices are arrays of numbers. The study of
the arithmetic governing the behavior of matrices - a study that mathematics,
the physical sciences, and the social sciences have benefited from greatly - is
the central focus of the proposed research for this award. The PI proposes to
continue the mathematical tradition of bundling the equations that represent the
algebra of matrices into a single geometric theory, thus allowing techniques
from geometry to deepen our understanding of algebra.
