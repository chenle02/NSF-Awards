This award will provide participant support for US graduate students to
participate in the International School of Cosmic Ray Astrophysics in 2012 to be
held on July 4-10, 2012 in Erice, Sicily, Italy. The theme of the Course is "A
New Era in Particle Astrophysics." It will present the new experiments, new
experimental results and the current understanding of them. The course will
emphasize the multi-messenger approach to astrophysics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For
Broader Impacts, it has a particular focus on early career scientists and
graduate students. This summer school is important in the education of such
young scientists not only because of the lectures they listen to, but also
because during the School they directly communicate with the older experienced
scientists who are the lecturers.
