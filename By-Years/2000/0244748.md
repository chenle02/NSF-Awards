This project, which combines research in physical chemistry, molecular physics,
and learning algorithm development, focuses on the exploration of coherent
control of small polyatomic molecular systems. The specific aims of the project
are to understand the relationship between coherent vibrational motion and
neutral molecular dissociation, and to explore mechanisms for controlling
fragmentation channels in laser assisted neutral dissociation using shaped
ultrafast optical pulses. One of the key elements of the project is
understanding the results of control experiments that make use of feedback and
learning algorithms to discover optimal laser pulses shapes for steering a
molecule toward a desired reaction pathway. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a broader
sense, the research has significant implications for chemical vapor deposition
(CVD), as the research to be carried out will provide new techniques with
potential as a new source in CVD, together with basic information about chemical
processes essential to CVD. The work lies at the boundary between chemistry and
physics and furthers understanding in terms of both quantum and classical
physics as well as frequency and time domains. Students working on the projects
will learn to work in an interdisciplinary environment and understand their
observations from a variety of perspectives. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
is co-funded by the Divisions of Physics and Chemistry in the Mathematical and
Physical Sciences Directorate.&lt;br/&gt;
