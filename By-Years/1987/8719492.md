The main results of the PI's work to date are the design and implementation of a
novel axiomatic, non-procedural language called S*M for the functional
specification of firmware and computer architectures. The implementation of S*M
consists of a compiler, a simulator, and a user interface running on VAX 11/780
UNIXTM environment. S*M has been used extensively to specify the behavior of,
and reason about, firmware and architectures and, consequently, considerable
understanding of its strengths and limitations has been gained. The features of
the language have also made it sufficiently attractive for S*M to have
influenced research projects in Colorado State University (firmware
engineering), University of Guelph, Ontario, Canada (design automation), and the
Technical University of Aachen, West Germany (formal development of
multiprocessor designs). The project continues this work by identifying the
basic mathematical laws of S*M. These laws will take the form "P = Q" where, P,
Q, are S*M constructs and will mean that, functionally and behaviorally, "P is
the same as Q". Thus, given an occurrence of P in an S*M description, one can
transform or replace P by the equivalent Q. These mathematical laws will be such
that: (i) All correct specifications in S*M must obey these laws. (ii) A correct
S*M specification may be transformed into a equivalent (possibly more concise or
more efficient) specification by applying these laws.
