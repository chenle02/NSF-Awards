This grant supports an investigation of the solar wind with the terrestrial
magnetosphere using ground-based magnetic records from the turn of the century
to the present in conjunction with interplanetary measurements when available.
This study will examine the control by the interplanetary magnetic field of
geomagnetic activity, the response of the magnetosphere to the blockage of the
solar wind by comet Halley in 1910; the response of the magnetosphere to rapid
reductions of the momentum flux in the solar wind, the deceleration of
interplanetary shocks near 1 AU, the statistical properties of geomagnetic
storms and the quantification of substorm magnitudes. The study will employ the
collections of the World Data Center A including those on their newly produce
CDROM and the data collected during the International Magnetospheric Study
(IMS). In addition to aiding our understanding of the coupling of the solar wind
and the Earth's magnetosphere, and its variation over the last century, this
study will help test the accuracy of the CDROM and IMS data sets and aid in the
correction of those data.
