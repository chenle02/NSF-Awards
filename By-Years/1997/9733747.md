DMI-9733747 Twomey Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) require large numbers of
observations to ensure good generalization, and a large number of independent
observations (or data) to evaluate the networks generalization performance. ANN
are potentially one of the most important data processing technologies in a
truly intelligent system for the monitoring and control of manufacturing
processes. However, manufacturers are often reluctant, if not resistant, to use
an ANN approach because of the associated costs of user expertise, long
development times, and the need for large amounts of training data. Very little
research has been performed on evaluation methods, and the problems of training
and evaluation concurrently, when data is sparse, have been overlooked. The
research objective of this CAREER project is to develop an ANN training and
evaluation strategy for manufacturing situations where data is sparse. The
approach in the project seeks the simultaneous use of sparse data for both
network training and evaluation. The results of this research will be applied to
two manufacturing processes: drilling and electrochemical machining. The
utilization of ANN and other information processing technologies will be
developed into courses for the undergraduate curriculum. The research will
increase the utility of ANN through the development of an ANN training and
validation strategy in cases where data is sparse. Together with the development
of curriculum in information processing, the project will provide a means for
attracting talented students to careers in research, and will embody practices
that encourage women and ethnic minorities to see themselves as tomorrow's
engineers.
