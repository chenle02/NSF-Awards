The proposed research will use molecular genetic variation among modern humans
to learn about the demographic history of our species. This will involve three
steps: (1) collect a world-wide sample of human mitochondrial and nuclear DNA,
(2) score the individuals in this sample for a large number genetic
polymorphisms, and (3) refine the statistical methods used in analysis of such
data. The pilot project proposed here will complete work on step 1, but will
only begin work on steps 2 and 3.
