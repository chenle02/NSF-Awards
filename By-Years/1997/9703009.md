This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project, supported in the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, aims to use state- of-the-art scanning
probe techniques to study the dynamics of ion channel conformation changes at
the single protein level. Professor Dunn and his students at the University of
Kansas will use near-field scanning optical microscopy, atomic force microscopy
and confocal microscopy to study the mechanism of action of ion channels to
better understand a broad range of neurophysiological processes. Undergraduate
and graduate students will be introduced to and involved in the work supported
by the CAREER research project both in the laboratory and in the classroom. The
understanding of neurological processes that occur at ion channels in membranes
has been limited by the lack of methods to see these processes while they occur.
Professor Dunn will use newly developed methods to observe these reactions in
real time at the single molecule level. The insights provided by this work have
potential impact in understanding a broad range of neurochemical areas. The
research and educational objectives of this CAREER proposal will have high
pedagogical impact due to the application of state-of-the-art methods to the
study of these problems.
