Nanofluids, typically consisting of a base liquid containing nanometer-sized
particles for enhancing the liquid's thermal conductivity, have been proposed
for application in heat transfer systems, such as the heat exchangers in
electronic packaging. The limited experimental data presently available clearly
indicate the potential to dramatically increase the effective thermal
conductivity of the fluid, which is promising for enhancing heat transfer. A
comprehensive fundamental understanding of transport in such nanofluids,
including information on both their thermal conductivity and viscosity, is
however lacking. This project involves a collaborative effort between Arizona
State University and the Intel Corporation aimed to improve our fundamental
understanding of nanofluids, including an understanding of how they can be
applied in macroscale and microscale heat exchangers. A variety of experiments
are proposed, including the measurement of the static thermal conductivity and
viscosity of various nanofluids, a novel measurement of the flow thermal
conductivity under controlled strain-rate conditions, a characterization of the
nanofluid morphology using quasielastic light scattering (QELS), and finally
heat transfer and pressure drop measurements of nanofluids applied in mm-sized
tubes and in microchannel heat sinks. Predictive models for the properties will
be developed, and these constitutive relations will be applied to a general
simulation of the performance of macroscale and microscale heat exchangers, to
enable the prediction of the performance of such heat exchangers in the future
that utilize nanofluids. The award has been funded by the Thermal Transport and
Thermal Processing Program of the Chemical and Transport Systems Division, with
cooperation from the GOALI Program.
