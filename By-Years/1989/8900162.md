This is an award to partially support a Conference on Video Microscopy, to be
held June 4-7, 1989 at Chapel Hill, North Carolina. The field of Video
Microscopy is currently in a dramatic growth phase, in terms of both technical
advances and biological applications. This newly-developing technology is
expected to lead to major advances in our understanding of structure and dynamic
processes in the living cell.
