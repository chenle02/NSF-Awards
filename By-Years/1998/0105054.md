This research addresses the roles of direct organic nitrogen (N) uptake in
higher plant nutrition and terrestrial ecosystem nutrient cycling. It is
hypothesized that plant use of organic N, particularly free amino acids (AA), is
more prevalent in terrestrial ecosystems than currently perceived. Although the
extent of AA uptake may depend on a variety of soil and plant factors, AA uptake
may act as a general mechanism of plant N acquisition along with mineral N
uptake. The research will use stable isotope labeling techniques in field and
greenhouse experiments to investigate the generality of AA uptake, and to
quantify the contribution of directly acquired external AA to plant productivity
and nitrogen cycling for four contrasting ecosystems in the Southeast USA. This
research will investigate AA uptake by plants growing in situ in temperate
terrestrial ecosystems, and the ecological implications of AA uptake in these
ecosystems.
