The Cognitive Science Department at UCSD is developing a new program of
training with the goal of unifying research in brain science, behavioral
studies, and computational theories and models. Although still in the early
stages of development, the program already shows real promise. The advanced
graduate students are producing insightful and publishable papers that cut
across these disciplines. The program's three years of experience leads to
confidence that the multidisciplinary approach to the study of cognition will
significantly enrich our understanding of the biological and computational bases
of cognition. These traineeships will enhance the educational experience of
students by permitting them undistracted time and energy to attend to the
rigorous coursework and experimental research required by this new discipline.
The goal of this grant is to attract intellectually diverse and multiply-
equipped students, with special attention to minorities, women, and others who
have been under-represented.
