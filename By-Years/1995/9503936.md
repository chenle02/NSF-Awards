9503936 Beckham The Georgia Institute of Technology will acquire a multinuclear
solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer. The instrument will
support and significantly enhance the research efforts of five promary
investigators in the fields of polymers, fibers, ceramics, and inorganic
materials. Four of the investigators (Abhiraman, Beckham, Rees, and Tolbert)
represent four separate academic units within Georgia Tech (Chemical
Engineering, Textile & Fiber Engineering, Materials Science & Engineering,
Chemistry & Biochemistry), while the fifth (Mariam) is from Clark-Atlanta
University, an institution closely allied with Georgia Tech both professionally
and geographically. The common thread connecting all five investigators is the
production of macromolecular solids: Such materials are being either improved or
prepared de novo. Advanced experimental NMR applied to relevant problems of
materials improvement and development represents the major theme of these
interdisciplinary groups. The purchase of this 400-Mhz solid-state NMR
spectrometer with 9.4-Telsa wide-bore magnet, will have significant impact on
materials research and education programs at Georgia Tech and Clark-Atlanta
University. ***
