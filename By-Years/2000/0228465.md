The investigators will acquire high spectral resolution data from Balmer alpha
and Balmer beta hydrogen emissions to determine hydrogen density profiles,
fluxes, and effective temperatures in the upper atmosphere. The work is aimed at
resolving long-standing observational difficulties in measuring the faint
geocoronal emission lines in the night sky. The measurements will be obtained
with a high-sensitivity Fabry-Perot interferometer, applying precise methods for
obtaining accurate calibration of wavelengths and instrumental profiles, and for
correcting for galactic background emissions and atmospheric transmission
effects. The measurements will be combined with models to achieve a better
understanding of the hydrogen geocorona which influences the chemistry of the
upper atmosphere and is linked to long-term variations due to global change.
