Professor Bruce Berne is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to perform theoretical studies of solutions.
Berne will study solvent effects on chemical reaction dynamics, solvation and
spectra, energy transfer and transport in classical and quantum many-body
systems through a combination of analytical and numerical techniques. The
numerical work will involve molecular dynamics, Monte Carlo, quantum Monte
Carlo, and quantum chemistry. He will attempt to incorporate many-body
dispersion and electrical induction forces by treating the full coulomb
interaction between dispersion oscillators on atomic or extended atomic sites. A
special focus will be on the development and application of analytical and new
computer simulation techniques to treat the problem of multiple time scales and
long range forces. Berne will attempt to incorporate quantum chemistry into his
molecular dynamics codes so that the charges and forces governing the dynamics
are computed quantum chemically on the fly. %%% Since most chemical reactions
occur in solution, it is important for chemists to have a complete understanding
of solute-solvent interactions at the molecular level. Computer simulations
provide an excellent method for examining the effects of these interactions on
chemical reaction dynamics, observed spectra, and transport properties.
Professor Berne's research efforts are directed at the development of new
computational algorithms which enhance the capability and reliability of such
computer simulations.
