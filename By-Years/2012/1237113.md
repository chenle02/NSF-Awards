This Innovation Corps project proposes a technology that will focus on reducing
the time, cost and effort, and on extending the capability, associated with
machining of primarily but not limited to semiconductors and ceramics such as
silicon, silicon carbide, sapphire, and others. The proposed technology (Micro
Laser Assisted Machining) benefits the manufacture of challenging materials that
are hard and brittle. The 50% decrease in material hardness during the Micro
Laser Assisted Machining process can be directly correlated to the improved tool
life and doubling of machining productivity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful,
this innovation will eventually result in entirely new capabilities relative to
production of materials and products currently not viable or achievable due to
processing or use-limitations. Potential applications to emerging technologies,
such as turbines and plug-in electric vehicles, where advanced high power and
high temperature operation of devices is required, such as IGBTs, may prove to
be compatible with the micro laser assisted machining processing technology,
possibly resulting in reduced overall manufacturing costs and improved quality.
