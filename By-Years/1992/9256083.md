Gallaudet University will initiate a four-week, residential, Young Scholars
project with an MSTP component in biology, chemistry, and physics for 30
students entering the 9th, 10th, and 11th grades and 6 high school teachers.
This summer program for deaf students will emphasize working in research teams
using the theme of the human body. Each research team will rotate through each
of the three science areas seeing how each science contributes to the study of
the human body in a different way and at the same time seeing how the sciences
are related to each other.
