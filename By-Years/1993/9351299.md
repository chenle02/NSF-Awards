A Computer Modeling Facility The project will purchase computer equipment to
develop a facility for molecular modeling. The facility will encompass all
levels of the instructional program, and touch all students passing through the
chemistry curriculum. This comprehensive use of computational chemistry is a
major new level of undergraduate molecular modeling. Students will use the
facility in laboratory, lecture and research aspects of their instructional
sequence.
