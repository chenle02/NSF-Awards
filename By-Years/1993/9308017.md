9308017 FARSOUN This project is a sociological study of the Israeli military
court system. It will focus on how authority and resistance in the occupied
territories interact in the court system. Data will be collected on the network
of relations among the various categories of participants (Israelis and
Palestinians), and on Israeli legal discourse about the occupation which
provides the justification for Israeli legal authority. The study will cover
three main topic areas. First, the investigator will conduct an ethnography of
the roles, practices and relations of the Israeli and Palestinian participants.
Second, the investigator will analyze the controversy over the military court
system's legitimacy from the perspectives of the participants, especially the
interaction between authority and resistance as it is negotiated in practice.
Third, the investigator will conduct a sociological analysis of Israeli legal
culture as it relates to the debate over the applicability of international law
to Israeli authority over the occupied territories. ***
