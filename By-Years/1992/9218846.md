The P.I.s propose a multi-national project involving Australian, Brazilian and
U.S. geoscientists in a pilot chemical and multi-isotopic study of 3 generations
of mantle derived rocks from the Sao Francisco Craton of Brazil. Komatiites may
be responsible for the very refractory nature of mantle beneath Archean
terrains. Major mafic intrusions often involve the continental lithosphere in
their evolution and, hence, give clues as to the composition and history of the
lithosphere at the time of igneous intrusion. Lamproites and kimberlites
represent small volume melts of incompatible element rich, possibly
lithospheric, mantle. The project involves field-work and sample collecting in
Brazil. Petrographic and elemental analysis of the samples will be done by Dr.
S. Esperanca of Deakin and Monash Universities in Melbourne, Australia. Os and
Nd isotopic analysis at DTM by Dr. Esperanca and the P.I. will then be used to
constrain the age and chemical history of the melts and their implications for
the present composition and formation history of the mantle.
