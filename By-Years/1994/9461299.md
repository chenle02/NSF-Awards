The goal of this project is to design and prototype a dexterous robotic
manipulator (-10 mm in size) for minimally invasive surgery. The robotic
manipulator will provide surgeons with a new and more-dexterous tool for
performing diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. The robotic manipulator have a
wide variety of applications in minimally invasive surgery, including suturing,
dissection, and retraction, in procedures such as removal of the gall bladder
and bowel resection. This robotic technology can also be adapted to arthroscopic
and atheroscopic applications. As the design of the hand is compatible with low-
cost batch fabrication of miniature actuators, it is anticipated that the
disposable robotic manipulator will be cost-competitive with existing minimal
invasive surgical tools.
