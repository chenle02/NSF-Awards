Under the direction of Dr. John Harris, Mr. Michael Rogers will collect data
for his doctoral dissertation. He will conduct archaeological survey and
excavation in the region East of Lake Turkana in Kenya. He will focus his
attention on a geological stratum known as the Okote Member and which dates to
ca. 1.64-1.39 million years ago. Previous work has recovered both stone tools
and associated faunal remains and thus demonstrated that this region was
inhabited by early hominids. However little is known about the behavior of these
early humans. Through a study both of the distribution of different kinds of
lithic remains over space and of their association with faunal remains and each
other, Mr. Rogers should gain insight into how activities were spaced over the
landscape. This research is important for several reasons. First, it will
increase our understanding of the emergence of modern humans. It is clear that
behavior, and behavioral changes have played a major role in the development of
our species yet for the earlier stages of this process, relatively little is
known. Mr. Rogers' research will help to fill this gap. Secondly, this research
will help to develop and refine techniques of archaeological analysis. The
methods Mr. Rogers will use may be applicable in many time periods and many
regions of the world. Finally this grant will help to train an extremely
promising young scientist.
