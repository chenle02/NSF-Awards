The application of promising new resonant structures and modern microwave
technology to EPR studies of problems in materials science, chemistry, physics,
biology, and medicine, is limited by the lack of engineering design data. The
PI's propose to test the quantitative predictions of our theoretical results for
inductive coupling, parallel capacitive coupling, and series capacitive
coupling. Sensitivity of coupling to dimensional and electrical parameters will
be explored. The best designs will be implemented for CW and pulsed S-band and
X- band spectrometers. Primary focus will be on ease of sample change,
returning, and variable temperature operation for samples contained in standard
cylindrical tubes and in solvents of various dielectric constants. A variety of
equipment will be built: A hybrid microwave EPR bridge that will be more
sensitive and cost-effective than present bridges. An electronically tunable LGR
for S-band operation that will improve tunability of the resonator/matching
network. A system in which the preamplifier is cooled along with the resonator
to take advantage of the low noise possible at cryogenic temperature. Design
guidance that will come from the proposed work is urgently needed by many
research groups. The results will enhance the competitiveness of American
spectroscopic measurements.
