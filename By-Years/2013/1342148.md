A workshop will be held to support U.S. scientists who are conducting research
on atmospheric aerosol and cloud interactions to assist with forming a community
consensus on what capabilities and functional requirements might be needed to
assist with the development of a common cyber-based infrastructure for the
geosciences. This workshop is part of a series of geoscience domain end-user
workshops to solicit the needs and requirements from end-user groups of
EarthCube so that those needs and requirements can be addressed in the EarthCube
design and implementation.

EarthCube is a community-driven activity sponsored through a partnership between
the NSF Directorate of Geosciences and Office of Cyberinfrastructure to
transform the conduct of geosciences research and education. EarthCube aims to
create a well-connected and facile environment to share data and knowledge in an
open, transparent, and inclusive manner, thus accelerating the ability of the
geosciences community to understand and predict the Earth system.
