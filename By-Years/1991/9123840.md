This is a small invitational planning workshop on Scientific Collaboration and
Interaction with Remote, Unique Facilities held on the campus of the University
of Michigan on January 21-24, 1992. A major function of the workshop is to bring
together members of the scientific research community who are engaged in
collaborative experimental research using a unique, remote facility, with
technologists and social scientists working on collaborative technology. The
researches are engaged in upper atmospheric and space research utilizing the
Sondre Stromfjord, Greenland Upper Atmospheric Research Facility. The goal of
the workshop is to develop a plan to implement and testbed collaborative tools
to be utilized by scientists engaged in collaborative and observational research
using this facility. Included in these plans are design of a system for
accessing the instruments at this facility from remote locations, such as at the
University of Michigan. It is expected that the output of this workshop will be
a proposal for establishing the experimental testbed for this collaborative
effort.
