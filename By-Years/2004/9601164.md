9601164 Briggs As sessile organisms, plants have evolved the capacity to
respond to a wide range of environmental signals, one of the most important of
which is light. Indeed, virtually every phase of a plant's development is
regulated by its light environment. These collective responses are encompassed
by the term photomorphogenesis. Since Koornneef et al. first described the hy
(long hypocotyl) mutants of Arabidopsis, mutants have been central to
photomorphogenesis research. The present award to study signal transduction in a
blue light-activated system, phototropism, also relies heavily on the use of
mutants. Dr. Brigg's laboratory has recently isolated a number of severe
phototropism mutants in Arabidopsis thaliana designated nph for non-phototropic
hypocotyl. They fall into four complementation groups, nph1-4. All five alleles
of the first group, nph1, are deficient in or lack the phosphoprotein but show
normal gravitropism, and it is the NPH1 gene that is focal point for this
proposal. The working hypothesis is that NPH1 is the gene that encodes the
phosphoprotein. As the weakest allele(nph1-2) shows altered spectral sensitivity
for phototropism, NPH1 may itself be the photoreceptor. This research will
contribute to extending our knowledge about the many ways in which light plays a
role in plant growth and development.
