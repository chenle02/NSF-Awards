Having passion and perseverance for long-term goals or the drive to achieve is
potentially important to individuals trying to achieve the challenging, long-
term goal of attaining an engineering degree, which requires not only talent but
also focused and sustained application over a long period. This project is
investigating the role of active learning in building passion and perseverance
through a longitudinal observational research design. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a
result of their natural progression through the curricula, students have widely
varying experiences along the active-learning continuum, from low quantity and
quality, to high. This highly diverse engineering-learning ecology presents a
unique opportunity to study the association between active learning and the
growth of passion and perseverance. This project is developing a smartphone
application (app) for participants to measure the quantity and quality of active
learning they experience. These data, along with extensive measures of other
psychological traits and student achievement, are elements of a model that will
clarify the relationship between active learning, passion and perseverance
growth, and student achievement. Results from this study potentially will
improve the retention and graduation rates of all STEM students.
