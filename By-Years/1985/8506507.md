A cryostage and digital image processor for a scanning electron microscope is
being purchased. This instrument is being used to view the morphology of
asymmetric polymer membranes and to investigate the single-celled giant
sporangiophore, Phycomyces. The cryostage increases the resolution of the
scanning electron microscope by several-fold and permits the viewing structures
of the order of 20nm without the distortion which may take place when structure
replicas must be made for transmission electron photo micrographs. Results
obtained using this instrument will provide additional confirmation of the
membrane formation model and may contribute to the design of optimally designed
asymmetric membranes for separation purposes. New information on the growth of
single cells also will be forthcoming from the work on Phycomyces.
