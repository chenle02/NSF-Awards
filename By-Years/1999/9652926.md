A virtual-reality laboratory for engineering education will be estab- lished at
North Carolina State University that takes advantage of recent dramatic
reductions in the cost of virtual-reality technology. A unique aspect of the
project is the use of haptic devices that incorporate tactile stimulation into
more traditional multimedia tools. The laboratory, which will be associated with
the Department of Materials Science and Engineering, will be used by
undergraduates to interactively explore complex materials-related topics like
the range and strength of chemical forces. The educational software will be
developed at NCSU in collaboration with the NIH National Center for Research
Resources at UNC-Chapel Hill.
