0429836&lt;br/&gt;Harmony: The Art of Reconciliation&lt;br/&gt;Benjamin C.
Pierce&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to build a generic tool for
reconciling disconnected&lt;br/&gt;updates to heterogeneous, structured,
replicated data -- usable, for&lt;br/&gt;instance, to synchronize bookmark files
from different web browsers&lt;br/&gt;running on multiple
machines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A central theme is bringing ideas from
programming languages to bear on&lt;br/&gt;problems more commonly regarded as
belonging to the purview of databases&lt;br/&gt;or distributed systems. In
particular, a major focus concerns&lt;br/&gt;developing the foundations of "bi-
directional programming languages," in&lt;br/&gt;which every program denotes a
pair of functions -- one for extracting a&lt;br/&gt;view of some complex data
structure, and another for putting back an&lt;br/&gt;updated view into the
original structure. Similarly, the issue of&lt;br/&gt;alignment of information
during reconciliation will be addressed by&lt;br/&gt;focusing on the type
structure of the data being reconciled. This&lt;br/&gt;linguistic perspective
may offer new insights into classical problems in&lt;br/&gt;these areas, such as
the well known "view update problem" in databases.&lt;br/&gt;At the same time,
reconciling complex abstract formats, such as ordered&lt;br/&gt;lists and trees,
brings to fore a number of algorithmic issues&lt;br/&gt;concerning how to
meaningfully weave together disconnected changes
in&lt;br/&gt;replicas.&lt;br/&gt;
