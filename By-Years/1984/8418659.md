Electric step motors are discrete incremental-motions devices that rotate
through small angles in response to drive pulses. They are widely used as
precision mechanisms in electric typewriters, computer printers and plotters,
and small robots and machine tools. Step-motor design is extremely complicated
if all phenomena are accommodated, and thus most step motors are designed by
"cut and try" variation on proved designs. The work to be done under this grant
should yield systematic design and analysis tools that accommodate the major
phenomena affecting step-motor performance while not requiring highly
specialized training or experience.
