IBN-9521484 McEachron, Donald L. Environmental light plays an important role in
the generation of daily rhythms in body temperature and activity. However, the
full spectrum of effects of light are just beginning to be realized. In the
proposed studies the effect of light and variations in light cyclicity on immune
function will be examined. In addition, light is known to manifest many of its
effects by altering the secretion of the hormone, melatonin. The ability of this
important hormone to modulate immune responses will also be investigated. The
proposed studies may prove useful for examining the effect of light on living
organisms. This proposal is appropriate for an SGER award because of the novelty
of the research area. Successful completion of this research will open new
vistas in understanding the interplay between the environment, brain and immune
system. The implications of these studies in seasonal variations in disease
prevention in natural ecosystems is of great significance.
