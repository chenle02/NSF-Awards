The purpose of this project is to prepare undergraduate mechanical engineering
students in the use of contemporary signal processing techniques as part of
their instrumentation laboratory course experience. The students will use a
digital storage oscilloscope, a menu-driven X-Y plotter, and a sweep/function
generator in conjunction with existing laboratory equipment to prototype and
test a variety of signal conditioning and signal processing circuits and
systems. Groups of three students each will perform their investigations in a
video-assisted individualized instruction, multi-stationed undergraduate
laboratory. The new equipment along with existing laboratory equipment and the
innovative video teaching system will offer individualized, hands- on experience
for the students in the use and understanding of modern signal processing. This
experience is most pertinent for engineers using control instrumentation found
in industrial integrated manufacturing systems.
