A variety of stellar dynamical problems which bear on cosmology will be
investigated. A maximum entropy - orbit based galaxy modelling technique will be
used to redetermine mass to light ratios (M/L's) in elliptical galaxies. Methods
will be developed to attempt to resolve whether the velocity dispersion tensor
in ellipticals becomes more tangential with increasing radius, or whether the
ellipticals have massive halos. The dynamics of stellar systems with twisted
isophotes will be explored considering the (neglected) possibility that there
are real internal misalignments of different components. The dynamical
consequences of the recent results indicating very large M/L's in galactic
nuclei will be studied. Previous work on the formation of clusters will be
extended to different cosmologies by treating the dark matter separately from
the galaxies. The purpose of these numerical simulations will be to explore the
separation of dark matter from luminous matter during cluster formation and
evolution, to understand better whether cluster profiles can be used to estimate
the mass density of the Universe, to study the formation of disk galaxies and
the evolution of galaxy mass and luminosity functions, and to attempt to
understand whether subclustering can be used as a cosmological probe.
