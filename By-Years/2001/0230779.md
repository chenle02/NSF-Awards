There exists a need for educational materials that introduce the research
paradigm into science courses for nonmajors. The PIs of this project are
developing curriculum materials for a course that allows students to model the
activities of professional scientists as a means of learning scientific method
and content. These new course materials present student laboratories in the
format of the scientific professional literature, albeit within a carefully
defined context. The information in these papers provides the background
required to allow the students to design and implement their own experiments.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twelve experiments are being transformed into the
scientific literature-presentation format. These are being field tested in
general science classes and refined based on student response. A guidebook to
provide faculty with the tools to carry out similar restructuring of traditional
laboratory exercises into directed inquiry based laboratories is also being
prepared. This guidebook is being evaluated and modified as necessary. The
Internet is being used to make the laboratories and guidebook available to
others.&lt;br/&gt;
