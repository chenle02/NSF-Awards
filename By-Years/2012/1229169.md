The CLEAR-VMI research group seeks support to study the following objectives:
(1) development of a low nitrogen genetically enhanced biomass species for use
as a reduced nutrient emission alternative energy production fuel source; (2)
elemental characterization of low nitrogen biomass species to develop full-scale
emission predictions; (3) real-time laboratory and field level emission analysis
of enhanced biomass species for determination and validation of reduced
atmospheric nitrogen loads; and (4) three-dimensional community multiscale air
quality (CMAQ) modeling of measured biomass emissions to quantify resulting
nitrogen deposition within the Chesapeake Bay. Also, as an educational
component, our group seeks to enhance the professional presentation and
communication skills of our student researchers through an added rhetorical
development objective. Experiments will involve the development of a genetically
modified biomass capable of producing low nitrogen (N) emissions. Through
accelerated stem senescence, the CLEAR group proposes to remobilize N to the
seeds, creating a more nutritious crop yield for consumption and leaving low N
content stems and leaves for use in alternative power and fuel production.
