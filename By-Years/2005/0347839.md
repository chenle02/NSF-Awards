Cryptographic security models are defined in terms of the capabilities of the
adversary, including computational limitations and what access he is allowed to
the system. The security of protocols is then proven with respect to such
adversaries, in a well-defined, rigorous and quantifiable way (typically relying
on some computational hardness assumption). However, traditional models are
often not adequate, especially in light of the widespread use of cryptography
today. Since we cannot predict everything the adversary can do a priori, it is
important to reduce the assumptions about the adversary's (in)capabilities as
much as possible.

Here, we propose to expand the traditional cryptographic foundations so as to
withstand attacks by stronger, more realistic adversaries. In particular, we
challenge the classical assumption that the adversary has no access whatsoever
to the legitimate parties' secret keys. We will study the strongest existing
models, design new models, develop protocols, and explore the limits of what is
possible to achieve, for the following types of attacks:

Chosen ciphertext attack: can we achieve CCA security from any scheme
satisfying only standard semantic security? What are the relations among the
different notions of security for public key encryption?

Tampering attacks: can we achieve security for various cryptographic
applications when the adversary can tamper with the secret key, e.g. through
fault attacks?

Key exposure attacks: can we achieve security when the adversary can obtain the
secret key? how to design and instantiate key evolving schemes with optimal
security and efficiency to limit damage caused by key exposure?

We will seek both positive and negative results in the above areas, in order to
better understand the relevant implications and requirements, and to obtain
optimal solutions.
