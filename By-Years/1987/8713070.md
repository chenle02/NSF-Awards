The PI proposes to continue his investigations into the underlying principles
that govern the dynamic behavior of chemical reactors by studying unsteady state
behavior. His objectives are to gain insight into chemical processes and to use
the results as paradigms with which the understanding of chemical dynamics can
be advanced. He plans to look at two systems: electrochemical and two-phase
processes. The modelling of the dynamics of electrodissolution of metals can
have various forms: one approach is to model the process with ordinary
differential equations derived from surface reactions on the electrode surface
while other models have as an intrinsic property the diffusion through a film on
the electrode surface. The PI plans to look at both types of models and
experimentally determine the best one. He also plans to look at the dynamics of
electrochemical reactions other than metal dissolution such as the
electrochemical catalytic reactions. The dynamics of gas-liquid continuous
chemical reactor systems will also be studied. Reaction occurs in the liquid
phase and one of the reactants, normally oxygen, is absorbed from a gaseous
phase. The PI plans to investigate the effect of reaction on the rate of mass
transfer, and consequently, the interaction of enhanced mass transfer with
oscillatory behavior. Mathematical models will be postulated and then
experimentally verified.
