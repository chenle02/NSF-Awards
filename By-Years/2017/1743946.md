Title: CHESS Workshop on Emerging Frontiers in Biology This workshop will
identify most compelling and significant challenges in biology where x-ray
synchrotron source would provide unique abilities to tackle with such
challenges. Biological sciences encompasses studies of systems from atomistic
resolution to whole cells and organisms with processes covering a wide range of
time and length scales. Deeper understanding of biological processes requires
development of complementary techniques to provide a multiscale
interdisciplinary approach. This workshop is designed to develop broader outlook
in the application of high-energy x-rays to challenging biological problems and
to facilitate wider involvement in biological community in such studies.
