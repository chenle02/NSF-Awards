This award is for the acquisition of infrastructure to support computational
science and engineering with the enhancement of the Scientific Computation
Research Center at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. The infrastructure consists
of a parallel computer along with visualization stations, network file systems,
application servers, and high performance desktop servers to encourage the use
of high performance computing and visualization in modern research. The areas
that will especially benefit include Design and Manufacturing, Composite
Materials, Integrated Electronics, Robotics and Automation, Electromagnetics and
Energy Systems, Fluid Dynamics, and Groundwater Transport. The infrastructure
will also be used for graduate training in high performance computing.
