Dr. Margaret Thayer of the Field Museum in Chicago is studying the basic
taxonomic classification and identification of the rove beetles of the world.
Study of the adult and larval morphology of specimens from museum collections
from several institutions will provide data for improved understanding of the
variability within and among the estimated 38 genera and 425 species of these
forest-dwelling staphylinid beetles. The resulting revised classification will
then allow further work on the evolutionary relationships among the genera and
the patterns of historical biogeography that explain the present worldwide
distribution of these insects. Further, the improved taxonomy will help in
understanding the evolution of the various feeding patterns found in rove
beetles, including pollen-feeding, fungus- feeding, and saprophytism. Dr. Thayer
is a young investigator with several high-quality publications to her credit.
