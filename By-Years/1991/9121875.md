This award is for software capitalization of a set of software tools being
written to support the development of parallel programs that are portable across
a wide variety of commercially available multiprocessors. The tools support
development of programs that utilize both shared memory machines and distributed
memory machines. A prototype has been written that provides for process creation
and termination, shared memory operations such as simple locking and high- level
monitor operations, message passing via send/receive, and logging for debugging.
The tools use shared memory operations internally whenever possible (even for
message passing), and use the Berkeley socket mechanism for communication when
shared memory is not available. On machines that provide a local communication
mechanism (such as some mesh machines), the local mechanism is employed
internally. The tools provide several advantages over existing systems that have
similar functionality.
