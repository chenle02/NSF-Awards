The removal of hardened photoresist layers by plasma ashing in an important
process tool frequently used in the lithographic processing of microelectronic
and optoelectronic devices. The existing techniques for plasma resist ashing
have undesired ion damage to underlying device layers resulting in degraded
device performance. While UV photo ashing avoids radiation damage from plasma
ions, these systems are limited by very low throughput. We propose a newly
developed dual source of atomic oxygen and VUV photons to ash photoresists at
high rates, at low substrate temperatures, and over wide areas with minimum ion
damage and residual contamination. A spatially confined active oxygen plasma of
disc shape will be used to ash hardened photoresist films with the goal of +5%
variation in uniformity over entire 15 cm diameter wafers. Wafers will be
located in a field free downstream plasma region, in the near afterglow, where
the resist surface is exposed primarily to both a reactive atomic oxygen flux as
well as a flux of 130.6 nm oxygen resonance radiation. We aim to measure various
polymer ashing activation energies, evaluate radiation damage effects, and
measure residual surface contamination for comparison of our ashing approach to
traditional methods.
