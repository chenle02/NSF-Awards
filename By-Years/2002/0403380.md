The purpose of this research is to investigate the broad implications of
theories with extra dimensions and to construct realistic models of particle
physics based on these ideas which address issues which are unresolved by the
standard model. During the past few years, advances in D-branes and in the
theory of extra dimensions have sparked a renaissance in supersymmetric model
building. With branes and extra dimensions, the phenomenological implications of
Supersymmetry is much richer than ever before. The proposal has three
directions. The first is to construct realistic unified theories in higher
dimensions. The second is to understand electroweak symmetry breaking from the
perspective of Supersymmetry and extra dimensions, and the third is to
investigate unified theories in strongly curved higher dimensional space-times.
