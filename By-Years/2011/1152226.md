The objective of this proposal is to improve undergraduate student education in
STEM at Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs). This will be accomplished by: i)
identifying common issues that prevent HSIs from obtaining extramural funding
which may impact student retention and graduation rate; ii) connecting STEM
educators at HSIs throughout the country through the creation of a centralized
faculty development network website: and iii) providing access to available
resources recently supported by NSF. At the core of the project is a symposium
that will be held at the University of Texas El Paso centering on the
improvement of HSIs R&D funding rates. The outcome of this work will result in
better trained faculty, establishment of communication network between HSIs
around the country, and documented resources for faculty to use. The proposed
work will contribute to the strengthening of HSIs capacity for performing high
quality research in various STEM disciplines and providing research
opportunities for undergraduate students. This will increase participation of
underrepresented minorities in STEM fields and contribute to the building of a
competent STEM workforce.
