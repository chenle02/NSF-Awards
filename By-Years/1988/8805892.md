Data acquisition and computer equipment are to be acquired to support a broadly
based research program involving turbulent flow characteristics and stability
behavior, flame structure and combustion, and fuel mixing. The various items of
equipment will permit an enhancing and extension of the experimental capability
of several investigators involved in various phases of this ongoing research
program.
