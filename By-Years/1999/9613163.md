This starter grant award to Iowa State University supports the research of
Professor Valerie V. Sheares. Research focusses on the synthesis and
characterization of new monomers, homopolymers, and block copolymers for gas
membrane applications. The work examines the effect of various morphologies on
the gas transport properties of a material. The utilization of living anionic
polymerization and new aminoisoprene monomers yields new block copolymers whose
morphology can be systematically varied. Through study of morphologically varied
products, understanding is advanced of how polymer microstructure, chain motion,
free volume, density, and polarity affect the solubility, diffusivity, and
ultimately gas permeability properties of these new materials. Through synthesis
and study of novel gas permeable membranes, the research advances understanding
of the fundamental relationships between the structure of a polymeric membrane
and its resulting separation properties.
