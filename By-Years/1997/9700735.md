9700735 Dodziuk In 1983, Daniel Gorenstein announced the completion of a major
mathematical undertaking: the Classification of the Finite Simple Groups. In
that same year Gorenstein and Richard Lyons of Rutgers University launched a
project to write a coherent and largely self-contained proof of the
classification theorem. By a combination of new ideas and improved organization
the goal was to refine the existing 15,000 pages of journal articles down to a
more readable 5,000 page proof. Publication of the series by the American
Mathematics Society began in 1994 and two volumes have appeared to date. Recent
exciting developments have accelerated the pace of activity in this field. This
award supports a conference in which the principal players as well as young
researchers can meet and chart the road map for future developments. A group is
an algebraic system with a single operation obeying certain laws. Examples of
groups are found everywhere in nature and their study has important applications
to physics, chemistry , biology and communications. The finite simple groups are
the fundamental building blocks of groups.
