This research extends traditional public goods theory by examining the
connectivity and communality properties of communication and information-based
public goods. This pilot study supports the development of methods and
instruments to conduct a longitudinal examination of communication and
information-based public goods. The research is motivated by the specific
example of a large interorganizational computer-supported collaborative work
system. This type of information-based collective action is theorized to possess
two properties that are uniquely important to communication forms of collective
goods: connectivity and communality. Marwell and Oliver's (1993) theoretical
framework integrates four characteristics of public goods: the good itself,
individuals, the groups or organizations involved with the good, and the action
process. The research is designed to test hypotheses that link collective action
theory, communication and information systems, and collaborative work processes
and effects.
