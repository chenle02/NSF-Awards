The Department has undertaken an extensive program of modernization and
extension of its entire laboratory program. The major theme of the project is
the development of skills related to the acquisition, display, analysis, and
interpretation of measured data. Instrumentation and microcomputers typical of
modern research and industrial laboratories are being introduced. This project,
as the next major step, involves 1) the installation of microcomputers in the
mechanics laboratories with direct interfacing to photogates for airtrack
experiments. A pilot project last years with one set-up proved very successful.
2) the introduction of modern oscilloscopes for experiments on sound, AC
circuits with reactance, and time-dependent DC circuits. A new experiment will
be based on the oscilloscope itself. Now in its sixth year, the modernization
program will be completed in another 4 years.
