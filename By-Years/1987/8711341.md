The creation of university research centers to encourage collaboration among
academe, industry and government in the conduct of science and technology is a
relatively new phenomenon in this country. The aim of this project is to explore
what happens to the values of these three sectors when they come together in
these settings. This effort itself is a collaboration between four scholars from
the disciplines of philosophy, political science and sociology. They will use
their disciplinary perspectives and methods, including normative,
organizational, structural and ethnographic analysis, in an intensive, on-site
examination of the negotiation of values, including concerns for professional
success, control, and management, in two research centers located at Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute, the Center for Manufacturing Productivity and Technology
Transfer and the Center for Composite Materials and Structures. A four-member
board incorporating business, government, and public interest perspectives, will
advise the project; and the study will be augmented by an exchange of ideas and
data with an investigation of other university-industry interactions currently
underway in RPI's Center for Science and Technology Policy. Results will be
disseminated in articles for disciplinary and interdisciplinary journals.
Special mailings of "Working Papers" will be made to administrators and
policymakers, and the findings should also be appropriate for sessions at
meetings of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the
Society for Social Studies of Science. Involvement at the centers should also
lead to channels of publication to audiences interested in the centers'
activities. This project can make a unique contribution to the development,
application, and evaluation of collaborative research agendas and methods in
science and technology studies. It will also provide the first intensive,
longitudinal examination of the processes and products of negotiating values in
these new institutional settings. The investigators are exceptionally well
qualified; graduate students are involved; institutional support and cooperation
is excellent. The use of an advisory board and interaction with another related
investigation will help to assure broader relevance and balance. This is a good
example of the kind of cross-disciplinary research EVS should encourage. Results
are likely to be useful and widely disseminated. Costs are reasonable. Total
support in the amount of $164,374 is recommended, of which $96,000 is awarded
now, from the Directorate for Engineering and the Directorate for Mathematical
and Physical Sciences.
