ADMI stands for the Association of Department Heads of Computer Science and
Engineering Departments at Minority Institutions and it was initially organized
in 1989 at an NSF-funded workshop. Its fundamental purpose is to increase the
number of minorities in computer science and computer engineering through a
variety of activities including the development of research and education
programs. With NSF support over the past two years ADMI has been able to conduct
four proposal writing workshops for minority institutions, to initiate a
visiting scientists program, to incorporate as a not-for-profit corporation, to
conduct a membership drive, and to begin to develop an industrial affiliates
program. ADMI currently represents about 75 of the 117 minority institutions
which have departments or programs in computer science or computer engineering.
The purpose of the grant is to provide enough additional startup support to ADMI
for one year to allow it to become self-sufficient. ADMI will organize and run a
conference on resource issues for minority institutions, develop research and
educational programs for its member institution (including mentoring programs),
develop fund raising mechanisms, and prepare a proposal for the Alliances for
Minority Participation program.
