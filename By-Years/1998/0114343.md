The Center for the Study of the Origin and Structure of Matter (COSM) aims
&lt;br/&gt;to conduct research that has the potential to advance our
understanding of &lt;br/&gt;the world through the lens of particle and nuclear
physics. The Center &lt;br/&gt;also aims to be a doorway for empowering a
network of Historically Black &lt;br/&gt;Colleges and Universities (HBCU's) to
participate in these highly visible &lt;br/&gt;science
projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three components of the Center: (1)
Experimental research at the &lt;br/&gt;frontiers of particle and nuclear
physics at all of the COSM network &lt;br/&gt;universities. (2) Building and
strengthening a collaborative network of &lt;br/&gt;researchers at HBCU's in
these research activities. (3) Outreach to K-12 &lt;br/&gt;teachers and
students, to invite and encourage these students to pursue &lt;br/&gt;careers in
science.&lt;br/&gt;
