An MPS Distinguished International Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (MPS-DRF)
will be used to perform research with P. A. Madden and his group at Oxford
University for a period of two years. The proposed research is molecular
dynamics and polarizable MD simulations on ion materials. The following specific
projects are proposed: (1) development of MD simulation techniques for highly
polarizable systems, (2) development and refinement of transferable systems from
first principle, and (3) study of ionic conduction and nuclear quadrupole
coupling.
