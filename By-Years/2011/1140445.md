Involving undergraduate students in research is recognized as an experience that
powerfully engages students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics
(STEM) and launches students into STEM careers. This research project examines
how participation in undergraduate research impacts students in terms of the
significance of the experience for the participants and explores the
relationship between student outcomes and the goals and activities of these
types of experiences. Focusing on the fields of chemistry and physics, the
largely qualitative study investigates commonly reported outcomes for students
and their mentors to identify intrinsic and extrinsic factors and common
relationships between features of the research experience and student
characteristics. Utilizing an iterative analytic approach, the investigators
document and analyze the structure and implementation of the research experience
in relation to student attributes and previous experiences with STEM. In
addition, the multi-site study examines hypotheses about the impact of these
experiences on engagement in STEM and how participation in a research experience
leads to commitment to pursue a career in STEM. Findings from the study are to
be published in science educational research journals and presented at meetings
sponsored by professional societies.
