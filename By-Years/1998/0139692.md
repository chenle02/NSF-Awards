0139692 &lt;br/&gt;Hillery&lt;br/&gt;Quantum information is a new field that
studies the representation and &lt;br/&gt;processing of information by quantum
mechanical systems. Present computers, &lt;br/&gt;which are classical devices,
represent information by bits, which can be &lt;br/&gt;either 0 or 1. A quantum
computer represents information by qubits, which &lt;br/&gt;have the potential
to be 0 and 1 simultaneously. This leads to profound &lt;br/&gt;differences in
what can be done with classical and quantum information. In &lt;br/&gt;this
project we will study programmable quantum information processing logic
&lt;br/&gt;circuits. Most of the quantum circuits that have been proposed so far
&lt;br/&gt;perform a single task. It is essential to go beyond this and to be
able to &lt;br/&gt;design circuits with two inputs, one the data to be acted
upon and the &lt;br/&gt;second, the program, that encodes the operation be
performed. Both the data &lt;br/&gt;and the program are quantum states. These
circuits can be either &lt;br/&gt;deterministic, succeeding in performing the
desired operation all of the &lt;br/&gt;time, or probabilistic, performing the
operation only some of the time. &lt;br/&gt;Probabilistic circuits can perform a
much larger class of operations than can &lt;br/&gt;deterministic ones. We want
to study how one can design circuits to perform &lt;br/&gt;specific sets of
operations, how these operations are to best be encoded into &lt;br/&gt;quantum
states, and how to optimize the probability of successfully
&lt;br/&gt;performing the desired operation in a probabilistic
processor.&lt;br/&gt;
