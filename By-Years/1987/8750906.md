The recent acquisition of a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) system
(including a computer-controlled work station) by the Chemistry Department at
San Jose State University is providing undergraduate students with a hands-on
working experience in a modern and powerful analytical technique vital for
training the modern chemist in such fields as organic and analytical chemistry,
toxicology, forensics, and environmental sciences. Extensive use of the system
occurs in a new Separation Science Course, with additional use in the organic
and biochemistry laboratories, as well as in undergraduate research, resulting
in significant enhancement of the chemistry curriculum.
