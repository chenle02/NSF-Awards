The primary aim of this research is to understand the developmental mechanisms
which account for the intricate cellular composition of the mature nervous
system. In the leech, individual neurons arise from precise cell lineages and
express unique combinations of differentiated characteristics. These neuronal
cell lineages have only been partially described, and one of the objectives of
the research will be to characterize the complete sequence of cell divisions
which lead to the formation of a small number of identified neurons. The
investigators will then perform embryonic cell ablations in order to ascertain
whether the number and identity of the neurons produced by a given lineage are
determined by cell interactions or by factors that are intrinsic to precursor
cells. The cellular basis of those interactions and/or intrinsic factors will be
studied in further detail. In addition, the P.I.'s will investigate the way in
which different cell lineages communicate in order to bring about coordinated
patterns of neurogenesis. In particular, they will examine the spatial
coordination of homologous cell lineages located in different portions of the
nervous system. Results obtained from this work will advance our understanding
of the way in which cellular diversity and specificity arise during neural
development.
