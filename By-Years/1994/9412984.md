9412984 Wahl Kirtland Community College requests support from NSF for connection
of its campus network to MICHnet. MICHnet is the midlevel network located in the
state of Michigan and it will provide operations management and information
services and will give Kirtland Community College a connection to the NSFNET, a
high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National Backbone network. The
College needs greater functionality and network speed to be able to access
supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers along with being able to
implement a more reliable mail system. Students and faculty research will
benefit from the link. This is also a unique opportunity for the school to
explore innovative educational resources.
