9515472 Bose Description: The International Workshop on High-Temperature
Superconductivity: Ten Years After Its Discovery" will take place at the
University of Rajasthan, Jaipur, December 18- 22, 1996. Since its discovery in
1986, high- temperature superconductivity research has been vigorous. The co-
organizers are Gautam Sen, Florida International University and K.V. Subbarao,
Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. The Deccan Trap giant lava formation
marked the end of the Mesozoic (Dinosaur) era and the dawn of the Cenozoic
(Mammal) era. There is worldwide interest in studying the origin of Deccan Trap
lavas and the impact of this major event on the earth's climate and ecology. The
workshop will access the current state of Deccan Trap research, identify
research priorities, and form working groups for the appropriate research areas.
Scope: The event is locally sponsored by the Geological Society of India. Indian
participants include the National Geophysical Research Institute, the Physical
Research Laboratory, and the Geological Survey of India. NSF will provide
support for six key U.S. participants who are considered critical to the success
of the workshop. Proceedings will be published. ***
