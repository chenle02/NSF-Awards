9512044 Morton This award provides partial funding (69% of total cost) for the
acquisition of an X-ray diffraction spectrometer system to be installed and
operated in the Department of Geology at the University of Minnesota-Duluth .
The institution is committed to providing the remaining funds necessary for the
acquisition of the equipment. X-ray diffraction is used as a basic analytical
tool in many research applications of the earth sciences to identify mineral
phases and to characterize their molecular structural states. The new X-ray
diffractometer will be the only such instrument on the Minnesota-Duluth campus
and will be available for use as a campus-wide facility. ***
