This project examines transient liquid phase bonding with the aim of modeling
this joining process and determining the effects of processing variables. The
approach is aimed at predicting those alloy systems that respond to transient
liquid phase bonding and quantifying important features of the process, such as
the solidification kinetics, effects of solid solubility and phase equilibria,
influence of surface tensions, generic design of interlayers, etc. Out of this
research a clear rationale for design of interlayers based on thermodynamic and
transport properties of the materials' systems should evolve. Potential future
applications include transient liquid phase bonding of electronic packaging,
advanced metal matrix composites, ceramic- to-metal bonding, and reactive metal
joining.
