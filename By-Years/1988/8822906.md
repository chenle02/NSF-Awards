A continuation of earlier work on the spectral asymptotics of
pseudodifferential operators and related questions on Toeplitz operators will be
carried out. Recent expansions associated with pseudodifferential operators
obtained in a formal sense have been shown, in certain cases, to be correct
asymptotically. In effect, one is trying to gain information about the trace of
functions of an operator in terms of some universal approximation which takes
the form of an integral of the function with respect to a measure. This was the
basis for the pioneering work of Weyl and Szego in the earlier part of the
century on classical operators. Present theory has produced a Szego expansion
for operators with a smooth symbol. The object of the current study is to
develop expansions for operators with nonsmooth symbols. Such operators are not
mathematical artifacts; they arise in several areas of applied mathematics. The
approach to this question will be based on a method of stationary phase for
integrals with nonsmooth amplitude function. Work will also be done in seeking a
generalization to the n-sphere of Szego's refined limit theorem on Toeplitz
determinants. Toeplitz matrices enter into these studies naturally as one-
dimensional discrete analogues of pseudodifferential operators, where the
multiplier is discontinuous. A crucial inequality in the one-dimensional theory
would have important implications to harmonic analysis in higher dimensions if
the correct analogue can be established. Work will be done towards this end.
Additional work will be done in an effort to establish a functional calculus to
support the study of nonselfadjoint Toeplitz operators, with emphasis placed on
learning how the spectra distribute when the multipliers change.
