This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
develop a carbon isotope ratio analyzer based on Off-Axis Integrated Cavity
Output Spectroscopy to measure the ratio of C13 to C12 in exhaled breath in real
time. The analyzer will serve as a medical diagnostic instrument that will
operate in a point-of-care setting and reference labs. The instrument will be
inexpensive, portable, easy-to-use and report C13/ C12 measurements with
sufficient sensitivity and precision to replace mass spectrometry in C13-labeled
breath tests for diagnosis of a number of conditions, including exposure to
chemical and biological warfare agents, sepsis, assessment of liver and
pancreatic function, delayed gastric emptying, bacterial overgrowth, irritable
bowel syndrome and viral infection. The Phase I Project will develop an
instrument to determine infection due to Helicobacter pylori, a Class-1
carcinogen, using the C13-urea breath test. The follow on Phase II Project will
develop a prototype commercial instrument for clinical trials.

The commercial application of this project is in the area of medical
diagnostics.
