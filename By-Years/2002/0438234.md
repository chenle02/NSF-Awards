This workshop will implement a strategy for achieving the goal of transforming
how K-16 Earth science is taught nationally by bringing together teams
representing alliances of scientists, educators, school districts, state
departments of education, policy makers, and businesses in the key states of
California, New York, Texas, and North Carolina. They will from the nucleus of
an effort that will expand nationally. During the workshop, each team will
identify the key policy, curriculum, and professional development issues in each
state that inhibit the teaching and learning of core Earth science concepts.
Each alliance will then develop a specific action plan and timeline to address
and solve some of these key issues. The program emphasizes an inquiry-based,
Earth systems approach closely aligned with the national and state standards. In
this approach, mathematics and technology, real-world investigations, data
collection, and modeling are important components of teaching and learning. A
resulting working knowledge of and appreciation for the Earth's resources,
processes, and history is vital to our future leaders and citizens.
