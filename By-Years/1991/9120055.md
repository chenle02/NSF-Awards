Experiments are directed towards understanding various aspects of the electronic
structure of solids using Inelastic Electron Scattering (IES) AND Soft X-ray
Emission (SXE) Spectroscopy. The electronic excitations over a wide energy range
are measured which allows Kramers-Kronig analyses of the data to be carried out.
Dynamical effects may be obtained by studying the momentum-transfer dependence
of the Spectral features. The systems utilized have several unique features,
which include low temperature sample holders, in situ ion cleaning and Auger
analysis, and sample changers which do not disturb the UHV environment.
Instrumental development is a complementary aspect of the program. In addition,
studies are made using synchrotron sources at NIST and NSLS.
