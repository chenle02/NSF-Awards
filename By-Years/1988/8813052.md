The overt behaviors that differentiate the interactions of distressed and
nondistressed married couples are well documented. Little is known, however,
about the thoughts and feelings (i.e., appraisals) that spouses experience
before and after their interactions. These appraisals are likely to be important
because of their potential association with marital interactionand satisfaction.
Consequently, in this study appraisals in distressed and nondistressed marriages
will be assessed beforeand after discussion of a marital problem, by asking
spouses to respond to a series of open-ended and structured questions. A
12-month follow-up assessment of marital satisfaction will be conducted to
examine the longitudinal relation between appraisals and changes in marital
satisfaction. Analyses will be conducted to test the hypotheses that (a)
distressed spouses will make relatively dysfunctional pre- interaction and post-
interaction appraisals, (b) pre-interaction and post-interaction appraisals will
be closely related, and (c)dysfunctional pre-interaction and post-interaction
appraisals will predict declines in satisfaction. This research will generate
and test theory that advances the conceptual foundation of marriage beyond the
study of behavior, and may help in predicting and preventing marital distress.
