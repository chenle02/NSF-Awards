This program will entail a detector upgrade for the University of Chicago
submillimeter polarimeter, Hertz, that operates at the Caltech Submillimeter
Observatory (CSO). The result will be a threefold improvement in point source
sensitivity, and an improvement in angular resolution from 20 arcseconds to 8
arcseconds. The upgrade will be achieved at a relatively modest cost by using
detectors that are "left over" from the large and expensive projects HAWC, and
SHARC-II. The upgraded instrument, Hertz/HR (HR for "High Resolution"), will be
the only submillimeter polarimeter designed for observations at 350 microns.
Observations will be made of magnetic field directions in molecular clouds using
the polarization produced by dust grains aligned with the field.
