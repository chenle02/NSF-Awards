This will support a workshop on the recent developments in industrial
polysaccharides on August 18 and 19, 1986. This workshop will provide a forum
for university, industry, and government scientists and engineers to openly
discuss the impact of polysaccharides in biochemistry, biotechnology and biomass
engineering, including new processes, structure-functions relationships, and
methodologies in characterization. Topics to be considered include: (1) new
biomass polysaccharides and bio-processes; (2) the optimization of
polysaccharide biomedical properties; (3) advanced approaches to
characterization; and (4) upgrading properties and applications of various
polysaccharides.
