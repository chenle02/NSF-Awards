9311194 Negahdaripour Over the last three years, this research group has been
working on the development of optical sensing methods for obtaining information
about an underwater scene from its images. This work has led to the development
of analytical solutions to many interesting problems on recovering the shape of
motion of objects from their images. This grant provides funds for purchasing
necessary equipment to perform high-precision undersea imaging experiments and
for constructing a test-bed for implementing optical sensing methods in an
underwater system. These will complement existing experimental resources for
carrying out controlled experiments (based on accurate knowledge of the ground
truth) to evaluate the performance of optical sensing techniques for undersea
applications. In particular, the facility developed under the proposed plan will
allow: implementation and testing of the developed methods, verification of
various analytical solutions, detailed analysis of the performance of the
methods and error/accuracy evaluation, comparison of the performance and
accuracy with the existing technologies. These equipment are essential for the
development and verification of accurate image models and the design of optical
sensing methods for undersea applications.
