This grant in the Organic Dynamics Program supports the research of Dr.Robert S.
Sheridan dealing with the independent generation, isolation, characterization
and reactivity of energetic intermediates which have been proposed in aromatic
photochemistry. The general approach centers on the synthesis and study of
precursors to these reactive intermediates. Major goals are: (1) Elucidation of
the factors distinguishing stepwise from concerted thermal and photochemical
reactions; (2) Mechanistic elucidation of aromatic photoadditions; (3) Synthesis
of novel, high-energy precursors to aromatic compounds; (4) Examination of "hot-
molecule" effects in condensed phases; (5) Definition of the limits to the
observation of highly unstable molecules. Highly exothermic precursor molecules
will be synthesized where aromatic moieties are formally bound to small, stable
fragments such as CO, nitrogen and carbon dioxide. The chemiluminescence and
adiabatic photoluminescence of these molecules will be observed as these
molecules react to form benzenoid structures. Spectroscopic studies of the
photoreactions of the molecules of interest will be investigated using low
temperature matrix isolation techniques.
