This project will organize, preserve, and archive an important collection of
fossil and extant specimens of stickleback fish from Alaska and California.
Sticklebacks have long been a critical model system in evolutionary biology, and
are known for their complex mating behavior and diversity among populations in
terms of morphology and life-history. This collection, which was assembled since
1975, represents extensive phenotypic diversity in stickleback fish, and
therefore this data-source is crucial for current and future comparative or
experimental research on sticklebacks in particular, and evolutionary and
behavioral processes in general. Of particular value are the fossil samples, as
they are central to gain a better understanding of the timing of evolutionary
dynamics, including trends in trait relationships and their role in shaping
stickleback diversity. This project will make this collection accessible to
researchers nationally, and internationally. It will provide important training
and research opportunities in basic and applied sciences (e.g., Department of
Fish and Wildlife).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fossil specimens will be deposited
in the University of California Museum of Paleontology; the extant specimens
will be deposited in the Ichthyology Collection of the California Academy of
Sciences. The samples and associated records will be indexed and linked to field
notes and associated databases will be assigned museum specimen numbers.
Curating and depositing these specimens will make them available to the general
science community. The preservation of this research collection will ensure the
continued use of this valuable resource, and preparation of sample records will
involve high-throughput scanning, accuracy-editing of labels, curation of
microstratigraphic data as well as map coordinate data. Sample records will be
linked to an existing limnological database, as well as the Alaska Department of
Fish and Game records for the Alaskan samples.
