This project will purchase computer equipment to enhance research and
educational activities using UNIDATA developed technologies within the
Department of Meteorology (DoM) at the SDSM&T. Two Sun Sparcstation IPC with
additional memory, disk capacity (on one unit) and input/output capabilities
will be purchased. The UNIDATA suite of software will allow the Department to
ingest, analyze, and interactively display of weather data for the purposes of
research and instruction. In addition to enhancing the Department's
capabilities, the requested hardware and software will enable transition from an
existing VMS-based to a UNIX-based system. This transition is important since
UNIDATA will no longer support or continue to develop its software for the VMS
operating system. SDSM&T is presently not part of the UNIDATA community and
their participation will be mutually beneficial to the SDSM&T and the UNIDATA
community.
