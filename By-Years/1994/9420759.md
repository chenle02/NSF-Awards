Abstract AST-9420759 Schramm, David N. Dr. Schramm will continue to lead a
research effort with a center of activity that connects particle physics,
nuclear physics, cosmology, and astrophysics. Topics of interest include:
nucleosynthesis from the big bang; the formation of galaxies and large scale
structure and their interrelationship with dark matter; ultra-high energy cosmic
rays; and the evolution of galaxies and globular clusters. ***
