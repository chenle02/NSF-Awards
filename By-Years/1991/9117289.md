One of the conspicuous large-scale changes in the Mesozoic marine fossil record
is the decline of the stenolaemate order Cyclostomata and the rise of
cheilostome bryozoans to the same approximate level of dominance in marine
faunas that had previously been occupied by stenolaemates. Such large-scale
turnovers between taxonomically related and/or ecologically similar groups may
be due to competitive replacement, to accumulated "small-scale" chance events
that by happenstance favor one group over the other, or to the destruction of
the formerly dominant group during a mass extinction, followed by the radiation
of the second into the vacated ecospace. Timing of the cyclostome-cheilostome
turnovers does not correspond with a major mass extinction. Competitive
interactions between recent cyclostomes and cheilostomes favor cheilostomes,
suggesting that competitive replace is a viable hypothesis. The hypothesis will
be tested through predictions of the effects of competition between the two
clades as seen in the Mesozoic to early Cenozoic fossil record. Implications of
the study are much larger than better insight into this one pattern. If tests of
the predictions support the predicted changes, this should provide strong
evidence for the importance of organic interactions in determining
macroevolutionary patterns.
