The investigators will study the self-focusing of whistler waves in magnetized
plasmas and their interaction with relativistic electrons in a runaway
discharge, and the generation of high-energy radiation (X-rays and gamma-rays).
These studies are motivated by the recent satellite observations of gamma-rays
emanating from the mesosphere, a puzzle whose solution requires a new
understanding of the plasma processes in the mesosphere during lightning
discharges. The numerical models of runaway discharge will be developed that
deal with runaway beams generated by a broadband pulse in the presence of
magnetic field. It relies on the runaway of magnetized relativistic electrons.
In this model, an ionization driven self-focusing instability which self-
consistently maintains the runaway population, and channels the energy of
whistler waves along field-aligned filaments is the key element. The approach is
based on an innovative concept of whistler mediated electron discharge and will
develop a new understanding of self-focusing of waves in magnetized plasmas and
its relationship to relativistic electrons. This research will enhance
technological understanding related to the development of tunable X-ray and
gamma-ray sources, and the potential impacts of gamma-ray flashes on aviation
electronics. The project will train undergraduate students and will target
participation by students from underrepresented minority groups. The research
results will be widely disseminated through publication in scientific journals
and web pages.
