This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in applied
mathematics. The investigators are Irena Lasiecka and Roberto Triggiani from the
University of Virginia and J.P. Zolesio and M. Souli from the University of
Nice. The investigators will utilize partial differential equations, hyperbolic
equations and numerical analysis in approaching a number of problems in
structural mechanics. The project focuses on elastic structures whose dynamical
behavior is effected by internal damping of vibrations. The objectives are to
enhance stability properties by determining the optimal shape or design of the
elastic structure so that undesirable vibrations are reduced. The U.S.
investigators bring to this collaboration their expertise in mathematical
modelling of structural damping, optimum control and related questions and the
utilization of elastic partial differential equations for determining
controllability and stabilization properties. This is complemented by French
expertise in shape analysis and optimization. The research has important
applications in the areas of space mechanics and control.
