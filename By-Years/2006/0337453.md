0337453 Nichols The focus of the proposed research is to determine how the
rhizosphere environments impact PAH aging and bioavailability. The novel aspect
of this proposal is that the researchers will evaluate activity in the
rhizosphere that could both increase or decrease PAH bioavailability. For
example, bioavailability could be increased as the result of exudates
destabilizing SOM and enhancing the desorption of PAH or decreased by providing
new hydrophobic sorption surfaces and stimulating humification reactions that
act to sequester PAHs in stable organic matter. Isotopic tracer techniques will
be used to evaluate the impact of vegetation on PAH bioavailability. The
proposal described a detailed experimental approach for accomplishing the
proposed objectives that is scientifically sound.
