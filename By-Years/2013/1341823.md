This grant will support of the attendance of 22 US-based graduate students to
attend The 24th ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles (SOSP 2013).
Participation in leading conferences is an extremely important part of the
graduate school experience, providing the opportunity to interact with more
senior researchers and to be exposed to leading edge work. In the area of
computer systems, SOSP is one of the few such leading conferences. The support
requested in this proposal will make possible the participation of students who
would otherwise be unable to attend. SIGOPS is among the oldest of the ACM SIGs,
and has a distinguished history of contributions to the advancement of systems
research. Many of the key components of the in-formation revolution, from memory
management to the Internet, secure communications protocols, net-work file
systems, and ubiquitous computing, were first showcased in SIGOPS-affiliated
conferences. SIGOPS is a sponsor of SOSP as well as the annual EuroSys
conference.
