This MRI proposal provides funding for the purchase of a three-dimensial
particle imaging velocimetry (PIV) device to augment the existing equipment at
the Auburn University Plasma Science Laboratory (PSL). The PSL has a unique
niche in the dusty plasma community - the ability to perform real-time, two-
dimensional particle transport investigations. This new device makes it possible
to overcome the key limitation of the present PIV device, that it is only able
to measure two of the three velocity components of the particles. Because dusty
plasmas, plasmas containing charged microparticles, are present in many
different environments, from astrophysical systems such as nebula and planetary
rings to industrial processing tools, understanding the behavior of dusty
plasmas in detail will have broad impact in a number of fields.
