This proposal requests funds to carry out a spectrally resolved measurement of
air fluorescence produced by electromagnetic showers at Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center (SLAC). The group expects that this experiment will shed
light on the apparent differences between the results reported by two ultra high
energy cosmic ray (UHECR) experiments, HiRes and AGASA, and will provide
reliable and much needed tests of shower-induced fluorescence for future UHECR
experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The group aims to achieve an accuracy of 8% in
the total fluorescence yield and in the individual spectral lines. The
experiment will also verify that our understanding of the energy dependence of
the yield is correct down to the lowest energies effective in showers, ~100 keV.
The Final Focus Test Beam (FFTB) electron line at SLAC will be used at
intensities of 10^7 to 10^9 per pulse. They propose to use both thin target and
thick target approaches. A thin target run will allow them to measure the total
fluorescence yield per beam track, and the spectrum, to 8%. It will also allow a
precise measurement of the dependences of the yield and spectrum on pressure and
on atmospheric impurities. The interaction of the beam in a thick target mimics
the distribution of electron energies found deep in cosmic ray induced air
showers. A beam with 10^8 electrons (~28 GeV /electron) has an energy per bunch
equal to that of a 2.8 x10^18 eV shower. The superposition of the showers can be
modeled by software such as EGS and GEANT. In the thick target experiment the
fluorescent yield will be measured at various depths in the shower development,
allowing detailed comparison with the Monte Carlo simulations. Measurements on
air or nitrogen mixed with various concentrations of CO2, Ar and water vapor
will also be performed. &lt;br/&gt;
