Recombination is a fundamental process in all sexually reproducing organisms.
Recombination describes the process where one's paternally and maternally
derived chromosomes exchange genetic material before being passed to offspring.
This process helps partition the proper number of chromosomes into egg and sperm
and creates genetic diversity by shuffling different gene copies. Despite the
importance of recombination, little is known about what causes recombination
events to occur in particular locations of the genome. One possible mechanism
for selecting the position of recombination events is epigenetics, describing
modifications to one's inherited genetic material independent from what is coded
in one's genes. Some research suggests that the epigenetic modification DNA
methylation could affect the recombination process by inhibiting certain sites
from experiencing a recombination event. Therefore, this research will utilize
the model system Drosophila melanogaster to directly test for a role of DNA
methylation in recombination. The experiments will measure recombination with
several different techniques in flies missing the gene responsible for DNA
methylation, flies in which the gene is over-expressed, and flies with the
normal gene, to understand how these processes are interrelated.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mechanisms of recombination and DNA methylation are
fundamental to the development, evolution, and general health of organisms from
flies to humans. Errors in recombination result in chromosomal defects that are
lethal or developmentally debilitating. Methylation has been implicated in human
diseases, particularly in the silencing of tumor suppressor genes in cancer.
Understanding the interaction and regulation of these processes will have direct
implications in human health and medicine.
