Abstract for DMS - 0104150&lt;br/&gt;PI: Wei-Dong Ruan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr.
Ruan proposes to study the Lagrangian fibration structure of &lt;br/&gt;Calabi-
Yau manifolds and of more general Kaehler manifolds, &lt;br/&gt;and their
applications in mirror symmetry &lt;br/&gt;and other Kahler geometry problems as
well. The objective of the proposed research &lt;br/&gt;is to further inderstand
the Lagrangian torus fibration structures for more&lt;br/&gt;general Calabi-Yau
manifolds, exploring the interplay of sympletic&lt;br/&gt;geometry and complex
geometry in Kaehler manifolds, as indicated &lt;br/&gt;by Kontsevich's
categorical mirror symmetry program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mirror symmetry has
its origin in string theory and&lt;br/&gt;says that we have two theories, which
appear to be completely distinct, &lt;br/&gt;describing the same physics. If we
have two different models of the same universe, &lt;br/&gt;one can expect that
one of the models can fill in the gaps in understanding &lt;br/&gt;the other
model. This project is towards understanding this symmetry
principle.&lt;br/&gt;Results from this proposal should be of interest to
mathematicians from&lt;br/&gt;various disciplines as well as physicists in
string theory.&lt;br/&gt;
