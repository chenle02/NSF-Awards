This is a proposal for a research program to study the role of interfaces in
superplastic deformation and cavitation failure in ceramics. Superplastic
forming offers the potential for near-net- shape processing of relatively
complex shapes from viable structural ceramics. The propensity to cavitate
during deformation, however, is one aspect of superplasticity that need to be
better understood for this technique to gain prominence in ceramic processing.
The proposed research addresses the critical issues relating to the cavitation
problem. The PI intends to study the nucleation and growth of cavities during
superplastic deformation as a function of the properties of the grain boundary
phase. The research will include the in-house processing of controlled
microstructures for the superplastic deformation studies.
