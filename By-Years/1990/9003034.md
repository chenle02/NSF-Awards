This project is aimed at developing new conceptual and mathematical methods for
the general analysis of mechanical efficiency and performance limitations of
reciprocating kinematic heat engines. The project is motivated by two recent
discoveries which, taken together, indicate that realistically complex engine
mechanisms can be treated in mathematically closed form fashion. The discoveries
arose from prior work on establishing mathematically explicit and general limits
on the mechanical efficiency of kinematic engines which are analogous to the
well known Carnot limits on thermal efficiency. The prior work was restricted to
highly idealized engine mechanisms models. The present project makes use of a
new abstract approach to model engine mechanisms which allow significant
relaxation or essentially complete removal of the idealizations and restrictions
of the earlier work. The results of the proposed new work will be more
faithfully representative of actual practice while retaining a broad general
range of applicability. This will not only provide more detailed insight into
the specific practical problems involved in extracting useful work from heat
engines, but it will also furnish a new ability to address global problems
important to practical heat engine design and development such as the optimal
matching of thermodynamic cycles and engine mechanisms.
