Experts continue to decry the poor performance of American children on
standardized mathematics tests. Hundreds of studies have investigated
mathematics learning in the formal setting of the school, including analyses of
teacher-student interactions and best methods for teachers to use in
instruction. In contrast, informal mathematics learning in the home has received
little research attention, and direct analyses of parent-child interactions
involving math problems have seldom been attempted. The primary purpose of the
proposed research is to study mothers as they help their 5th and 7th grade
children with math problems. The researchers developed a standardized
mathematics task that can be administered in the home using a laptop computer.
Mother-child interactions will be videotaped and coded. The approach is based on
cognitive social learning theory and Vygotsky's premise that the child's
intellectual development is heavily rooted in the child's social environment, or
what Rogoff calls an apprenticeship in thinking.
