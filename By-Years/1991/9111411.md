Professor Jones will study examples of subfactors (both from finite dimensional
and infinite dimensional methods). His techniques will involve the use of loop
group representations, knot theory, and statistical mechanics. Of special
importance is an attempt to understand the correspondence between statistical
mechanics and knot theory. This will be approached both by looking at large
knots and a procedure called Baxterization. Jones' work has its basis in the
theory of algebras of Hilbert space operators. These are families of linear
functions on a certain type of infinite dimensional space. He is interested in
how nests of these algebras fit inside one another. This seemingly technical
subject turns out to have very important implications for a large variety of
other areas of mathematics and physics including knot theory and the theory of
three dimensional manifolds (topology) and statistical mechanics (physics).
