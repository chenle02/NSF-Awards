Genocide often leads to linguicide, or the extreme endangerment of the languages
spoken by the communities targeted for destruction. Historical testimony
interviews with survivors are a critical source of data for those who wish to
describe, analyze, or revitalize these minority languages. To what extent can
such materials also be used to reconstruct the social meaning of variable
language features or even the direction of language change in the pre-genocide
period?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project analyzes sociolinguistic variation and
language change in video-recorded testimonies by Holocaust survivors. A genocide
of unprecedented scale, the Holocaust had a particularly devastating effect on
minority languages. Although the testimonies were not collected specifically for
linguistic research purposes, they provide the raw data necessary for innovative
projects in phonetic and grammatical analysis. The goal of these projects is to
assess the decline of stereotyped dialect features in pre-genocide communities,
as well as the actuation of grammatical change after speaker displacement. The
grant will fund the development of a new digital archive which will contain
testimony transcripts, media files, and metadata. These materials will be made
available to researchers, language instructors and students, and members of the
public in accessible online formats. In addition to these research outputs, the
project includes research and professional training for a postdoctoral scholar
in linguistics; the development of modules for undergraduate and graduate
sociolinguistics courses on the use of oral histories as language data; and the
development of supplementary curricula for intensive language programs, which
will familiarize students with the voices of native speakers of endangered
varieties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
