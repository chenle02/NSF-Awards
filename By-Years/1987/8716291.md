From July to December, when the current is strongest, the North Brazil Current
leaves the coast between 4 and 6N and feeds the North Equatorial Counter
Current. During the rest of the year it follows along the coast and delivers a
sizeable contribution of warm water into the North Atlantic subtropical gyre.
Csanady is going to model the physical processes that control the retro-
flection of the North Brazil Current. These models will provide the theoretical
framework to interpret the observational program of NOBREX (North Brazil Current
Experiment).
