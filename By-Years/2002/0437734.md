This grant provides funding to hold the very first International Workshop on
"Mining of Manufacturing Enterprise Data" as part of the Conference on
"Mathematical Methods of Learning - Advances in Data Mining and Knowledge
Discovery" scheduled for June 21-24, 2004 in Como, Italy. The Workshop intends
to serve as a forum for data mining researchers and also enterprise system
researchers to meet to discuss how they can work together to advance the
research in mining of manufacturing enterprise data. The funding supports eight
U.S. researchers from six universities to take part in the Workshop. They will
present topics including&lt;br/&gt;o An overview of manufacturing enterprise
data mining&lt;br/&gt;o Mining of time series data in manufacturing enterprise
systems&lt;br/&gt;o Selection of invariant objects with a data mining
approaches&lt;br/&gt;o Modeling and applications in data mining and knowledge
discovery&lt;br/&gt;o Process partitions for process data mining&lt;br/&gt;o
Mining of human performance data from automated systems&lt;br/&gt;o Learning
from production scheduling data&lt;br/&gt;o Discovery and reuse of knowledge for
engineering design&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Workshop attempts to depict the
unique characteristics of manufacturing enterprise data and the associated data
mining goals, to set new research directions for developing domain-specific,
customized data mining algorithms, and also to explore the use of grid computing
in mining of enterprise data. The results of the Workshop will be recorded in an
edited book. The Workshop is also expected to foster an environment for national
and international collaborations on the
subject.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
