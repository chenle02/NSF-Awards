The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to develop
technology that improves healthcare data infrastructure. Digital health has
reached an inflection point. The FDA recently issued new guidelines for
"Software as Medical Device" (SaMD) which is accelerating the development of
clinical-grade connected devices. In recent months, investors poured $815
million into digital health and health sensor startups. The rise in digital
biomarkers and biosensors present an opportunity to make significant changes in
the way that care is monitored and delivered. Some relatively inexpensive tools
that collect health data can make "precision medicine" a reality. However,
current tools are not optimized for a large influx of data and there is a need
for better infrastructure to be able to securely store and access data and to
develop algorithms on these new datasets.

This I-Corps project uses blockchain-derived protocols to improve the way
digital health information is stored and accessed. A blockchain is an open
database (e.g., a distributed ledger) maintained by a network of independent
participants. This blockchain protocol is designed for trustless, peer-to-peer
exchange without a central authority. Each digitally-connected sensor is a
separate node (participant) in the protocol. As a patient generates new data,
the sensor records the information, and creates a time-stamped summary in the
distributed ledger. The blockchain provides assurance that the research queries
are tamper-proof and have an auditable history across a wide range of actors in
the system. The goal for the I-Corps participation is to best understand the
systems and features the clinical data scientists are looking to as they develop
next-generation clinical decisions and algorithms.
