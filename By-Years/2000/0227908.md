This MPS-IPSE award supports Cosmic Connections, a partnership between the
Milton J. Rubenstein Museum of Science and Technology (MOST) and a group of
research scientists at Syracuse University. A series of four to six museum
exhibits introducing concepts from cosmology to the general public will be
developed and constructed. The individual exhibit modules will ultimately be
integrated into a single permanent exhibit at MOST. Graduate students,
undergraduate students, and schoolteachers will serve as interns in the project,
playing crucial roles in the design process. Some student participants will have
a background in physics, while others will bring strength in visual design.
Working in concert, these groups will assure that the exhibits produced offer
both technical accuracy and visual effectiveness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
overall aim of the project is to bring to the general public a broader awareness
of science, its methods, and its most exciting results. By working closely with
various community organizations, Cosmic Connections will seek to reach out to a
broad and diverse audience. This project is funded by the Office of
Multidisciplinary Activities in MPS.&lt;br/&gt;
