In this project in the Physical Chemistry program of the Chemistry Division, Dr.
V. Bierbaum of the Chemistry Department of the University of Colorado will
continue and extend her ongoing investigations on the kinetics, mechanisms, and
thermochemistry of gas phase ion-molecule reactions. The work on isotopically
labeled ions, SN2 reactions of microsolvated ions, and the effect of
translational energy on the kinetics and mechanisms will be extended. Newer work
will involve studies of higher degrees of solvation, kinetic energy dependence,
comparison of the behavior of sulfur vs. oxygen nucleophiles and nitrogen
substrates. Other mechanisms of labeled, microsolvated ions, including proton
transfer, elimination, addition, and associative detachments will be explored.
This research is of intrinsic interest to gas phase reaction chemistry. Its
results are of importance not only in combustion, but also in the chemistry of
the upper atmosphere.
