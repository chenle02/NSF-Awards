The aim of this project is to thoroughly integrate computer technology into the
teaching of mathematics so that it supplements traditional pencil-and-paper
calculations. The technology-based curricular reform began in 1989 with
experimental sections of calculus using Mathematics. Today, Mathematics is being
used in almost all of the departmental offerings, as well as in other courses on
campus, and has become an indispensable tool for many students. It has helped
students to recognize mathematics as a discipline which requires thought,
experimentation, and creativity. The department has many student computer
laboratories, a campus-wide network, and a site license to Mathematics. However,
many college- and student-owned computers cannot run Mathematics effectively
because of the memory resources it demands. Therefore, this project is
purchasing a network kernel server which can handle the computational
requirements of Mathematics and leave the client machines to simply display the
results. This system is providing the essential next step in the curricular
reform program by making Mathematics available to almost all computers on
campus, enhancing its instructional impact.
