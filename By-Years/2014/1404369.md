This is a project in a subfield of mathematics known as arithmetic geometry.
Many of the questions in the project are motivated by the philosophy that
algebraic information can be obtained by geometric methods. Solution to the
problems under study in this project will have substantial impact on research in
cryptography, theoretical physics, and quantum
computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator will study arithmetical
intersection numbers of special cycle on Shimura varieties and their relations
to the special values of automorphic of L-series. This work will have
applications to the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture on abelian varieties
and the Beilinson--Bloch conjecture on algebraic cycles.
