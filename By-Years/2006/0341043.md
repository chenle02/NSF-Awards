Project CLEA (Contemporary Laboratory Exercises in Astronomy) is building on its
experience developing software for astronomy labs to do two things: (1) Complete
development of VIREO, the Virtual Educational Observatory, a simulated
multiwavelength observatory with a variety of instrumentation and analysis
tools. VIREO involves the creation of software and student workbooks and the
adaptation of astronomical databases to meet the pedagogical requirements of
astronomy classes. CLEA is producing a book-length user's manual for VIREO, so
that it can serve as an environment for the development of astronomy exercises
by the community of astronomy educators. (2) Develop several new astronomy
exercises utilizing VIREO, at both the introductory and advanced undergraduate
level, including exercises that emphasize observing strategies and current
problems in astrophysics such as the search for high-z QSOs, discovering
extrasolar planets, and multi-wavelength imaging of star-forming regions. CLEA
is building on its associations with researchers at other institutions as it did
in its recently released Solar Rotation exercise with the GONG project. CLEA
materials are available on the dedicated CLEA website, and are also being
distributed by CD-ROM and DVD upon request. CLEA is promulgating its materials
vigorously at national and regional teachers' meetings. A summer training
workshop on astronomical research techniques for college teachers will be held
on the Gettysburg College campus in June, 2006. Evaluation of the curricular
impact and pedagogical effectiveness of these materials is being conducted
through on-line questionnaires to faculty, pre- and post- tests to students, and
site visits by an external evaluator. The intellectual merit of the project lies
in its development of astronomy labs that are connected to contemporary
astronomical discoveries. The broader impact is on the large number of astronomy
students, almost all non-science students, at all kinds of institutions, who use
the materials.
