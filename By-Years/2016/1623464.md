The workshop on Systems for Solar Fuels Generation Utilizing PV and Electrolysis
will be held at the University of Delaware on March 7-8, 2016. The purpose of
this workshop is to bring academic, industry, and government researchers
together to assess the potential of making hydrogen gas, a sustainable zero-
carbon fuel, from the splitting of water into hydrogen and oxygen using
electricity generated through solar energy. The expected outcome of this
workshop is the formation of team that can advance both the science and
practical development of integrated photovoltaic / electrolyzer (PV/EC) systems
through coordinated efforts. The workshop will also include a Poster session
highlighting student research and projects in this
area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will cover two major topic areas
underlying systems-level integration of PV/EC processes for potentially low-cost
solar hydrogen fuel production. The first area is Systems Optimization, which
will focus on identifying systems-driven approaches for scalable design,
manufacture, assembly, and operation of large-scale PV/EC systems for solar
fuels production. Topics discussed will include techno-economic analysis,
minimization of coupling losses, power conditioning, and design implications for
PV and electrolyzer components in an optimized system. The second topic area is
Integration of Photovoltaic &amp; Electrolyzer Design, which will focus on
identifying opportunities to improve system performance by redesigning both
components for synergistic operation. Topics will include identification of low-
cost/high-performance components, novel module and electrolyzer designs,
membrane technologies, and catalyst development.
