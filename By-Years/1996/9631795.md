Clark U. This proposal is for research which examines the middle ground between
general beliefs and specific reasons for economic action using the discourses of
actors in New England's industrialization (1790-1860) as case material. The
social theoretic research uses an intra-regional study of economic actors and
involves three types of analysis. First, a clarification of the philosophical-
theoretical notion of the cultural-discursive formation of economic rationality
is intended which will culminate in a `cultural order of production` concept.
Second, new historical research will be initiated on the discursive constitution
of early economic actors in New England and the cultural construction of
economic forms. Third, the work will synthesize theory with empirical findings
in a cultural production of New England industrialization. The main empirical
research involves distinct types of modern manufacturing systems which have
emerged from the pre-industrial New England moral economy. Local history work
will be carried out in several towns where small producers rapidly became modern
capitalist entrepreneurs. The research is significant because it shows that
economic activities have cultural origins. Second, the work will place regional
economic development in a broader cultural framework.
