The architecture of the cerebral cortex of the brain shows sophisticated
connections among and between the layers of nerve cells, and within and between
functional units called columns. Nerve cells have very high metabolic rates, and
blood flow to different areas of the brain depends on which parts are most
active at particular times. Blood flow is altered by regional changes in oxygen
and carbon dioxide content, as well as by blood pressure. It is known that
vascular capillary networks show flow changes with regional, cyclic activity of
opening and closing. The opening of a capillary network to a local region is
called recruitment, and provides local cycling of nutrients (such as oxygen) and
waste metabolites to active biological tissues. This work uses a unique approach
to combine the concepts of temporal cycling, capillary recruitment, columnar
organization of the cortex, and vascular architecture of the cortex. There are
suggestions that the recruitment cycles here are relatively quite rapid.
Measurements with novel technology will allow new results at a very fine level
in time and space, to determine how vascular units composed of groups of
capillaries regulate flow in response to demand. The impact of this novel work
will be high not only on the obvious clinical issues, but on the many areas of
neuroscience that deal with functional architecture and activity patterns in the
brain.
