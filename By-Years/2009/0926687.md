This proposal will be awarded using funds made available by the American
Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, investigators propose to develop a
programming environment for easing the development of portable high-performance
applications for GPUs and accelerators ? by automatic generation of OpenCL code
from annotated C programs provided by the user. The proposed work is motivated
by recent advances in polyhedral based approaches for powerful transformations
of affine computations that have enabled the development of the Pluto automatic
parallelization/optimization system. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The developments will
result in enhancement of the widely used gcc compiler providing broad impact
across the sciences. The education of students engaged in the work will be
central to the project.
