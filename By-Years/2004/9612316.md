With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor Saltiel at Florida
State University is investigating the photochemistry and photophysics of
conjugate olefins. Through the use of experiments and the principal component
analysis-self modeling methodology, he is gaining insight into the consequences
of single bond rotamers and double bond isomerizations on the photochemical
behavior of complex olefins. Application of these ideas to Vitamin D formation
and the Bacteriorhodopsin photocycle is the focus of this investigation. Results
of previous investigations on polyolefin photochemistry are being applied to the
photochemistry and photophysics of biologically significant chemical systems.
This includes the study of Vitamin D formation and Bacteriorhodopsin photocycle.
The latter deals with an exploration of vision chemistry.
