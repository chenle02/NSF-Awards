Mathematics Department at SUNY College of Agriculture and Technology at
Cobleskill is establishing a computer laboratory/classroom for regular class
scheduling of all precalculus and calculus classes. This classroom is allowing
students to learn mathematics using a "hands-on" approach. The Harvard Calculus
Consortium Project materials are being used to teach Calculus I and II at
Cobleskill. Selected exercises from the Harvard materials are also supplementing
the precalculus classes while other precalculus lessons are being written or
modified from other projects. The faculty are attempting to modernize all of
their course outlines by using the types of presentations and exercises given in
the Harvard materials. While no specific technology is required for these
materials, this project is creating a computer laboratory/classroom that
includes the CAS software Derive. Such software allows the student to do
numerical problems, graphs, and closed-form algebra and calculus very
efficiently. Thus, the students are learning by doing mathematics throughout the
class instead of just watching the teacher. In addition, the computers are
available for in-class and out-of-class laboratory projects. These projects are
designed to present "real" mathematical situations.
