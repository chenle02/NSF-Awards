Growth-Associated Protein-(GAP)-43 has been implicated in a wide variety of
phenomena in the nervous system. The physical characteristics of the molecule,
together with its elevated expression during periods of neuronal growth and
regeneration, suggest that it might play a role in the extension of nerve fibers
toward their targets. GAP-43 also appears to be involved in some way in the
regulation of neurotransmitter secretion in the mature nervous system, perhaps
because it modulates several biochemical signaling systems within the nerve
cell. Despite the accumulation of a large amount of experimental information on
GAP-43, the precise function of the protein remains elusive. We have used a
model cell culture system consisting of two closely related neuroendocrine cell
lines which express GAP- 43 at dramatically different levels to investigate
further the role of GAP-43 in neurotransmitter secretion. Our initial
experiments demonstrated that the secretory response is highly correlated with
the levels of GAP-43 expression in these cells. Subsequently, we have used
molecular genetic approaches to manipulate GAP-43 expression and have obtained
more direct evidence for a role of this protein in secretion. Our experiment
system will thus permit us to determine the molecular basis of this role; this
information may be relevant to the other postulated functions of GAP-43 as well.
