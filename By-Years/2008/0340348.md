This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I research project proposes
to demonstrate the feasibility of the company's metasearch technology by
developing a prototype system for automatically creating customized metasearch
engines based on the search engines specified by a user (i.e., the URLs of the
interface pages of the search engines are provided by the user). A metasearch
engine is a system that provides unified access to multiple existing search
engines and it is an effective mechanism to combine the coverage of multiple
search engines and to reach the portion of the Web that cannot be publicly
crawled. Several issues must be addressed. First, different form tags that
contain search engine interfaces need to be automatically analyzed so that
information useful for connecting to the search engines (i.e., submitting
queries and receiving results) through a program can be correctly extracted.
Another issue is that various result pages returned by different search engines
in response to user queries need to be automatically parsed so that useful
information such as the URLs and snippets of retrieved documents can be
correctly extracted. A third issue is that retrieved documents from multiple
search engines need to be automatically merged into a single ranked list with
good retrieval effectiveness while minimizing the need to downloading/analyzing
the actual documents. One final issue is that created metasearch engines need to
be automatically maintained so they can continue to work correctly when
independently managed search engines change.

The outcome of this project will contribute to research in several related areas
such as distributed information retrieval, autonomous systems, information
extraction and self-maintainable systems. Customized metasearch engines can
benefit individual users and companies/organizations in their information
acquisition. This solution saves users' time and increases productivity
