Through collaboration between UCSD's Jacobs School of Engineering, Mathematics
Department, San Diego Supercomputer Center, and Division of Student Affairs,
this institution will refine and continue its CSEMS Program in order to provide
scholarships for freshmen and upper-division, low-income undergraduates majoring
in computer science, engineering, or mathematics. Ten qualifying freshmen will
receive $3,030 annually over four years beginning in fall, 2003 while 40 upper-
division students will receive $3,030 annually for two years, 20 effective in
fall, 2003 and 20 in fall, 2005. Recruiting will be initiated through
personalized letters sent from PIs to students identified as potentially
eligible. To encourage applications from low-income women, underrepresented
students and those with disabilities, notices will be posted in specialized
campus locations such as the Women's and Cross-cultural Centers. Applications
will undergo review by a committee including PIs and the CSEMS Coordinator. Due
to under representation of ethnic minorities, women and persons with
disabilities in CSEMS fields, priority will be given to students from these
groups. Alternate Scholars will be identified to insure a consistent participant
level of 30.
