The primary objective of this research is to test the hypothesis that reduction
in size of the olfactory system of the brain in higher primates has been
accompanied by a significant reorganization at the cellular level. Such
reorganization could have allowed some animals previously considered to be
microsmatic (having a poor sense of smell)--including humans--to have highly
discriminative olfactory systems despite their small size. The Principal
Investigators will conduct a quantitative analysis of neurons of the olfactory
system, their arrangement, and their interconnections in the brains of several
primates and other mammals. The animals to be used in this research are to be
received from other investigators and this therefore represents a judicious use
of a valuable resource. This research addresses a fundamental question of
interest to those involved with either olfactory behavior or anatomy; namely,
why do some animals, sensitive to olfactory cues and with seemingly complex
social behavioral patterns, have what appear to be diminutive olfactory
structures? Anthropologists have traditionally believed that the olfactory
system in primates has been reduced at the expense of development of the visual
system. This research could demonstrate that long-held tenet of anthropology to
be misleading if reorganization of the olfactory system has allowed a small
"smell-brain" to be just as efficient in some respects as a large one.
