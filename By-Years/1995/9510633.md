This research examines how radical political parties become established parties,
capable of participating in government. The principal focus of the research is
on the development of the Greens party from a fringe environmental movement to
the 3rd largest political party in Germany. The research explores the
interactive relationship between change in party organizational characteristics
and participation in governing coalitions. Political parties in six German
states will be compared with respect to their differences in composition, the
attitudes of their members and leaders, their organizational structures, and
their programmatic activity. The attitudes of members will be measured with
questionnaires distributed to participants at state party conferences. Party
leaders will be interviewed using an open-ended interview protocols. In addition
to cross-sectional comparisons between states, the evolution of the Green
parties within states will be traced. Organizational changes and coalitional
behaviors over time will be mapped to programmatic changes.
