The objective of this activity is the development of a theoretical and
empirical understanding of the ionospheric thermospheric domain in the 100-1000
km altitude region. To accomplish this objective it is proposed to continue
SUNDIAL investigations focused on global scale ionospheric physics, its solar
and interplanetary controls, and its coupling to the magnetosphere and
thermosphere, SUNDIAL investigations merge the accumulated ionospheric,
magnetospheric interplanetary and solar inputs, and will use the combined data
to test first- principle and empherical models dealing with measurements and "
in situ" observations from relevant satellite programs of opportunity through
ground based activity. The data and models will be reviewed and analyzed in
workshops. Special issue journal publications will be developed. The data base
will archived for follow-on investigations and baseline support for efforts to
develop a geospace prediction capability. ***
