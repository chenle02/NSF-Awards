9731206 Manson Description: This award supports the US-India Cooperative
Research: Ionization of Atoms by Electromagnetic Radiation and Charged
Particles." Collaborators Steven Manson of Georgia State University and Pranawa
Deshmukh of the Indian Institute of Technology(IIT), Madras will continue to
research problems involving theoretical calculations of the interaction of
various kinds of ionizing radiation with atomic and ionic matter. They will
emphasize regions which have not been explored experimentally. With the advent
of the new powerful synchrotron light sources, including one in India, these
systems will be more readily explored in the laboratory, thus making the
proposed studies quite timely. Scope: The results will provide further insight
into the basic nature of fundamental atomic processes which are important in
plasma physics, atmospheric, solar and astrophysics, and radiation physics. In
both countries, the research provides training for graduate and advanced
undergraduate students in methods of calculating and understanding atomic and
molecular structure and collisions. Additionally, for India the collaboration
facilitates the build-up of an internationally competitive research program at
the IIT, Madras. ***
