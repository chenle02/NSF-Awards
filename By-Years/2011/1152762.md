With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division
of Chemistry, Professor Merlin Bruening at Michigan State University and his
group will develop enzyme-containing porous membranes that catalyze digestion of
proteins to enable their analysis. They will investigate how variation of the
flow rate through the membranes affects the lengths of the peptides that result
from digestion. Formation of large peptides is important for finding specific
protein modifications including phosphorylation that are relevant to diseases
such as cancer. Control over membrane digestion can also help elucidate protein
structure and examine how structure changes in response to certain drugs or
other proteins. The proposed research, if successful, will extend the utility of
the membrane digestion approach and provide better tools for post-translational
modified protein analysis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will involve
students at high school, undergraduate, and graduate levels, including those
from underrepresented groups. A high school teacher workshop on protein analysis
by mass spectrometry will further expand the impact of these studies. An
international student exchange program is also in development to further expose
students to different scientfic training and cultural environments.
