This a planning grant to develop a full-scale proposal for the support of a
community-based network of technology learning centers. The Playing to Win
Network will address the question of how to make science, and math, and
technology issues relevant to the undeserved. Over the past 8 years the Playing
to Win training center has provided training to teens and young adults in the
predominantly minority community of Harlem (New York City) who need familiarity
with math, science, and technology in order to keep a job. The goals of the
grant are (1) to identify communities to serve as pilot sites of the network,
(2) to develop collaborations to support the larger network structure, and (3)
to study existing network models, financial structures, and to develop a
business plan. Once the network is in place, further research into teaching and
training techniques for minorities will be pursued.
