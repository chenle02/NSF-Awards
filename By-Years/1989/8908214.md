It is now widely accepted that the final cost of a manufactured product is
largely determined at the design stage. This work addresses decisions that must
be made early in design; namely the selection of suitable processes and
materials for the proposed component parts of the product. However, designers
will tend to conceive parts in terms of the processes and materials with which
they are familiar and may, as a consequence, exclude from consideration
process/material combinations that may have proved more economic. A satisfactory
method for the systematic selection of suitable process/material combinations
for part manufacture is not currently available. Such a method and its
implementation in a computer environment for use at the early stages of product
design are developed.
