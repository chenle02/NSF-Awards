This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) is focused on environmentally
friendly lubricants for cold forging processes based on polymeric formulation
and the develop of methodology based on coupling tribochemistry with severity of
deformation modes of specific forging processes. The new lubricant formulation
concept is based on combination of internally stabilized emulsion polymers along
with advances in adhesion chemistry and synthetic lubricants. This lubricant is
aimed at replacing zinc phosphate coating. The effort will include development
of a quick and robust online lubrication system for the newly formulated
lubricants. In recent years the U.S. forging industry has undergone significant
shrinkage due to intense global competition, technological changes, and
environmental and economic factors. Serious environmental concerns may cause the
phase out of the current lubrication system for cold forging based on zinc
phosphate coatings. This project, in cooperation with NC State University,
targets an environmentally friendly lubricant to assist the forging industry.
