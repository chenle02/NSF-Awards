The goal of this research is to predict hydrologic and hydrochemical response
of alpine catchments to perturbations in the patterns of precipitation,
precipitation chemistry, energy fluxes. The objectives involve both improving
our ability to model the processes, and examining the responses of test basins
to possible anthropogenic perturbations. The main study areas are three
headwater basins of the Tokapah valley on the Marble fork of the Kaweah river in
Sequoia National Park, which lie on the west slope of the Sierra Nevada; and two
headwater basins in the Rock Creek drainage of the Eastern Sierra Nevada.
Several years of hydrological and hydrochemical data are available for these
catchments. The approach uses physically based mathematical modeling of the data
records from these basins. The algorithms used for the modeling are being
developed and tested as part NASA/EOS and other projects to provide an
integrated approach to modeling the hydrology and hydrochemistry of seasonally
snow- covered alpine basins. This project uses those tools to describe and
predict: i)spatially distributed snowmelt (discharge and chemistry), ii)
snowmelt runoff, iii) stream, lake and soil chemistry, and iv) changes in
snowmelt, runoff, and chemistry in response to anthropogenic perturbations.
Issues of scale and parameter estimation are addressed.
