This award supports the research in Automorphic Forms of Professor Paul Garrett
of the University of Minnesota. Dr. Garrett's work is concerned with integral
representations of L- functions and Eisenstein series. Among the topics he plans
to work on are: criteria for expressibility of automorphic forms as theta
series, relations between zeros and poles of Eisenstein series and L-functions,
integral representations of Eisenstein series attached to cuspforms, and
uniqueness results for Hecke eigenfunctions with prescribed invariance. Non-
Euclidean plane geometry began in the early nineteenth century as a mathematical
curiosity, but by the end of that century, mathematicians had realized that many
objects of fundamental importance are non-Euclidean in their basic nature. The
detailed study of non-Euclidean plane geometries has given rise to several
branches of modern mathematics, of which the study of Modular and Automorphic
Forms is one of the most active. This field is principally concerned with
questions about the whole numbers, but in its use of Geometry and Analysis, it
retains connection to its historical roots.
