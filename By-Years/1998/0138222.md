AST-0138222&lt;br/&gt;Gatewood, George D.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Multichannel
Astrometric Photometer (MAP) at the Thaw Refractor of the University of
Pittsburgh will be upgraded to extend the magnitude limit from its current level
of twelve to fifteen and will be upgraded to increase its precision by a factor
of two better than the current system. Precise, relative astrometry to a few
milliarcseconds for a night's observing will be enabled. Unique aspects of the
instrument include: a Ronchi grating scanned across the star field to modulate
the stellar flux, angular distances between stars measured using the phase of
the resulting signals, and the replacement of the old photomultipliers with
avalanche photodiodes.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
