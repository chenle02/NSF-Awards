The aim of the project is to study double affine Hecke algebras, new and very
useful objects in representation theory with many applications in mathematics
and mathematical physics. The main objectives are as follows:&lt;br/&gt;1)
semisimple and unitary representations of double affine Hecke&lt;br/&gt;
algebras and the harmonic analysis direction,&lt;br/&gt;2) the counterpart of
the Jantzen filtration and its connection&lt;br/&gt; to the Plancherel formula
for affine Hecke algebras,&lt;br/&gt;3) the non-semisimple theory and its
applications to the&lt;br/&gt; decomposition of the polynomial
representation,&lt;br/&gt;4) the polynomial representation as |q|=1 and at roots
of unity&lt;br/&gt; with possible relations to Lusztig's quantum
groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theory of double affine Hecke algebras attracts
now quite a few specialists in representation theory and neighboring
fields.&lt;br/&gt;It has deep relations to physics (the quantum many-body
problem, Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation, Verlinde algebras and
more).&lt;br/&gt;It also provides deep formalization of the concept of the
Fourier transform, demonstrates the power of p-adic methods and tremendous
potential of the q-functions. The project includes algebraic and analytic
aspects of this quickly growing theory and applications, for instance, possible
applications to the Langlands duality.&lt;br/&gt;
