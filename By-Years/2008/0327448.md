The PIs propose to conduct a high-resolution near-bottom bathymetric and
magnetic survey and sampling program of the PACMANUS hydrothermal area and to
collect and analyze fluid and solid samples and geophysical data from PACMANUS
and Desmos hydrothermal systems in the eastern Manus Basin (EMB). Their goal is
to integrate Leg 193 drill core data with comprehensive chemical, mineral,
isotopic, and geophysical data to identify and constrain the key variables that
influence crustal alteration, fluid chemistry, deposit composition and
morphology, and the range of habitats available for biological communities in
felsic-rock hosted systems. The idea is to study the entire system, including
alteration assemblages at depth. Specific goals are to 1) delineate the tectonic
and structural controls on hydrothermal activity within felsic crust of the EMB;
2) examine interaction of hydrothermal fluids with rocks of felsic composition
(dacite to rhyodacite), which represent an endmember in the spectrum of basement
compositions; 3) constrain geochemical processes responsible for ore formation;
and 4) assess the role of magmatic fluids in EMB hydrothermal
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
