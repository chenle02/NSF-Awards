This proposal focuses on intracellular transport, "protein trafficking," in
neurons. Neurons, which are highly polarized cells, must synthesize,
translocate, and package numerous intracellular, extracellular, and membrane
proteins in order to maintain their normal structure and function. The
photoreceptor is an example of a highly polarized neuron which must produce and
transfer membrane proteins to the outer segment proteins to the
interphotoreceptor space and synaptic terminal. It is not entirely clear how
neurons handle the processing of so many proteins. Dr. Carter-Dawson proposes to
use the photoreceptor cell as a model to examine the processing of extracellular
matrix constituents and membrane glycoproteins. In addition to providing
information on "protein trafficking" in neurons, this study will also provide
additional information towards the long-term goal of characterizing the
interphotoreceptor matrix and visual cycle components in normal, developing, and
mature retinas.
