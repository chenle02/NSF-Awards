Conlon 9603627 The ribs and the vertebral column arise exclusively from an array
of transient embryonic structures, the somites. The mechanism of somite
segmentation is of considerable interest as a basic patterning process that
directly affects the vertebral column as well as indirectly affecting a wide
spectrum of trunk structures in normal human development. Perturbations of
somitogenesis by gene mutation and environmental insult are likely to underlie a
broad range of congenital malformations including some proportion of spine
bifida, non-myopathic scoliosis and other dysraphic disorders. This proposal
investigates the hypothesis that the embryonic midline signals to coordinate
somite segmentation on the two sides of the embryo. The nature and identity of
these signals will be identified by experiments performed in vitro on the
embryos of the mouse. The proposed experiments are designed to increase our
understanding of segmentation, specifically the way in which it is coordinated
in the two segmental primordia, so that they can later give rise to the single,
segmented vertebral column.
