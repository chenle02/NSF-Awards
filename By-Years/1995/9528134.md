AST 9528134 Collaborative Project: Independently Determined Distances to the
Magellanic Clouds. Dr. Thomas Moffett at Purdue University and Dr. Thomas Barnes
at the University of Texas expect to complete the determination of distances to
the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds using a technique that is independent of
the standard extragalactic distance methods. Distances are currently obtained
using the Cepheid Period-Luminosity relation, the RR Lyrae mean absolute
magnitude, and main-sequence fitting techniques. These standard methods disagree
and lead to uncertain distance scales. Drs. Barnes and Moffett will use the
visual surface brightness technique to determine distances to the Magellanic
Clouds with the intent of improving the distance measures to these two key
galaxies. ================================================
