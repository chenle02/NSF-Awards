This research investigates the use of disparate sensing modalities within
intelligent microassembly systems. Various microforce sensing technologies are
being experimentally and theoretically investigated, and a framework for sensor
assimilation is being developed. The assimilation framework is based on a real-
time task representation that incorporates sensor models as an integral
component of the task description. The result is an intelligent microassembly
system that seamlessly assimilates disparate sensing modalities throughout
complex microassembly tasks. Based on results obtained with microforce sensing,
the project also develops and fabricates instrumented microgrippers for
intelligent microparts handling. This research will aid in the development of
complex hybrid MEMS devices in two ways; by enabling the microassembly of more
complex MEMS prototypes; and in the development of automatic assembly machines
for assembling and packaging future MEMS devices that require increasingly
complex assembly strategies. An educational component of the project builds on
the research component in three ways; in modifying traditional engineering
courses; in developing new courses that stress interdisciplinary problem
approaches; and in collaborating with a local manufacturing firm in order to
develop short courses in advanced manufacturing technologies for practising
engineers.
