9612663 Rosen This proposal is for the further investigation of a relationship
between the toxicity of various anionic surfactants and certain of their
physicochemical interfacial properties discovered by the principal investigator
and his co-workers in a cooperative research project with the Environmental
Science Department of the Procter and Gamble Company. The proposed project is
for an extension of that investigation to other types of surfactants (cationic,
nonionic, and zwitterionic) and to mixture of surfactants, with the aim of
determining whether that relationship holds also for these systems. The
physicochemical properties will be calculated from surface tension measurements
conducted in the principal investigator's laboratory; the toxicity measurements
will be conducted by the Procter and Gamble Company. The surface tension
measurements will be made on solutions of the surfactants in water of the same
pH and electrolyte composition as that used for the toxicity measurements. In
addition, other physicochemical interfacial properties will be investigated for
possible correction with toxicity. Since all of these physicochemical properties
have known relationships to the chemical structure of the surfactant, the
results of this project should provide guidelines for the selection or design of
surfactants with minimum environmental impact for commercial use. ***
