This award supports Professors Juan Carlos Campuzano of the University of
Illinois at Chicago and Arun Bansil of Northeastern University, to collaborate
in materials research with Professors M. Lindroos and M. Pessa of the Physics
Department of Tampere University of Technology, Finland. They will carry out a
joint theoretical and experimental program to investigate the electronic
structure of the high-Tc superconductors via angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy. Their research builds on the basis of highly productive past
collaboration that has demonstrated the synergistic effect of their
complementary theoretical and experimental expertise. With the increasing
interest in angle-resolved photoemission studies of superconducting compounds,
there is a need to obtain corresponding theoretical intensities. The proposed
research will compare experimental spectra to first-principles predictions of
the photoemission intensities in order to obtain significant new information and
further understanding of the electronic structure of the new superconductors.
Results should also help to establish the extent to which the conventional band
theory picture can be used to describe the normal state electronic structure of
the new materials.
