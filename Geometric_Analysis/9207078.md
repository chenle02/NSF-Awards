The principal investigator will study applications cyclic homology and related
algebraic constructions such as the deformation theory of algebras to quantum
mechanics, microlocal analysis, index theory, and algebraic K-theory. This award
will support research in the general area of differential geometry and global
analysis. Differential geometry is the study of the relationship between the
geometry of a space and analytic concepts defined on the space. Global analysis
is the study of the overall geometric and topological properties of a space by
piecing together local information. Applications of these areas of mathematics
in other sciences include the structure of complicated molecules, liquid-gas
boundaries, and the large scale structure of the universe.
