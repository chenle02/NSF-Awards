Quantum physics has profoundly changed the world since 120 years ago. Its
impacts on mathematics is also deep and huge. The project aims to relate
geometry of 3-dimensional space and quantum physics. The affirmative resolution
of the problems will have impact on our understanding of the 3-dimensional
universe. The nature of the objects under study is also at the intersection of
several different areas of mathematics. The investigator plans on studying all
of these aspects, and expects that techniques from each area will shed new light
on the other areas involved.

The research is centered at the interface of hyperbolic geometry and quantum
invariants. The PI?s dual expertise in these two very different fields makes him
well prepared to tackle the problems. The project is articulated along three
inter-related research themes involving the asymptotics of quantum invariants
and their relationship with hyperbolic geometry. Specific goals include: (1)
Find an explicit formula of the adjoint twisted Reidemeister torsion of a closed
hyperbolic 3-manifold in terms of the length of the edges of a geometric
triangulation of the manifold. (2) Attack the Volume Conjecture and the
Asymptotic Expansion Conjecture for Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants of closed
oriented hyperbolic 3-manifolds and for Turaev-Viro invariants for hyperbolic
3-manifolds with totally geodesic boundary. (3) Study the asymptotics of the
quantum invariants of self-homeomorphisms of a surface introduced by Bonahon and
Liu, and relate them to the hyperbolic volume of the (3-dimensional) mapping
torus of the homeomorphism. This research will be partially conducted with a few
collaborators, whose expertise can be an asset to the program.
