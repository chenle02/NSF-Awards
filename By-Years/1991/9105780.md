With NSF support, Dr. Feinman has conducted archaeological survey in the Ejutla
Valley which is located in South Central Mexico to the south of the Valley of
Oaxaca. This latter, with its prehistoric capital of Monte Alban, saw the rise
of a centralized state which likely controlled a large hinterland. After many
years of archaeological research, the prehistory of Oaxaca is fairly well known.
As a result of the Ejutla survey, Dr. Feinman was able to begin an examination
of the interaction between this marginal area and the center at Monte Alban. Dr.
Feinman has located a large stratified site on the edge of the modern town of
Ejutla. Large surface scatters of shell fragments as well as in situ material
indicate that this area served as a factory in which shells brought from the
Pacific coastline were turned into finished objects and then presumably traded
to Monte Alban. Excavation will provide information on the time interval covered
and the social context in which this work took place. Analysis of the objects
themselves will identify shell species - and through this areas of origin - and
will also allow reconstruction of the manufacturing process. These data will
provide insight into the interactions between the core area of Monte Alban and
the Ejutla periphery. This research is important for several reasons. First, it
will provide insight into how complex societies arise and are maintained.
Secondly, it will increase our understanding of the interactions between core
and peripheral areas and how these develop and change over time.
