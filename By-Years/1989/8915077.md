This award will support Prof. Richard Shiavi of Vanderbilt University in a
research collaboration with Prof. Antonio Pedotti of the Centro di Bioingegneria
in Milan, Italy. The purpose of the research is to combine the expertise at both
centers in order to investigate and analyze human locomotion. The researchers
plan to develop several gait analysis procedures for a single laboratory
environment that would utilize current measurement techniques, analytic
procedures, and interactive graphical interfaces. The extensive adaptability of
motor control of locomotion makes bipedal locomotion extremely versatile, but
consequently, makes its investigation extremely difficult. Depending upon the
aspect of gait being investigated, some combination of electromyographic,
kinematic, and dynamic measurements are required. Prof. Shiavi has developed
several techniques for analyzing muscle activity while researchers in Milan have
developed procedures to analyze the dynamics of locomotion and study motor
control. By combining these techniques and procedures, the researchers intend to
develop and make available to researchers and clinicians quantitative analytic
tools useful in gait evaluation.
