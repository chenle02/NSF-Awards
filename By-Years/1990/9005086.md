A GPS survey network will investigate the relationship between caldera
deformation and deformation of the Taupo Volcanic Zone (TVZ) OF North Island,
New Zealand. GPS stations in these high strain rate areas will be resurveyed in
the second year of this experiment. The high accuracy epoch GPS measurements
which are made during the surveys will also be the basis for future deformation
monitoring. It is anticipated that future measurements will be made by Victoria
University and the NZGS as GPS programs are developed there.
