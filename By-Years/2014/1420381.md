Algorithmic mechanism design, or Â "incentive engineering", is a topic of great
importance at the intersection of game theory, economics and computer science.
Research in this field focuses on the design and analysis of algorithms or
protocols that are explicitly designed so that rational participants, motivated
solely by their self-interest, will end up achieving the designer's goals. In
the age of the Internet, the set of important mechanism design applications is
vast, including online auctions, advertising auctions, file sharing, routing and
scheduling, among others. This project is aimed at developing the foundations of
algorithmic mechanism design and its applications.

More specifically, the primary goal of the project is to develop simple and
robust mechanisms for fundamental problems in algorithmic mechanism design under
more realistic modeling assumptions than those used in the past. Building on the
theoretical foundations of game theory and computer science, the research will
explore auction design in the fundamental setting of agents whose values are
correlated or common, and in more realistic settings where agents that do not
know their values can spend time and money to learn about them. The PI will also
explore mechanism design in repeated and online settings, as well as game-
theoretic matching problems.

This research has a great potential to influence mechanisms employed in online
auctions, a huge societal benefit.
