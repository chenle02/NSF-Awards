This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is aimed at optimizing
the mass-transport properties of the cathode electrode for high temperature
(120C), and dry air operation. The overall objective is to fabricate complete
catalyst coated membranes utilizing the newly engineered cathode electrode
layer, and test the improvements in a high temperature(120C) fuel cell. A second
objective is to understand the water and reactant transport mechanisms occurring
in the cathode electrode that are limiting the operating temperature and
requiring high levels of cathode humidification. &lt;br/&gt; Major benefits
could be realized if proton exchange membrane fuel cells could be operated under
hotter (&gt; 90C) and drier conditions on the air electrode. Higher operating
temperatures allow for an easier system heat rejection and a greater anode
tolerance to CO contaminants typically found in reformed hydrocarbon fuel
streams. Similar benefits can also be realized in building co-gen applications
where a higher temperature. &lt;br/&gt;
