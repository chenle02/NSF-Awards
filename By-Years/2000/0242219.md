The vortex tube is a simple device that is capable of separating a flow into two
streams with different temperatures. Despite its simplicity, the thermal-fluid
behavior of the vortex tube remains a subject of considerable controversy. The
recirculating, compressible, highly swirling flow within a vortex tube is
difficult to model. Accurate experimental measurements of the internal
distributions of temperature, pressure, and velocity are not available because
conventional measurement techniques such as invasive probes or flow
visualization using seeding particles are not effective in this environment.

A non-invasive laser technique that does not require particle seeding has been
designed. The technique is based on chromatic analysis of laser light scattered
by the gas itself. The focus of this project will be the development of this
technique. Initial experimental results will be compared with measurements using
conventional flow visualization techniques under benign, benchmark flow
conditions in order to verify the technique. The internal distribution of
temperature, pressure, and velocity in a vortex tube will subsequently be
measured.

This work will produce two significant results. First, the experimental
measurements will provide vortex tube data of unprecedented detail and accuracy,
revealing the processes that govern its unique behavior. Second, a powerful,
non-invasive technique for obtaining detailed measurements in complex flows will
be developed and demonstrated. The measurement technique promises to be useful
in other areas such as turbomachinery.
