Abstract ATM-9413294 Flatau, Piotr J. University of California, San Diego Title;
Aircraft Radiation Observations During TOGA COARE Radiation data collected
during TOGA COARE by NOAA-P3 Turboprops will be processed, analyzed and
synthesized. I will be inter compared with NCAR Electra and NASA DC-8 radiation
measurements. Boundary layer cloud information and SST will be obtained from
PRT- 5 data. The aircraft data will be combined with the synoptic scale analysis
using ECMWF and NOGAPS models to define large scale conditions. Using BETTS-
RIDGWAY scheme, radiative transfer budgets will be calculated over the TOGA
COARE area. These results will be compared with the results obtained for CEPEX
area to understand similarities and differences between the boundary layers
under similar large scale atmospheric radiation conditions but with different
SSTs.
