This action is to support the cost of an international conference on behavioral
and cellular neurobiology. It brings together, for scientific exchange, U.S. and
Taiwanese scientists who are working on behavioral, molecular and cellular
approaches to the study of the function of the nervous system. This conference
has three objectives: 1) to facilitate the exchange of scientific information by
researchers that are currently working in related fields; 2) to initiate or
extend collaborative research projects between U.S. and Taiwanese scientists who
are using complementary approaches to research issues; and 3) to introduce novel
or recently developed research techniques such as high speed in vitro and in
vivo electrochemical detection, which are not yet in common use in Taiwan.
