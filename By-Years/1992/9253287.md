This project is a four year program to build a partnership between four school
districts in Westmoreland County, PA, local industry, and Saint Vincent College,
in support of mathematics and science education in the four districts. The
project will consist of three components: 1) 10 day summer academies for 90
elementary teachers from the La Trobe School District (grades k-6), with school
year follow-up support for implementation and evaluation of new mathematics and
science activities developed during the academies; 2) the development of 24
teams (6 per participating school district) consisting of a junior or senior
high school "lead or mentor" teacher, an industrial scientist and a college
scientist. The scientists will introduce the teachers to their work environments
and will assist them in the development of appropriate hands-on classroom
activities to improve their mathematics and science courses: and 3) three five
day seminars for 18 selected teachers to develop and implement an integrated
mathematics-science capstone course for high school seniors in the four school
districts. Cost sharing equals 120.2% of the NSF award.
