Abstract This work is intended to complement and provide a theoretical basis for
interpretation of flare and flare-related phenomena during the current solar
maximum. The two primary processes to be investigated are (1) the mechanism
responsible for initiating and driving the coronal mass ejection, the solar
flare and associated phenomena, and (2) magnetic reconnection and its potential
role in energy conversion, heating and particle acceleration. Numerical
modelling forms the core of the theoretical approach to be used in studying
these topics, although some analytical studies will be used for the second
topic. A primary objective will be to relate the results to observations. In
particular, the first study will be directly compared to observations from white
light coronagraphs, as well as to x-ray and H alpha data. The second study has
application to x-ray, EUV, and H alpha data and to observations with particle
detectors. ***
