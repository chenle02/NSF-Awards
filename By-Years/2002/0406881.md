AST 0406881 Gladstone

Dr. G. Randall Gladstone will reduce and analyze existing observations that were
taken with the Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) instrument at the Canada-
France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) in 1999 and 2000 of Jupiter's H3+ and H2 auroral
emissions at infrared (IR) wavelengths near 2 micron. With the FTS in
spectroimaging (BEAR) mode, 14 high-resolution interferogram cubes were obtained
that contain bright H3+ and H2 emission lines from the northern and southern
auroral regions. Careful analyses of these data will provide information on the
spatial distribution of composition, temperature, and ion and neutral wind
velocities in Jupiter's thermosphere. Preliminary reduction indicates
electrojet-type winds of up to 6 km/s (apparently supersonic, since the expected
thermal speed is 2-3 km/s). Preliminary derived temperatures are about 35% lower
in the northern aurora than in the south, while derived H3+ column densities in
the south are about an order of magnitude lower than in the north.

Further reduction of these data can provide an unprecedented window on the
dynamics and energetics of Jupiter's upper atmosphere and will yield much needed
constraints for a newly-developed Jupiter Thermosphere General Circulation Model
{JTGCM). Our understanding of the upper atmosphere of Jupiter has changed very
rapidly over the last decade, primarily as a result of a great wealth of data
from ground-based observatories {e.g., CFHT, IRTF), Earth-orbiting observatories
{e.g., HST, Chandra), and spacecraft {e.g., Voyager, Ulysses, Galileo, Cassini).
A model such as JTGCM is required to help make sense of all these data, but
finding suitable model constraints is quite difficult. The CFHT data to be
reduced and analyzed here provide the only information on the spatial
distribution of Jupiter's high-altitude ion and neutral winds available for the
foreseeable future. These observations were made as part of an international
collaboration involving several colleagues from the Observatoire de Paris-Meudon
and the Institut d' Astrophysique de Paris. ***
