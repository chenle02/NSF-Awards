This project supports a workshop and briefing paper to be done by the National
Academy of Sciences on the research interface between the mathematical sciences
and materials research. The briefing paper will be used in planning at the
National Science Foundation and will be distributed to other Federal agencies
and industrial groups that fund research in the mathematical sciences and
materials science. The project has particular promise for identifying research
opportunities at the interface between the mathematical sciences and materials
science. Materials science applies techniques of chemistry and physics to real
materials. Current research depends upon correlations that have been arrived at
through exhaustive laboratory experiments and simulations. Mathematical models
of composite materials hold the promise of predicting strength, flexibility, and
electrical resistance of a proposed composite without conducting extensive
testing.
