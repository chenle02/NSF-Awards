9350523 Ridd A growing world-wide supply of environmental data, the availability
of sophisticated and inexpensive computer-based hardware, and the development of
user-friendly, flexible software makes possible the development of modules which
can put students in touch with the world at any scale from the locality of the
student to the world at large. Many national and international organizations are
networked and committed to collecting and sharing increasing volumes of Earth-
environmental data. There is a growing awareness of global change and
environmental stress and the responsibility humans have for these conditions and
their amelioration. Students can and should be part of the quest to explore
these questions in new ways. Through hands-on, image analysis and Geographic
Information Systems (GIS) digital map manipulation, secondary school students
can overlay remote-sensed data to see vital relations at the interface between
humans and the natural world. Two modules, of two weeks duration, are developed
in this pilot project: One is global in perspective such as decertification or
tropical deforestation; the other concerns local conditions such as water use.
The modules are developed by teachers, science educators and scientists working
together and are field tested in diverse locations. The software runs on a 386
equivalent computer with enough memory to accommodate ArcView files and 4 MB of
RAM. The project is governed by a national advisory board and has two external
evaluators to document the effects on students and teachers. ***
