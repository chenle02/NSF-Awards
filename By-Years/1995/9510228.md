This project is for Collaborative Research at Undergraduate Institutions,
involving evolutionary and developmental biology, mathematics and computer
sciences. One of the fundamental questions in biology is how variation in form
arises from a general pattern common to a group of closely related species.
Although a lot of descriptive detail is available about changes in shape and
size of an animal during embryonic development, we lack precise and quantitative
descriptions for irregular biological forms. This multidisciplinary approach
will use new imaging technology ald recent advances in geometrical theory to
establish some novel mathematical equations to characterize how the shape of a
complex structure develops and evolves. The quantification of sizes and shapes
of musculoskeletal structures in amphibians will be used to compare features at
different times during development, and to compare features in evolutionarily
related groups. The project brings together faculty and students from biology
and computer science. Results will be important in interpreting how variation in
timing of developmental events can be a mechanism for evolutionary change. This
work has a potentially major impact on developmental and evolutionary biology,
and promises a novel cross-disciplinary experience involving undergraduates in
exciting research.
