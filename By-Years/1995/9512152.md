Abstract Zhao 9512152 This proposal is for the development and testing of an
inductively-coupled plasma (ICP) etching and deposition system for advanced
material and device processing. A class-100 clean room will be used in which
etching of stable semiconductors such as 6H-SiC and GaN among others will be
carried out. A major goal of this research is to provide feedback and
suggestions to the industrial partner regarding possible improved design for
final commercialization of the ICP system. Efforts will include the setting up
of a prototype ICP system and evaluate its etching capabilities and its
comparison with other available systems such as RIE and ECR.
