This project reshapes the curriculum and laboratory structure for the two-
semester Introduction to Computer Science sequence. Students explore the role of
abstraction in both program development and reasoning about computation. This
change allows the course to play an important general-education role, letting
non-computer-scientists sample the computer-science world view. It also allows
the prospective majors to gain an early perspective on the field. To accomplish
this change, the Scheme dialect of Lisp, which better supports abstraction and
exploratory programming, is used which necessitates switching from personal
computers to more powerful workstations. To support this means of delivery,
allow exploration of abstraction mechanisms, and allow empirical study of
computational phenomena, the project uses 17 NeXTstation computer workstations
and supporting file servers, printer, and system software. In order that the
students have a positive, fruitful laboratory experience, the project also
includes a switch to scheduled, structured, supervised lab sessions, rather than
a drop-in computer room.
