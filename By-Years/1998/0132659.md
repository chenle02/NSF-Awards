This research proposes to exploit timing diagrams to improve formal verification
for system designs. Formal verification is a valuable debugging technique, but
scalability and usability problems hinder its broader use. Timing diagrams
promise to alleviate both problems because they arise from the design community
and engender more restrictive computational models than existing verification
notations. The proposed research (1) enhances timing diagrams with constructs
needed to capture realistic verification problems and (2) develops scalable and
compositional verification techniques that exploit timing diagrams' unique
computational characteristics for improved scalability and efficiency. The
educational aspect of this project focuses on increasing students' skills in
modeling and reasoning about system designs through a combination of curricular
enhancements and hands-on projects. The combination of these research and
educational objectives enables wider adoption and increased feasibility of
formal verification in real-world design practice.&lt;br/&gt;
