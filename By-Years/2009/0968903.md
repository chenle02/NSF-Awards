At the core of a successful undergraduate education in STEM disciplines is the
capacity to offer students the opportunity to practice scientific inquiry
through the iteration that connects the use of modern technology and captivating
areas of research. This project is centered on a research program to study Heavy
Ion Collisions at European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) with the
ALICE experiment in two areas of interest: the jet physics capabilities brought
to ALICE by the electromagnetic calorimeter (EMCal), and a modest R&D component
to explore the enhancement of the EMCaL physics possibilities by improving
ALICE's track-by-track particle identification capabilities with the
construction of a very high momentum charged particle identification detector
(VHMPID), and the expansion of the number of the EMCaL modules.

Recruiting, retaining, and educating science, technology, engineering and
mathematics students and teachers has been identified as the cornerstone in the
effort to improve scientific literacy, maintain economic growth, and to provide
the platform for relevant scientific discoveries. This project addresses these
issues by strengthening a recently instituted high-energy experimental nuclear
physics program at CSU: (1) The use of cutting-edge technology for high-energy
nuclear physics experiments provides an attractive opportunity to captivate and
prepare students, (2) A collaborative program at an international laboratory
exposes students to research experiences they could not otherwise obtain at an
undergraduate university. Because of the make-up of our student population, the
location of our university and the current outreach programs of the department,
this program has the potential to promote inner-city underrepresented students
into STEM education.
