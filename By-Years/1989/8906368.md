This award from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program
provides partial support for the Fourth International Conference on Bioinorganic
Chemistry which will be held July 23-27, 1989 in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The
conference is the first in this area of research to be held in the United
States. Nearly 100 invited speakers from at least 10 countries will discuss
research concerned with every aspect of the involvement of metals and other
inorganic substances in the function of biological systems. The award will help
enable the attendance of the conference by about 100 graduate students.
