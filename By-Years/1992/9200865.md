This is a doctoral dissertation project to study women's responses to the child
birth experience and to the medical treatment during childbirth. In-depth
interviews will be conducted with women before and after the birth of their
child. The study will contribute to the understanding of the social
psychological processes which accompany childbirth and possibly to the
development of policies that would improve women's child birth experience.
