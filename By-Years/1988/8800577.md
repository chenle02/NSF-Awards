CEDAR Improvements for the Sondrestrom Observatory This proposal is to improve
the ability of the Sondrestrom (Greenland) Radar Facility to meet the needs of
its many users -- both radio and optical aeronomers. The aspects of the
observatory to be enhanced are the radar facility, the optical facility and
communications. First increased receiver sensitivity will improve the precision
and time resolution of all radar observations. A higher transmitter pulse rate
will enable atmospheric radar studies to be conducted in the ionospheric D-
region and in the mesosphere. The addition of a site crew person whose primary
responsibility will be to monitor and maintain the instruments collocated with
the radar, especially the optical instruments, will improve significantly their
reliability and usefulness. The increased number of optical instruments has
necessitated the need for more experiment space, which will be met by the
addition of an appropriate trailer. Finally, improvements in communications
between the observatory and the rest of the world are planned. These include
developing electronic mail, file transfer, and, possibly, remote login
capabilities using the telephone lines and packet-switched networks.
