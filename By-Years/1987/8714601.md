This project is an investigation of the physical chemistry of metallurgical
slags in iron and steel making processes. The first part of the study deals with
the removal of tramp elements from liquid iron and the second part of the study
deals with the influence of surface-active solutes on the surface tension of
slag melts. These will be elaborated on briefly in that order in the following.
The production of ultra-low C, S and P steels requires that ladle metallurgy be
incorporated as an integral part of the steelmaking process. However, current
ladle metallurgy practice does not provide for the removal of the so-called
tramp elements which occur in recycled scrap steel charged to the Basic Oxygen
Furnace (BOF). These elements include Sn, Pb and Cu which cannot be removed from
steel by selective oxidation into the slag. The increased production of
continuously-cast steel has decreased the availability of in-house scrap, and
hence has increased the extent to which external scrap must be used. In this
project an experimental study will be made of the extent to which Sn, Pb and Cu
can be removed from liquid iron by treatment with CaC2-containing slags. Surface
tension is one of the major factors which influence the lives and stability of
slag foams and the surface tension of metallurgical slags can be significantly
decreased by the presence of small concentrations of surface-active solutes. In
this project an experimental study will be made of the influence of oxygen
pressure and the solutes P2O5, Cr2O3, CaF2 and alkali oxides on CaO-SiO2 and
FeO-based melts. The results will provide a basis for understanding the
phenomenon of slag foaming.
