Abstract Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound - I. Goverman Connection to
Internet Proposal No. NCR-9318050 Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound (GHS)
requests funding to connect to the Internet via the NorthWestNet regional
network. This will greatly aid the current projects in which GHC is already
interacting with a number of regional and national partners to develop common
data systems and form intellectual partnerships. GHC is actively pursuing a
major project to develop a workstation for clinicians. In addition, the GHC has
a long-standing commitment to addressing basic research issues. GHC's Center for
Health Studies already collaborates with a number of academic institutions, both
nationally and internationally. These collaborations will be greatly aided by an
Internet connection.
