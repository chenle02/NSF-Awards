Optimal estimates for three general problems from the theory of elliptic
differential equations will be studied. The first part of the project involves
establishing an Agmon-Miranda maximum principle or showing the failure of such a
principle for all constant coefficient linear elliptic equations in the dilation
invariant setting of Lipschitz domain in Rn. Included here is the completion of
the Lp theory in the manner of Agmon- Douglis-Nirenberg for Lipschitz domains.
The second part involves strong maximum principles and best constant estimates
for conditioned Brownian motion. The third part is concerned with optimal domain
decomposition in the Schwarz iteration method employed in certain numerical
problems.
