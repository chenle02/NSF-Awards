In this project, a field experiment will be conducted to observe turbulent flow
over a coral reef in Palau. The reef site was chosen to be accessible and
represent wave influenced flow so that current models of turbulent fluxes can be
tested. The project also includes a numerical modeling component to test the
theoretical ideas. The research has the potential to improve modeling and
prediction for the biogeochemical fluxes over coral reefs, which are sensitive
to a range of environmental change factors. The project also includes
educational outreach to high school students in California and Palau, to learn
about environmental flow over reefs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will test
the validity of the “law of the wall” for turbulent flow over a rough surface in
the presence of surface gravity waves. Instrumentation for measuring the flow
field and inferring turbulent momentum and energy fluxes as well as dissolved
oxygen fluxes over the reef will be deployed twice over a two-year period.
Idealized modeling of flow over the reef will also be used. The project will
advance the state of the art for oceanic turbulence modeling and apply it to
coral reefs which are notably under threat from environmental
changes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
