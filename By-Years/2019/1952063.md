Teaming with community partners across New York State (NYS), this project will
design a coordinated, statewide public internet of things (IoT) network based on
unlicensed lower power wide area network (LPWAN) technology. The work is
motivated by an imperative need to bridge the digital divide between rural and
urban areas, which has contributed not only to information disparities, but also
greater social, democratic, educational, and economic disparities. The research
will test the concept of IoT networks as a public utility to bridge the digital
divide. This project explicitly sees rural communities as opportunities for
developing new networked technologies which can leapfrog traditional wired
broadband technologies and create new opportunities for local technological
development and innovation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research plan is framed as
a co-design process with community partners to create the envisioned IoT network
through synergetic research and education, living labs and community engagement.
The key feature of the co-design process is to integrate scalable/adaptable
physical networks and trustworthy social networks. The project will identify and
overcome key barriers for adopting LPWAN networks, develop scalable and
adaptable network topology for 100% LPWAN coverage for three types of governance
structures (i.e., cities, towns and villages), and create effective strategies
to build trust among communities of public IoT networks. This project not only
creates the first introductory course in IoT at Cornell University, but also
expands the engaged learning opportunities to citizen across NYS through
innovative community-based learning hubs; a model that can be replicated across
the U.S.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
