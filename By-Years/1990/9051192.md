The Department of Chemistry will acquire an automatic sample changer, a variable
temperature attachment and six microcomputers for use with an existing 300 MHz
NMR spectrometer. The sample changer will run during off hours and greatly
increase the number and sophistication of the NMR experiments the students can
perform. Also to be developed is a "flight simulator" program to run on personal
computers to familiarize students with the menus and displays of the NMR
spectrometer software so they can make efficient use of the instrument during
their hands-on time. The temperature control accessory will enhance the
usefulness of the instrument in the physical chemistry laboratory courses.
