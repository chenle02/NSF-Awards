This proposal from Boston College seeks funding to continue the preparation of
prototype inquiry task items for the TIMSS 2003 international assessment and to
provide a website for teachers that documents students' approaches to responding
to the prototype problems. The second set of activities includes a Questionnaire
Development Group that would consider the most useful types of contextual
information for TIMSS to gather and identify the best vehicle(s) for gathering
it. Support for this project ensures that the 2003 international study can
continue the planning and staff work necessary for the 2003 TIMMS
administration.
