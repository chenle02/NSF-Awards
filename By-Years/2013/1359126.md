The Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign provides twelve undergraduate students each summer
the opportunity to participate in research on topics in biological physics,
high-energy physics, nuclear physics, acoustical physics, astrophysics and
condensed matter physics. In addition to participating in research with an
experienced team of mentors, the REU students will gain knowledge of and
practice technical communications, research collaboration and networking, and
responsible conduct of research. They are given career guidance and advice on
applying for graduate school and graduate research fellowships. By the end of
the program, every student will have presented the results of the work in a mid-
term talk, a final talk, and a research paper.

This REU site will have a number of broader impacts with its focus on providing
research opportunities to undergraduates to help prepare them for future
science, technology, engineering, and mathematics careers. The site has a strong
plan to recruit undergraduate students from groups underrepresented in physics
and from non-research institutions. The project is informed by an on-going
evaluation and there is a plan to disseminate successful undergraduate research
practices.
