This project will apply the geometric theory of exterior differential systems
and Cartan's method of equivalence to a variety of problems arising in
differential equations. Clelland will continue the study of sub-Finsler
geometry, originally introduced by Clelland and Christopher Moseley as a natural
generalization of sub-Riemannian geometry with applications to control theory.
In addition, Clelland will study the geometry of the more general category of
control-affine systems (system with "drift"), with particular attention to the
geometry of systems of non-constant type, where the drift vector field vanishes
along a distinguished submanifold of the state space. The notion of a
"t-codistribution," originally introduced by Elkin, is expected to facilitate
the application of Cartan's method of equivalence to this important case. This
study will eventually include the introduction and analysis of metric structures
akin to sub- Riemannian and/or sub-Finsler geometry for such systems, with
applications to the study of optimal control for control-affine systems.
Clelland will continue her work on the geometry of Backlund transformations,
with emphasis on the geometric significance of the arbitrary parameter that
appears in many (but not all) Backlund transformations, as well as the
classification of "auto-Backlund transformations" for hyperbolic Monge-Ampere
PDEs, which relate solutions of one hyperbolic Monge-Ampere PDE to additional
solutions of the same PDE.

Differential equations have an enormous range of applications, from engineering
and physics to biology and finance, just to name a few. A common theme in all
the proposed projects is the use of geometric techniques to study structural
features of differential equations which may be obscured by the expression of an
equation in a particular choice of coordinates. This approach, pioneered in the
early 20th century by Elie Cartan, has enjoyed great success in furthering the
understanding of many types of differential equations and their solutions. With
the proposed research on sub-Finsler geometry and control-affine systems,
Clelland will apply these techniques to the study of problems related to control
theory, whose applications include areas such as robotics and quantum computing.
With the proposed research on Backlund transformations, Clelland will study
problems related to integrable systems, whose applications include efficient
signal propagation over long distances with minimal distortion in signal
quality.
