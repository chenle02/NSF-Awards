High accuracy calculations of parity forbidden transition amplitudes in heavy,
many--electron atoms are undertaken to provide a test of radiative corrections
to the Standard Model. The corrections are insensitive to the presently unknown
mass of the top quark, which allows a sensitive probe of the new physics. Many
body perturbation theory and coupled cluster techniques, including triple
excitations are required to perform the calculations to an accuracy of .1% in
the Cs atom. In addition, a calculation of the screened Lamb shift in highly
charged ions will be undertaken in order to provide information to compare with
experimental QED radiative corrections in few valence electron atomic systems.
