This US-Russia workshop on Organometallic Chemistry and Catalysis will be held
August 18- 21, 1993 at Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois prior to the
national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Chicago. It was organized
by Michael Doyle, Trinity University and Dr, Mark Vol'pinm Boreskov Institute of
Catalysis, Novosibirsk, Russia, after a delegation of chemists visited Russia in
the Fall of 1992. The subjects for the workshop are of critical scientific
significance in both countries; opportunities for mutual cooperation and
collaboration in these areas are substantial. Twelve participants from each
country will discuss the present status of basic research as well as the future
needs for industrial development, linkage and cooperation. There will be further
contact with US chemists when the FSU participants attend the American Chemical
Society meeting following the workshop. This workshop in organometallic
chemistry and catalysis fulfills the program objectives of advancing science by
enabling leading experts in the US and Russia to combine complementary talents
and pool ideas in the areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
