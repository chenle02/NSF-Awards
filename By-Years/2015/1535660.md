This research considers the links between mining investment, legal rights to the
subsoil, and legal rights to surface lands. Recent scholarship indicates that
the geography of subsoil ownership in the Americas is undergoing significant
changes regarding the pace and type of extractive investments. This study
explores those changes by undertaking a targeted comparative analysis of two
regions that figure prominently in these changes. This research will contribute
to the development of methods not only for researchers but also for the public
to understand legal changes to ownership in contexts where it is rapidly
changing, new land governance structures are in the process of development, and
ownership histories are complex and not readily discernible from available
records.

Long-term case studies will be undertaken in two sites for new forms of
extractive investments: the Marcellus and Utica shale formations in north
central West Virginia and the Intag region of northwest Ecuador, believed to
contain mineral ores. The research focuses on subsoil rights acquisitions, and
uses both qualitative and quantitative methods to determine (i.) how the
geography of subsoil ownership patterns is changing, and (ii.) how these changes
are facilitated or impeded by institutional and governance practices.
