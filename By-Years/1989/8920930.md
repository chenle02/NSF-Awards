In this project the theoretical foundations of databases are being investigated
through the use of discrete mathematics. Research is conducted toward two major
subgoals, i.e. to: (1) Find conceptually simple set-theoretic and/or algebraic
models of database issues and practices, especially those associated with the
relational database model. Examples of such models are those for object
histories, spreadsheets, sequential- data query languages, and nested relations.
Such models are in contrast with the familiar logical and programming language
models. (2) Use these models to address significant questions of database
studies and possibly in other areas of computer science interest. Such questions
are being suggested by either (a) the underlying database physical situation and
design methodologies or (b) analytic considerations and the underlying
mathematical formalism. Results of this research are expected to formulate a
better understanding of current database concerns, as well as provide tools for
examining and solving database management problems. For example, one line of
activity is addressing the fundamental problem of data restructuring, i.e., what
does it mean, how can it be accomplished, and what are the fundamental laws
related to it.
