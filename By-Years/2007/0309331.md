This research investigates the community dynamics of malarial parasites in a
tropical host bird species, the Clay-colored robin, Turdus grayi. Preliminary
data show that multiple-species infections are common in tropical birds, that
there is rapid turnover of species in the host blood stream, that parasites vary
seasonally in prevalence, and that nearly all juvenile birds are infected. The
proposed research on captive birds will describe, for the first time, the
temporal dynamics of a community of naturally occurring blood parasites. These
data will be used to describe how interactions among parasites result in
observed variation in parasite life history traits and infection patterns.
Broader impacts of this research include the application of new tools and the
training of a Panamanian student in field and laboratory techniques. Results may
advance our understanding of disease, and of malaria more specifically.
