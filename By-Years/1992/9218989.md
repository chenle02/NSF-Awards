It is proposed to investigate scent production in Clarkia, a genus of annual
plants native to California. Clarkia breweri is the only species in the genus
with scented flowers. C. breweri flowers are visited mostly by hawkmoths. The
odorless flowers of C. concinna, a closely related species, are visited mostly
by butterflies and flies, whereas all other outcrossing Clarkia species are
pollinated by bees. We have identified four major components of the scent of C.
breweri flowers. They are linalool, linalool oxide, benzyl acetate, and methyl
salicylate, all important ingredients in manufactured perfumes. We propose to
conduct a formal genetic study of the genes controlling the production of these
compounds in C. breweri, and to use molecular biological techniques to isolate
the gene encoding the enzyme linalool synthase (LS) that catalyzed the synthesis
of linalool. The genetic changes underlying the ability of C. breweri to make
linalool, while its close relatives do not, will be examined. %%% Flower scents
have profound effects on the reproduction of plants and are also important in
many man-made products. However, the synthesis of flower scents has been
scarcely investigated on the genetic and molecular level and the results
obtained from this work will produce significant insights into this process.
