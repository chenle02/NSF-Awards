9707443 Lackmann The ultimate goal of this project is to gain insights into the
large-scale atmospheric flow patterns that precede and accompany heavy
precipitation events (HPE). HPE's are here defined as those events where
precipitation exceeds the average 24 hour seasonal rainfall totals by two
standard deviations. If characteristic flow patterns associated with such events
can be identified , new insights about the diabatic heating and precipitation
processes and feedbacks involved may be obtained. This information, in turn,
could serve as the basis for better parameterization of the physics in numerical
forecast models. The principal investigator has obtained some promising results
with a preliminary study of HPE's over western Canada. This study will examine
HPE's in the northeastern part of the U.S., principally in the cold season. His
analyses will involve both composite and case studies of these events diagnosed
from a quasi-geostrophic potential vorticity perspective and will examine the
role of moisture transports in the evolution of HPE's. This award is part of
NSF's Research in Undergraduate Institutions activity. Dr. Lackmann will involve
several undergraduates directly in his research.
