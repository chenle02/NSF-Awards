This is an important project which requests time on the Cornell supercomputer to
study the relative computational efficiencies of parallel and serial processors
in solving very large economic optimization problems. The supercomputer is
becoming a very important research tool in economic analysis. Many economic
models which are realistic from a behavioral standpoint are not computationally
tractable on standard mainframe computers. They are, however, solvable with the
aid of a supercomputer. This project develops efficient vector algorithms for
the solution of large economic optimization models. Technically, the research
models large-scale equilibrium economies as variational inequality problems.
This general set of problems encompasses a wide variety of economic frameworks,
such as oligopolistic markets, inventory and investment optimization for firms,
allocation and management of non-renewable resources, and traffic networks.
Professor Nagurney is an experienced researcher in the areas of mathematical
programming and economic optimization.
