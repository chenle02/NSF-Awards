This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project proposes to
evaluate the feasibility of obtaining statistics (mean, RMS and spatial
correlation) of mixing of particulates in turbulent pipe flows. The two key
issues that will be addressed during the proposed work are: (1) the feasibility
of obtaining local statistics of particles in a turbulent smoke jet using the
deconvolution algorithm, and (2) the feasibility of obtaining laser extinction
measurement in smoke laden turbulent flow confined within a pipe. Two tasks are
planned to address the feasibility of obtaining statistics of particulates in a
turbulent pipe flow. The first is to evaluate the deconvolution algorithm in a
turbulent smoke jet. The second is to utilize the algorithm in a smoke laden
turbulent pipe flow with a variable size opening on the pipe. The statistics of
particulates confined in the pipe will be determined asymptotically by varying
the opening size. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two major commercial
applications for the on-line monitoring of particulates in confined turbulent
flows. The first involves online monitoring of particulate emission from engines
and smoke stacks. Power plants, waste-to-energy plants and chemical industries
that apply high cost particulate controls would be interested in identifying the
efficiency of their control devices at various process conditions. The second
application involves assuring quality control in process industries. Solids and
powder processing, power, chemical and pharmaceutical industries would benefit
the most from the quality improvements that are enabled with on-line particulate
monitoring in pipes. The additional commercial application of the particulate
monitor will be to help two-phase flow scientists in universities and research
laboratories to obtain data for model validation&lt;br/&gt;
