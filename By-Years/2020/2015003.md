The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project will be to improve math education by integrating cognitive and
behavioral approaches to learning. This project will develop a novel data-driven
approach to understanding the underlying root cause of students' mathematics
struggles to enable appropriate interventions in a practical solution addressing
the needs of educators of all grade levels and content. This will be
particularly important in a virtual learning environment, such as that generated
in the COVID-19 crisis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project integrates cognitive, behavioral, and learning
research. The innovation will add measures of self-control to existing cognition
measures. This development is important because of the high variation in
behavioral responses across learners. This innovation is expected to help
develop independent, self-regulated learners by enabling the delivery of
evidence-based teaching (EBT) with fidelity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
