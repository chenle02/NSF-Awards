This research seeks to design an apparatus capable of measuring permeability of
wafers/disks drilled through a weathered surface. Permeability changes can then
be compared with more standard petrologic and geochemical analyses. The ability
to make such determinations has a wide range of theoretical and practical
applications, but has not been done heretofore.
