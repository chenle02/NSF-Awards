Supermassive black holes (SMBH) are thought to be at the center of many, if not
most, galaxies. They can provide information about how galaxies and black holes
(BHs) form, and provide a laboratory for testing fundamental physics. The work
proposed here will enhance our knowledge of how SMBHs form and advance our
understanding of the early Universe. The research will measure the masses of BHs
in distant quasars by studying the spectra of the objects. The work will provide
constraints on the physical properties of newly-formed SMBHs. The results will
aid researchers in interpreting data from upcoming facilities such as the James
Webb Space Telescope (JWST).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through single-epoch
spectroscopy, the investigators will use the technique of reverberation mapping
to estimate BH mass in distant quasars. They will significantly improve quasar
BH mass estimation over a wider range of distances (hence, ages). The statistics
derived will help guide future investigations on early-stage BHs using JWST,
30-meter telescopes, and upcoming time-domain multi-object spectrograph
projects.
