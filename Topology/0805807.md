This project deals with invariants in low-dimensional topology which come from
gauge theory and symplectic geometry. The focus will be the relation between
these invariants and fibered manifolds, in particular, whether these invariants
detect fibered 3-manifolds. It is hoped to prove that Monopole Floer homology
detects fibered 3-manifolds, which is the analogue of a known result in Heegaard
Floer homology. Another goal of this project is to study a problem of Boileau
concerning surgeries on null-homotopic knots.

The shape of the universe is modelled on three and four dimensional manifolds,
which are the objects studied in this project. Understanding such shapes is an
important step towards the understanding of the universe we live in. In the
microscopic world, macromolecules are often visualized as knots and links in the
three space. The knot invariants studied in this project thus provide important
tools in analyzing the structures of macromolecules, which turn out to be
extremely significant in pharmacology.
