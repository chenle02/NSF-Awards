This research asks whether local electoral structures have an impact on
African-American office-holding and public policy outcomes. The answer is
important for two reasons. First, knowing when and how electoral structures
matter is important for minority groups wanting to increase their voice in local
politics. Second, knowing when and how political institutions matter is a
broader question of importance within political science. This research has two
parts. The first part examines large, cross-sectional data sets. These data are
used to determine the impact of local electoral structures on African-American
office-holding on city council and school boards. In turn the analysis shows the
impact of changes in minority representation on policy outcomes such as
redistributive spending by municipalities and minority hiring by school
districts. The second part of the research looks at the voting patterns of city
council members in three northern and three southern cities, matched on
population, over the period 1970 to 1995. These data enable the PI to more
carefully explore the impact of electoral structures on policy outcomes and bi-
racial coalition patterns among white and African-American council members.
