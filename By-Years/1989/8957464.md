The development and testing of knowledge based computer tools, collectively
called distributed and integrated environment for computer-aided engineering
(DICE), for the integration and coordination of various phases and participants
of the engineering process are being pursued. The primary objectives of DICE are
to: (1) facilitate effective coordination and communication in various
disciplines involved in engineering; (2) capture the process by which individual
designers make decisions, that is, what information was used, how it was used
and what did it create; (3) forecast the impact of design decisions on
manufacturing or construction; (4) provide designers interactively with detailed
manufacturing process or construction planning and; (5) develop intelligent
interfaces for automation.
