This award is to research, develop and implement a comprehensive control system
for Turning Centers in close collaboration with an industrial co-sponsor. This
control scheme will be based on reliable process models, the sensing and
processing of multiple process monitoring signals and the intelligent control of
the system in response to limiting factors and disturbances. Identified areas of
research which provide viable, incremental advances towards the goal of computer
integrated, untended manufacturing will be investigated with emphasis on the
development of intermediate products and solutions. The proposed work, even
though limited to the turning process, is an essential part of the necessary
research that will advance the capability and efficiency of manufacturing.
Working in close contact with industry will also allow the transfer of research
efforts in an efficient manner and foster future relationships between the
researcher and industry.
