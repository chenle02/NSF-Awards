This research addresses that class of optimization problems known as nonlinear
integer programming problems which can be formulated as unconstrained
maximization problems of real-valued functions in 0-l variables. These functions
are often called pseudo-Boolean functions (pBf). It is expected that this
research will lead to the clarification of certain fundamental properties of
pBf's and the recognition and use of special classes of pBf's for which
efficient optimization algorithms can be devised. A new concept called "roof
duality" will be a major tool for designing such optimization algorithms.
