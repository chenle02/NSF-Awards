This proposal consists of the upgrading of chemical instrumentation at Western
Oregon State College for the purpose of undergraduate instruction. The project
will provide students with laboratory experiences which relate to techniques
utilized in the modern analysis or research laboratory. It will improve the
infrared spectroscopic capabilities through the addition of the Perkin-Elmer
Model 1650 FT-IR system. The acquisition of accessories for multiple internal
reflectance and diffuse reflectance measurements will offer the possibility of
developing new applications of IR spectroscopy for the teaching laboratory. This
instrument will be used extensively in organic, analytical instrumental
analysis, advanced experimental chemistry courses and undergraduate research
projects.
