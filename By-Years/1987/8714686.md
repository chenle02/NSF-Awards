The overall goal of this project is to explore concepts for flexible forming of
sheet parts of employing in-process measurement and control concepts. The intent
is to eliminate long setup and tooling development times, to greatly improve the
process of conventional tooling design and to permit small lot size production
of complex sheet parts. The work will focus on refinement of the Deformation
Transfer Function concept, and on the coupling of this concept with the flexible
forming system that the principal investigator has worked with prior to this
project. The control theory work will concentrate on making stronger theoretical
connection between the transfer function concept and elastic springback in
forming, and on extensions to polymer and composite material. Experimental work
will be conducted on the axisymmetric system and on the variable configuration
die system. The variable configuration forming machine itself will be fully
evaluated, and some novel forming methods based on its unique characteristics
will be tested. Finally, a completely integrated shape commanded forming system,
comprising the new forming machine and the Deformation Transfer Function forming
control strategy will be developed.
