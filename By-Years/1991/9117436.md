The American Geological Institute (AGI) provides a variety of informational
services to the geoscience research community including a geological references
database (GeoRef), a bibliography and index of geology, human resources surveys,
a directory of geoscience departments, and a glossary of geological terms.
Replacement of an obsolete data processing system will allow AGI to continue to
provide these services and to improve its ability to handle the bibliographic
data, human resources surveys, and maintain lists of data sources. This will
involve improving the present network by adding a new server, adding a
statistical analysis workstation, and replacing the 18 terminals on the old
network with new workstations for the upgraded network. With this system upgrade
AGI can provide information much more specifically tailored to the topical and
geographical needs of the research community.
