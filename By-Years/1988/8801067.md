The tidal motions in the atmosphere, which originate at stratospheric levels
with the absorption of solar radiation by water vapor and by ozone, propagate
upward through the mesosphere and dissipate in the thermosphere. They transfer
heat and momentum (acceleration of the mean flow) into the region. the tidal
motions are detected at mesospheric and thermospheric levels (50 to 120km in
altitude) by the doppler shift of the airglow emission lines, by meteor scatter
radars, and by incoherent scatter radars. This award is for a theoretical
modelling effort to include the tides in a numerical general circulation model
of the atmosphere running on the Cray computer at the National Center for
Atmospheric Research in Boulder, CO. The results of several coordinated
observational campaigns on the Coupling, Energetics, and Dynamics of Atmospheric
Regions (CEDAR) will be interpreted in comparison with the model.
