Individuals differ in how well they survive, grow and reproduce, but the reasons
for these differences are not well understood. Previous work has shown that
either the intrinsic quality of the individual, the quality of the environment
in which they were raised, the quality of the environment that they inhabit, or
the social environment, may affect an individual's success. No study has
examined the relative importance of all these factors within a single species.
The central aim of this study is to elucidate the reason for differences in the
performance of individuals in nature by manipulating all of these factors
simultaneously. Molecular genetic characterization of individuals will be
combined with large scale field experiments to test the magnitude of these
factors in the ant model system, Pogonomyrmex occidentalis. The results of these
experiments will be combined with an ongoing twenty-year study of the population
biology of this species to provide a comprehensive measure of the determinants
of individual success. This work will contribute to the development of
biological infrastructure and to student training. The project will involve
undergraduate students from underrepresented groups in scientific research and
will provide mentoring to encourage their continuation in science, technology
and engineering careers post graduation. The data from this study will be made
available through Dryad (datadryad.org) and the Knowledge Network for
Biocomplexity (knb.ecoinformatics.org).
