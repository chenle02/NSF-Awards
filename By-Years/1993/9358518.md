9358518 Ramirez The focus of the research is to develop new knowledge and
methods in the area of engineering design for the purposes of effective teaching
and real-world application that will facilitate the development of engineering
judgment and design vision for new engineers as well as established engineers
facing new technologies. Results from the fields of educational psychology and
cognitive science will be integrated and developed into a cohesive framework for
teaching/learning which will be motivationally-based, student centered, and
vectored towards structured experiential learning for the development of
engineering judgment. The role of spatial and functional visualization in
scientific creativity will be investigated. New knowledge structures and methods
will be developed to cope with the intrinsic characteristics of engineering
design as well as for the accomplishment of the goal of innovation. ***
