This proposal aims to generalize the Stokesian dynamics formulation of fluids
with particles, with a fresh theoretical approach and several new computer
strategies. The multi- particle simulations will consider a variety of
interparticle forces (Brownian, colloidal, external and hydrodynamical forces)
and different length scales in the flow. Microstructural and macroscopic
(rheology, diffusivity, etc.) properties will be determined under nonequilibrium
flow conditions. It is expected that Stokesian simulations of systems with tens
of thousands of degrees of freedom will be possible by using sparse matrix
systems and parallel processing. This will make feasible quantitative
predictions for real systems. The proposed research will provide basic
understanding for design in processing of microstructured fluids, such as
composite materials, polymers, ceramics, etc. Stokesian dynamics will be
developed as a tool for other scientists and engineers.
