9320935 Shea This research will investigate the source of comovements across
various industries at business cycle frequencies. The important fact about
business cycles in the United States is that different industries tend to
experience expansions and contractions at the same time. Most industries do well
simultaneously during a boom; conversely, most industries do poorly
simultaneously during a recession. There are two potential explanations for such
interindustry comovements. One explanation is that different industries tend to
experience similar shocks.The second explanation is the existence of linkages or
complementarities connecting different industries to each other. This research
seeks to determine which types of complementarity, if any have been important
sources of interindustry comovements in the postwar United States.The strategy
adopted in the study is to compare the predictions of various linkage models to
the actual pattern of employment and output comovement among one hundred and
twenty six US manufacturing industries during the postwar period. The results
from this study will help reveal the channels by which shocks are transmitted
across sectors of the economy, and further our understanding of the causes of
business cycles. ***
