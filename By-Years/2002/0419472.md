This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I research project is to
develop an electrochemical detection method for analysis of liver stage
plasmodium falciparum malaria parasites, with the intent of eliminating
interferences, while achieving speed and sensitivity.

The commercial application of this project will be that the proposed product
could lead to an effective malaria vaccine, which could have significant impact
on world health.
