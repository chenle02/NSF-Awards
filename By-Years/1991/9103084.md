The Solid State Sciences Committee (SSSC) of the Board on Physics and
Astronomy, together with the National Materials Advisory Board (NMAB), will co-
host the 1991 SSSC Forum on February 27, 1991. The Forum will be followed on
February 28-March 1, 1991, by a technical meeting organized by the Materials
Research Society (MRS) and sponsored by several other materials societies. The
technical themes of the Forum and the MRS program will be superconductivity and
the science of semiconductor processing. The policy theme of the Forum will be
the results of the National Coordinating Meeting on Materials, held November 29-
30, 1990. The National Coordinating Meeting on Materials culminated the regional
meeting process that was initiated to follow up the National Research Council
study "Materials Science and Engineering for the 1990s." In addition, the Forum
will give special attention to the role of consortia in materials science and
engineering.
