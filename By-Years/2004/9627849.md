9627849 Shu This project is a continuation of the research supported by NSF
Grant ECS-9214488. The object is to study the modeling, mathematical analysis,
and in particular numerical approximations using recently developed, accurate
and stable finite difference and finite element algorithms, for semiconductor
device simulations. The emphasis is on simulating the hydrodynamic (HD) models,
the energy transport (ET), and the quantum hydrodynamic (QHD) models, and
investigating their physical implications. Special attention will be paid to
time dependent problems, such as the multi-valley Gunn oscillator, which require
robust algorithms with high order accuracy both in space and in time.
Collaborations with device physicists, device engineers, and applied
mathematicians will be maintained, to investigate device simulation problems
form both physical, mathematical, and numerical points of view. ***
