The objective of this project is to perform cloud chamber studies of
heterogeneous SO oxidation by combustion products. The proposed 2 experiments
seek to provide answers to the following questions: (1) How do combustion
conditions influence heterogeneous SO oxidation? (2) How 2 does the chemical
modification of particle surfaces in the flame and postflame region influence
their cloud nucleation properties? (3) How does phase change of water vapor
influence SO oxidation at room and 2 subfreezing temperatures? These questions
will be answered in a series of experiments with an experimental cloud chamber.
The chamber is coupled to a combustor, which is a source of cloud nucleation
particles and reactive particulate and gaseous species. The chamber can be
operated in a wide temperature range and enables collection of cloud water
interstitial and total (cloud + interstitial) aerosol for chemical analysis and
real-time measurement of soot content and cloud and interstitial aerosol
