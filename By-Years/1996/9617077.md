PROPOSAL ABSTRACT Proposal Number: 9617077 P.I.: Banchoff, Thomas F.
Institution: Mathematical Association of America Proposal Title: "Communications
in Visual Mathematics": An Interactive Hypertexted Electronic Journal Abstract:
Recent advances in information technology, especially in interactive computer
graphics and hypertext publication, offer to the mathematical profession
opportunities to develop new ways of communicating expository and research
mathematics, particularly in areas that involve sophisticated visualization
techniques and multi-level non-linear documents. This proposal outlines a two-
year experiment aimed at developing an electronic journal, "Communications in
Visual Mathematics:, for eventual inclusion among journal publications of the
Mathematical Association of America. The project will explore issues relating to
electronic publication, with particular attention to geometric visualization,
and it will work toward providing mathematical authors with tools and procedures
for producing interactive hypertext documents for such a journal.
