This proposal seeks to determine the feasibility of scaling up High Performance
Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) separations in the displacement mode of
chromatography for the production of pharmaceutical grade synthetic peptides and
recombinant proteins. In certain cases, HPLC is the only large scale process
step that yields the purity levels required for human therapeutic use.
Conventional elution chromatography can be conveniently scaled up to the level
required in manufacturing, but is expensive, poorly utilizes column capacity and
is difficult to reproducible operate. The displacement mode is performed under
conditions similar to conventional HPLC operations, but instead of a gradient in
eluent strength, the feed components are displaced from the column by a
carefully chosen solution containing a component that is more strongly adsorbed
than any of the feed components. The purified product exits the column in
adjacent bands of individual components just ahead of the displacer front.
Concentrations and column loadings in this mode of chromatography are typically
ten- to one hundred-fold higher than in elution chromatography, and so
displacement more fully exploits the column and equipment capacity. These
factors together with simplified control aspects make displacement
chromatography a promising manufacturing step.
