The New York Botanical Garden, with over 5 million plant specimens, is an
essential resource for botanical research in the U.S. and internationally,
providing vast service to national and international community of scholars and
students. The garden is strongly committed to its collections and research
activities, as indicated by the long range plan to expand into a new wing in
1996 and to begin computerization of the vast holdings. This grant will enable
the Garden to maintain its enormous loan/visitor program and to provide
expansion capabilities until the new building is completed in 1996. Also this
support will allow hitherto unstudied and underused parts of the collection--
lichens and fungi--to be identified, curated and used in the botanical research
and education.
