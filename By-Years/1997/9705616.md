This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase II project will support the
development of a prototype Total Reflection X-Ray Fluorescence (TRXRF)
spectrometer for measuring light element contamination on silicon wafers. The
Phase II approach is to increase the source brightness and detector efficiency
of the Phase I breadboard, while continuing to identify and reduce sources of
interfering background. Phase II will be targeted at demonstrating detection
limits of <4x1013 atoms/cm2 for carbon and < 1x1012 atoms/cm2 for sodium, while
providing a feasibility estimate for achieving the industry's desired goal of
1010 atoms/cm2 for sodium. Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) will
compare solid-state and proportional-counter detectors for this application,
while using the lower detection limits possible with the synchrotron source to
probe the fundamental limits of TRXRF. The technique of X-ray Photoelectron
Spectroscopy (XPS) will be used to cross-check the TRXRF measurements and
monitor uncontrolled surface contamination of samples during handling. The main
commercial applications are to measure light element (boron through aluminum)
contamination of silicon wafers to support the needs of the semiconductor
industry, and for trace analysis of elements in ultra-pure solutions.
