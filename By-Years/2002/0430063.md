Exploiting Fast On-Chip Wires&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As VLSI
technology scales below 100 nanometer feature sizes, the performance of chip-
based systems will be limited by the cost and delay associated with on-chip
communication. An important problem facing future microprocessor designers is
the efficient movement of data on a chip. The objective of the proposed research
is to accurately characterize the cost and performance options for on-chip
interconnect, and to develop micro-architectural approaches that use these
options efficiently. The expected result is a novel class of hybrid
architectures that utilize a small percentage of their wire budget on costly,
low-latency long wires to achieve enhanced performance/cost.
