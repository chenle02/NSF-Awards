This project will make possible interactive, process-oriented laboratory
instruction throughout the biology curriculum. Experiments will emphasize
observation, measurement, organization and analysis of data, and hypothesis
formulation and testing. Students will employ electrophoresis,
spectrophotometry, and centrifugation to investigate topics in biotechnology and
molecular biology, genetics, and environmental biology. Students will use
networked Macintosh workstations to and computer-based instrumentation to
investigate a variety of physiological conditions, as well as to process and
graph data. The new laboratory environment will foster scientific inquiry and
will help students develop critical thinking skills. Students also will use
computer-based post laboratory simulations to reinforce lecture and laboratory
activities. As well, computer augmented instruction will afford a flexibility to
better meet the needs of our single and working parents. Faculty will use the
Macintosh server as a workstation to develop simulations supporting laboratory
materials. Published reports and presentations on the results of this project
will stimulate other community colleges to lab investigations modeled on those
from this project.
