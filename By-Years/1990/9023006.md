Aquaculture production of penaeid shrimp larvae is constrained by costly and
unreliable supplies of live food, especially Artemia nauplii. Despite Japanese
and European commercialization of high quality larval feeds, a complete
replacement for Artemia has not yet emerged. Larval shrimp production continues
to be an industry bottleneck. This research is to formulate and test a complex
microencapsulated feed consisting of <10 um, lipid- walled microcapsules and
high quality micronutrients stabilized within 45 to 500 um microgel particles.
Lipid-walled microcapsules will be produced by a modified double-emulsion
process, and they will contain water- soluble micronutrients in the payload
(core material). Microgel particles will be formed by ionic gelation and they
will consist of a protein-enriched hydrocolloid matrix. Unlike permeable
crosslinked protein microcapsules, these complex microcapsules will be vitamin-
impermeable and maintain nutrient balance. In-vitro vitamin-leaching rates will
be correlated with growth and survival of penaeid shrimp larvae to evaluate R&D
feasibility. Commercialization potential will be evident from the in-vitro
analytic values and whole-animal responses to test feeds.
