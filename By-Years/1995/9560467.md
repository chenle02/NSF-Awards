*** 9560467 Wilde This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
will examine enhanced holographic data storage in ferroelectric photorefractive
recording media. This is thought to be a promising solution to an input/output
bottleneck between high-speed microprocessors and mass storage peripherals.
Although many necessary optical systems components are now available, a suitable
volume recording medium is still lacking. This research will explore the use of
domain screening in a ferroelectric medium to improve dynamic range and and
other features. When combined with two-photon recording for nonvolatile readout,
this approach to a storage material is expected to provide very high
performance. If the approach is feasible, it could lead to significant advances
in database management, high-definition digital video, and new interactive
multimedia software for the entertainment industry, education, and business. ***
