Sidman proposes two main lines of investigation. The first involves
lexicographic Groebner bases and the other has to do with properties of secant
varieties. The goal of her work on lexicographic Groebner bases is to use the
notion of Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity to produce concrete statements about
the complexity of the lexicographic term ordering and the geometry of
projections that would explicitly confirm long-held beliefs about their
behavior. She also proposes to work on several problems in which computational
and combinatorial methods are applied to the study of secant varieties. Interest
in secant varieties has arisen in diverse areas including algebraic geometry,
coding theory, computational complexity, and algebraic statistics. Recent
applications of secant varieties in algebraic statistics have brought both new
techniques and new questions to the forefront.

In the undergraduate mathematics curriculum the objects of so-called "modern"
algebra, groups, rings, fields, and modules, have a reputation for being very
abstract. Indeed, the names "modern algebra" and "abstract algebra" are often
used interchangeably. The power of the abstraction only becomes evident when one
sees how these ideas enable us to discuss an increasingly large variety of
applications in a common framework. Computational algebra is an area that is
useful to pure mathematicians in algebraic geometry and commutative algebra. It
is also able to bridge the divide between abstract algebra and many concrete
applications including integer programming, enumeration problems in statistics,
and geometric modeling. Sidman's first project connects computational algebra
with algebraic geometry. The questions she proposes to study related to secant
varieties are also related to algebraic geometry, but were motivated by work in
the emerging field of algebraic statistics. Thus, the proposed work reflects the
ways in which pure and applied mathematics influence each other, often in
unexpected ways.
