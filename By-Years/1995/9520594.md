9520594 OSWOOD The boreal forests of interior Alaska are an important global
carbon sink, a significant forest and land resource, and are threaded by a large
network of streams and rivers. Permafrost has a profound influence on the
ecology and hydrology of these forests and streams. The PI's propose to study
the influence of permafrost on exports of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus in
soil and stream water in a boreal forest watershed. Samples collected over a two
year period will be analyzed for both organic and inorganic components. These
data will be combined with permafrost distribution, temperature and
precipitation data to predict nutrient exports. The development of this model
will increase our understanding of the influence of discontinuous permafrost on
carbon and nutrient flows between upland, wetland, and aquatic ecosystems in
boreal forests.
