Earthquake triggering provides a fundamental clue into earthquake nucleation. If
an observational relationship could be established between seismicity rate
changes and the triggering strain of an earthquake, then we would have a basic
constraint on the nucleation process. Here we use a novel statistical approach
and an abundance of modern data to measure the number of earthquakes triggered
for both nearby and distant earthquakes. The preliminary results indicate that
the intensity of triggering scales continuously as a function of dynamic strain
as measured by seismic wave amplitude. The trend is consistent regardless of
distance. However, some regions, like California, are more prone to triggering
than others, like Japan. The lack of discernible crossover in triggering
behavior at small distances implies that dynamic triggering is sufficient to
explain local aftershocks.

This result points the way to a new methodology for earthquake forecasting based
on the amplitude of the observed seismic waves.

This proposal presents a plan of study to test, analyze and apply these
preliminary results. Specifically, we will: 1) Evaluate the robustness of the
relationship between triggering rate and strain by: a) Varying the choices of
parameters in the measurement scheme. b) Improving the proxies for dynamic and
static strain by using observed seismograms corrected to depth and measured
focal mechanisms. 2) Constrain the physics of earthquake triggering by: a)
Determining whether immediate triggering or delayed triggering is a stronger
signal using filtered waveforms and the distribution of the normalized inter-
event times. b) Comparing the tendency to trigger across different tectonic
regimes in New Zealand and globally. c) Comparing the results to standard models
of earthquake triggering. 3) Apply the results to hazard mitigation by: a)
Combining the interpolated ground velocity from an earthquake with the triggered
rate function to predict triggered seismicity in the next hour.
