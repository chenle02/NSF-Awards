This SBIR Phase II project will develop innovative design software that enables
people of all ages to easily create blueprints for production with laser
cutters, CNC routers, and 3D printers. These machines hold the potential to
transform American manufacturing by enabling anyone to design and build physical
items. However, design software remains a bottleneck. This project addresses
this problem by offering a paper-like interface to create machinable drawings
while retaining the creative and cognitive advantages of freehand sketching.
Moreover, the software's innovative interaction paradigm has broad applications
in every domain where people sketch or make diagrams, and will enable people to
design and prototype more productively.

The project goal is to provide an effective, intuitive design application for
tablet computers to make it easier for students to engage in engineering design
as they invent and build physical constructions. The innovation combines sketch
recognition (that enables freehand input) with geometric constraint management
(that enables the software to maintain as much precision as the user needs).
Throughout development, the software will be continuously deployed and assessed
at collaborating high schools and out-of-school fabrication labs to guide future
features and interaction needs.
