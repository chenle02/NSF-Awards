Abstract

Inverse scattering problems arise when one wishes to recover physical
properties of an object from data obtained by remote observations or from
measurements made on its surface without penetrating the interior. Interpreted
broadly they include methods of nondestructive testing and medical imaging. The
problems proposed here include showing that it is possible, in principle, to
determine the properties of an inhomogeneous elastic body from its response to
pressures on its surface, and to determine both the acoustic properties of a
medium surrounding a solid obstacle and the obstacle itself from reflected sound
waves.

More specifically, the problems we propose include:

1) showing that it is possible to uniquely determine the Lame' parameters of an
inhomogeneous elastic body from its response to infinitesimal boundary
deformations.

2) For an obstacle in an inhomogeneous medium we propose to show that both the
obstacle and the sound speed in the medium can be recovered from the scattering
amplitude at a fixed frequency.

3) Do problem 2) in the more technically difficult case of two space dimensions,
where it becomes a "determined" inverse problem.
