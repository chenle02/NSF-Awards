A request is made to fund replacement instrumentation on the R/V Atlantic
Explorer, a 168? general purpose research vessel operated by Bermuda Institute
of Ocean Science (BIOS) as part of the University-National Oceanographic
Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet. The request includes one
item:&lt;br/&gt;1) 12 KHz Transducer&lt;br/&gt;Funds are requested for
acquisition of a replacement 12 KHz Transducer. The existing transducer failed
and is no longer operational.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;
The principal impact of the present proposal is under criterion two, providing
infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use
instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects
(which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of
NSF). The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation
allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working,
calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research,
and expanding the base of potential researchers.
