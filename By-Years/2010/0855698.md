The objective of this proposed workshop is to lay the groundwork for
implementing the recommendations that were developed through The ?5XME?
Workshop, held on May 10-11, 2007 in Arlington, Virginia. The proposed workshop
will develop curricular templates, at both the undergraduate and graduate
levels, based on the recommendations from the previous report, for various types
of schools (e.g., large public, large private, small public, small private). It
is anticipated that these templates will facilitate the adoption of the 5XME
recommendations by a wide cross section of mechanical engineering departments
across the country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A diverse group of mechanical
engineering educators will be brought together in the workshop to ensure that
all points of view and learning styles are fully considered. These workshop
participants will represent leaders (e.g., department heads, program advisors)
from a variety of schools (i.e., small, large, public, private) to reduce the
barriers to implementation of curricular reforms in mechanical engineering
departments across the country
