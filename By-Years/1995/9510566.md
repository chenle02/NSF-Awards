This RPG in the Organic Synthesis Program to Professor Romo of Texas A&amp;M
University will be used to elaborate the chiral catalysis of 2 + 2
cycloadditions for the synthesis of 2-oxetanones. These compounds which are
better known as beta lactones are important moieties in many physiologically
active chemical compounds. Moreover, these types of monomers are used in
polymerization reactions and in organic synthetic strategies. The control of
catalytic processes in such a way as to yield chiral products is an important
goal. This proposal has this goal and appears to be an excellent opportunity to
find new ways of synthesizing physiologically active compounds. These results
will be useful in the medicinal chemistry and polymer fields.
