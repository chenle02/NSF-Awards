The South Carolina EPSCoR Research Infrastructure Improvement Award will enhance
the research infrastructure in nanoscience, structural and chemical biology, and
bioengineering by adding a critical mass of researchers to these targeted areas.
The goal is to improve South Carolina's R&amp;D competitiveness through the
continued development and use of science and technology resources in the three
major research universities (Clemson University, University of South Carolina,
and the Medical University of South Carolina) and through productive, long-term
partnerships between academia, government, and the private sector. This project
will enhance nanomaterials research at Clemson University in collaboration with
the University of South Carolina, expand bioengineering/biomaterials research at
Clemson University, develop and upgrade biomolecular structure research at the
Medical University of South Carolina, and establish and expand statewide
initiatives in education/outreach. Outreach initiatives to support interfaces
with the state's four-year colleges, HBCUs and the private sector will also
result from this funding. Collaborative opportunities between faculty from HBCUs
and those residing within the major research universities will further develop
the state's research enterprise. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Faculty hires in the
nanomaterials/nanotechnology program at Clemson University will complement
existing expertise in the state, benefit graduate and undergraduate education,
and serve to stimulate the further development of the emerging knowledge-based,
high-tech economy in South Carolina. The Medical University of South Carolina
will expand its biomolecular structure capacity and develop chemical biology
through the addition of five new faculty. Partnerships with the College of
Charleston and interactions with state and federal agencies will add synergism
and competitiveness in additional areas of research. The
bioengineering/biomaterials program will be used to establish a branch of the
Clemson University Bioengineering Department at the Medical University of South
Carolina staffed with new Clemson University bioengineering hires, and add new
faculty at Clemson with expertise in molecular
biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
