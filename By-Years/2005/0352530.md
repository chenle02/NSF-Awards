The purpose of this applied research is to study the impact of chemistry lessons
developed specifically to improve student understanding of energy. Energy is a
pervasive concept in science that is used in chemistry, biology and physics to
explain many observed phenomena; however, it is often not emphasized in high
school chemistry courses. The goal of this project is to examine ways to frame
the concept of energy to foster student understanding of this important topic.
Specifically, the plan is to determine if an emphasis on stability improves
student understanding of energy. The results of this research will ultimately
guide the development of a "Living by Chemistry" high school chemistry unit on
energy and the development of questions on energy for the "ChemQuery" assessment
system.
