&lt;br/&gt;Shatz&lt;br/&gt;CCR-0326223&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A workshop is
supported on "Software Engineering for &lt;br/&gt;Embedded Systems: From
Requirements to Implementation". This workshop, supported by NSF, ARO, ONR, and
AFOSR, considers software engineering issues in embedded systems. The workshop
is devoted to exploring the critical problems associated with cost-effective
development of high-quality software systems. The purpose of the workshop is
two-fold: first, to assess the state-of-the-research in current "point solution"
approaches to specific problems in this domain; and second, to define a roadmap
for future research that bridges gaps left by&lt;br/&gt;current tools and
methodologies and articulates a more complete set &lt;br/&gt;of technology
requirements to guide goal-driven research. The first objective is addressed
through presentations by leaders in a variety of relevant areas. The second
objective is addressed through presentations of position papers and extensive
open discussion periods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop convenes in Chicago
in September 2003. Participants are US and international researchers, selected
for their expertise in one or more system and software engineering challenge
areas related to embedded systems.&lt;br/&gt;
