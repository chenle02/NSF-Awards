The principal investigator will continue his work in the general area of
empirical processes, paying particular attention to the development of
asymptotic techniques that can be applied to non-standard problems in Statistics
and Econometrics. Specific applications will include: the theory of least
absolute deviations estimators in time series models; discrete choice models;
and the extension of empirical process results for independent variables to
cover various types of dependent variables.
