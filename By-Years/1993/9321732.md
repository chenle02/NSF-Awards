Proposal #: 93-21732 The PI's request funding to purchase shipboard
instrumentation in support of NSF-funded research. The instruments will be used
aboard the R/V POINT SUR, a 135 foot vessel, which is owned by NSF and operated
by the University. Instrumentation requested includes two dissolved oxygen
sensors and a fluorometer for use with the CTD and a new printer for use with
scientific data acquisition aboard the ship. The instrumentation requested is
required for support of NSF-funded cruises aboard the POINT SUR during 1994 and
will enhance the scientific capability of the vessel in the future.
