9304624 Cohen The PI's will investigate the physics of the core's most abundant
constituent, iron, at high pressures and temperatures, including its sub-solidus
phase relations, the thermo-elasticity of its solid and liquid phases, dynamic
properties of the melt and the iron melting curve. The properties of face-
centered cubic, hexagonal close packed and body centered cubic crystalline
structures are investigated with first principles solutions of Schrodinger's
Equation based on density functional theory. They will construct parametric
model Hamiltonians to represent the theoretical results and use this model in
molecular dynamics simulations of the equation of state, structure and viscosity
of liquid iron. The model Hamiltonian will also be used in high pressure cluster
simulations of iron melting. The aim of the project is to predict and provide a
firm theoretical basis for a discussion of the temperature distribution in the
core, the composition of the solid inner core and liquid outer core and the
crystal structure of the inner core. ***
