annual Presidential Early Career Awards for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE).
There are twenty PECASE Awardees from the National Science Foundation this year.
This highly prestigious award is being given for the first time in recognition
of excellence and promise for future success in scientific and engineering
research, and the potential for eventual leadership of the awardees in their
respective fields. Kennedy has worked on the development and validation of
electrodes that can measure insulin and melanocyte stimulating hormone secretion
from single cells at the level of single exocytosis events, studies of the
fundamentals of exocytosis, the development of rapid immunoassays using
capillary electrophoresis, and in coupling capillary electrophoresis with
microdialysis sampling for neurotransmitter and metabolite monitoring in vivo.
He is also known for his genuine enthusiasm for and outstanding performance as a
classroom and as a laboratory teacher.
