The PIs are organizing the 5th Biennial Women-in-Theory Workshop. This workshop
is to take place at the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing in May
2016. The intended audience of the workshop is graduate students in the field of
theoretical computer science (TCS). Motivated by the low overall number of
female faculty members, researchers, and students in TCS world wide, the
workshop has two goals. The first is to deliver an invigorating educational
program to the student participants by inviting leading female researchers to
present tutorials of their research topics. The second is to provide an
outstanding opportunity to bring together women students from different
institutions across the country and internationally, so as to foster a sense of
kinship and camaraderie, and to provide access to role models in this area by
having senior and junior faculty members and industrial researchers present. The
format of this workshop consists of technical tutorials, a non-technical talk, a
student rump session, and a panel discussion.

The first four Women-in-Theory workshops were greeted with great enthusiasm both
from the participants and from the TCS research community at large. Since the
first workshop in 2008, the PIs have received overwhelmingly positive feedback
and many participants have matured to be successful researchers. These serve as
testimonials that the workshop is accomplishing its primary goal of helping
women become more successful in TCS.
