Stanford University continues operating a Research Experience for Undergraduates
(REU) Site. The REU Site is affiliated with a multi-institutional Materials
Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) which includes, in addition to
Stanford, UC-Davis, UC-Berkeley, and IBM-Almaden Research Center. The MRSEC
research focuses on polymer interfaces and macromolecular assemblies. Eighteen
undergraduate students are recruited nationwide with a recruitment focus on
undergraduates from two-year and four-year institutions, as well as members form
underrepresented groups. Students are involved in research in polymer science at
all four US institutions, as well as at some of the industrial affiliates
laboratories and at collaborating institutions in Germany. In addition, REU
students participate in professional development and group social
activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The REU Site includes a Research Experience for
Teachers (RET) component. Four teachers are recruited every year for an 8-week
summer research experience&lt;br/&gt;
