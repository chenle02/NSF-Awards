This is a proposal to fund a research program to investigate the constituent
structure of matter by colliding leptons (specifically electrons and positrons)
with protons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The experiment is being done by physicists
from PSU and collaborators using the ZEUS detector at the HERA accelerator of
the DESY laboratory in Hamburg, Germany. This experiment is a study of
electron/positron-proton deep inelastic scattering (DIS) collisions at a center-
of-mass energy of 318 GeV. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary aim of the experiment is the study of DIS at
the highest available exchanged photon virtualities (Q-squared up to 90,000
GeV^2), in order to probe electron and quark substructure down to distances of
10^(-18) cm, and to search for new families of excited leptons and quarks
indicative of physics beyond the Standard Model. The PSU group expects to study
heavy quark production as well as the electroweak properties at high Q-squared
that could be observed with the advent of polarized electrons and
positrons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, the PSU group has been invited to
participate in a cosmic ray experiment (CORAL) to determine the energy spectrum
and primary particle chemical composition in the energy range of the "knee",
i.e., cosmic ray primary energies of 10^15 to 10^16 eV. The experiment will
involve the simultaneous determination of both the electron/photon and muon
components of cosmic ray air showers, using a surface array of scintillation
counters and an underground muon drift chamber system, where the muon momentum
cutoff is about 70 GeV. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Education/outreach activities include taking
typically two REU students to work on the ZEUS experiment in the summers. The
group will also participate in the cosmic ray "school" effort already in an
advanced planning stage with a group at CERN that is working with the schools in
Dusseldorf. &lt;br/&gt;
