Our research proposal concerns the interplay between Operator Theory and
Function Theory in one and several variables. A particular group of problems
that we propose to attack involves the generalizations to several complex
variables of some of the classical moment and interpolation problems on the unit
disc such as the interpolation theorem of Nevanlinna and Pick, and the moment
theorems of Caratheodory and Herglotz. Other groups involve the generalization
of geometric function theory to analytic varieties and the understanding of
extremal mappings into the symmetrized bidisc. Research intrinsic to operator
theory that we will undertake includes issues involving model theory in one
variable on nonsimply connected domains in the plane and in several variables on
domains other than the bidisc.

Operator Theoretic Function Theory, the particular type of mathematics that we
are proposing to investigate, has direct and concrete bene&#64257;ts for a
number of areas of human endeavor. For example, the model theory aspects of our
proposal all involve the generalization of the Commutant Lifting Structure which
leads to an e&#64259;cient algorithm for the discovery of oil from acoustical
data taken on the surface of the earth. Other aspects would add to the theory of
Linear Matrix Inequalities. The mathematical theory of LMI?s, which currently is
of great importance in several areas of engineering, is an extension of linear
programming, which has made large scale resource allocation and economic
prediction possible. Finally, the particular brand of function theory we propose
to study, forms the mathematical core of H-in&#64257;nity control theory, which
has been used to design control systems for fusion reactions inside Tokamaks and
feedback stabilization systems for the space shuttle.
