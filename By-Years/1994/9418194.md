Pessagno 9418194 Chert and limestone samples collected from the basement
complexes will be processed in the laboratory. Radiolarians liberated from the
rock matrix will be identified with our scanning electron microscope. Following
the productive format of previous work in other basement complexes, results are
divisible into two important components. First, radiolarian faunas will allow
better dating of these basement complexes. Careful field work permits selective
dating and discrimination of both the igneous basement and any subsequent
inclusions into this basement material. Second, the paleobiogeographical
significance of radiolarian faunas will further constrain models of the
paleogeographic development of the Caribbean Plate. The research fills in gaps
in the knowledge of Earth history especially providing further details of the
age and origin of various fragments of the Caribbean Plate.
