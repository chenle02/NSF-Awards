0115810&lt;br/&gt;Zhou&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation award to
University of Minnesota at Duluth will provide support for acquisition of a
towed, profiling vehicle with physical, biological and chemical sensors for
environmental and lacustrine research. It will also support the acquisition of
an instrument for studying physical microstructure and turbulence in lake
waters. These instruments will be managed and operated as shared-use research
facilities, available to all funded users of the UMD Large Lakes Observatory's
research vessel Blue Heron, which is operated as part of the University-National
Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) academic research fleet. UMD will
contribute cost-sharing of more than 30% of the cost of this project from non-
federal funds. &lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
