9452058 Hawkins This project provides students with the use of solid modeling
software techniques to create both Machine and Architectural/Civil designs on
RISC 6OOO computers. The integrity of these designs will be analyzed using
materials analysis software. Three-dimensional wire-frame drawings will also be
created. These wire-frame drawings will be projected into two dimensional
drawings when appropriate. After intellectual property protection (also a part
of this class) has been addressed, the design ramifications and the results of
the design analysis will be communicated to the class using formal academic
papers and presentations. If the design is of sufficient quality and innovation,
it will then be submitted to manufacturers. Designs in the initial year of
funding will involve materials handling options. These Designs will be created
which facilitate those covered under the Americans With Disabilities Act to
perform shipping and receiving tasks. This proposal also includes a three-year
study designed to evaluate workable hardware/software options when teaching
solid modeling. By combining solid modeling, wire-frame construction, design
theory/problem solving, journal creation, communications of the design and the
implications of intellectual property protection, this capstone class provides a
culmination of the baccalaureate experience.
