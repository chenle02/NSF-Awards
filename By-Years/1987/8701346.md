In Phase I research the chitinase (chiA) gene from the bacterium Serrata
marcescens has been fused to three different promotor fragments which have been
isolated. These chimaric genes have been introduced into tobacco protoplasts.
Stably transformed plants have been generated and individuals have been
identified which express high levels of the chiA gene at both the mRNA and
protein level. These have been assayed for susceptibility to infection by the
fungus Alternaria. It appears that they exhibit an increased resistance to the
disease. In this Phase II research, it is planned to improve the level of
expression and to express chitinase in specific tissues (roots) and outside the
cell. Later the gene will be transferred to other plants and their resistance to
other pathogens will be tested. This experimental research will be performed in
tobacco tomato and Brassica napus and will assay for conferred resistance
against Alternaria, the powdery mildews, and root knob nematodes. Control of a
broad range of fungi by genetic engineering of plants could greatly increase
crop production and preclude the excessive use of chemical fungicides.
