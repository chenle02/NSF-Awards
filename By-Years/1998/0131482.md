Joel Bowman of Emory University is supported by the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to investigate improved computational
methodologies with the aim of performing molecular dynamics calculations more
efficiently than is currently possible. This research will avoid a major
computational bottleneck by using a novel method based on Hermite interpolation
that will provide information on molecular motion using much sparser data. The
new codes, to be developed in collaboration with a numerical analyst, will be
made available to the scientific community. The new methodologies will be
applied to studies of ketene photodissociation and the vibrational energies of
the hydronium ion. Research outcomes are expected to advance computational
methods and the ability to understand molecular processes of importance in
chemistry and biochemistry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Powerful computer programs
currently exist to predict realistically the rates of chemical processes of
importance in the diverse areas such as atmospheric chemistry, environmental
chemistry, combustion chemistry, protein folding, and enzyme catalysis. The
methods and software that will be developed in this project will enable faster
and more efficient use of these programs to predict, interpret, and guide
experiments that explore useful chemical and biochemical phenomena.
