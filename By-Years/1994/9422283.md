9422283 A five-day workshop during the 1995 Linguistic Society of America Summer
Institute at the University of New Mexico will be devoted to the investigation
of issues in the interaction between morphology and syntax in Athapaskan
languages, some of which have figured very large in current theoretical
discussions in linguistics. One day of the workshop will be set aside for
presentations and discussions on each of four topics, with a fifth day for
presentation and discussions which draw the topics together. The themes for the
first four days of the workshop are: (1) third-person pronominal forms and their
representations, (2) the status of the dichotomy between inflection and
derivation, (3) clause structure, and (4)relations of morphology and syntax with
phonology. These topics address two major typological questions for which
Athapaskan languages have been vital sources of data and hypotheses: the nature
of syntactic configurationality, and the necessity for 'position class'
morphology. Workshop participants will include scholars and students of
Athapaskan, many of whom will be assembled at the Institute participating in the
Athapaskan conference and in three Institute courses on Athapaskan.
