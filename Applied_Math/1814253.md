Advances in digital signal processing often rely on successes in pure and
computational harmonic analysis, a branch of mathematics dating back to Joseph
Fourier. Examples of these successes include the introduction of the JPEG
standard for compression of photographic images, advances in phaseless
reconstruction, and compressed sensing, e.g., the construction of single pixel
cameras. At the core of this progress is a better understanding of the
redundancy inherent in many data generated in our daily lives. Frame theory can
be viewed as one of the appropriate paradigms to investigate and model
redundancy. The investigators use frame theory to study two classes of problems
whose solutions could have significant applicability in quantum information
theory. Because some of the mathematical problems taken up in this project are
related to engineering problems, their solutions could lead to advances in
signal processing and technological infrastructure, as well as broaden the
understanding and role of frames in applications.

The investigators study the Zauner conjecture in quantum information theory and
the HRT (Heil-Ramanathan-Topiwala) conjecture in time-frequency analysis. They
observe that the Zauner conjecture is a special case of the HRT conjecture in
the setting of rank-one finite-dimensional time-frequency matrices, and use that
relationship initially for the transference of current technology for each
conjecture. The theory of frames plays a fundamental role in formulating and
understanding the problems the investigators examine here. The notion of the
coherence of finite sets of vectors is an important quantitative measure
necessary to make technical progress in solving these problems, especially as
regards understanding the role of maximal incoherence that such sets may have.
