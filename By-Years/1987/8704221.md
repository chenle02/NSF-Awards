The transduction of chemical energy into mechanical work by muscle actomyosin
in situ is thought to involve the interaction of magnesium ATPase with
crossbridges of myosin which cycle through steps of being bound to and then free
from actin. It is widely held that while bound to actin, a crossbridge
dissociates the ATP hydrolysis products and undergoes a structural change that
produces force. The many crossbridges in a muscle sarcomere operate
asynchronously and the force generated by an individual actomyosin is thought to
be transiently stored in an elastic component of the crossbridge. Dr. Highsmith
plans to obtain additional data on the structures of muscle myosin crossbridges
which will test the hypotheses that the crossbridge portion called subfragment-1
(S1) bends, by rearranging its constituent tertiary structural domains and
generates force, and that its structure is reversibly distorted in order to
store the mechanical energy involved. The primary technique to be used is
transient electrical birefringence in which a solution of S1 is subjected to an
electric field pulse of adjustable strength and duration. The motion of S1 under
the influence of the electric field and its rate of field-free rotation will
provide much needed structural information.
