9303948 Evans This award provides one-half the funding necessary for the
purchase of an image analysis system to be installed on the electron microprobe
in the Department of Geological Sciences at the University of Washington. The
University is committed to providing the remaining funds needed for the
acquisition. The electron microprobe provides quantitative elemental
microanalysis with a spatial resolution of one micrometer. The capabilities of
the microprobe are used by geoscience students and senior research scientists in
the fields of igneous and metamorphic petrology, as well as for studies in
geomorphology and paleontology. The microprobe lab is also used in a variety of
studies by archeologists, astronomers (studying meteorites) and biologists
(studying hard parts) at the University of Washington. The digital imaging
system will greatly facilitate all of their studies by enhancing the ability to
view the spatial distribution of elements with respect to sample morphology, and
by quantifying the size, shape, amount and distribution of selected sample
components from digitized images. ***
