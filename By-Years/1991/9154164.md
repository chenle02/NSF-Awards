The NSF Summer Institute on Micro-scale Organic Laboratory Techniques is
designed to assist faculty who contemplate undertaking this type of laboratory
approach by introducing them to the experimental methods involved. The Institute
is organized around a framework of lecture-demonstrations, laboratory exercises,
and informal group discussions of micro- scale techniques. 'Hands-on" laboratory
experience is emphasized with particular attention paid to manipulative
procedures involved in preparation, isolation, purification, and
characterization of reaction products at the milligram level.
