With funds from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program a field emission
gun scanning electron microscope (FEG-SEM) will be acquired for the study of
polymers, ceramics, and biological materials. The facility will include energy
dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) which will provide a substantial improvement
in the detection of light elements (boron through fluorine) which is very
important for the materials being studied. It will also include an ion beam
coater to produce ultrathin chromium coatings for high resolution imaging of
nonconducting materials. Research topics under investigation include: 1)
bioengineered proteins and bioceramics; 2) aqueous processing of biopolymers; 3)
bioceramic plant products; 4) polymer surface studies; 5) block copolymer
surfaces; 6) assembly of polymers at interfaces; 7) fracture resistance of
fiber- reinforced polymer blends; 8) carbon black reinforcement of rubber; 9)
embrittlement of nylons by salt; 10) gelation crystallization of polymers from
supercritical solutions; 11) microstructural effects in high tempereature crack
growth in ceramics; 12) shock and thermal history of iron and chronditic
meteorites. A field emission gun scanning electron microscope will be acquired
for the study of polymers, ceramics, and biological materials. The research
involves a diverse range of studies of polymer and ceramics, including
bioceramics, and biomolecular materials. The work includes studies of silk films
and wood infused with ceramics and has many potential applications.
