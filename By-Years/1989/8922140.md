The Washington University group, will extend its studies of the potentially
observable consequences of the general theory of relativity, in experimental,
astrophysical and cosmological contexts. The effects of gravitational emission
and damping in binary systems of compact objects will be analyzed, as possible
sources of detectable gravitational radiation and as potential tests of
alternative theories of gravity. A study of the normal modes of oscillation of
black holes will continue, with emphasis on high-overtone modes, and on modes of
rotating black holes. The observable effects of light scalar fields, that could
arise in field theories of particles and their interactions, are being analyzed
with a view to obtaining constraints on their properties using tests of the
"fifth force" and other gravitational experiments.
