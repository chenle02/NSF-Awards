Valencia College in Orlando, FL on behalf of the Central Florida STEM Alliance
(CFSA) is seeking funding under the LSAMP B2B program to double the number of
underrepresented minority (URM) STEM students (from 321 to 642) transferring
from three community colleges to the University of Central Florida (UCF) and
other universities. The target population for this project is African Americans
and Hispanic students. The community colleges within the Alliance are: Valencia
College, a designated Hispanic Serving Institution, fiscal agent and project
lead, (VC), Lake-Sumter State College (LSSC), and Seminole State College of
Florida (SSC). This project will expand and focus efforts toward building a
system and infrastructure for URM students in STEM majors. This project will
focus efforts to increase the transfer rate of underrepresented minorities
through focused efforts including: 1) providing clear and targeted advising; 2)
providing information about STEM fields and career opportunities; 3) encouraging
their projective identity as a STEM professional; and 4) increasing
opportunities for students to conduct research.
