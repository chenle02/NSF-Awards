This award provides support to Dr. Nancy Rose under the National Science
Foundation's Faculty Awards for Women Scientists and Engineers Program. The
objectives of this program are to recognize the nation's most outstanding and
promising women scientists and engineers in academic careers in research and
teaching, to retain them in academia, and to facilitate the further development
of their careers. This award will allow the investigator to pursue two important
projects. The first involves the investigation of three major questions in the
area of industrial organization, making use of the wealth of data created by
airline regulation and the policy shock created by deregulation in 1978. The
questions to be analyzed are: (1) What is the extent of price discrimination and
how is it affected by market structure? (2) What determines firms' product
quality choices? and (3) How does entry into markets affect competitive
interactions and what does this reveal about theories of oligopoly behavior? The
second project will explore the impact of government risk management on firms in
the financial service sector. The questions to be analyzed include (1) What
managerial objectives do financial service firms pursue? and (2) How did the
increased competition resulting from the regulatory reforms and technology
changes of the late 1970's and early 1980's affect bank and thrift portfolio
risk strategies? This research will develop empirical models of firm's risk
preference behavior that will be interest both to scholars studying firm
behavior and to policy makers interested in designing effective government risk
management strategies.
