To test various models of glacial history in the Gulf of Maine, this study will
use exsiting samples collected during the first two years of an NSF-funded
project to investigate possible deglaciation (=warming?) at about 14 ka, the
possibility of a Younger Dryas signal in the record, and evaluate further the
compete hypotheses of ice shelves versus calving embayments in this setting.
