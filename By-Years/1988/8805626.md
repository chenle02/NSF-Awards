This research will study the asymptotic solution of nonlinear initial and
boundary value problems involving systems of differential equations. A
characteristic of the solutions of these equations is that they exhibit rapid
changes within thin regions. Consequently, the asymptotic methods are able to
make use of the presence of multiple scales. Of particular interest in this
research are problems involving boundary and interior layers. The work will be
motivated by physical applications including models which simulate the operation
of semiconductor devices. Problems will be attacked using a combined analytical
and numerical approach.
