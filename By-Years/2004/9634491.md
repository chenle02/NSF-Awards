The focus of this research is the determination of bond-dissociation energies
and the carrying out of acidity measurements. Compilations of the data in book
form will aid numerous chemists now and in the future. With this Accomplishment
Based Renewal award the Organic Dynamics Program is supporting the research of
Dr. Frederick G. Bordwell of the Department of Chemistry at Northwestern
University. Professor Bordwell will focus his work on determining bond-
dissociation energies and acid-base values, thermodynamic data that are of great
use to other chemists.
