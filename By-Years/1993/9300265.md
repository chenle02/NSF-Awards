Dr. Lowell D. Kispert and other members of the Chemistry Department of
University of Alabama are being supported to continue a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry. For the period 1993-5, twelve
undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in a
variety of research projects. Projects cover the traditional areas of chemistry-
analytical, inorganic, organic, physical and biochemistry. A unique feature of
this program is the primary focus is on students from small colleges including
minority institutions east of the Mississippi that do not have facilities to
carry out research.
