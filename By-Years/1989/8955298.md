This is a one year summer program which will take place in the summer of 1990
and which is being sponsored by the University of Northern Colorado. Its
principal goal is to teach 30 high school science teachers teaching strategies
based on results of cognitive science research and to use these teaching
strategies to teach courses which integrate science, technology and societal
issues (STS). The target group for this project are mainly teachers who teach
non- science oriented students who, however, will need to understand some
science in order to become informed citizens. The four week workshop for
teachers selected from around the nation will, (a) provide science content in
earth science, life science and physical science, (b) introduce and provide
laboratory experiences for an STS curriculum, (c) enable teachers to design
their own classroom activities relating to the local STS issues in their
communities and (d) introduce the science teachers to the principles of
cognitive science and to teaching strategies which have been shown to be
effective by cognitive science research. The NSF portion of the project,
$154,982, will be matched with $16,750 from the University of Northern Colorado
and the participating schools. This is a cost share of about 11%.
