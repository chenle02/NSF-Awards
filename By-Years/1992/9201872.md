This is a SBIR Phase II project. The objective of this research is to develop
an imaging system for screening DNA libraries. Genome research is one of the
most active research areas in biology today, and an improved way to analyze DNA
libraries will be useful. The research plan is to utilize a new nuclear detector
to generate a real time image of the distribution of radioactivity on the
transfer membrane containing DNA samples. The image will be directly projected
onto the primary agar plate. In the Phase I project, a new large area imaging
instrument prototype has been developed using two orthogonal arrays of
scintillating fibers, each coupled to a position-sensitive photomultiplier tube.
In the Phase II project, research will focus on improving the performance of the
prototype and designing the ways of increasing area. If successful, the new
device will improve the efficiency and precision of the identification and
isolation of genes.
