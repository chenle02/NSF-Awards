0235339&lt;br/&gt;Bohs&lt;br/&gt;This project will examine evolutionary
relationships among the so-called "spiny Solanums," a group of about 450 species
of plants in the Solanaceae (tomato or potato family). Included within this
group are economically important fruit crops such as the eggplant (Solanum
melongena), the lulo or naranjilla (S. quitoense), and the cocona (S.
sessiliflorum) as well as species with potential as sources of glycoalkaloids
useful in medicine. The spiny Solanums exhibit much variation in their
morphology and reproductive biology and show intriguing biogeographical patterns
through the tropics. Despite their potential as economic crops and their use as
model systems for the study of biological questions, the taxonomy and phylogeny
of the spiny Solanums have been neglected.&lt;br/&gt;The primary data for the
phylogenetic analyses will come from DNA sequencing of three genes or gene
regions, with measures of mutational differences used to define major lineages
within the spiny Solanum group. Sequences will be obtained from the nuclear
ribosomal and waxy genes and from chloroplast gene regions, from exemplar
species samples representing as much of the taxonomic diversity of the group as
possible. These data sets will be analyzed separately and in combination to
achieve an overall view of evolutionary relationships within the spiny Solanums.
Collecting trips to Mexico and Ecuador are planned to gather material for
morphological and molecular analyses, in collaboration with local botanists.
More detailed sampling will taxa place in two focal groups, the S. mammosum and
S. quitoense groups, in order to clarify relationships at the species level and
examine evolutionary patterns of floral biology, biogeography, and fruit
chemistry and morphology.&lt;br/&gt;This project will contribute to teaching and
learning by employing post-doctoral associates and undergraduate students who
will be trained in taxonomy, molecular methods, and data analysis. Substantial
national and international collaboration will result through foreign collecting
and herbarium trips and interaction with Solanaceae specialists in the U.S. and
abroad. This project will generate extensive DNA sequence data as well as
herbarium collections, leaf and DNA samples, and germplasm accessions that will
be distributed to international repositories and available for wide
dissemination. The scientific information gathered as part of this project is
expected to impact humankind by increasing the agronomic potential of important
or emerging crop species such as the eggplant, lulo, and cocona and by
contributing to conservation of germplasm of economically useful
plants.&lt;br/&gt;
