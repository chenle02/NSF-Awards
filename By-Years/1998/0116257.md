With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at DeSales University will acquire a 60 MHz NMR
Spectrometer. This equipment will enable researchers to carry out studies on a)
organic synthesis of ionic solvents and study of reactions using these solvents;
b) aerosol preparation of metal oxides and organic polymer systems; and c)
controlled-release kinetics of drug molecules from a microcrystalline cellulose
matrix. This instrument will also be used in advanced undergraduate courses.
Students will be heavily involved in the research projects at this primarily
undergraduate institution.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is
used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential
to chemists who are carrying out frontier research.
