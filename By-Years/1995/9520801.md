Sherman 9520801 Abstract Evolutionary theory suggests that behavior should be
adjusted to maximize an individual s fitness. Species in which individuals
switch between distinct behavior patterns offer an opportunity to test this
hypothesis. This dissertation improvement research will contrast the alternative
behaviors of territoriality and wandering in male water striders. This is a
powerful model system because it is possible to watch single individuals over
the course of repeated behavioral decisions. The research will determine why
alternative behaviors are maintained in the population, and identify the factors
that cue switches between behaviors. Behavioral observations of mating success
and electrophoretic analyses of paternity will show how territoriality and
wandering affect number of offspring. Experimental manipulation of social,
individual, and environmental variables will be combined with behavioral
observations to determine what causes behavioral switches. The research will
increase understanding of the bases of behavioral decisions and the evolution of
alternative behaviors.
