Pantev 9800790 Pantev will use techniques from abelian and non-abelian Hodge
theory to approach concrete geometric questions as well as problems in
mathematical physics and string theory. Four problems will be studied. The first
one is to look for a construction of a linear algebraic object that is
canonically associated to a projective variety X and calculate the cohomology of
all local systems on X together with their Hodge structures whenever the latter
makes sense. The second concerns the non-abelian Hodge conjecture on curves and
provides an intrinsic geometric characterization of the locus of motivic local
systems. The third discusses a construction of a singular plane curve whose
complement has a non-residually finite fundamental group. The fourth project
suggests a geometric strategy for understanding the appearance of enhanced gauge
symmetry in string theory and proposes a method for analyzing the exotic
components of F theory moduli spaces. The understanding of these questions is
essential for unifying various linearization procedures in algebraic geometry
and mathematical physics. On one hand, it will bring us closer to understanding
the basic structure of algebraic varieties, and on the other hand it will bring
a geometric perspective to the interaction of the recently discovered M and F
string theories. This is research in the field of algebraic geometry. Algebraic
geometry is one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one that has had
a revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century. In its origin, it treated
figures that could be defined in the plane by the simplest equations, namely
polynomials. Nowadays the field makes use of methods not only from algebra, but
from analysis and topology, and conversely is finding application in those
fields as well as in physics, theoretical computer science, and robotics.
