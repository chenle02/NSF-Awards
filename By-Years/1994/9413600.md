This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I research project will
focus on an analytical technique capable of simultaneous, trace, multi-element
determinations on small samples of biological materials at a reasonable cost.
The proposed research will develop a unique capacitively coupled microwave
plasma (CCMP) emission spectrometer system for this purpose. The system will
utilize a novel, commercially available , high resolution, large spectral range,
large throughput, small image format echelle spectrometer with a charge coupled
device detector. This detection system will provide more than 1 million spectral
resolution elements over the range 170-900 nm. For the multi-element analysis of
microsamples, the analytical figured of merit as well as the cost and simplicity
of the proposed systems, will exceed any other commercial or research
instrumentation.
