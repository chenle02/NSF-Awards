9505436 Johnson A sulfonamide-based collection system for tropospheric active
chlorine will be developed. Measurements of active chlorine species
(predominantly hypochlorous acid and mmlecular chlorine) is a recent concern, as
these species may have a significant impact on marine boundary layer chemistry.
Advantages of the proposed collection technique over current methods include the
potential for enhanced sensitivity, the possibility of speciation of active
chlorine compounds, and the possibility of detecting active bromine. The
proposed work includes laboratory testing of experimental implementations of
sulfonamide-bonded media to evaluate: 1) collection efficiency for chlorine and
hypochlorous acid, 2) ability to discriminate between the various chlorine and
bromine species collected (including possible artifacts), and 3) possible
interferences from other atmospheric species. The final stage of the proposed
work will be preliminary field measurements at a remote marine site in
California.
