The objective of this award is to support undergraduate and graduate student
attendance at the annual American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME)
International Design Engineering Technical Conferences (IDETC) and the American
Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) Multidisciplinary Analysis and
Optimization (MAO) Conference. A secondary objective is to encourage students to
think deeply about what engineering design of complex systems will be like 20-30
years in the future. Students will communicate their thoughts on this topic in
an essay which will be judged by a distinguished group of engineering design
researchers and educators. Travel funds will be provided for students who are
selected through the design essay competition. A poster session will be
organized at the conferences to give the students an opportunity to interact
with researchers and discuss their ideas on the future of engineering design of
complex systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports the NSF goal to
'achieve excellence in U.S. Science, mathematics, engineering, and technology
education at all levels', and will 'provide opportunities for young people that
will attract them to and prepare them for careers in science, mathematics, and
engineering'. The competition will be widely advertised through the ASME and
AIAA conference websites and to researchers in engineering design. Posing the
task as an exercise by an industry employee requires the students to consider
the effect of global competitiveness on engineering design practices,
particularly in light of complex systems. Conference experiences promote growth
in individual students and can also serve to strengthen the overall research
quality of the research at the student's home institution when this knowledge is
shared among their peers.
