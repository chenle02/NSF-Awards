This award will support construction of a high accuracy, high sensitivity
spectropolarimeter for use from 1 to 4 micrometers. The instrument will
incorporate both cold and warm rotating waveplates with a cold internal
polarizer. The effective resolving power will be R=180 and instrumental
polarization will be less than 0.1%. The instrument will incorporate a 16
element InSb detector array and will be background limited at this resolution at
all wavelengths from 1 to 4 micrometers. Scientifically, this award will target
interstellar dust features, comets, very dusty evolved stars and nuclei of
active galaxies for study with this instrument. Infrared spectropolarimetry will
provide important information on the relationships between silicate and carbon
compounds in interstellar dust and on the environment of interstellar dust that
exhibits emission from carbonaceous compounds. Infrared spectropolarimetry will
also allow us to probe the geometry and the spatial relationships between
emission mechanisms in the coma of comets, the circumstellar shells of dusty
stars, and the nuclei of active galaxies.
