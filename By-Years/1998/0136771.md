The goal of Systems Biology is the construction and experimental validation of
mathematical models that explain and predict the behavior of biological systems.
Systems Biology is a synergistic integration of theory, computation and
experiment. Intuition is not reliable when confronted with the highly
interconnected reaction networks that underlie biological processes.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Second International Conference will be held in
November 2001. It seeks to promote the growth and development of the field of
Systems Biology. The goals include: establishing the foundations of the field;
presenting new results; identifying promising directions; fostering
communications; and helping to organize the community. A top priority is to
adopt a sound foundation for theory, software and experiment. The meeting seeks
to be a specific forum for Systems Biology. &lt;br/&gt;
