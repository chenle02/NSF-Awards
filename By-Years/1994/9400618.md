9400618 Asmar This proposal describes a continuation of collaborative work in
multipliers on Lebesgue spaces and maximal operators over a locally compact
abelian group. The work leads to dimension-free estimates for radial multipliers
such as the Riesz transforms on Euclidean space. It also continues earlier work
in transference theory, this time in connection with the Coifman and Weiss
Multiplier Theorem for semi-groups of operators. The joint work with S.
Montgomery-Smith on the applications of Brownian motion is yielding new results
and showing a unity in the treatment of maximal and square functions in
martingale theory, and harmonic analysis of Banach space valued functions on
groups with ordered dual groups. Vectors in n-dimensional Euclidean space can be
added and in this way Euclidean space is a commutative group. Classical analysis
usually refers to analysis of functions and operators on this commutative group.
This project involves studying analogues of classical analysis operators and
estimates in the context of an abstract commutative group. This abstract point
of view leads to a unification of large areas of analysis. ***
