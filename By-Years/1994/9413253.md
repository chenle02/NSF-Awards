The research in theoretical gravitational physics will include: The role of
short distance physics in black hole radiation via the Hawking process and in
particle production in an expanding universe; Observational limits on, and
theoretical properties of, higher derivative effective actions for the
gravitational field; Black hole thermodynamics for such effective actions; The
effort to identify a statistical origin for black hole entropy; Cutoff models
for spacetime structure via the algebra of quantum field operators and causal
networks; Results of this research should lead to a better understanding of the
sensitivity of particle production in gravitational fields to unknown short
distance physics, possible corrections to the Einstein equations, and of the
nature and range of validity of the laws of black hole thermodynamics. The
research may also lead to predictions following from the existence of a
fundamental short-distance cutoff on physical degrees of freedom, and/or yield
insights valuable in attempts to supplant the continuum model of spacetime by a
finitistic one.
