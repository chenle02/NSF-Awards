Isoprene emitted from trees is the largest source of hydrocarbons in the
atmosphere. Isoprene decomposition in the atmosphere is rapid and causes lower
atmosphere formation, acid rain, and blue hazes. Only some plants produce
isoprene, it is a common trait in trees ferns, and tropical plants. The
production of isoprene is closely associated with the carbon photosynthesis, but
mechanism of isoprene formation and its function in plants is unknown. To better
understand isoprene emission and to predict changes in isoprene emission which
may occur in the future the effect of growth conditions on isoprene synthesis
will be studied. The mechanism of isoprene synthesis will also be studied.
Previous results indicated that when oak trees are grown in high carbon dioxide
atmospheres the rate of isoprene emission can double. In this project the effect
of carbon dioxide will be further tested and the effect of increased
temperature, believed to be a consequence of increased carbon dioxide, will also
be tested. Rates of acclimation to the various growth conditions will be
assesed. The pathway of isoprene synthesis will be investigated using techniques
developed to study photosynthesis. Stable isotopes (nonradioactive) of carbon
and hydrogen will be used to trace the pathway of carbon during isoprene
synthesis in leaves. These studies are important because of the role of biogenic
isoprene in atmospheric chemistry, because isoprene synthesis can be a fast,
nondestructive measure of important, nonphotosynthetic carbon metabolism inside
chloroplasts (e.g. carotenoid synthesis), because isoprene synthesis can affect
the overall carbon budget of plants.
