The growth of herbivores is recognized by most researcher to be limited in
large part by a plant's nitrogen content. When a plant is eaten, its remaining
tissues exhibit a plethora of responses that include not only the dramatic
increases in the concentrations of "secondary" metabolites (the putative induced
defenses which presumably contribute to a plant's resistance to herbivory) but
also a suite of physiological responses that include increases in photosynthetic
rates( which presumably contribute to a plant's resilience to herbivory). This
proposal examines how a plant integrates these two suites of responses and thus
asks how a plant resolves the potentially conflicting demands of its "defensive"
and "civilian" biochemical responses to herbivore attack. This metabolic
integration will be examined in a species of plant (Nicotiana sylvestris) where
both the "defensive" responses--the production of toxic alkaloids--and the
"civilian" responses--included photosynthetic capacity--make large demands on a
plant's nitrogen budget. Since nitrogen is frequently the important limiting
element for plants growth, we will choreograph the movement of nitrogen between
alkaloid and protein synthesis in order to examine this metabolic integration.
Research on pest-resistance in agriculture has been focused on two fronts: the
chemical and physical of plants that confer resistance to pest attack and the
physiological attributes of plants associated with resilience to herbivory.
Little, if any research has explored the integration of both the defense against
and the tolerance to herbivory. And understanding of this integration is
essential if we are to proceed beyond the "pesticide-approach" to plant
protection. This will be the first project to examine chemical defense as an
integral part of the physiological processes by which plants regrow those
tissues lost to herbivores.
