9505673 Phelan This U.S.-Chile Program award will fund a planning visit by Dr.
P. Larry Phelan of Ohio State University to meet with Prof. Andres O. Angulo of
the Universidad de Concepcion to lay the groundwork for a proposal on the mating
behavior of the primitive moths of austral South America. Understanding of
primitive moths is important and necessary to elucidate the evolutionary history
of moth pheromones. The Palaephatidae occupy a phylogenetic position that
suggests their status as a missing link in this evolutionary path. Preliminary
observations of mating behavior will be made in the field and specimens
collected for pheromone extracts and for morphological studies of pheromone
glands in both males and females. ***
