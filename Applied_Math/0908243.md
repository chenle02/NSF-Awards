A number of inexpensive, safe, and high contrast medical imaging procedures like
Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) and Optical Tomography (OT) have been
introduced in the recent decades. However, EIT and OT are plagued by instability
and low resolution. To overcome these difficulties, novel hybrid methods are
being currently developed that combine different types of radiation (e.g.,
ultrasound and electromagnetic waves). The idea is to combine the advantages of
these waves, while alleviating their individual deficiencies. Among these
methods, the project will concentrate mostly on the Thermoacoustic Tomography,
Ultrasound-Modulated Optical Tomography, and Acousto-Electric Tomography, as
well as possibly some newer emerging imaging modalities. It is devoted to
developing mathematical analytic and numerical tools needed in these techniques,
which are currently in their early (sometimes infant) stages of development.

Computerized tomography is a major method of biomedical imaging, as well as of
industrial non-destructive testing, geology, and other areas. Various modalities
have been developed, including for instance the usual X-ray clinical ``CAT
scan'', MRI, Optical, Ultrasound, and Electrical Impedance Tomography. All of
them have their advantages and deficiencies in terms of resolution, cost, and
safety. Thus a quest continues for new safer, cheaper, and reliable methods. In
recent years, novel hybrid methods have been emerging, which promise to become
cheap, safe and effective medical diagnostics tools. The project addresses the
mathematical issues that are central in their development, since images have to
be obtained by complex mathematical procedures rather than direct acquisition.
Besides the significant impact on the development and implementation of several
new inexpensive and safe methods of biomedical imaging, one can also envision a
possibility of applications to non-destructive industrial testing and other
areas where imaging of non-transparent objects is required.
