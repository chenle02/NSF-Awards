The United States Geological Survey is opening the 5030-ft-deep Varian A-1
well, 4 km southeast of the expected epicenter of the next Parkfield earthquake.
It is proposed to NSF that this well be instrumented with a 4-part sensor array
to conduct basic research into the character of small earthquakes and the
physical properties of the San Andreas Fault Zone. The design, installation,
data collection, and data analysis for this project will be conducted by
University of California, Santa Barbarba in collaboration with University of
California, Berkeley. The sensor array will consist of: (1) an "ultra low
frequency" downhole pressure transducer and 1-hz seismometer at the bottom of
the well, (2) a set of 8 "low frequency", 2-hz 3-component gimbled seismometer
packages spaced at 200-meter intervals along the well, (3) a set of 8 "high
frequency", 4.5-hz 3-component pressure-cased seismometer packages at 20-meter
intervals near the bottom of the well, and (4) a set of 8 "ultra high frequency"
1000-hz 1-component accelerometers at 2-meter intervals, also near the bottom of
the well. In this present proposal, UCSB seeks funds to construct and cement the
array into the well. An additional but separate part of our proposal is to
collect microearthquake data and analyze microearthquake Vertical Seismic
Profiles recorded on the "low frequency" part of the array. Requests for funding
of data collection and analysis for the other parts of the array will be
submitted in separate proposals by UCB.
