Ash 9531675 This award provides funding for a project that addresses some of
the connections between groups of integral matrices and the number theoretical
aspects of systems of polynomial equations with integer coefficients. In
particular, it studies the cohomology of arithmetic groups as a module for the
Hecke algebra, with connections to motives and Galois representations and
automorphic forms on adele groups. A theory of p-adic families of cohomology
classes for general arithmetic groups, with particular application to subgroups
of finite index in GL(m) is considered. Also investigated is a series of
computer calculations designed to probe for the existence of non-selfdual
automorphic representations of cohomological type, and another series to test a
conjecture relating modular Galois representations to Hecke eigenclasses in the
cohomology of GL(3,Z) with twisted coefficients mod p. This project falls into
the general area of Arithmetic Algebraic Geometry -a subject that blends two of
the oldest areas of mathematics: Number Theory and Geometry. This combination
has proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems that
withstood generations. Among its many consequences are new error correcting
codes. Such codes are essential for both modern computers (hard disks) and
compact disks.
