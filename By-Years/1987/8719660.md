The supply of engineering students over the next two decades is important to
the nation's economy, national security, and quality of life. A workshop on the
future supply of undergraduates in engineering is undertaken by the Engineering
Deans Council of the American Society for Engineering Education. The issues
addressed are: demographic changes; inadequate precollege preparation; and
minorities and women in undergraduate engineering education. A major objective
of the workshop is to identify barriers to increasing the number of students. A
further objective is to improve methodologies for recruiting able students to
engineering programs. Another objective is to improve retention rates of
incoming students. The workshop is to report, recommend and specify actions to
be taken by all undergraduate engineering programs.
