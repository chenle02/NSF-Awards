In previous work we have shown that the P gene regulates the accumulation of RNA
from three genes of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway. We have also shown that
P encodes proteins with significant homology to the DNA binding domain of the
c-myb family of oncogene proteins. Here, we propose a combined molecular,
biochemical and genetic analysis of the regulatory function of the P gene
products. We will generate antibodies against P proteins and use these to
identify the P-encoded proteins and determine post-translational modifications
may be involved in the regulatory function of P. The role of the P-encoded
expression of the P transcripts in different maize tissues. The target sequences
present in P regulated genes necessary for P regulation will be determined by
functional testing and in vitro DNA binding assays. Finally, we will analyze
mutations in the P-encoded proteins using two complementary in vivo systems. In
the first, we will attempt to reproduce P regulation of a target gene in the
yeast S. cerevisiae; if successful, this approach will facilitate rapid analysis
of P regulation and allow the identification of transcription factors which
interact with P. The second in vivo system examines P function in the maize
plant using the transposable element Ac to generate mutant alleles at the
specific sites in the P protein. Together, these results should help to reveal
fundamental mechanisms by which a plant regulatory gene activates
transcription.***//
