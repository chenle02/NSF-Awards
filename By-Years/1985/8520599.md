In this project, a systematic method for parameter identification for an assumed
system is developed. The method utilizes both the more general non-classical
modes of vibration and the more restrictive classical modes of vibration and
includes the effect of modal interference. Such a method would provide the most
general interpretation of vibration test results and would enable engineers to
gain insight into the complex behavior of an arch dam system. The method is
applied to the recent test results of the three existing arch dams. The accuracy
of the classical mode formulation and the importance of the non-classical modes
is critically assessed. An effort is also made to develop a method of
establishing a non-proportional damping matrix from the modal parameters.
Recommendations are made on vibration test procedures that would yield more
information on the behavior of arch dams than current procedures.
