Integrated Circuits (ICs) are becoming more complex and market demand continues
to pressure designers to produce new ICs in a shorter amount of time. For these
reasons, there is interest in the use of verification&lt;br/&gt;methods that
allow designers the ability to ensure correctness of their product without
resorting to time-consuming simulation techniques. Two approaches for
verification are equivalence checking and model checking. Internally, in these
two approaches, a method for checking the equivalence of Finite State Machines
(FSM) is commonly used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FSM equivalence checking is
typically implemented through the use of a symbolic state-space reachability
algorithm that uses BDD data structures and satisfiability (SAT) algorithms.
While there have been advances in symbolic FSM machine state-space traversal
methods in recent years, many designs of interest still cannot be verified using
this method due to the transition relation (TR) BDD becoming too large, the BDD
representing the state space already traversed becoming too large, the
intermediate BDDs during image computation becoming too large, and, the overall
process requiring too much computation time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Evolutionary
algorithms have recently been applied to several problems in design automation.
This research project involves the investigation of the use of evolutionary
algorithms for exact and approximate FSM&lt;br/&gt;equivalence checking.
Evolutionary algorithms are being developed that prune the TR and the reachable
state BDDs such that exact, over-approximation or under-approximation state
space traversals can be&lt;br/&gt;performed. Since evolutionary algorithms can
be quite computationally intensive, a major portion of this effort focuses on
the development of efficient mutation and crossover
operations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
