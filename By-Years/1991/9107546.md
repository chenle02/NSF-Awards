This research project consists of four interrelated project areas utilizing
field manipulations and laboratory experiments designed to elucidate several
features of epipelic periphyton function in lake ecosystems. Specific objectives
are 1) to determine how widespread are diel fluctuations in phosphorus efflux
rates from sediments among different lake types, 2) to further define the
mechanism(s) controlling diel variation in phosphorus efflux 3) to quantify the
effects of hydrodynamics and epipelic algal photosynthesis on seasonal oxygen
dynamics of lake hypolimnia, and 4) to quantify the relative contributions of
epipelic periphyton production and seston sedimentation to annual sediment
accretion. The mechanistic approach to examining these process- level questions
will rely on extensive use of oxygen and pH sensitive microelectrodes in both
field and laboratory, and on radiotracers for laboratory studies of
biogeochemical processes affected by the metabolic activity of periphyton. The
research will be based at The University of Notre Dame Environmental Research
Center in northern Wisconsin.
