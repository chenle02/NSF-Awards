Copper is released into the environment from many sources, including the
burning of fossil fuels and wood products, mining and smelting operations, and
through the application of copper compounds in agriculture for plant disease
control. Copper has accumulated in certain soils and water systems to levels
that have caused toxic effects on plants, animals, and microorganisms. Little is
known about how organisms can adapt to increased levels of copper, but such
information could have practical value in designing methods for detoxifying
copper or for genetically modifying plants and beneficial microbes for increased
tolerance to copper. Dr. Cooksey has isolated copper-resistant bacteria from an
agricultural system where copper compounds are routinely applied to plants for
bacterial disease control. He has also cloned and partly characterized the genes
that determine copper resistance. This proposal is to further characterize the
genetics of this system, and to investigate the physiological basis for copper
resistance. Since these bacteria accumulate high levels of copper, such that
they become bright blue, this system probably involves a unique mechanism of
metal resistance; other known metal resistance systems usually involve either
the exclusion of the toxic metal (with reduced accumulation), or the
detoxification of the metal by reduction or methylation. The combined molecular
genetic and biochemical approaches described in the proposal should provide new
fundamental information on how microorganisms can adapt to toxic levels of
copper and how they interact with this metal at the molecular level.
