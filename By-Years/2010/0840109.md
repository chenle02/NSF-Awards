The author intends to visit U.S. stations in Antarctica to complete a book on
Antarctic aviation and especially on the role of U.S. in supporting
international science. The work also will emphasize little-known (or small)
early expeditions.

The proposed volume would comprehensively document the history and current
status of a key element of the logistics network that makes science possible on
the southernmost continent and fill a gap in the existing published record on
the topic; currently there exists just one book on Antarctic aviation, which is
both out-of-print and dated.

A second existing work focuses on one specific Naval-aviation unit and is
therefore very limited in scope, relative to the topic of Antarctic aviation
generally.
