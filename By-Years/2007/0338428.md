Information on killer whale systematics and ecology is currently interpreted
within the conceptual framework of a single, intermixing species. However,
recent evidence suggests that three distinct forms of killer whales (Orcinus
sp.) occur in Antarctica during the austral summer. These forms have different
prey and habitat preferences, different average school sizes and geographic
distributions, and distinct morphologies, and therefore it was suggested that
they are best regarded as separate species. All three forms occur in the Ross
Sea and the investigators propose to evaluate the separate species hypothesis.
If, in fact, there are three distinct species in Antarctic waters, results of
the proposed work have the potential to largely re-shape our understanding of
killer whale ecology and conservation status in Antarctica. Given their large
numbers (current estimates: 25,000-94,000) and status as top trophic level
predators, killer whales are undoubtedly key species in the Antarctic ecosystem
but their roles will not be understood until their taxonomic status is
clarified. Also, the conservation status of killer whales, including potential
effects of commercial fishing, depends on properly identifying their taxonomic
status, specifying dietary needs, and assessing the impacts of fisheries. Two
main goals are proposed: (1) to compare genetic divergence among the three forms
and (2) to accurately determine lengths and body proportions for morphological
comparisons. The killer whale is arguably one of the most recognizable, and
best-studied, large animals on earth, yet basic questions about how many species
there are and how they function within the ecosystem remain unanswered.
Confirming new species in Antarctic waters would highlight the fact that our
knowledge of marine biodiversity is perhaps even more rudimentary than currently
recognized.
