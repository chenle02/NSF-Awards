This NSF-CONACyT Collaborative research project concentrates on analyzing wait-
free synchronous distributed systems. In particular, techniques from the
abstract mathematical area of simplicial algebraic topology are applied as a
powerful combinatorial tool. Specifically, as modern parallel and distributed
systems scale up, there is an increasing need for algorithms and data structures
to tolerate delays and failures. A data object or algorithm is wait-free if it
guarantees that any process can execute any operation within a fixed number of
steps, independent of the level of contention and the execution speeds of the
other processes. The goal of this project is to work toward a comprehensive
theory of wait-free synchronization. In the past few years, a number of
researchers have developed powerful new tools, based on classical algebraic
topology, for analyzing wait-free algorithms and data structures in a variety of
models. These new techniques are used in developing a comprehensive theory of
multiprocessor synchronization. The need for such a theory has become compelling
as tec hnological advances have made concurrent and distributed platforms
readily available. The topological approach to these problems may represent a
powerful new combinatorial tool for Computer Science, not just for distributed
computing, as for any problem area that requires reasoning about uncertainty and
partial information.
