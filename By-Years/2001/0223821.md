The objective of this research project is to develop a post-processing technique
to planarize curved freestanding thin film microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)
devices by means of controlled exposure to a neutral ion beam. The method works
by (1) affecting a thin highly stressed layer in the first few seconds of ion
beam exposure through atomic rearrangement near the surface of the film; and,
(2) removing initially stressed material in the film after several additional
minutes of ion beam exposure. These effects can be combined in a controlled way
to offset the initial relaxation curvature in the micro-mirror. MEMS micro-
mirrors are important components in several next-generation optical
communications devices. Freestanding MEMS micro-mirrors are often fabricated in
a layer-by-layer process before being released from a host substrate; through-
thickness dimensions may be as small as one micron or less. Once these thin
structures are released, residual stresses due to processing are relaxed by
transverse curvatures large enough to render the devices optically useless.

The program includes both theoretical and experimental work. Using analytical
and numerical models, the effects of various processing parameters will be
studied; experiments will be carried out to test these parameters, and the
quality of the resulting planarized mirrors will be characterized.
