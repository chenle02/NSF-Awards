This project is to support a conference aimed at producing a publication on the
history of health and nutrition in the Western Hemisphere. The project extends
previous research on health and nutrition by analyzing skeletal evidence from
pre-Columbian times to the early twentieth century. The research findings of
sixteen teams consisting of economics historians and physical anthropologists
will be presented and discussed at the conference to be held in Columbus, Ohio
in the fall of 1995. Publication of the conference findings will be of enormous
value to scholars and researchers interested in health, economic, and life-style
changes of the early peoples of the Western Hemisphere.
