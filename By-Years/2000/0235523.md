At the back of the eye is the retina, which includes the retinal pigment
epithelium (RPE) as well as photoreceptor cells. The cells of the pigment
epithelium in many vertebrates contain a dark pigment that screens light, and
this pigment can shuttle out into finger-like projections of the RPE cells htat
in turn interdigitate with the photoreceptors. In teleost fish, when the eye is
in bright conditions, pigment granule dispersion is an important component of
retinal responses associated with light adaptation. It is not fully clear how a
light signal to the photoreceptors triggers the RPE to control this pigment
dispersion. One extracellular messenger is known to be the amino acid dopamine,
and recent data show that the compound carbachol also induces pigment granule
dispersion in teleost fish RPE. Because carbachol mimics the effects of the
neurotransmitter acetylcholine, the discovery of carbachol's effects suggests a
role for acetylcholine as a physiological messenger molecule signaling bright
light conditions to the RPE. Acetylcholine and carbachol act on target cells by
binding to a class of molecular receptors called muscarinic receptors. This
project uses molecular techniques and information currently available from
zebrafish genome projects to test whether bluegill fish have genes to express
particular types of muscarinic receptors, and whether these receptors are
responsible for the carbachol-induced dispersion. &lt;br/&gt; Results will
establish how acetylcholine might act as an extracellular messenger in the
teleost eye RPE, and will have an impact beyond sensory neurobiology by
advancing our understanding of the biology of muscarinic receptors and
cholinergic signaling. This Research at Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) project
also provides an excellent opportunity for undergraduate training, in particular
including students from historically underserved minority groups, with a
minority woman faculty PI as a role model. &lt;br/&gt;
