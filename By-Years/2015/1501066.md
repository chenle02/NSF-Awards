This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the
"International Conference on Harmonic Analysis and Its Applications" that will
be held June 1-5, 2015, at the Graduate Center of the City University of New
York.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference brings together specialists from
different parts of harmonic analysis and its applications, among them experts in
classical harmonic analysis, in frame analysis, and in the study of large data
sets. Some of the specific topics that will be discussed at the event are the
following: analysis and geometry of high-dimensional data sets; compressive
sensing; diffusion geometry; frame and wavelet theory; homogeneous spaces;
interpolation spaces; phase retrieval; Radon transforms; sampling theory; sigma-
delta quantization; signal and image processing; symmetric spaces and Paley-
Wiener spaces; time-frequency analysis; visualization and learning theory. The
list of featured speakers includes Peter Casazza, Ronald Coifman, Palle
Jorgensen, Adam Koranyi, Michael Lacey, Mauro Maggioni, and Elias Stein. The
conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs,
and other young scientists to present their work.
