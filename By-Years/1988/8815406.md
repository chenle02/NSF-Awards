This grant supports a general research program to utilize the 14 meter diameter
telescope at the Five College Radio Astronomy Observatory (FCRAO) which is
operated by the University of Massachusetts. This instrument is the largest
Americal millimeter wave, single dish telescope, and it is equipped with state-
of-the-art receivers for observations in the 7, 3, 2, and 1 mm wavelength bands.
The research program covers a variety of topics which include studies of
extragalactic systems, the dense interstellar medium, star formation, the late
stages of stellar evolution, astrochemistry, and planetary science. The
Observatory also plays a major role in graduate education in radio astronomy in
the United States. Continued development of new instrumentation is vital to the
scientific productivity of the telescope, and that area is a high priority at
FCRAO. During this grant period, the focus will be on implementing a 15 element
array receiver for use at a wavelength of 3 mm, on constructing a versatile
spectrometer backend for data acquisition with the array receiver, and on
obtaining the computer hardware and software to support the reduction and
analysis of a substantially increased data flow. The array detector will result
in more than an order of magnitude improvement in the efficiency with which the
telescope can obtain data, and it will permit an entirely new class of
millimeter wavelength projects to be undertaken.
