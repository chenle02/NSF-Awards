9401509 Delzell This awards supports the research of Professors C. Delzell and
J. Madden to work in real algebraic geometry. In particular they will try to
extend their theory of local real algebraic geometry from dimension two to
dimension 3. They will also study consequences of their recent proof of the
existence of a completely normal spectral space which is not the real spectrum
of any commutative ring. This research is in the field of algebraic geometry,
one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which blossomed to the
point where it has, in the past 10 years, solved problems that have stood for
centuries. Originally, it treated figures defined in the plane by the simplest
of equations, namely polynomials. Today, the field uses methods not only from
algebra, but also from analysis and topology, and conversely it is extensively
used in those fields. Moreover it has proved itself useful in fields as diverse
as physics, theoretical computer science, cryptography, coding theory and
robotics.
