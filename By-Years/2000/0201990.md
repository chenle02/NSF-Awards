This dissertation investigates how immigrant Chinese and Indian entrepreneurs
in Silicon Valley use social networks to develop their enterprises. The
dissertation hypothesizes that the strong social ties typical of co-ethnic
networks are especially important for success in startup phases but that the
weak ties found in broader networks beyond the ethnic community become more
important during the expansion phase. Data will be collected in a survey
followed up by more intensive interviews.
