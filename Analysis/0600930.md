Advances in Modern Free Boundary Problems Abstract of Proposed Research Eduardo
V Teixeira

This project is to study free boundary problems that arise in science. One
problem is to study mathematical models of the optimal shape of an heterogeneous
body with respect insulation. That is one wishes to minimize the heat flux as a
function of shape for the same exterior conditions. This model also corresponds
to a number of other physical optimization problems. Another project is to study
certain free boundary problems that arise in combustion theory and the
propagation of flame fronts.

Mathematically these problems involve the existence, regularity and stability
of free boundaries and of the solutions of the systems of equations that model
these phenomena. The PI proposes to develop new analytical and geometrical
methods for analyzing these problems.
