9423577 Sytsma The investigators propose a morphologic and molecular
phylogenetic study of a diverse group of plants, the tribe Coleeae, from
Madagascar and Africa. Within Madagascar the tribe has undergone tremendous
diversification in habit, habitat, leaf form, floral and fruit features, and in
reproductive biology. Testable hypotheses are proposed involving the evolution
of floral characters and breeding systems. %%% The study is an example of the
value of phylogenetic systematics to understanding ecological diversification.
