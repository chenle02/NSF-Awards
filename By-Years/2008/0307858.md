The Mashantucket Pequot Museum and Research Center will implement a three-year,
research-based community program entitled "Archeology Pathways for Native
Learners." This comprehensive program consists of four components or pathways
that are designed to increase participation of Native Americans in science.
Pathway #1 invites students and teachers from New Haven Public Schools to
participate in archaeology field research, which expands to include youth
throughout the northeastern US. Students will be involved with site excavation,
documentation and analysis of findings in an archaeology laboratory, working
with scientists to interpret findings, and communicating the results of research
to their peers and through the project Web site. Concurrently, in the first year
of the project, Pathway #2 will focus on the expansion of museum programs for
youth and community members in addition to the creation of related professional
development programs for educators. Pathway #3 calls for replication of the
research model at Navajo sites in New Mexico and Arizona during year three,
while Pathway #4 emphasizes leadership training workshops for Native Americans
from over 50 tribal communities. Workshops will focus on the creation of
research-based youth programs in native communities across the country, using a
train-the-trainer model to disseminate the model. It is anticipated that this
project will reach more than 60,000 youth and community members, in addition to
over 450,000 individuals via the Archeology Pathways website.
