9617595 Getty This project will attempt to develop U-Pb dating for shallow
marine carbonates (corals) between 1-10 million years old. Current dating
methods are inadequate in this time range; successful development of the method
will permit studies of carbonate bank evolution and eustatic sealevel change
under different climate conditions than those of the present. Preliminary data
on samples from the Pinecrest Formation of Florida indicate large U/Pb ratios,
rapid production of 206Pb and age estimate accurate to about+ 100,000 years. The
project will first examine a relatively young coral using both the standard
U.-series and the U-Pb techniques to evaluate U-Pb initial conditions. Corals
and molluscs from the Pinecrest Formation will then be analyzed to test
applicability further.
