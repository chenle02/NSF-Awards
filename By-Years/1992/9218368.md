This investigation of intramolecular and solvation dynamics in ultrafast
nonlinear spectroscopy is a part of the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry
Program of the Division of Chemistry. The optical response of chromophores in
polar and nonpolar liquids is being computationally simulated. Both
benzene/argon and water clusters are being studied. Methods for calculating the
cooperative radiative dynamics of confined excitons is being developed and
applied to the excitonic response of rare-gas clusters. Superradiance and
polariton effects on retarded intermolecular interactions in liquids and
disordered solids are being treated in a consistent way. %%% Modern
spectroscopic methods often reveal how molecules in liquids and solids interact
with each other and with radiation. This information can be obtained with aid of
theories and computational simulations of the types being developed in this
program of studies and applied to systems such as clusters of water molecules.
