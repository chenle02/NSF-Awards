The projects seeks to investigate the combined use of robust feedback control
based on estimation of disturbances such as cutting forces, low-velocity
friction compensation, and feedforward control based on inverse dynamics of
machine feed drive systems, and the integration of these control schemes with
standard Computer Numerical Control (CNC) functions on a laboratory personal
computer. A machining center will be used as a test bed for demonstrating the
control schemes and their integration. The resulting system will be a prototype
turnkey system, which makes it possible for machine tool developers, programmers
and operators to receive the full benefit of advanced controls without
specialized knowledge of machine tool dynamics and control theory. It is
expected that this project will have a significant impact in the highly
competitive area of high-speed machining.
