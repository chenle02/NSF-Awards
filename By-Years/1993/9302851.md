9302851 Sieradzan This is an RUI proposal for the precision measurement of
atomic excited-state interactions in one-and two-electron atoms. The experiment
would improve the determination of such quantities by an order of magnitude with
significant implications for theoretical calculations which are crucial to the
interpretation of atomic parity violation experiments. The experimental approach
would be a pump- delayed-prove method to achieve spectral resolutions well below
the natural linewidths.
