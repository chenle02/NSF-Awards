This Presidential Young Investigator project includes studies of transition-
metal nitrides and carbides, organometallic cluster-derived materials, and
amorphous and metastable materials. Nitrides and carbides of early transition
metals are prepared as well-defined thin films by using ion-beam techniques, and
as high-surface-area particulate using solid- state reactions; catalytic and
electrocatalytic applications of these materials are then investigated.
Organometallic clusters containing bridging sulfido, nitrido, or carbido ligands
are studied as precursors to electronic materials or ultradispersed ensembles on
oxide supports for catalytic applications. Catalytic properties of amorphous or
metastable materials prepared by ion-beam techniques are investigated.
