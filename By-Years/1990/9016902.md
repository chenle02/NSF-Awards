This award supports the participation of six US scientists in a joint US-Japan
seminar on "Biology of the Epidermis," July 21-25, 1991 in Sapporo, Japan. The
co-organizers are Professor Joseph McGuire, Department of Dermatology, Stanford
University School of Medicine, and Professor Akira Ohkawara, Department of
Dermatology, Hokkaido University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan. Specific
topics to be discussed at the seminar include (1) stratum corneum and
extracellular lipids; (2) structural proteins of the epidermis; (3) regulation
of proliferation and differentiation, vitamin D3, growth factors and cytokines;
and (4) expression of oncogenes by keratinocytes. This will be the fifth seminar
on this subject since 1976. These seminars have played an important role in
fostering and promoting interactions between US and Japanese dermatologists and
skin researchers. Because much information on the epidermis has become known
since the last seminar in 1985, the proposed seminar is particularly timely. The
epidermis covers the entire human body, protecting internal organs and
maintaining human homeostasis. In order to perform protection and maintenance of
proper homeostasis, the epidermis possesses highly organized features and
functions. Much research has been undertaken to try to understand these,
concentrating on defining the morphological and biochemical properties of the
epidermis. The field is expanding rapidly, particularly in the areas of
molecular biology and regulation of cell growth and differentiation. Significant
contributions are currently being made to the field of skin science, which
should eventually lead to the resolution of the pathogenesis of various skin
diseases. Because the seminar will address topics where significant recent
advances have been made, the meeting should bring the U.S. and Japanese research
communities up to date and stimulate future collaborative projects.
