Evolution is generally thought to be a slow, plodding process. However, it can
sometimes be surprisingly fast, with noticeable changes occurring in only a few
generations. The speed of evolution depends on such factors as the severity of
natural selection, the rate of mutation, and the size of the population. This
project focuses on the effects of spatial structure: the way a population is
spread out within its habitat. Previous research has shown that some structures
speed up evolution while others slow it down. The investigators will use
mathematical modeling to gain a deeper understanding of why, and under what
conditions, spatial structure can change the rate of evolution. Undergraduate
students, including those from groups typically underrepresented in STEM, will
be trained in mathematical modeling and engaged in all aspects of the research
process. Results of this investigation may inform the estimation of important
events in our evolutionary past, such as when humans split from our closest
primate relatives. This work may also aid our understanding of cancer, which can
be seen as unwanted evolution occurring inside the body.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mathematically, the rate of evolution in spatially
structured populations can be studied using evolutionary graph theory. Spatial
structure is represented as a graph (or network), in which individuals occupy
vertices and edges indicate spatial relationships. Evolution is modeled as a
stochastic process driven by birth and death events, leading to the fixation or
extinction of new genetic mutations. A decade of research has shown that graph
topology can affect both the rate at which mutations accrue and the balance of
selection versus drift. However, exact results are known only for very simple
graphs, and few general theorems have been proven. Additionally, evolutionary
graph theory is so far limited to haploid, asexual populations. This project
will apply new analytical techniques to evolutionary graph theory, and extend
the theory to include sexually reproducing diploid populations.
