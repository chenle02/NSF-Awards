The California Academy of Sciences will develop, evaluate and disseminate
exhibits and programs designed to communicate to public audiences the results of
research including a biotic inventory of the amphibians and reptiles of Myanmar.
Using innovative trading cards for kids, updates to current research exhibits, a
poster highlighting research, a pocket guide to venomous snakes of Myanmar and a
posting of research -related materials on the CAS website, the project will
inform the public about biotic inventory research and conservation in Myanmar.
Designed specifically for target audiences of children and adults, the exhibits
and programs will serve several hundred thousand CAS visitors annually.
