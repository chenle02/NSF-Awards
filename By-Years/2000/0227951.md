Dr. Martha Mecartney is an Associate Professor at the University of California -
Irvine. Dr. Mecartney has created outreach programs for K-12 students and
developed summer programs for middle school teachers from low-income
communities. She has had extensive involvement in the UC Irvine California
Alliance for Minority Participation, and was the founder of the Alliance for
Graduate Education Program (a nine-campus consortium) and the UC Irvine Fastrack
to the Professoriate. Both of these were designed to advance minorities and
women into graduate level engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Mecartney is
commended for her effort that has led to the mobility of minorities and women
into the professoriate and the engineering profession, especially through her
attention to the interests and needs of undergraduate women. The sheer volume of
programs and services that Dr. Mecartney has led exemplifies her creative
academic leadership and insightful programming that listens to and is instructed
by the voices of minorities and women.&lt;br/&gt;
