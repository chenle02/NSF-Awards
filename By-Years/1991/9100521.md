This x-ray diffraction system is suitable for powder diffraction experiments,
single crystal and thin film work, and is equipped with a full Eulerian specimen
carrier for texture measurements. Access to this fully automatic, user-friendly
system will be made to faculty and students throughout the University, in need
of rapid specimen characterization, and will be incorporated in a teaching
laboratory for training of students. Materials research efforts currently
underway include: the local arrangement of point defects in non-stoichiometric
oxides; studies of mercury-cadmium-telluride II-IV semiconductors to determine
the state of local chemical order and atomic displacements; studies in iron-
nickel-carbon steels to elucidate the effects of carbon ordering on matensite
formation and determination of phase fractions and lattice paramaters of steels;
determination of periodicities in two dimensions in metal-metal, metal-ceramic,
and metal-semiconductor interfaces; residual stress measurements in
microcracking ceramics, and phase characterization of zirconia oxide thermal
barrier coatings.
