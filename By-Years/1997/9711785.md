1 9711785 Smalley The objective of this Selected Research Opportunity Grant is
to interrogate the true tensile strength of an individual single-wall carbon
nanotube (SWNT). Achieving these very difficult experiments will require
substantial improvements in techniques for isolating, manipulating, and securing
SWNT ropes onto fabricated supports. A single continuous rope of SWNTs will be
draped cross metallic line features on a silicon wafer fabricated at the
Stanford Nanofabrication Facility. The sample will then be introduced into an
atomic force microscope which will be used for three purposes: (1) The entire
sample will be scanned periodically, first to find an attractive span, and
subsequently to look for signs of breakage and slippage; (2) High-resolution
scans of the rope lying on the support lines on either side of the span will
yield the geometry of the rope, giving a good estimate for the number of SWNTs
in the rope; (3) The AFM tip will be engaged at one point in the middle of the
span to deflect the rope. The known AFM cantilever force constant along with the
measured deflections will provide the information required to obtain tensile
strengths of the rope and of the individual tubes. %%% New evidence suggests
that carbon nanotubes are the strongest materials known, potentially enabling
unique applications in many areas critical to the U.S. economy. This research
will involve direct measurements of the strength of nanotube ropes using
micromanipulators. The results will provide the foundation for research and
development of nanotube based superstrong materials and their applications
