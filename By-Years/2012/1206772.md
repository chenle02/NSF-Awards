Stochastic dynamic models of complex networks arise in a wide variety of
applications in science and engineering. Specific instances include high-tech
manufacturing, telecommunications, computer systems, service systems and
biochemical reaction networks. This project involves the study of a number of
mathematical problems stemming from the challenges of analyzing and controlling
such dynamic stochastic networks. A balance of topics is proposed. Some topics
involve the development of general theory for broad classes of networks, while
others focus on mathematical problems directly motivated by specific
applications. Since the complexity of these networks usually precludes exact
analysis of detailed microscopic models, the focus here is on approximate
models. Mathematical questions to be addressed include rigorous justification of
these approximations, analyzing and controlling the behavior of the approximate
models and interpreting the results for the original microscopic models.
&lt;br/&gt;Four topics are proposed for study:&lt;br/&gt;(i) Dynamic control of
stochastic processing networks,&lt;br/&gt;(ii) Analysis of processor sharing
networks,&lt;br/&gt;(iii) Congestion control and resource entrainment in data
networks,&lt;br/&gt;(iv) Stochastic systems with delayed dynamics and state
constraints.&lt;br/&gt;Some stochastic process aspects of these topics include
study of singular diffusion control problems, analysis of measure-valued
processes, foundational questions for reflected processes, and the asymptotic
properties of functional stochastic differential equations with natural state
constraints.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dynamic stochastic networks are used as
mathematical models in a wide variety of applications in science and
engineering, particularly in operations management, computer science, electrical
engineering and bioengineering. This grant funds research to develop new results
and techniques for addressing mathematical problems stemming from the need to
analyze and control such dynamic stochastic networks. The networks under study
are substantially more general than those that have been rigorously studied to
date. The results will be of fundamental mathematical interest as well as of
interest for applied researchers in relevant areas of science and engineering.
The training of mathematics PhD students, dissemination of results through
publication in peer-reviewed journals and presentations of the research at
cross-disciplinary conferences, are all integral parts of the project.
