This research is intended to identify and resolve the problem of dynamic process
oriented migration among heterogeneous systems joined with a local network. The
results of this research will provide a basis for better integration of
heterogeneous systems working on common problems. This work will also provide a
laboratory for implementing and studying dynamic load balancing and load sharing
schemes. This research is a logical first step for a wide body of further
research including: identification of subtle issues in software portability,
understanding the requirements for moving software in an active state between
machines embodying diverse architectures, testing diverse approaches to
optimization, and evaluating load balancing algorithms.
