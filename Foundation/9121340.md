Partial support is provided for the Mid-Atlantic Mathematical Logic Seminar.
MAMLS was formed in the fall of 1982. It has been running three or four meetings
a year under the primary supervision of Lee Stanley since that time. Four
meetings per year are projected for the next three years, including some
meetings held jointly with other organizations. The seminar covers a broad
spectrum of mathematical logic with particular emphasis on complexity theory,
theoretical computer science, fragments of arithmetic, pure and applied model
theory, set theory, subsystems of analysis in accordance with the program of H.
Friedman and S. Simpson, and topos theory. Support is provided primarily for
outside speakers. Supportis also provided for travel expenses of graduate
students and other regular seminar participants not supported by other grants,
and for incidental expenses associated with organizing and running the seminar,
notably mailing costs (copying and postage). MAMLS was supported by NSF in
1984-1985 through a supplement to Lee J. Stanley's grant MCS 8201042 at Lehigh
University, in 1985-1987 under grant DMS 8506058, in 1987-1989 through grant DMS
8704751, and since 1989 under grant DMS 8907348, all to Lehigh University with
Lee J. Stanley as project director.
