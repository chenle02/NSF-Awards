The explosion of digital data carries a wealth of opportunities. The ability to
collect and mine data at scale continues to enable new applications and
transform our lives. However, privacy concerns are seen as a major hurdle
towards data sharing and analytics. This project develops a practical framework
for "oblivious computation", which allows general computation over sensitive
data, but without disclosing the data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work
takes a combined algorithms and programming language lens. On the programming
language side, the proposed work designs friendly programming abstractions that
facilitate the compilation of programs into efficient, oblivious
representations. On the algorithms side, the proposed work designs efficient
oblivious algorithms for a wide characterization of realistic tasks. The
resulting framework, ObliVM, allows non-expert developers to write programs much
as they do today, and ObliVM automatically generates the corresponding oblivious
computation implementation. ObliVM supports several different architectures for
implementing oblivious computation, including those based on trusted hardware
and those based on cryptographic secure computation. ObliVM offers a unified
programming framework such that a developer can write a program irrespective of
the backend architecture -- through a universal intermediate representation,
this program can be compiled to either a trusted hardware-based or a
cryptography-based backend architecture. ObliVM can facilitate the deployment of
oblivious computation in real-life scenarios, and allow businesses and
individuals to monetize sensitive data without the risk of exposure.
