The objective of this research equipment grant is to purchase a
stereolithography rapid prototyping machine and necessary accessories. The
equipment will be used for several research efforts with special emphasis on (1)
rapid prototyping directly from a non-uniform rational B-spline based solid
modeling systems, and (2) computer-aided design based interactive graphics
modification and automatic verification of three dimensional objects using laser
scanning data. The equipment will facilitate the completion of a research
program resulting in the development of a testbed that will demonstrate how to
electronically bridge the gap between design and manufacturing for the
production of rapid prototypes.
