Dr. Daniel Savin and Dr. Holger Kreckel at Columbia University will examine
destruction rates for the hydrogen molecule H3+ in the laboratory with
applications for studying molecular clouds and emission line objects such as
Galactic and extragalactic gaseous nebulae. The laboratory measurements will
focus on measurements of H3+ dissociative recombination, which plays an
important role in the formation of complex molecules observed in molecular
clouds. The team will also make similar measurements for oxygen (O2+), sulfur
(S2+), and neon (Ne2+) molecules to determine the effective temperature of
ionizing stars in HII regions.

This work will impact the astronomical community by generating atomic and
molecular data that can be used to interpret astronomical observations. This
will be a trans-disciplinary effort, bringing together astrophysics, atomic and
molecular physics. The research will also help foster international
collaborations in astrophysics as it will be carried out using the heavy-ion
Test Storage Ring at the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg,
Germany, as no facilities currently exist in the U.S. for the proposed studies.
