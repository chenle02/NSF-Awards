ATM-9419638 VanZandt Abstract We propose to continue the operation and
development of the Flatland Atmospheric Observatory (FAO), located in very flat
terrain near Champaign-Urbana, Illinois, for three years. Instrumentation at FAO
includes a five-beam 50 MHz wind-profiling radar, a five-beam 915 MHz wind-
profiling radar with a radio- acoustic sounding system (RASS) to measure
temperature profiles, a ground meteorological station, an array of 24 digital
barographs centered on FAO, and a facility to launch radiosondes to measure
temperature and humidity. All of the instruments except the radiosondes operate
continuously through thee year. FAO will be use for atmospheric research
principally in the following areas: (1) Studies of the mesoscale wind field,
particularly gravity waves and momentum flux; and (2) Studies of the planetary
boundary layer, particularly structure and entrainment, heat budget, and
precipitaion classification. Considerable effort will be devoted to exploring
the technology of wind-profiling radars; that is, their capabilities for
observing microscale and mesoscale wind structures, as well as long term
vertical velocities.
