This project will provide support for delegates travel to attend the Third
International Conference on Ethics and Development to be held in Tegucigalpa,
Honduras, on June 21-27, 1992. Colorado State University and the International
Development Ethics Association (IDEA) are the North American sponsors of the
conference. The theme is "The Ethics of Ecodevelopment: Culture, the Environment
and Dependency." Conference participants are expected to number 200, including
50 Hondurans. IDEA is an interdisciplinary, cross-cultural group of 300
philosophers, development theorists, and practitioners who apply ethical
reflection to national and international development goals and strategies and to
the relations between the "North" and the "South." Among the Conference's
distinctive aims are to promote a fruitful convergence of international
development ethics and environmental ethics; to contribute to the formation of a
new paradigm of sustainable development; and to generate a greater understanding
of the actual and ideal relationships between biodiversity, cultural diversity,
and sustainable development. The immediate beneficiaries of these funds will be
participants from the Third World who otherwise would not be able to attend the
conference. Other participants will benefit from their exchange with these
speakers about their understanding of the problems of and solutions to species
impoverishment, environmental degradation, and unjust development in both South
and North. Besides articles, publications, and proceedings, results will include
media interviews, newsletter and newspaper articles, and further development of
the international network of theorists, analysts, decision makers, academic
institutions and stakeholder groups concerned about these issues.
