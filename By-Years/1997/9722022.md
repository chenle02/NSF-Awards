Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will include work on string
theory, the interface between particle physics and cosmology, fundamental
problems in quantum theory, the application of quantum field theory to phenomena
in particle physics and statistical mechanics, random matrix theory and lattice
gauge theory. Research in string theory will focus on the search for a
nonperturbative formulation. This includes study of physics at the shortest
distance scales and of the quantum mechanics of black holes. Work on
astroparticle physics will focus on problems related to matter production in the
early universe, and properties of dark matter and its possible detection.
Research on fundamental problems in quantum theory will concentrate on the role
of classical chaos in various quantum systems, including quantum field theories.
Work on the applications of quantum field theory will include the study of
various phenomena in random matrix theory, in particle physics, and in
statistical physics. Work in lattice gauge theory will be directed at the
calculation of masses of strongly interacting particles, the weak decays of
these particles, and the behavior of strongly interacting matter at high
temperatures. The topics to be covered include some of the most interesting and
centrally important questions in present-day elementary particle physics.
