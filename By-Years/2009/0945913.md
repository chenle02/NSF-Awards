This SBIR Phase I project will develop a phage technology to remediate and
control the foam-causing microorganisms at wastewater treatment plants. The
research will include isolation of problematic foaming Nocardia species,
isolation of phage capable of killing foaming Nocardia, and evaluation of phage
clearing of Nocardia in batch culture test systems. This is an important issue
in wastewater treatment and the concept of using phage for foam control in waste
water systems is innovative.

The broader/commercial impacts of the proposed project will be the potential
applications of the proposed technology. Activated sludge wastewater treatment
processes are common. Problematic foaming caused by excessive microbial growth
occurs if the operation conditions are not optimized. The project will allow
development of an innovative solution and if successful, should have significant
commercial value.
