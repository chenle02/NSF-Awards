This action funds Ellenor J Brown of the Georgia Institute of Technology to
conduct a research project, entitled "Muscle Training Effects from Physical
Interaction with a Wearable Robotic System," during the summer of 2012 at the
Nara Institute of Science and Technology (NAIST) in Nara, Japan. The host
scientist is Dr. Tsukasa Ogasawara.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to gain a better understanding
of muscle coordination in healthy adults, information that may be useful for
understanding and rehabilitating muscle coordination disorders and for target
muscle training for fitness and conditioning. Muscle coordination is being
monitored using an exoskeleton robot worn by the subjects. The long-term goal of
the project is to develop ways to predict and alter muscle coordination for a
given movement task.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
