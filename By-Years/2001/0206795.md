This proposal deals with the design and analysis of efficient algorithms
for&lt;br/&gt;the class of hybrid systems called (discrete-time) piecewise
linear (PL)&lt;br/&gt;systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The area of hybrid systems
concerns issues of modeling, computation and&lt;br/&gt;control for systems which
combine discrete and continuous components.&lt;br/&gt;The subclass of PL
systems, which we investigate in this project,&lt;br/&gt;provides one systematic
approach&lt;br/&gt;to discrete-time hybrid systems, naturally blending switching
mechanisms with&lt;br/&gt;classical linear components.&lt;br/&gt;PL systems are
of interest as controllers as well as identification models,&lt;br/&gt;and they
can be thought of as arbitrary interconnections of finite automata&lt;br/&gt;and
linear systems. &lt;br/&gt;Tools from automata theory, logic and related areas
of computer&lt;br/&gt;science and finite mathematics are used in the study of PL
systems, in&lt;br/&gt;conjunction with linear algebra techniques, all in the
context of a ``PL&lt;br/&gt;algebra'' formalism. In this project, we will study
basic algorithmic&lt;br/&gt;and computational problems for these problems with
applications to&lt;br/&gt;modelling of biological
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More concretely, &lt;br/&gt;basic questions for
any class of systems are those of equivalence, and, in&lt;br/&gt;particular,
whether state spaces are equivalent under a change of variables.&lt;br/&gt;This
project will address various algorithmic and computational
challenges&lt;br/&gt;related to this state-space equivalence and isomorphism
problem for PL&lt;br/&gt;systems, as well as questions of learnability and
representability for such&lt;br/&gt;systems. The project also suggests the use
of PL models for differential gene&lt;br/&gt;expression testing.&lt;br/&gt;
