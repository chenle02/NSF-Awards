This grant will support research in differential geometry and nonlinear control
theory to advance our understanding of motion planning for nonholonomic systems.
Nonholonomic problems arise in mobile robot navigation, rolling contacts and
robotic grasping, free-floating robots in space or underwater, and control of
legged robots.
