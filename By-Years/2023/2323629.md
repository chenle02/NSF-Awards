The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development of a lithium battery recycling process to recover essential metals.
With the drive towards less pollution and the adoption of electric technologies
such as electric vehicles, battery demand is predicted to increase along with
battery waste. The proposed process may help to ensure the reliable supply of
essential resources to the local lithium battery market as well as the safe and
effective treatment of lithium battery waste. In addition, the process may allow
for cost savings during the metal recovery process and aid in supplementing the
local supply of metals for lithium-based energy storage technology manufacture.
The proposed efficient battery waste process may serve to prevent improper
lithium battery waste management and foster sustainability within the lithium
battery market.

This I-Corps project is based on the development of a recycling process for the
recovery of metal-based materials from waste associated with lithium batteries.
The proposed process applies a hydroiodic acid-based solution for the selective
recovery via leaching of critical metals from lithium battery cathode material.
In conventional hydrometallurgical lithium battery recycling operations,
elevated temperatures are used to improve process kinetics and a reducing agent
is added to the leaching media to improve cathode metal recoveries. However,
this results in costs associated with energy requirements to achieve high
temperatures and the purchase of reducing agents. In addition, these systems
result in the production of toxic gaseous compounds such as chlorine, nitrogen
oxides and sulfur oxides. The proposed process has been shown to recover metals,
on average, nine times faster, at temperatures close to ambient in the absence
of a reducing agent, and without toxic gas production.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
