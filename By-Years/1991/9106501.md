This research process and performance consequences of changes in various
aspects of work groups. It builds upon and is an extension of a continuing
program of research on time in group interaction and performance. The studies
will make use of two major products of earlier work in that program: A theory of
work in groups (called Time, Interaction and Performance, of TIP, theory), and a
time-oriented system for analysis of interaction process in work groups (called
Time-by-Event-by-Member Pattern Observation system, or TEMPO). TIP theory
predicts a number of important consequences for group process and outcomes, of
changes in group membership, changes in group tasks, and changes in the
circumstances under which the group is operating. TEMPO provides a method for
testing many of the predictions about process changes. A new set of techniques,
called "process replay", will be developed and used to explore the situated
meanings of acts within group process and relate those meanings to the main
concepts of TIP theory.
