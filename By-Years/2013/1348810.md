The project conducts an exploration of elements of geometric mathematics tasks
that promote students' record keeping (RK) strategies that facilitate student
cognition during problem solving and aid in communication about how solutions
were obtained. The project addresses three questions: (1) What features of
mathematics task presentation promote record keeping that aid middle grades
students cognition and communication? (2) What principles can be derived and
applied for designing tasks to promote useful record keeping? (3) How does
student performance differ on tasks designed with supports for record keeping
versus tasks without such supports? Are there different impacts for English
Language Learners (ELL) versus non-ELL students? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project uses the framework of Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) to guide the work. A
variety of methods will be used in the study, including student observations and
interviews, design and testing of tasks and creation of a rubric, and an
experiment that uses tasks with and without RK supports, particularly noting
impacts for ELL students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study's findings has
immediate relevance for mathematics instruction.
