ABSTRACT CTS-9700312 John Dorgan The Chemical Engineering, Physics, and
Metallurgical and Materials Engineering Departments of the Colorado School of
Mines (CSM) will obtain a variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometer which will
be used in a wide variety of projects including the following: 1. Investigation
of polymer and copolymer layers near solid inorganic surfaces. 2. Exploration of
the electronic structure of photovoltaics. 3. Characterization of thin films
from the Advanced Coatings and Surface Engineering Laboratory (ACSEL) in the
Metallurgical and Materials Engineering department. 4. Incorporation into the
class Experimental Methods in Materials Science. The acquisition of the
instrument: 1) provides a means of testing theories of material systems of
interest to the researchers at CSM, 2) enables the rational advancement of the
Materials Science of thin films 3) enhances the educational experience of
graduate students participating in the interdisciplinary Materials Science
Program, and 4) builds the scientific infrastructure on campus.
