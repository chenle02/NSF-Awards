By analyzing the morphological and genetic differences among populations of
species of frogs in the high Andes in Peru by cladistic methods, it will be
possible to determine the evolutionary relationships of five lineages of frogs.
Once this has been accomplished, repetitive patterns of species formation and
biogeography will be compared with existing data on historic patterns of
climatic and geologic changes. The results will provide an interpretation of how
such changes affected the speciation and distributions of the frogs and will
provide a basis for comparison with other groups of organisms.
