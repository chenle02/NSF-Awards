9732159 Sellin This research is a joint experimental and theoretical effort
whose primary objectives are the testing and elucidation of the details of
single and multiple ionization, of electron transfer, and of atomic interactions
at surfaces. Both electromagnetic radiation and charged particles will be used
as collision partners, and comparisons will be made of the similarities and
differences induced by the two types of collision.
