Research in theoretical physics, to be carried out by one of the new
Presidential Young Investigators for 1991, will focus on the numerical
computation of physical quantities using an approximation which replaces the
continuum of space- time by a discrete lattice of points. One of the quantities
to be calculated in this computer-intensive approach is the "B parameter," which
describes the probability for a K particle to turn into its antiparticle. To
date, studies of the K particle are our only source of information on the
asymmetry between matter and antimatter, and the interpretation of these studies
depends critically on a knowledge of the B parameter.
