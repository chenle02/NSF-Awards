The diffusive and adsorptive properties of water vapor and organic compounds on
highly silicious zeolites will be determined by a gravimetric technique and a
well-stirred reactor. The primary objective is to obtain adsorption and
diffusion data as a function of Si/Al ratios for both single component and
multicomponent systems to gain fundamental understanding of adsorption and
diffusion in zeolites. Furthermore, competitive adsorption from gaseous mixtures
will be investigated with water vapor as an important variable. The current
gravimetric system is unique in that the system pressure, the sample temperature
and the sample weight change can be monitored simultaneously during the entire
sorption process. This unique feature allows one to examine the temperature
effect on sorption. More important is the fact that this feature makes it
possible to differentiate the thermal effects from other factors by keeping the
temperature rise at a minimum. Also unique to the well-stirred system is the
capability to investigate the displacement phenomena resulting from competitive
adsorption which is important in practical adsorption applications.
