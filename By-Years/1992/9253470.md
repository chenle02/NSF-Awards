BACKYARD SAFARI (Working Title) is an engaging series of 26 half hour programs
designed to introduce topics in Natural Science to children ages four to six.
The series will be shot on-location and hosted by an appealing young women of
color, who will serve as a role model to female and minority children who are
normally disenfranchised from participation in science. A variety of settings
and topics will be used that appeal to all preschoolers -- from urban/inner
cities to surburbia to Appalachia. A special feature of the series will be an
animated gnome - like character called Crinkleroot. Using the rotoscope
technique similar to that in the "Who Framed Roger Rabbit?", Crinklroot will
interact in screen with the host and special, acquired footage. Thus,
Crinkleroot is able to do things the host can't do -- for example, interacting
with time-lapse photography as a flower blooms, or as a spider climbs its web.
Outreach to parents and childcare providers will be an important part of
BACKYARD SAFARI. It is imperative to communicate that all children, regardless
of race, sex, or disability are "science material." Activities will be developed
that engage adults and children in hands-on, physical science activities using
materials commonly found in any home or school.
