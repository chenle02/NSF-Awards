Nowadays, anyone can buy and put together sensors, actuators, and computation
components, but typically only highly trained engineers are able to compose
systems that can autonomously perform complex tasks. This project makes the
design of cyber-physical systems (CPS) accessible to anyone by creating
computational tools that enable people to choose a set of building blocks and
define what a system should do. The tools then automatically create a simple and
easy to understand description of how to assemble the components and provide the
control needed to accomplish the task. If the task cannot be done with a single
system, the tools provide either multiple systems that need to be assembled
and/or explanations as to why the task cannot be done, for example due to
physical constraints. The project includes designing a competition to accelerate
the development of design tools, and mentoring of students from underrepresented
groups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inspired by advances in program synthesis, control
synthesis and modular CPS, this project (i) defines formal specifications and
synthesis processes for CPS whose task requires motion in the physical
environment, and (ii) creates automated design tools that synthesize both the
structure and control of the CPS and that guarantee either full or partial task
satisfaction. The formalisms and tools are based on the Syntax-Guided Synthesis
(SyGuS) paradigm where the design space is reduced by considering additional
structure and leverages computational methods from satisfiability-modulo-
theories (SMT) solvers to program synthesis tools, inverse kinematics solvers,
motion planners and design optimization. The tools are evaluated on two physical
and two simulated platforms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
