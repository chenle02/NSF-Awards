Abstract 9615138 LaBelle The Earth's aurora emits a rich variety of radio waves
over a wide range of frequencies. These wave are a result of the interaction of
the electron beams from the magnetosphere interacting with the ionospheric
plasma. This project operates an array of low, medium and high frequency
(LF/MF/HF) radio receivers in Antarctica to study this radio noise and to use it
to elucidate the physics of the aurora. The receivers are located at South Pole
and in the Automatic Geophysical Observatories (AGOs) operated by the USARP and
BAS (British Antarctic Survey), thus providing coverage at a wide range of
geomagnetic latitudes. ***
