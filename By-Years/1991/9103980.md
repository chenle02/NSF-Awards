Much attention has been given to human activities in tropical regions during
the past half century. Tropical dry forests occupy a roughly equivalent
proportion of the earth's surface as do tropical rain forests, and like the
tropical rain forests, they are decreasing dramatically in area. Shifting
cultivation, the principal subsistence agricultural activity in tropical
forests, has been less well studied in tropical dry forests than it has been in
the tropical rain forests. This doctoral dissertation project will investigate
the shifting cultivation system as it operates in diverse environmental settings
within the tropical dry forests of Guerrero, Mexico. Specific attention will be
given to cultigen diversity, fallow characteristics, environmental impacts, and
the sustainability of the production strategies. Field research will include
observation of cultivation activities and biophysical conditions and processes.
Quantitative assessment of changes in the cultivation system in recent decades
also will be used provide a basis for testing hypotheses about the form, timing,
and location of shifting cultivation. This project will generate valuable
information about tropical dry forest ecosystems that have been affected by the
practice of agriculture. The information will contribute to fundamental
understanding of the relationships between environmental, cultural, and economic
conditions. The project will provide information relevant to addressing some of
the major problems associated with agriculture encountered by developing
countries. It also will provide an excellent opportunity for a promising young
scholar to continue to develop independent research skills.
