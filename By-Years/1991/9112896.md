This project supports the dissertation research of a student of linguistic
anthropology from the University of Texas. THe project studies speech styles in
rural Indian education in highland Bolivia to test the hypothesis that local
Indian school teachers are trained in speech styles radically different from
those of the Indian homes. This creates a communicative barrier between teachers
and students in the elementary classroom, despite the similarity of ethnic
background of teachers and students. Methods include ethnographic observation in
classrooms and homes, and videotaped speech interactions and audio-taped
interviews. Analysis will target participant cultural structures and
interactional rules using an "ethnography of speaking" approach. This research
is important because multicultural education is increasing in many countries as
ethnic consciousness is heightened. Understanding the nature of ethnically-based
linguistic problems between teachers and children will help educational planners
design programs to maximize the potential for success in formal education of
subordinated groups.
