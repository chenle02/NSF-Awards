Schubert Funding for this proposal will provide supplementary funding for an
interdisciplinary Gordon Conference titled "Composition, Structure and Dynamics
of the Earth's Interior" aimed at addressing major unanswered questions about
the composition and structure of the Earth and the dynamics of it's deep
interior. This is the first Gordon Conference on this research topic, and NSF
funding will be used to match funding from the Gordon Research Conferences. The
conference will be held June 30-July 4, 1996 at Plymouth State College in
Plymouth, New Hampshire. Funds will be used to partially support invited
speakers, students, and participants located far from New Hampshire.
