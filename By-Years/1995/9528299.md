STONE, James 95-28299 Dr. Stone will conduct a theoretical study of
magnetohydrodynamic instabilities in accretion disks and the nature of
magnetosphere- disk interactions using 2- and 3-dimensional model codes
developed by Stone and his collaborators. Angular momentum transport and the
evolution of magnetic instabilities in protostars, cataclysmic variable stars
and X-ray sources are the focuses of the numerical models to be produced. ***
