9600133 Brenner In the application of finite element methods to problems in
computational mechanics, difficulties such as the phenomenon of locking, the
incompressibility constraint, cracked domains and higher order equations are
encountered. By combining the techniques of nonconforming elements, macro
elements, singular functions and mixed formulations, robust finite element
methods that employ relatively few numbers of unknowns can be developed to
overcome these difficulties. The investigator develops multigrid and domain
decomposition algorithms for such finite element methods. Multigrid algorithms
compute the solutions of systems of equations at a cost proportional to the
number of unknowns and therefore are the most efficient methods for solving
large systems. Domain decomposition algorithms distribute the computation over
different parts of the physical domain and hence are very suitable for parallel
computers. They are currently two of the major ideas in high performance
computing. The results from this project can lead to fast solvers for problems
in elasticity, plasticity, plates, beams, shells, and fluid mechanics. In
particular, a new multigrid method is developed for the computation of stress
intensity factors, which are important quantities in the study of the
macroscopic phenomena of materials such as fatigues and fractures. These
problems arise in the design of structures such as buildings, bridges, planes,
and ships, and in the analysis of how structures perform. Hence the project
provides tools for solving problems of manufacturing and of monitoring and
renewing civil infrastructure.
