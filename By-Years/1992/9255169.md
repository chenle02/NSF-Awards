The CONAMES Project proposes to design, develop, promote, conduct, and evaluate
a conference for Oklahoma Native American educators and students. The objectives
to this conference will be to prioritized mathematics education issues for
Oklahoma Native American students and their mathematics teachers and to
determine a general plan of action to solve these issues. Further, the CONAMES
Project will write and submit a proposal to NSF for funding titled Oklahoma
Native American Mathematics Educators and Students (ONAMES). The ONAMES Proposal
will propose a project which will put into action the recommendations made by
the CONAMES Conference. The CONAMES Conference will be a conference for Oklahoma
Native American educators and students led and conducted by Native American
educators and students. The ONAMES Project will develop and deliver mathematics
education programming to Oklahoma Native students and their teachers, parents,
counselors, and administrators. The overall goal of the CONAMES and ONAMES
Projects is to help more Oklahoma Native American students (grades 6-12) to
successfully take more mathematics courses and as a result of this, improve the
high school graduation rate of Oklahoma Native American students, in particular,
those sufficiently prepared in mathematics to enter a mathematics-dependent
college plan of study.
