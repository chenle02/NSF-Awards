The project will use NOAA/HRD-derived aircraft data, including dual-Doppler
winds and reflectivity, plus numerous additional sources of data, to evaluate
existing theories of vertical wind shear effects on tropical cyclones. The focus
will be on the "low-level pathway" in which low equivalent potential temperature
air produced by downdrafts into the boundary layer reaches the eyewall and
reduces storm intensity. Case studies will be conducted for varying intensity
changes in the presence of moderate to large vertical wind shear. The goal is to
understand every aspect of the low-level pathway, including the roles of cold
downdrafts, boundary layer recovery, and stratiform and convective
precipitation.

Intellectual Merit: The questions that are addressed here are fundamental to
predicting tropical cyclone intensity change. The understanding of key processes
in tropical cyclone intensity change constitutes a direly needed scientific
endeavor, which would lead to improvement of hurricane forecasting.

Broader Impacts: These include the education of graduate students and the use of
an outstanding database collected by HRD/NOAA. These valuable taxpayer-funded
data have not been fully utilized. The graduate student education includes
guidance with the writing of theses and papers and development of presentation
skills. Additional educational experience for graduate students and postdocs is
produced by co-sponsoring the Northeast Tropical Conference every two years.
Work is disseminated through articles in top professional journals and via
numerous presentations.
