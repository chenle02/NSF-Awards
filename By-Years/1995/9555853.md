PROPOSAL ABSTRACT Proposal Number: 9555853 P.I.: Coppola, Brian P. Institution:
University of Michigan Proposal Title: A Day 2-to-40 Symposium: Instruction in
the Chemical Sciences Abstract: Goals and promised outcomes comprise the usual
"first day lecture" in courses. Promoting behavioral changes in classroom
practices on days 2 through 40 (a semester) to actually meet these goals is more
complex and often unaddressed or ignored. A workshop-symposium is being
organized that encourages the participants to learn how to explicitly articulate
and connect their goals to the subject matter (chemistry) and to classroom
practices. Participation is encouraged from outside traditional chemical
education communities.
