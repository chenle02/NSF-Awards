PI: Burdick, Jason A.&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:
1351472&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due to their complexity and diversity in structure
and function, the development of tissue substitutes for tissue engineering and
regenerative medicine applications is a challenging and highly interdisciplinary
endeavor. Thus, it is important to enhance the interaction of professionals
trained as materials scientists, chemical, mechanical, and electrical engineers,
stem cell and developmental biologists, bioimagers, physicians and surgeons,
immunologists, and biochemists, towards advancing efforts in the field of
regenerative medicine. The proposed Gordon Research Conference (GRC) and
trainee-driven Gordon-Kenan Graduate Research Seminar (GRS) will foster such
interactions and promote a convergence of research in varied disciplines within
the field of regenerative medicine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of
the proposed support lies in recruiting a larger number of graduate students,
post-doctoral researchers and young faculty to attend the conference and to aid
in their career development on this important topic. This GRC will involve the
invitation and attendance of leaders in this field, while trainees and young
faculty will have ample opportunity to interact with these leaders throughout
the conference. Indeed, the GRC is structured to enhance these interactions. The
GRS is designed specifically for graduate students and postdocs to present their
research and interact with each other to better poise them to participate in GRC
activities. Support from NSF will be used to help young investigators attend the
GRS and GRC by covering conference registration for students and trainees for
GRS, and for young faculty that are selected to present their work at the GRC.
