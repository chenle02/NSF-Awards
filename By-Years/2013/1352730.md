This workshop support award is for the bi-annual meeting on complex networks
"Network Frontier Workshop" to be held at Northwestern University, Evanston,
Illinois, December 4-6 2013. The meeting will bring together a diverse group of
experts in complementary areas of network science, dynamical systems, and
complex systems, with substantial emphasis given to topics that cut across
disciplinary boundaries. Participants will include experts both in theory and in
applications as well as students and postdoctoral researchers. They will, in
addition, participate in discussions about future directions that are likely to
lead to transformative research. The program will include tutorials,
presentations by young researchers, and discussions about career opportunities,
in addition to research talks by leading experts in the
field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this workshop, presenters will report recent
results in the area of network science and related applications. Participants
will become aware of the latest results in their respective subfields, and will
also be able to discuss with other experts in an interdisciplinary environment.
This is expected to generate new insights and stimulate new interdisciplinary
collaborations. In addition, the workshop will involve activities jointly
organized with the Northwestern SIAM Student Chapter, which will include
tutorials by experts, presentations by students and postdoctoral researchers,
and discussions about career opportunities. The participation of early-career
researchers will also help promote the transfer of expertise to the next
generation of engineers, physicists, and mathematicians.
