The award provides funds to establish a National Science Foundation "Research
Experiences for Undergraduate" site in southeast Wisconsin. Eight highly
qualified undergraduates will be recruited to conduct research, at the
Biomedical Research Institute laboratories on the campus of the University of
Wisconsin-Parkside in Kenosha. Based upon extensive experiences with
undergraduate research together with active research programs, faculty
representing the focus of Molecular and Regulatory Biology will serve as
potential project supervisors. This program is designed to develop each
participant's intellectual confidence, technical competence and research
independence via 1. Guidance and daily nurturing by active researchers in the
areas of Molecular and Regulatory Biology whose primary emphasis is working with
undergraduates. 2. A program of specific goals for each student's research
progress via a meeting and seminar schedule plus instruction in literature
search and seminar presentation techniques complementary to each project
including faculty-led discussions of relevant, current literature. 3. Leveraging
of the NSF effort through a commitment to support additional students each
summer and/or to carry over meritorious students for a second summer of research
using internal funding. 4. Aggressive regional and in some cases national
recruitment of superior candidates with special efforts to attract
underrepresented groups plus housing arrangements proximate to the UWP
laboratories, and, 5. Immediate and long-term evaluation of the NSF-REU
experience.
