Device motion estimation is a key component of spatially-aware systems such as
mobile robots and virtual or augmented reality displays. Integration of motion
estimates over time, or dead reckoning, is typically used to track the position
and orientation of the device in space between intermittent absolute position
measurements. Vision-based motion estimation is a passive, low-cost approach
that provides high accuracy. This project develops faster methods for vision-
based motion estimation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The motivation for this work is
the basic insight that increasing the speed of motion estimation leads to a
"virtuous cycle" of system improvement: by computing the motion estimate more
quickly, the camera can be operated a higher rate; this in turns leads to less
motion between successive frames, enabling faster computations. The speedups
achieved in the current preliminary work rely on two techniques: approximation
of the motion model; and reduction of fundamental geometric problem to a smaller
form which is quicker to solve. By investigating related problems, the PI seeks
to determine an entire class of visual motion estimation problems which can be
efficiently solved in a similar way.
