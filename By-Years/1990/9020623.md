The research, in the general area of Analytical and Surface Chemistry, focuses
on surface processes that are induced by collisions of gas particles with
surface bound species. The work addresses the important "pressure gap" which
attempts to relate chemistry at ultra-high vacuum and low pressures to real
situations at high pressure. This type of investigation is needed if surface
science studies are to impact many important applications. The current studies
of dissociative chemisorption of adsorbates will be extended to examine
previously undocumented collision induced surface processes. Collision induced
dissociative chemisorption will be developed as a method to probe the reaction
coordinate for thermal dissociation of adsorbates and as a tool to synthesize
novel adsorbates. Mechanisms for these processes will be examined. Molecular
beam techniques will be coupled with high resolution electron energy loss
spectroscopy for these studies, and this spectroscopy will also be developed as
a probe for subsurface and bulk vibrations.
