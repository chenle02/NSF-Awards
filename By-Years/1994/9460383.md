This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project provides a novel
approach for recovery and purification of metabolic products such as antibiotics
from cell culture. It offers the promise of a simpler, more economical recovery
of products and greater productivity through possible multiple reuse of
productive cells. The technology is applicable to microbial cells as well as to
mammalian, plant and insect cells. It is being utilized successfully in the
production of the anti-cancer drug adriamycin (doxiorubicin) by microbial cells
of Streptomyces peucetius.
