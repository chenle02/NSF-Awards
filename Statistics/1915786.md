Bootstrap methods play a central role in statistical methodology, and are among
the most widely used tools for uncertainty quantification. Although bootstrap
methods have an extensive literature, their scope of applicability is far from
being fully understood in modern statistical problems. This is especially the
case when data are described by high-dimensional models with many unknown
parameters, or when then the amount of data exceeds computational constraints.
Motivated by these challenges, the proposed research has two main objectives,
which are to (1) analyze the theoretical validity of bootstrap methods in high-
dimensional models, and (2) develop novel ways of using bootstrap methods to
enhance large-scale computations. The graduate student will focus on the
analysis of bootstrap methods for high-dimensional and large-scale data.

With regard to the first objective, the research will focus on overcoming
certain limitations of the non-parametric bootstrap, particularly in the context
of high-dimensional principal components analysis. This will be pursued through
a generalization of the parametric bootstrap that is tailored to the statistics
of interest. Examples of such statistics include those arising from the
eigenvalues of sample covariance matrices. For the second objective, the
research will explore bootstrap methods as a systematic way to estimate the
errors of randomized algorithms. Given that bootstrap methods have been
historically labeled as computationally intensive, this application is based on
a relatively distinct perspective, since it seeks to use bootstrap methods to
assist computation. In particular, bootstrap methods will be developed to obtain
numerical error estimates that offer a practical alternative to worst-case error
analysis.
