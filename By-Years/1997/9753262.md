This award of the Professional Opportunities for Women in Research and Education
(POWRE) program funded through the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities
(OMA) supports the research and educational activities of Professor Nita A.
Lewis of the University of Miami. The research aims to develop a new and general
class of molecular wires based on a protein backbone. Polypeptides serve as
templates for the self-assembly of metal complexes into a conducting track
covalently bound to the protein. The POWRE award enables the prototyping of
short wires with two and ten metal atoms through exploratory synthesis and
extensive spectroscopic characterization. The opportunity afforded through the
POWRE program will enhance Professor Lewis's research potential and her
educational mentoring of undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral scientists.
The preparation of molecular wires is expected to be of interest not only to the
electronics industry, but also to researchers interested in constructing tiny
implantable bio-devices requiring the production of small electrical currents.
