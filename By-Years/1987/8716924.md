This project seeks to gain an understanding of the kinematic and dynamic
properties of meanders in the Gulf Stream by means of two detailed
investigations using CTD, velocity and transport measurements, and RAFOS
lagrangian floats. The cruises would address the evolution of a ridge and a
trough in the region of large amplitude meandering. During the cruise, a real-
time model will be operated to guide the sampling efficacy. Tasks include the
preparation and conduct of the cruises, analysis of data, and the interpretation
of the results in terms of the dynamics governing the Gulf Stream system. The
experiment will be done in conjunction with a major experiment, SYNOP, which
addresses the real-time modeling of the system.
