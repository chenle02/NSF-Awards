The University of Kentucky continues a Research Experience for Undergraduates
(REU) Site. The REU Site has been in operation since 1994. The theme of the REU
Site is Functional Materials. Ten undergraduate students are recruited
nationwide every year for a two-month summer research experience, with
recruiting emphasis on students from the Appalachian region of Kentucky and
members of underrepresented groups in science and engineering. In addition to
participating in individual research projects, REU students attend weekly
seminars on current major research topics, career opportunities, professional
ethics, and effective communication skills. Students present the results of
their research in in-house mini-conferences, and have the opportunity to attend
the annual Regional Undergraduate Chemistry Research Poster Competition as well
as a professional conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
