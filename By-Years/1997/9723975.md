Many endocrine glands and neurons release complex compounds that contain a
"main" secretion, and co-secretions whose roles are poorly understood. The
identification of these co-secretions and their functions is of great urgency:
(1) malfunctions of neurons and endocrine glands due to co-secretions could be
involved in so far unexplained pathologies; (2) an understanding of the co-
secretions may pave the way the new treatments of neural and endocrine diseases.
The goal of the present investigation is to clarify the roles of co-secretions
in the release of the stress hormones adrenaline and noradrenaline, and of their
suspected antagonist dopamine. Plasma adrenaline and noradrenaline derive from
chromaffin cells. It appears that their release is controlled (a) by a cocktail
of co-secretions released by the chromaffin cells themselves, and (b) by a
cocktail released by the fibers that innervate the chromaffin cells. Plasma
dopamine derives from the wall of large blood vessels, and its release is
affected by adrenaline, noradrenaline and opioid substances. Using economic and
highly efficient model systems, the chromaffin cells and blood vessels of the
eel, the studies will focus on co-secretions such as messenger peptides, amines
and endogenous codeine and morphine.
