Biological Sciences (61) This project is adapting technology for producing
three-dimensional physical models, developed at the Milwaukee School of
Engineering, to the teaching of macromolecular structure and function to
undergraduates and graduate students in biology, biochemistry, and chemistry at
the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The PI team is creating a new honors course
in which undergraduates work with researcher-mentors to produce both a physical
model and a computer-based tutorial that illustrate some aspect of the function
of a macromolecule of interest. The models and tutorials created by these
mentor-student teams are then introduced into the classroom in five
undergraduate and three graduate courses that cover macromolecular structure and
function at several levels. The efficacy of the model-tutorial combination in
teaching structure and function of macromolecules to different student audiences
with different levels of chemical sophistication is being evaluated.
