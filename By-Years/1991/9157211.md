The objective of this research effort is to investigate the integrated design
of electromechanical systems with specific consideration of preventive
maintenance, automated failure diagnosis, fault tolerant operation and improved
serviceability. The approach consists of exploiting the analytical redundancy
present in models of the plant over more costly hardware redundancy solutions.
Potential areas of application for such a design methodology which emphasizes
the integration of system modelling, failure mode and effects analysis, control
system design, and diagnostics are many, ranging from heavy industrial machinery
to precision electromechanical motion control devices. A specific application of
the design methodology to an electromechanical system, with its hardware
realization in integrated circuit form, will be considered. Industrial
collaboration will provide both the testbed for the prototype development
segment of this research effort.
