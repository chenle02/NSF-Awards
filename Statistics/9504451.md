Radial basis function neural networks provide an attractive model for high
dimensional nonparametric estimation, particularly for model-based process
control. They are faster to train than conventional feedforward networks with
sigmoidal activation functions , and provide a model structure better suited for
adaptive control. Radial basis function neural networks can be viewed as a
mixture model where the number of components is chosen adaptively. This view
allows for statistical analysis and the extension of current radial basis
function networks. In particular, this research will develop models using
combinations of local linear models, invert the models for calibration, estimate
the local prediction errors, identify outliers or novel data points, adaptively
choose the number of basis functions and derive algorithms that learn
incrementally. The research extends and improves a certain class of artificial
neural networks, the radial basis function networks, for applications to
(chemical) process control. Algorithms developed will be written so they can be
efficiently updated for use in on-line process control applications. This is a
coordinated project between two investigators, a statistician and a chemical
engineer. A major chemical company, DuPont, has expressed strong interest in
using these methods and they have supplied data to test the methodology of this
research .
