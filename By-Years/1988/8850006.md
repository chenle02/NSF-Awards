A eight week field-oriented geology course will be implemented for 16 high
school students, based at Colorado College in Colorado Springs. The course will
teach students to apply scientific principles to actual geological problems in a
stimulating outdoor environment, emphasizing the approach and methods a
professional geologist would use. Hands-on experiential learning in classical
geological areas of the west replace classroom lectures and labs. More than 80%
of class time will be spent in the field. Cognate sciences will be employed to
demonstrate the interdisciplinary nature of geology and promote further interest
in their pursuit. Students will learn to make informed, reasoned, ethical
judgement about environmental and resource issues. Tours of government and
industry facilities will expose students to career choices and employment
opportunities in the sciences. The intensive, yet informal nature of the course
fosters professional interchange of ideas, which will be presented orally and in
written reports. The staff are all experienced filed geologists with backgrounds
in the liberal arts approach to learning. Outstanding women and minority
paraprofessionals have been chosen to encourage mentoring with leaders
underrepresented in the field.
