This award is made in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Program in
support of the research of Dr. Roger Willett. The research will address the
structural, electronic spectroscopic, magnetochemical and EPR properties of
monomeric, dimeric and higher-order Cu(II), Mn(II) and Ni(II)-halide complexes.
An emphasis will be a study of the variation of the geometric and electronic
structure of the complexes with temperature, either by phase transitions or by
dynamic Jahn-Teller interactions. The principle experimental techniques utilized
will be X-ray diffraction methods, EPR and NMR. %%% This research involves the
study of certain fundamental properties and processes in mixed organic/inorganic
crystalline materials. Studies will focus on the changes that occur in these
systems as the temperature is varied. Included are materials that exhibit
continuum properties in the crystalline phase and that mimic the physical
properties of lipids and other phenomena.
