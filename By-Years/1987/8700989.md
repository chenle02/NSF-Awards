Dayton and Tegner are leaders in the study of kelp system ecology; Dayton is
likewise recognized for substantial contributions to ecological theory on the
development and organization of natural communities. These investigators have
been studying the dynamics of kelp populations in the extensive Pt. Loma kelp
beds for a decade and a half. The last award and their long-term monitoring
allowed some very interesting observations on the effect of El Nino - Southern
Oscillation anomalies on the kelp forest dynamics. Second order effects, after
the return to "normal" oceanographic/atmospheric conditions, have caused
dramatic perturbation of the Pt. Loma beds. Ecological succession within the
kelp community has proceeded in ways that were not predictable, a priori, from
our earlier understanding of kelp systems. Dayton and Tegner feel that our
predictive capabilities are now hampered by our lack of understanding of how
physical disturbances and physiological conditions of kelps (as affected by
environmental stresses and variation) influence reproductive condition, capacity
and the recrutiment of new individuals. This work will examine inter- and intra-
specific competition, and nutrient availability effects on reproduction and
succession within kelp forests.
