This project will examine the impact of two interactive information processing
tools on science teaching and learning at lower undergraduate and upper high
school levels. These tools, which have emerged from our prior research on
technical and academic learning strategies are: Concept Mapping, a method of
converting information to two-dimensional node-link displays, and Scripted
Cooperation, an approach to orchestrating the joint processing of information by
peer dyads. These tools will be used independently and interactively to enhance
the extraction of scientific knowledge from experts, the presentation of this
knowledge to students, and the subsequent processing of the communicated
information. Expert maps of biological and statistical concepts will be
developed and used in a series of six experiments designed to assess the impact
of the information processing tools on a variety of science education outcomes.
These experiments, which will involve approximately 660 college freshmen and
high school seniors, will also examine Aptitude X Treatment interactions and
transfer to other learning situations. The results of this experimentation will
be used to further develop a model of science education and will be used as a
basis for developing implementation materials for practitioners.
