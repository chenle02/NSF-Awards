be, for PICES: planning and organization of a PICES scientific workshop
tentatively planned for late 1991 and funding for participation of U.S.
scientists in this workshop; participation of U.S. scientists in PICES Governing
Council meetings and related activities; and communications, secretarial
assistance, travel, and documentation costs for the Chairman pro tem of PICES;
and, for WESTPAC, planning of the Second WESTPAC Symposium in December 1991 and
funding of participation of U.S. scientists in the Symposium; and participation
of U.S. scientists in WESTPAC working groups and task teams.
