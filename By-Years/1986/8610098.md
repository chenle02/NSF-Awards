The proposed research will endeavor to understand 2D transport phenomena in
surface inversion and accumulation layers on InP and InGaAs. The present lack of
understanding is caused both by the structural/chemical complexity of the
surface region and insufficient experimental data and transport modeling of
InP/InGaAs devices. The research proposed here will provide detailed transport
measurements and interfacial analysis upon which realistic transport models can
be founded. This will provide an increased understanding 2D transport at
insulator-semiconductor interfaces and advance the development of the MOS
devices on InP and InGaAs.
