Funds are provided for a magnetic paleointensity study of sediments from one ODP
site in the Atlantic Ocean (and compared to a second site for which a detailed
oxygen isotope stratigraphy has been established). For the off Bermuda core this
oxygen isotope stratigraphy is mainly be based on benthic foraminifera, whereas
for the site from the northern most North Atlantic (to be studied in detail
here) stratigraphy will come from planktonic foraminiferal oxygen-isotope data.
Within the framework of these stratigraphies the PI will carry out a high-
resolution study to identify geomagnetic excursions and paleointensity patterns.
The study could advance this magnetic paleointensity technique substantially,
and could add a new tool to the tool-kit for high resolution stratigraphy.
