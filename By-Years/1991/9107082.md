The funds sought in this proposal are for the acquisition of a modified one-
dimensional consolidometer which has the capability of freezing and thawing the
soil sample, and using an automatic loading and data acquisition system, make
measurements of the hydraulic conductivity by direct and indirect means. The
ultimate aim of the research is to seek methodology for minimizing changes in
the hydraulic conductivity of soils when subjected to variations in
environmental conditions.
