This project will focus on obtaining constraints on deviatoric stresses and
thermal parameters associated with extension, normal faulting, and magma
intrusion at MORs. This will be done by calibrating microstructures as a
function of stress and then applying this information to Layer 3 gabbros. They
will take a multiprong approach that ranges from TEM study of the
microstructures, thermometry of two pyroxenes, to high-T deformation experiments
on cpx and plagioclase.
