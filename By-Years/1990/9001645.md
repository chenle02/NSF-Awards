Theoretical and numerical studies will be initiated for an array of problems in
gravitational physics and relativistic astrophysics. Topics of interest include
(1) development of techniques in numerical relativity and their application in
modeling sources of gravitational radiation and in exploring nonlinear,
dynamical spacetimes; (2) numerical modeling of the tidal disruption of stars
during close encounters with massive black holes and the possible relevance of
disruption for feeding active galactic nuclei; (3) the calculation of
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) winds from accretion disks and stars and the
development of a general relativistic MHD numerical scheme; and (4) a study of
the recently discovered eclipsing millisecond pulsar 1957+20. The goal of this
work is to acquire a deeper understanding of self-gravitating and dynamical
systems and of high energy (relativistic) phenomena. Many of these physical
studies rely upon the use of large-scale numerical modeling techniques.
Accordingly, useful byproducts of such studies are almost invariably new and
refined numerical algorithms. The project relating to the eclipsing pulsar
1957+20 is of a more phenomenological nature and relies upon the close interplay
between theoretical calculation and observational evidence.
