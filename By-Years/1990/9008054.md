Microwave polarimetric radars (polarimeters) are just now showing great promise
as scientific instruments that are capable of remotely sensing natural surface
and volume targets. The advantages of polarimetry should extend to higher
frequencies as millimeter wave device technology advances. In particular,
millimeter wave polarimeters will be useful in sensing the fine millimeter-sized
features of water, ice, and foliated and unfoliated terrain surfaces. They will
also be used to conduct scientific studies of natural volume targets such as
rain, snow and cloud cells. The University of Massachusetts has developed 95 and
225 GHz polarimeters, which it hopes to use in cooperative research projects
with other universities and government agencies. This Engineering Research
Equipment Grant provides funds to reconfigure the 95 GHz polarimeter so that it
can accurately measure the scattering behavior of natural surfaces and
atmospheric volume targets. New antennas, an antenna positioning system, and
equipment needed to develop an appropriate data acquisition system are provided,
which will be used in a variety of field measurement programs.
