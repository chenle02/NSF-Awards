The objectives of this project are (1) to carry out research on iterative
algorithms for solving large sparse systems of linear algebraic equations with
emphasis on systems arising from problems involving partial differential
equations and on the use of parallel computers, (2) to develop research-oriented
prototype software based on the algorithms, and (3) to test the algorithms and
software on a range of problems. Among the algorithms to be considered are
parallel alternating-type methods, periodically generated iterative methods,
rational iterative methods, and iterative methods for solving large sparse
nonsymmetric linear systems.
