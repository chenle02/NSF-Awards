This project is to conduct several laboratory experiments of long nonlinear
internal waves in laterally inhomogeneous environments. Long internal waves are
ubiquitous features on continental shelves. Field studies indicate that wave
instabilities may cause significant vertical mixing. The proposed research is
designed to examine several processes which can lead to wave instability and
breaking and thus promote mixing. The first experiment will investigate the
shoaling of an internal solitary wave in a two- layer system. The second
considers the interaction of a internal solitary wave with a horizontally
varying density field. The third experiment extends the work on shoaling to
include a continuously rather than uniform lower layer. All three situations are
geophysically relevant. The objective is an improved understanding of the
processes leading to instability and dissipation of long internal waves, and how
these waves may help maintain or enhance mixing on continental shelves.
