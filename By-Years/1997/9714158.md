Abstract Wang/ATM-9714158 This grant provides support for research being pursued
by two Ph.D. students on the microphysical processes of ice particles in cirrus
clouds. The funding is for a period of one year, which should allow the students
to complete their degree programs. The research should lead to better
understanding of the sensitivity of microphysical processes to variations in the
atmospheric conditions (for example, temperature and humidity) in the cloud
environment. wangabs.doc
