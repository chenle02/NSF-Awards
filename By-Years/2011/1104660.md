Modern fabrication techniques have paved the way for many recent breakthroughs
in electrically controlled semiconductor nanostructures with length scales on
the order of tens of nanometers. Quantum dot devices containing one or several
electrons have even been employed as quantum bits. Although these devices are
highly adaptable, only a small number of quantum properties have been exploited
to date as the basis for a quantum computer. However, the number of potential
quantum variables grows quickly with the number of electrons. The aim of this
project is to theoretically explore new multi-electron quantum dot
configurations that may be particularly well suited for quantum computing.
Experimental designs will be considered that contain multiple electrons per
quantum dot, or multiple coupled dots. The goal is to identify quantum bits with
desirable properties, in terms of control, speed or versatility. The operation
of the new quantum bits will be characterized, and their interactions with the
environment will be assessed, in order to optimize quantum operations. The
identification of new high performance quantum bits will provide a blueprint for
near-term experimental explorations, and for long-term, large-scale
implementations.

The broader impacts will involve both researchers and members of the local
community. The researchers will benefit from collaborations between scientists
with different types of expertise. Graduate students will obtain a valuable
range of interdisciplinary training and exposure to cutting edge research in a
variety of fields. They will also obtain valuable experience presenting and
explaining their research to coworkers with varying backgrounds. The broader
impacts will be further enhanced by specific outreach activities in local
schools and other venues.
