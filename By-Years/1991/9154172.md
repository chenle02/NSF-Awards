Most of classical applied mathematics, and essentially all of undergraduate
training in applied mathematics, is dominated by direct problems in which given
causes evolve continuously into effects which are to be determined. In recent
years there has been a great deal of research activity in inverse problems, that
is, problems of determining a cause of a given effect or a law of evolution
given a cause and effect. A three day regional workshop is offered to acquaint
undergraduate faculty with some of the peculiar mathematical and computational
difficulties associated with inverse problems and to assist them in developing
curricular materials on aspects of inverse problems. Follow up activities will
include a special session at a regional Mathematical Association of America
meeting. The majority of the support for this workshop is being provided by the
Division of Mathematical Sciences.
