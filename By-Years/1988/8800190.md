Adult suspension feeding fishes (e.g., anchovies and mackerels) capture
multiple prey by swimming with mouths held open. Despite the economic and
ecological importance of these fishes, few studies have tested hypotheses
concerning the functional morphology, energetics, and hydrodynamics of
suspension feeding. As juveniles, these species are particulate feeders that
capture individual prey using suction. The profound shift from particulate
feeding to suspension feeding offers an ideal opportunity to investigate
suspension feeding from a mechanistic perspective. The techniques of respiratory
physiology and biomechanics will be applied to test two main hypotheses:
first,that the hydraulic resistance of the water path through the oral and
opercular cavities, as well as the hydrodynamic drag of the entire body during
swimming with the mouth held open, is significantly higher in juvenile blackfish
than in adults; and secondly, that the energetic cost of feeding decreases
abruptly over the transition between feeding modes. Although the energetic cost
of suspension feeding may be low after the transition, physical constraints may
prevent juveniles from suspension feeding. Information on the factors involved
in the switch between feeding modes will have implications for plankton
population dynamics, resource partitioning between juvenile and adult fishes,
and the evolution of suspension feeding in fishes. The University of California
at Davis will serve as the host institution for this postdoctoral research
fellowship project. The duration of this award is two years.
