This is an individual award for the Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Plant
Biology. The applicant received his Ph.D. from Stanford University. His Ph.D.
research was in the area of plant genetics, with emphasis on genome evolution.
He plans to carry out his postdoctoral fellowship research in the laboratory of
Dr. Axel Brennicke at Institute fur Genbiologische Forschung Berlin GmbH, in
Berlin, Germany. The proposed research entitled "Biochemistry of replication in
mitochondria of Arabidopsis thaliana" will broaden the training of the Fellow
into nucleic acid biochemistry and will introduce him to a new model plant
system.
