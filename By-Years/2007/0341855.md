The SARS virus, SCoV, is a newly emerged, highly virulent member of the
coronavirus family of positive-strand RNA viruses. While coronaviruses have
unique aspects of RNA replication and transcription, little biochemical and
structural information exists for the key enzyme of these processes, the RNA-
dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). This SGER project will combine the biochemical
and structural biology expertise of the two principal investigators to: 1) use
oligonucletoides to construct a cDNA to express the RdRp of the Toronto isolate
of the SCoV, purify the protein using conventional and affinity chromatography,
establish a polymerase assay, identify the catalytic residues, and map the
minimal region required for RNA synthesis in vitro; 2) characterize the
initiation of RNA synthesis by the SCoV RdRp; and 3) grow high-resolution
crystals of the SCoV RdRp and use X-ray crystallography to elucidate the
structure of the protein alone and bound to substrate mimics. Results from these
studies will establish biochemical assays and solve the structure for the SCoV
polymerase. The results will be highly relevant to the mechanism of viral RNA
replication and will allow the design of more effective antivirals against a
significant class of human and animal pathogens.
