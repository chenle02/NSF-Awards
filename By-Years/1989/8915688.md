The Anamixidae are a unique group of amphipod crustaceans that undergo a
striking developmental transformation during metamorphosis. Owing to this marked
shift in the male's morphology, different developmental stages have been treated
as separate taxonomic entities, leading to a confused array of names. James
Thomas proposes continued taxonomic study of the representatives of the family
that occupy tropical reefs. He has accumulated new collections and borrowed
existing museum holdings in preparation for a definitive systematic revision of
the group. Descriptive treatment of this group will document a fascinating
component of one of the world's most diverse habitats -- tropical reefs. The
resulting monograph will help marine ecologists and behavioral biologists in
their efforts, and will provide a foundation for evolutionary and biogeographic
analyses. Studies such as these open new research avenues toward a better
understanding of biodiversity.
