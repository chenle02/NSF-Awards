This EAGER project proposes an initiative to review existing methods and to
create a design framework for the development of new and innovative approaches
for evaluation of teacher education programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The George
Washington University School of Education and Human Development and the National
Academy of Education will lead the effort and the project will result in the
following products: (1) a synthesis of existing research and experiential
approaches in evaluating teacher education program quality and effectiveness;
(2) an exploration of new and innovative approaches to evaluation in teacher
education; and (3) a roadmap of issues and recommendations for new approaches.
Issues in teacher education are politically at the forefront of the education
policy agenda at the present time and an EAGER is an appropriate vehicle for
exploring alternatives to current evaluation practices. Specific products will
include commissioned papers, a synthesis report, policy briefs and other
materials for dissemination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Teacher education is at a
crossroads with calls for increasing accountability and efforts to guage
teachers' performance to student outcomes and to the institutions/programs where
they were prepared. The synthesis and roadmap provided by this project will link
traditional preparation programs with alternatives of various kinds and shed
light on new ways to evaluate all different kinds of programs.
