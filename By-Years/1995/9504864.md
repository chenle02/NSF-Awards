The proposal calls for experimental studies of electronic Polarization dynamics
in atoms and in atomic collisions. The basic approach is non-resonant, two-
photon, two-color polarization spectroscopy, which is uniquely sensitive to
dynamics on a 10fs time scale. Two polarized photons are absorbed during the
course of a collision, thus providing a direct probe of the collisional
polarization dynamics.
