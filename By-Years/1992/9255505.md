Computer algebra software represents a mature, interactive technology that is
only just beginning to reach the physics classroom. Its successful integration
into the curriculum depends on the careful attention to the capabilities and
limits of this software. Such attention can only come from a thorough mastery of
the programs. This workshop provides the participants an opportunity to master a
computer algebra program and develop strategies for its use in broadening the
range of physics topics available in the physics classroom. Workshop
participants are then able to lead workshops of their own in local and regional
settings.
