This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to develop
activated carbon nano-fiber based ultra-capacitor with ability to store large
energy and power density. Super-capacitors are increasingly becoming attractive
because of their potential to provide highly reliable peak power but are not
notable for energy storage. Achieving this step improvement in energy storage
may be judged by a maturing advancement but if successful it would have a major
impact on many more business sectors. Under this proposed study, polymer
precursor nano-fibers will be produced using an electro-spinning process from
polyacrylonitrile (PAN) polymer. PAN nanofibers will be converted to activated
carbon nano-fiber with surface area in excess of 3 to 5 times more than the
conventional electrode material used in super-capacitors. The nanofiber
architecture will be tailored to achieve the desired power and energy
performance by varying various process and product properties. This material
will be used to build single cell electrode based super-capacitor. Capacitor's
capacitance (i.e., energy) is a direct function of available surface area.
Carbon nano-fibrous membranes are expected to produce a thin, low-density
electrode having low resistivity combined with high surface offering a unique
electrode material and super-capacitor. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of
high power ultra-capacitors has been an important change in the electronics
component world. This technology gives equipment designers new capability to
manage and more effectively use energy in their products. Any improvement in
double-layer capacitor performance will bring more attention to the industry's
ultra-capcitor potential. Super-capacitors are candidates for many applications
including electric vehicles, consumer and industrial electronics and power
tools, power management, etc. &lt;br/&gt;
