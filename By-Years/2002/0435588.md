The fifth DLESE annual meeting will focus on DLESE as a teaching and learning
resource. Activities will be organized to engage participants at three levels:
1) all participants as the teaching and learning society, 2) 3-person teaching
and learning teams where mentoring and networking can effectively occur and 3)
as individuals shaped by their own interests. This structure will provide a
unique opportunity for participants to help shape DLESE into a premier Earth
System educational tool for the 21st century. The four main goals of the meeting
are 1) defining and developing a quality and comprehensive collection, 2)
reaching new users, 3) making effective use of library resources, and 4)
enhancing the diversity of DLESE.
