9553877 Thier THis is a four year grant to the Science Education for Public
Understanding Program (SEPUP) to develop, field test, and publish a life science
curriculum for middle school science. The SEPUP design is an issue-oriented
activity-based curriculum that is developed by science educators and scientists
with continuous input from classroom teachers and their students. The curriculum
is based on major life science concepts as they apply to real-life decision
making by the individuals and along with the SEPUP physical science curriculum,
Issues Evidence and You, forms two years of middle school integrated science.
The proposed curriculum has three major content areas, My Body and Me-including
reproduction and development and maintenance of the human body; Living
Partnerships-including evolution and ecosystems; and Using Tools and Ideas - the
ways which humans use tools and ideas to adapt the external environment. Four
process-oriented components, Scientific thinking, Personal and Societal Decision
Making, Science and Technology as Professions, and Futures Study, is integrated
throughout the curriculum. The curriculum includes embedded assessment that
allows teachers to measure the growth and development of students.
