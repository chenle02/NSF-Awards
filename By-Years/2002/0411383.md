Morris College will implement comprehensive approaches to strengthen the
institution's undergraduate science, technology, engineering and mathematics
(STEM) education and research infrastructure. The College will use NSF support
to: (1) revise and enhance STEM gate-keeper courses by infusing research and
technology into the curricula; (2) enhance student preparation and success by
providing on- and off-campus research opportunities, stipends and scholarships,
tutorials, and graduate school preparation; (3) enhance faculty development by
engaging faculty in on- and off-campus research activities and by attending
seminars, workshops and professional conferences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
intellectual merit of this project lies in its use of research, technology and
student support activities to enhance student performance in STEM to the level
where they become competitive scholars and researchers prepared for graduate
school enrollment and success and research careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
impact of this collection of strategies is to increase the representation of
under-represented minorities in STEM disciplines and the national STEM
workforce. &lt;br/&gt;
