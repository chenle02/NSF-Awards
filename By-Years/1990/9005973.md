In this project supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic
Chemistry Program, Joseph M. O'Connor of the University of California, San Diego
will continue studies in the area of organometallic research at the interface of
metallacycle and carbene chemistry. This research directly impinges on the role
of metal carbenes in alkene metathesis, alkene and alkyne polymerization,
cyclopropanation chemistry and an impressive array of synthetic organic
methodology. The proposed research has its focus on iridium, rhodium and cobalt
compounds and the development of new carbene coupling reactions wherein ring-
expanded metallacycles of the above metals and ultimately four- and five-
membered carbocycles would be accessible. In addition to the synthetic studies,
structural and mechanistic studies will also be carried out.
