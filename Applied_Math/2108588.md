Peridynamic theory is an emerging modeling tool used in engineering applications
to analyze material discontinuities including dynamic fracture, spontaneous
crack formation, and fragmentation. Despite a growing body of experimental
evidence in favor of peridynamic modeling, there remain several mathematical and
computational challenges that may hinder its potential widespread use in
applications. On the computational side, standard numerical methods can be
prohibitively expensive due to the need to handle longer range interactions,
while on the theoretical side, progress is needed in understanding the sources
and evolution of discontinuities and in identifying the local limiting behavior
and the connection to nonlinear elastodynamics. Furthermore, while for practical
engineering usage, precise application of boundary conditions is essential,
nonlocal boundary conditions are still poorly understood. This project addresses
these challenges by developing new mathematical and computational strategies
which advance peridynamic modeling and increase its appeal for engineering
applications. The project provides training opportunities in applied and
computational mathematics for undergraduate and graduate students. This project
introduces a unified and systematic approach based on Fourier spectral analysis
for studying linear and nonlinear peridynamic models and their applications. The
approach is built on a foundation of analytical and computational methods for
linear peridynamics, which are then lifted to nonlinear peridynamics. The
investigators will study the Fourier multipliers of peridynamic operators and
develop efficient algorithms to compute them. This Fourier multipliers analysis
will be used to develop regularity results, spectral solvers in periodic setups,
and a Fourier Continuation method for boundary value conditions. The spectral
methods introduced are efficient and well-suited to study peridynamics as they
decouple the nonlocality parameter and the grid size, in contrast to finite
difference or finite element methods in which the nonlocality scales with grid
size. From the applications point of view, the Fourier analysis approach will be
utilized in the context of peridynamics to study nonlocal boundary conditions,
to investigate the sources and evolution of discontinuities, and to better
understand the connection between nonlocal equations and their local classical
counterparts.
