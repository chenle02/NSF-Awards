9523469 Rebbi As HPCC technologies, especially parallel computing and high
performance networking, become available to much wider segments of the community
through the emergence of the NII, there is an increased need for people who
understand this technology and are capable of applying it in all sectors of
education's, research and business. It is more important than ever to find
effective means to link efforts on a national scale to regional and local
efforts in order to expand access to and involvement in HPCC for broad sectors
of society. The MARINER (Metacenter-Affiliated Resource In the New England
Region) project by Boston University will serve as a focal point for HPCC/NII
related activities in the New England area. It will act as a catalyst for wide
diffusion of technologies and as a channel to the Metacenter. Mariner will draw
on the University's advanced computing and communications facilities and build
on its experience in computer science, computational science scaleable parallel
computing and wide area networking to provide education and tra ining to a wide
audience and reach out to institutions within the area that have hitherto not
been part of the HPCC/NII community. Key elements of MARINER are: training,
education and research programming, outreach programs and activities, and access
to facilities at boston University.
