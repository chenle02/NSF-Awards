Mobile browsers are beginning to serve as critical enablers of modern computing.
With a combination of rich features that rival their desktop counterparts and
strong security mechanisms such as TLS/SSL, these mobile browsers are becoming
the basis of many other mobile apps. Unfortunately, the security guarantees
provided by mobile browsers and the risks associated with today?s mobile web
have not been evaluated in great detail. This project investigates the security
of mobile browsers, the applications that build on them through APIs such as
WebViews and the mobile specific websites they access. This research differs
significantly from prior work; whereas previous research has focused largely on
stand-alone, third-party applications, our work focuses on mobile browsers and
the increasing number of applications using them as their basis for delivering
content. Moreover, our work measures the extent to which the mobile web itself
is vulnerable. The combination of these efforts aims to create the first
longitudinal and principled study of the mobile web ecosystem.
