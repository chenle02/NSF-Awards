The University of Southern Mississippi and Jackson State University will each
host a four-week summer workshop for twenty cross-over and certified physics
teachers. These workshops will be repeated for a total of three years with
participants being selected from school districts in Mississippi and neighboring
states. Workshops participants will construct high-quality experimental
apparatus from kits of easily obtained materials so that each participant can
deliver a series of model experiments to their high schools. Included will be a
wooden force table having a computer-generated paper degree circle with fishing
rod eye tips for pulleys, a unique kinetics car which leaves a timed pen trace
as it moves along a paper track, an optical bench which utilizes magnetically
mounted components, and an Ohm's law apparatus which uses an inexpensive AC
power adaptor as its power supply. A cross-over teacher will work with a
certified physics teacher to design experiments around the constructed
apparatus. Experimental activities for each apparatus will be written up by one
member of the team, and the other member, in the role of a high school student,
will perform the experiment. Each team will then present their results for
critique and improvement to the group. The final experiments will only be
defined after all teams have contributed their recommendations and improvement.
This process will generate over twenty-five tested and proven experiments which
emphasize the guided discovery approach. In this manner, cross-over teachers
will be trained in physics concepts by building, doing and sharing. At the same
time an attractive vehicle will be provided for high schools to improve the
quality of their physics laboratories. School districts will participate by
supporting peer-led workshops, by designating educational supervisors and
physics resource persons, by representative attendance at academic year workshop
conferences, and by committing to help construct and perform experiments
developed by the workshop. Cost sharing equals 20% of the NSF award.
