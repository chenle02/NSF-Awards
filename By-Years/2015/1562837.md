Non-volatile memory (NVM) is a transformative technology that is dramatically
changing how data storage systems of the&lt;br/&gt;future are built. This
technology allows an unprecedented combination of performance and persistence
into a single&lt;br/&gt;device. This project will develop a suite of storage
caching techniques for this transformative technology along
four&lt;br/&gt;complementary dimensions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first two
usage dimensions address the selective use of NVM as host-side read caches for
persistently stored data&lt;br/&gt;as well as using their persistence properties
explicitly by developing fault-tolerant write caching solutions.
The&lt;br/&gt;latter two develop advanced techniques for delivering storage
quality of service (QoS) using NVM caches and building
caching&lt;br/&gt;algorithms that are aware of data reduction techniques, such
as deduplication and compression, for the NVM layer. Together, these
contributions have the potential to transform enterprise data center storage
stacks by readily adopting the best properties of current and future NVM
technology. The expected performance benefits apply to a broad spectrum of
computer systems and applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Educational activities
will include the involvement of undergraduate students and incorporation of the
project's research findings into coursework. Planned outreach activities will
focus on recruitment of under-represented students from minority groups in
computer science for participation in the project. Transition of the new
technologies to practice through open source distribution of the Linux operating
system and KVM hypervisor code implementing the innovations are successful
expectations.
