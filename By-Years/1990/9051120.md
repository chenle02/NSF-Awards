Understanding lighting and electrical power distribution is critical in today's
high-tech, energy conscious, building environment. The wide spread dependance on
electronic media has emphasized the need for quality, well designed lighting to
increase visibility and productivity, as well as reliable electrical power
distribution and communication systems. The Lighting and Electrical Systems
Classroom and Laboratory will enhance the education of 500 students over the
next five years in the areas of lighting and electrical systems for buildings.
With the numerous lighting systems, lighting controls data acquisition and
computing equipment of the facility. Students will be able to see lighting
fundamental applied in state-of-the-art lighting systems. Students will be able
to evaluate visually and with actual measurements and mathematical models of
lighting. To enhance the student's understanding of building electrical
distribution, the present project includes actual components of electrical
distribution equipment, connected and installed identically to an actual
application but not energized. The electrical and lighting manufacturing
industry is providing strong support for the project. They have provided letters
of intent to donate almost $37,000 worth of lighting and electrical distribution
equipment.
