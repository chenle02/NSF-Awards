The NSF workshop on National Networks of Research Institutes (NNRI) is a two-day
workshop designed to bring together diverse individuals from academia, industry,
philanthropy, government, and non-profit organizations to collectively define a
distinctive and compelling vision and explore implementation considerations for
a new type of research institutes. These institutes will engage in (1)
fundamental research in critical areas of science and engineering and (2) the
translation of this research, with an integrated team of partners, from
industry, philanthropy, government, and non-profit organizations, to solve
challenges of national importance.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Participants in the
workshop will work jointly to develop a comprehensive vision and to outline the
distinctive and critical characteristics for a new Institute model and NNRI in
the context of NSFâ€™s mission with special focus on two key goals: (i)
strengthening US leadership in critical areas through use-inspired fundamental
research; and (ii) fostering the economic and societal impact of federally-
funded R&amp;D. With use- inspired fundamental research as the major driver, the
workshop will explore innovations in systems, structures, and processes that can
deeply interconnect academic, venture capital, technology sectors, small-medium-
large industry, and regional, state and federal government agencies. Such
innovations are expected to accelerate translation of fundamental advances in
critical areas into services, processes, and products that can help achieve
national goals related to economic competitiveness, domestic manufacturing,
national security, shared prosperity, energy and the environment, health,
education and workforce development, and transportation. The organizing
committee will provide to the NSF, a final workshop report that outlines a list
of findings and recommendations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
