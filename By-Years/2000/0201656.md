Dr. Conselice is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral
Fellowship to carry out a program of research, education, and public outreach at
the California Institute of Technology. He will study the problem of how
galaxies form and evolve by making observations of merging galaxies and
comparing the observations to models that trace the evolution of galaxies by
both mergers and initial collapse. Dr. Conselice has developed a novel method to
quantify the merger status of individual galaxies by measuring their asymmetry.
He will use this method, as well as others, to distinguish between galaxies that
were formed by the merging of smaller galaxies, and those that were formed by
rapid collapse. Dr. Conselice will also supervise undergraduates in research,
teach undergraduate seminars, and write essays on astronomy for the general
public. ***
