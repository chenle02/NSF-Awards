This program provides scholarships to recruit and retain talented but
financially disadvantaged students majoring in mathematics and computer science.
Preference is given to underrepresented and female students. The program seeks
to improve retention rates, provide academic support for CSEMS awardees, utilize
CSEMS awardees as tutors and role models, increase the number of mathematics and
computer science majors coming from families with financial need, and link each
CSEMS awardee with a faculty adviser/mentor. Additional academic support is
offered to CSEMS students through faculty mentoring and tutoring, the
Mathematics Assistance Center, and the University tutorial services
center.&lt;br/&gt;
