The researchers will use the geochemical signature of shells from the European
Limpet, Patella vulgata, collected from archaeological sites along the Scottish
coast, to reconstruct surface seawater temperature (SST) seasonality during the
mid-to-late Holocene. The specific goal of the project is to test hypotheses
related to shifts in winter/summer seasonality during the Sub-boreal to Sub-
Atlantic transition and the Medieval-Climate Anomaly to Little-Ice-Age
transition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts include support of graduate
students and strong international collaboration. Furthermore, research methods
and results will be broadly disseminated through exhibits and lectures at the
North Carolina Museum of Natural History, and the Orkney and Mull Museums in
Scotland. Finally, software developed through the project will be made freely
available to the international scientific community.
