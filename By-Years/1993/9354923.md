9354923 Entekhabi The traineeship program in the hydrologic sciences is an
interdisciplinary reseach and education initiative between the Environmental
Engineering and Water Resources division of the MIT Departments of Civil and
Environmental Engineering (C&amp;EE) and the Center for Meteorology and Physical
Oceanography (CMPO) in the MIT Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary
Sciences. These two Departments currently have strong links, in terms of both
educational and research programs, through the MIT Center for Global Change
Science. The proposed traineeship program is focused on educating earth
scientists in the observation, analysis and modeling of physical processes
governing the hydrologic cycle and the climate system. Investigations on the
role of clouds, vegetation, land-surface processes and atmospheric transport
mechanisms are key to the international, national and Institute-wide initiatives
on the scientific analysis of Global change and the definition of sustainable
development. The MIT proposal is strongly focused on training and education at
both undergraduate and graduate levels. The proposed MIT training program in the
hydrologic sciences will include: l) multidisciplinary graduate education, 2)
experience with integrated analys9s-observation-recruitment and retention in the
Environmental Engineering and Water Resources Division will be included. ***
