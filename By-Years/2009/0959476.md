This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation-
Recovery and Reinvestment (MRI-R2) award funds the acquisition of a suite of
instruments suitable for elemental analysis (atomic absorption and x-ray
fluorescence), ion analysis (ion chromatograph), molecular analysis (infrared
spectroscopy and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) as well as direct
functional analysis (a CO2 and H20 gas analyzer) at Skidmore College. The
instrumentation will enrich and transform the diverse research of nine faculty
members from biology, environmental studies, chemistry and anthropology to
understand the structure and function of their research system at the molecular,
cellular, ecosystem, or societal level. Additionally, the instrumentation will
advance a diverse suite of research questions, including but not limited to
those that explore how cell wall composition changes during differentiation, how
organic matter stoichiometry and biological communities couples nitrogen and
phosphorus cycles in terrestrial and aquatic systems, how ions migrate through
polymer-coated capillaries under flow conditions, and, how, when and where
technology transfers occurred during the transformation of rural jungle
societies to networked stratified polities. Skidmore College has a strong
tradition of faculty-undergraduate research and the College has significantly
increased its commitment to the sciences, with a concomitant increase in
scholarship by its faculty and the proportion of students that pursue advanced
degrees in the sciences. Data from the research projects enabled by the new
instruments will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications, and through
student and faculty presentations at regional and national meetings.
