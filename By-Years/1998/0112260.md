Genome remodeling occurs throughout the eukaryotic kingdom and includes well
known examples such as mating type switching in yeast and recombination of
immunoglobulin genes in mammals. The ciliated protozoa present an extreme
example in which large amounts of DNA are eliminated and rearranged to form the
transcriptionally active macronucleus as a normal part of sexual reproduction.
In Paramecium tetraurelia, an estimated 50,000 short DNA elements called
internal eliminated elements (IESs) are removed from the genome via site
specific recombination. Previous research led to the hypothesis that Paramecium
IESs are related to transposable elements. This project will define the regions
of a 28 bp Paramecium IES that are required for accurate DNA splicing and
compare these regions with those critical for excision of transposable elements.
One series of experiments will involve the construction of specific mutations in
the cloned IES. Each mutant IESs will be tested for accurate splicing by
injection into cells that are undergoing macronuclear development. A second
approach will involve sequencing several examples of evolutionarily related IESs
from different Paramecium strains. Comparison of these sequences will identify
conserved nucleotides that are presumed to be important due to their
evolutionary conservation. This assumption will be tested by constructing
appropriate mutations in the IES. Investigations in the related ciliate
Tetrahymena thermophila will focus on a recently identified developmentally
regulated translation elongation factor-2. Gene disruption and replacement
experiments will determine whether this gene and its corresponding protein are
involved in a translational control mechanism that is required for the genome
remodeling process. The research will contribute to a broader understanding of
the relationship between ciliate DNA elimination and transposable element
insertion-excision, and perhaps reveal novel biochemical features of DNA
splicing in this organism. The study of a developmentally regulated elongation
factor 2 may reveal a novel mechanism for the control of protein synthesis in
eukaryotes.
