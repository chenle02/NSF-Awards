GEOTRACES is an international program which aims at identifying processes and
quantifying fluxes that control the distributions of key trace elements and
isotopes in the ocean, and at establishing the sensitivity of these
distributions to changing environmental conditions. Iron (Fe) plays a key role
in phytoplankton growth and composition yet our knowledge of the distribution of
this element in the ocean and the processes that influence its observed
distribution remain poorly quantified. To further our understanding of Fe in the
marine environment, a scientist from Old Dominion University plans to analyze
water column and surface water samples for dissolved Fe and Fe(II) using high
throughput flow injection analysis during the upcoming 2010 GEOTRACES cruise to
the North Atlantic Ocean basin. In addition, following the cruise, the samples
will be analyzed again using both the flow injection method and high resolution
inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry to assess the effects of sample
storage and to ascertain the accuracy of their shipboard measurements. Results
from this research will facilitate the inclusion of iron in biogeochemical
models of the marine ecosystem and improve scientists' ability to predict how
the ocean will respond to future climate change. This study represents a
collaborative effort between a scientist at a U.S. institution and the
University of Tasmania. It is anticipated that results from the study would be
incorporated into class lecture material for graduate and undergraduate courses
at Old Dominion University. One graduate student would be supported and trained
as part of this project.
