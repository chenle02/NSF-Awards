The Museum of Natural History at the University of Kansas houses an
internationally important ethanol research collection of catalogued specimens of
fossil and recent vertebrates. This valuable research resource is used by many
researchers of systematics, biogeography, and evolutionary biology for their own
research as well as for training students in these fields. The current facility
is not only out dated but the space is inadequate and in violation of fire
codes. This award will allow for a replacement facility which will enable a
modern systematic biological research collection to be a computerized
information acquisition, storage, and retrieval system as well as serve the
general functions of a research resource. This replacement facility will allow
for better research and training of students concerned with issues related to
biodiversity and ecology.
