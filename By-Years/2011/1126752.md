This award supports the development of an optical calorimeter with nanoKelvin
resolution which is estimated to improve upon the sensitivity of current laser
calorimeters by more than three orders of magnitude, which will push the state-
of-the-art in optical absorption measurements of 0.1 to 1 ppm (parts per
million) to the ppb (parts per billion)region. This will allow the
characterization of optical components with unprecedented sensitivity. Spectral
resolution and measurements at 3 K combined with spatial resolution will yield
unique information about the physical and chemical nature of native and laser
induced material defects, which is necessary for the development of mitigation
strategies. The new instrument will enable precision studies of optical/IR
absorbance of materials used in low-temperature detectors with spectral, power,
and spatial resolution, including the impact of adsorbed surface contamination.
This will provide information on the position-dependent response of paramagnetic
gamma-ray/particle detectors, which will result in lower operating temperatures
for improved performance.
