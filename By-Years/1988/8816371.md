Early diagenetic repartitioning of carbon, sulfur, iron, and manganese in
poorly oxygenated to anoxic marine deposits will be studied using new
geochemical and stable isotopic data on the Miocene Monterey Formation and the
mid-Cretaceous Greenhorn Formation. Our objectives will be 1) to interpret
interrela- tionships in the Corg-S-Fe-Mn system in terms of depositional and
early diagenetic conditions and 2) to reconstruct the pathways for transfer of
sulfur from dissolved and solid inorganic-sulfur species to organic-sulfur
compounds in bitumen and kerogen. Organic and inorganic sulfur species will be
isolated using a step-wise procedure that will yield seven sulfur fractions
(sulphate, elemental, bitumen, acid-volatile, disulfide, barite, and kerogen).
Depth and timing of pyrite formation relative to incorporation of sulfur into
organic matter will be inferred from the isotopic compositions of the various
sulfur fractions in conjunction with the distribution of iron and manganese. The
Monterey and Greenhorn both contain interbedded laminated and bioturbated
lithofacies that will enable us to sample a wide range of paleoenvironmental and
early diagenetic settings. Integration of organic and inorganic sulfur data with
manganese and iron data will provide a new basis for interpreting ancient poorly
oxygenated to anoxic basins. The geological units selected for this study will
permit comparison of sedimentary strata in modern and Miocene coastal upwellings
and in modern oceanic and Cretaceous epicontinental settings.
