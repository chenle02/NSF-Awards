The unconventional nature of superconductivity in the heavy electron
superconductors (UPt3, URu2Si2, UPd2A13 etc.) will be explored via ultrasound,
magnetic and electromagnetic measurements. The dependence of the phase diagrams
in these superconductors on uniaxial strain, magnetic field and impurities will
be mapped using ultrasonics. The results will be compared with predictions of
Ginzburg Landau theories to place constraints on the multicomponent order
parameters. Vortex states in these multiple phases will be studied using low
temperature scanning microscopy techniques. Initial experiments will be carried
out with a magnetic force microscope which we have partially developed. Finally,
we propose to study the novel response of these superconductors to
electromagnetic waves. The unusual frequency dependence to arise in these
superconductors will be studied up to frequencies of 2GHz. %%% Heavy-fermion
materials show extraordinary electronic properties, some exhibit
superconductivity. Measurements on thin films should give valuable insights into
the behavior of these highly unusual materials.
