This project delves into several research directions within representation
theory, which is the mathematical framework for studying objects through their
symmetries and the operations which preserve them. Such operations can carry a
classical, or even more intriguingly a quantum algebraic structure. Originally
appearing in physical models within statistical mechanics and quantum integrable
systems, quantum groups and the theory surrounding them are now a thriving
source of uncovering new mathematical principles. This project will develop a
richer understanding of this theory by building a common ground for combining
algebraic, combinatorial, and higher-structural categorical techniques for the
study of quantum groups and associated diagram algebras. This will lead to a
more unified approach and provide connections between several areas of
mathematics, as well as potential physical applications. The project will
involve the participation of undergraduate students and create opportunities for
discussion and collaboration among early-career researchers.

Specifically, the project will answer several questions about the representation
theory of quantum groups and their related algebras from a categorical and a
combinatorial perspective. In more detail, the centers of quantum groups are key
to understanding the structure of their representations, which have further key
symmetries captured by braid and cactus groups. The actions of quantum groups
are intertwined with actions of Hecke and Temperley-Lieb algebras, informing
each other's behavior and the structures of their representations. The main
goals of the project are to first construct and diagonalize elements of the
centers of categorified quantum groups, and use the resulting collection of
idempotents to study the decomposition of categorical representations.
Subsequently, the PI will develop new tools and build connections between braid
and cactus group actions, both on the classical and higher-structure,
categorical level, and in the process develop the representation theory of the
cactus group. Finally, the PI will investigate a family of closely related
diagram algebras—the two-boundary Temperley-Lieb algebras—and unite three radial
viewpoints of their standard modules, which will enable the study of their
decomposition and irreducibility.
