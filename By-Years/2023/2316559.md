In this project, which is managed by the Chemistry Division and funded jointly
with the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR),
Professor Nicolas Holubowitch and his students at the New Mexico Institute of
Mining and Technology (NMT) will investigate mechanisms leading to the
degradation of redox flow batteries for grid-scale energy storage. The project
seeks to broaden the profile of NMT Chemistryâ€™s graduate program through a
variety of initiatives meant to leverage their geographic location and access to
diverse demographics. Broader impact initiatives include (1) a new
electrochemistry and computational chemistry Special Topics graduate course
filling in gaps in the current curriculum; (2) focused STEM-related activities
and a crash course on post-graduate education/career opportunities for
undergraduate students; and (3) organization of various events, social
gatherings and research symposia that establish a sense of community within our
graduate program and extend their reach to the community.

Professor Holubowitch will establish a deep understanding of processes and
environmental factors responsible for limiting the performance and lifetime of
emerging sustainable redox flow battery chemistries. The project will subject
state-of-the-art electrolytes from two next-gen RFB classes of active compounds,
viologens and nitroxyl radicals, to systematically controlled conditions: pH,
concentration, trace oxygen, and temperature fluctuations. Chemical and
performance degradation will be correlated across in situ and ex situ studies,
allowing the parameter space for RFB configurations and their environmental
susceptibility to be mapped with high resolution. A public database,
RFBrxiv.org, will be established for the community to report, compare, and
discuss results.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
