This award provides funds to the Psychology Department at the University of
Connecticut to purchase equipment which will help improve the introductory
psychology sequence at the University. The school has already funded a pilot
program (tested in General Psychology 1) which provided some student computer
stations, one network file server and one instructor's station. The pilot
program extended control over stimulus presentation, data collection and data
analysis. New programs were written and existing programs modified to increase
the range and complexity of the experiments which formed the core of the labs.
This award will allow the program to be expanded to give all students the
opportunity to participate in the Computer Assisted Laboratory for Introductory
Psychology. It will also enhance the pilot software and develop new software to
enrich the understanding of experimentation and increase the level of computer
literacy of primarily freshman and sophomore students. The grantee is matching
this award with non-Federal sources.
