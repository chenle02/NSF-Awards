What are the social processes that pattern disaster evacuation behavior among
transient populations? Little or no research has been directed toward this
question. Transient populations are defined as persons who are not in the
community where they normally reside at the time they initiate disaster
evacuation behavior. There are at least four sub-types: tourists, business
travellers, migrant workers, and people in the process of relocating (including
the homeless). The research has five objectives: (1) to describe the sequence of
behavior that culminates in actual evacuation from disaster sites among
transient populations; (2) to describe the range of variation that may exist
among these behavioral sequences among population sub-types, urban- rural event
locations, and disaster phases (i.e., pre or post-impact evacuation); (3) to
identify factors that account for the variation in these behavioral sequences,
e.g., disaster warning receiver characteristics, warning message
characteristics, social group qualities, organizational qualities and community
characteristics; (4) document perceptions of transients who have been disaster
victims regarding evacuation procedures implemented by governmental agency
representatives and private sector organizational executives; and (5) formulate
policy recommendations for emergency managers and business executives. In
accordance with disaster design requirements, field interviews will be conducted
following major disasters resulting from earthquakes and other agents in eight
locations wherein large numbers of transients have evacuated.
