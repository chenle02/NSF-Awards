9508055 Banerjee The PI will perform a detailed magnetic study of 9 m cores from
the Pittsburg Basin, southern Illinois, to determine multi-parameter magnetic
proxies for incorporation into an ongoing multi-disciplinary climate change
study for this site. The robust, internally validated magnetic proxies will be
integrated with equally important mineralogical, geochemical and
sedimentalogical proxies developed by the PI and other colleagues who use
Mossbauer spectroscopy, elemental and isotope geochemistry, palynology, and
quantitative grainsize distribution analyses. ****
