This award is made as the starter grant increment of Dr. Nancy Levinger's
Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Chemistry Award in support of her research
at Colorado State University. This research will probe the role of molecular
modes in photoinduced charge transfer reactions, especially electron transfer. A
detailed molecular picture of the structural changes and dynamics of chemical
reactions in solution will be developed. One of several systems to be studied is
electron transfer of nitrosyl or nitrosonium cations with arenes. Reactions will
be followed by time-resolved resonance Raman spectroscopy and time resolved
visible and ultraviolet pump/infrared probe absorption spectroscopy. %%% Charge-
transfer process are ubiquitous in chemistry. The detailed vibrationally
resolved information gathered in this research will extend our understanding of
the complicated behavior of charge-transfer processes in solution.
