This proposal requests funds to obtain an ultracentrifuge and an HPLC. Seven
investigators have proposed projects, all dealing with plant science, that will
make use of the instrumentation requested. The projects include: the
biochemistry of terpenoids, proteinase inhibitors in natural plant protection,
the molecular biology of seed development, regulation of plant gene expression,
ascorbic acid metabolism in plants, nutrient exchange in the Rhizobium-legume
symbiosis, and lipid biosynthesis in leaves and seeds.
