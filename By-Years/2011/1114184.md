Geysers provide a natural laboratory to study eruption processes and the
geophysical and hydrological signals that can be measured before, during, and
after an eruption. Because they are smaller than volcanic eruptions, and erupt
more frequently, they provide a rare opportunity to collect abundant data and
develop approaches for integrating and interpreting
measurements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About 3 million visitors to Yellowstone
witness the wonders of geyser eruptions. Explanations for these phenomena,
however, are limited or lacking. Geyser-like behavior of water and hydrocarbons
has also been observed on the ocean floor and at mud volcanoes. Thus improved
understanding of geyser behavior may yield insight into other self-organized,
intermittent processes in nature that result from localized input of energy and
mass. Insights from studies of geysers can also be translated to volcanic
systems. This project will integrate field measurements, laboratory studies, and
numerical simulations of multiphase flow in geyser systems to address the
following basic questions about the geysering process: How does conduit plumbing
affect eruption initiation and interval? Do eruptions begin at the top or bottom
of the conduit? How many conduit volumes erupt per eruption? Do non-condensable
gases play a role in eruptions? Which external processes (e.g., tides,
variations in barometric pressure, earthquakes) and internal dynamics (e.g.,
duration of preceding eruption) influence the interval between and duration of
eruption? How are geyser conduits recharged? When and where does vapor form?
Answers to this question may offer new insight into triggered seismicity and
volcanic eruptions.
