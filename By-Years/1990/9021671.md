The research aims at developing a fundamental understanding of shear-band
initiation and propagation. The materials that will be investigated, titanium
and aluminum alloys, have great importance in the aerospace industry; they
undergo shear localization during plastic deformation and this is an important
practical problem. Systematic and integrated experimental and theoretical
investigation of the phenomenon of shear-band formation will be carried out.
This will lead to the prediction and control of shear instability and to the
establishment of its effect on the strength and failure modes of a broad class
of materials. Dynamic experiments will be performed, in order to generate shear
bands under controlled conditions. The Hopkinson bar experimental technique will
be used with both hat-shaped and double-notched specimens. Pulse amplitude and
shape in the Hopkinson bar will be varied to control the extent of shear-band
propagation. This will be followed by microstructural characterization involving
optical, scanning, and transmission electron microscopy. The microstructure
after controlled high-strain-rate deformation stages and prior to the onset of
macroscopic shear localization, will also be systematically investigated in
order to establish which internal defects can lead to the initiation of
localization and to characterize the microstructural evolution. The
microstructure at the tip of the shear band will be examined in order to
establish the structural changes in this zone prior to shear band extension.
