This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate
the feasibility of exploiting nanostructured mixed ionic and electronic
conductor (MIEC) ceramic anode material for direct electrocatalytic oxidation of
hydrocarbon in solid oxide fuel cell applications. The proposed catalyst
consists of an electrical conducting phase, Sr0.88Y0.08TiO3, coated with an
oxidation catalyst, Ce0.80Y0.20O0.19. Both phases are known MIECs ideal for fuel
electrode materials in view of electrode polarization.

Commercial potential of the proposed technology includes solid oxide fuel cell
applications, direct hydrogen generation for portable or stationary fuel cell
systems for communication, computers, electric and hybrid vehicles, home utility
suppliers, power source for appliances, military aircraft, electric wheelchairs,
and medical power supply systems.
