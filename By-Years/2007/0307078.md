Thirty years ago B. Mazur discovered some surprising similarities (a) between
knots and prime numbers, and (b) between 3-dimensional manifolds and number
fields. Those similarities were further elaborated by Kapranov, Morishita,
Ramachandran, Reznikov, and PI, but the full scope of these analogies is still
unknown. PI's goal is to continue investigation of these analogies and their
roots.

Arithmetic topology is an exiting new area of mathematical research relating two
of the most active areas of mathematical research in the recent years: low-
dimensional topology and number theory. The development of Arithmetic Topology
is driven by the desire to establish rigorous and uniform foundations for those
two seemingly diverse theories.
