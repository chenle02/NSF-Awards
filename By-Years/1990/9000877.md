This project is concerned with the study of the steady states of partial
differential equations. In particular, the principal investigator is interested
in existence, multiplicity and symmetry questions for solutions of semilinear
elliptic problems. The project consists of two parts. In the first part the
principal investigator considers semilinear problems involving a parameter and
studies the solution structure of the problem for the parameter in a
neighborhood of an eigenvalue of the linear part of the problem. Here the
principal investigator is mainly interested in semilinear problems whose
nonlinear part involves bounded oscillatory terms (Sine Gordon type problems).
For such problems the multiplicity of ground states (positive solutions) appears
intimately dependent upon the dimension of the independent variable and the
geometry of the underlying domain. In fact, very little is known for domains
which are not convex. In the second part the principal investigator studies the
question of symmetry breaking and the development of interior and boundary
layers for positive solution branches of semilinear elliptic problems. Here the
principal investigator is mainly interested in problems where the domain is
either a sphere or a convex domain with certain reflection symmetries.
