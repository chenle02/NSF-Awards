The investigators conducting this project have been studying properties of the
visual system of the horseshoe crab, Limulus, for some time. This is a favorite
model system for investigations of visual mechanisms and principles of neural
organization. Among their important recent discoveries is the observation that
the structure and function of the eyes are modified by signals from the brain
recurring with a twenty-four hour (circadian) cycle. This observation is an
example of a newly emerging principle in sensory physiology: feedback from the
brain alters the nature of sensory receptors and the information they transmit
to the brain. That is, sensory receptors and the brain are two-way communication
systems, not unidirectional systems as had been thought previously. In this
project they will obtain long term recordings of electrical signals in the
Limulus retina and optic nerve in intact animals. The potential for doing such
studies is one of the advantages to using this organism as an experimental
model. This will permit better analysis of the circadian regulation of retinal
sensitivity. They will also conduct anatomical, neurochemical and behavioral
studies of the system. The goals are to increase our understanding of the
mechanisms by which the brain can influence retinal structure and function; the
neural characteristics of the "clock" controlling circadian rhythms; the course
of development of circadian rhythms in retinal sensitivity; and the role of such
rhythms in visual behavior. They also plan to explore other possible animal
models for studying control of visual sensitivity by the brain. We expect
significant advances in our understanding of vision, neural organization, and
general principles of sensory receptor modulation by the brain to emerge from
this project.
