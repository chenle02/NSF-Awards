Laboratory courses are offered to accompany content courses in Cognitive
Psychology and Psychology of Perception. The requested instructional scientific
equipment was selected for its versatility for performing a wide variety of
psychology experiments and its ease of use for students. These laboratory
courses provide expanded opportunities for undergraduate psychology majors to
actively participate in the SCIENCE of psychology. Students are introduced to
the application of the scientific method to a content area of interest to them.
They replicate experiments they are reading and hearing about in their content
course, and ultimately design, carry out, and present in a research conference
format an original research study. These courses benefit women and minority
students particularly, since these students have shown a clear preference for
enrolling in psychology courses rather than other science areas. Thus laboratory
experiences in psychology can serve as a gateway to the sciences for
traditionally underrepresented groups.
