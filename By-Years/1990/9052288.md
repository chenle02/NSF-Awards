To improve the introductory laboratories, the Physics Department is introducing
microcomputer-based laboratory (MBL) instruments into the laboratory curriculum.
The equipment consists of eight microcomputers along with sensors and software
that can be utilized in all of the physics department's undergraduate
laboratories. The sensors are interfaced to the microcomputers to measure
physical quantities such as position, velocity, acceleration, force,
temperature, sound and light. As measurements are taken, data obtained by the
sensors are displayed in digital and graphical form that can be later
manipulated and analyzed giving students unprecedented power to explore,
measure, and learn from the physical world. MBL instruments have been shown to
make the understanding of physical phenomena more accessible to the naive
science learner, and they expand the investigations that more advanced students
can undertake. The purchase and implementation of MBL instruments will
significantly benefit students because recent research in educational and
cognitive science verify the importance for students to have solid empirical and
heavily phenomenological experiences in developing their science skills and
learning concepts. The University is matching the award with an equal amount of
funds.
