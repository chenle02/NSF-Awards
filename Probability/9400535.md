This is a three year program of research organized around the theme of heavy
tailed modeling. Heavy tailed modeling assumes regular variation is present in
either the right tail (frequently implying infinite variances) or the left tail
of basic component distributions of the system and thus departs from Gaussian
methods. Broad themes include parameter estimation and prediction in heavy
tailed models (Hill estimator, linear programming estimator), model selection
and confirmation and long range dependence. Specific classes of models to be
studied are extreme value models, infinitely divisible processes and time series
with positive innovations. Application areas include modeling financial and
commodities markets and teletraffic systems. This is a three year program of
research organized around two topics. The first involves modeling random
phenomena whose behavior is controlled by exceedingly large values. For example,
in communications, network performance can be dramatically affected by anomalous
long calls such as computer logins by modem. Accurate modeling of these
phenomena can lead to improvements in the system. The second topic deals with
random phenomena in which dependencies in a system last a long time. Once again
accurate modeling is important in improving system performance. Other
applications of this research include modeling financial and commodities markets
and modeling of water flows and heights.
