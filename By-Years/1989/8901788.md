This research is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfields of atomic spectroscopy and mass spectroscopy. The goal of this
research is to develop and evaluate radio frequency (RF) powered glow discharge
as an atomization/excitation/ionization source for direct solids elemental
analysis. This approach in combination with mass spectrometric and atomic
emission detection should allow for direct analysis of insulating materials such
as glasses and ceramics. This research focuses on examining the analytical
utility of this approach, particularly for the analysis of insulating materials.
This research involves the use of a new method of direct solid analysis. A new
type of sampling source, which is modulated at radio frequency, is to be used
for direct sampling. This research should provide a new and improved approach to
the analysis of materials such as glasses and ceramics.
