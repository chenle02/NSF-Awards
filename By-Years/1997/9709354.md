This award supports the participation of eight US participants to a US-Italy
workshop investigating the role of software architecture in testing and
analyzing complex systems. The co-organizers are Debra Richardson of the
University of California, Irvine, and Paola Inverardi, University of Aquila in
Italy. The workshop's objectives are to identify the appropriate uses of
formalized software architectures as the abstract basis for analysis and
testing, and establishing a research agenda for cross-disciplinary
investigation. Software engineering is strong in Italy, and there is a growing
interest in software architecture, testing and analysis, and the interaction
between the two disciplines. The workshop will lead to new collaborations
between US and Italian participants and advance understanding of the area of
software architecture that could become a significant force in organizing
approaches to software development.
