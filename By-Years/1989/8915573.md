In this award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry
Program, Ian P. Rothwell of Purdue University will continue studies in the
chemistry of transition and main group elements bound with aryloxide ligands.
The results of the project are expected to provide a deeper understanding of the
chemical reactivities of organic molecules which are attached to metal atoms and
may lead to improved syntheses of some organic compounds. The research effort
will include four aspects. The first involves the investigation of the synthetic
utility and mechanistic details of intramolecular carbon-hydrogen bond
activation by both d-block and p-block metals. Another area involves the
exploitation of the potent reducing power of low valent early d-block metal
aryloxide compounds. The third area involves the synthetic and mechanistic study
of p-block metal hydrides to stepwise hydrogenate intramolecular aryloxide
ligands. The final thrust is to investigate the hydrogenation of aryl-phosphine
and arsine ligands. Also included in the last study will be efforts to carry out
catalytic asymmetric hydro- genations of prochiral phosphine and arsine ligands.
