The goal of this project is to provide a significant research experience to
undergraduate students in order to encourage them to pursue graduate careers in
science. Students will be especially recruited from under-represented groups and
institutions in the Midwest. The focus of the research projects will be parallel
processing, and it will include design, analysis and implementation of parallel
algorithms as well as suitable programming languages. During the summer,
students will learn the tools and background necessary to parallel processing
and, with the help of faculty, define a research project. They will continue
research on their selected projects at their home institutions during the
academic year.
