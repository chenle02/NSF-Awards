This grant funds students and early-career faculty to travel to the Foundations
of Software Engineering Symposium (FSE 2016) in Seattle, Washington in November
of 2016. Participants will attend two events for junior researchers in the field
of Software Engineering. The first is the Doctoral Symposium for PhD students.
The second event is the Mentorship Sessions program, which connects junior
researchers (senior PhD students and pre-tenure faculty) with senior researchers
who will serve as mentors.

The education, training and mentoring received by the participants helps build
the next generation of US-based researchers and educators, also encourages the
exchange of ideas and new research collaborations to advance the field of
Software Engineering, which is important to the economy.
