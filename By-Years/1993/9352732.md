State-of-the-art laboratory sequences in immunology, plant physiological
ecology, cell physiology, biochemistry, and cell biology augment existing
courses. Innovative approaches to laboratory design include: Replacing
radioactive tracers with either colorimetric or fluorescent assays;
Miniaturizing experiments to reduce reagent use through the use of tissue
culture and development of assays using the microplate reader; and Studies the
effect of similar stress situations on varying plant physiological responses.
