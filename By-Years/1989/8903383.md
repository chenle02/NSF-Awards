The planned research falls roughly into two categories. The first will utilize
junction capacitance and ESR spectroscopy to study defect properties in various
kinds of amorphous samples. First, they will extend their recent very successful
studies of single heterojunction c-Si/a-Si:H structures to investigate
contamination effects at the interface, and also to heterostructures of
a-Si,Ge:H alloy layers on crystalline substrates. They thus hope to identify
trends in the interface defect structure and in band offsets. They will continue
their work with doping superlattice samples and also to initiate studies of
heterostructure multilayer films. They also wish to characterize the deep defect
structure of bulk a-Si,Ge:H alloy films using their techniques. The second area
will be to study transport behavior using time and spatially modulated
photoconductivity measurements. Through some relatively new techniques they hope
to better resolve the dispersive vs. non- dispersive components of the free
carrier dynamics. They also wish to apply the acphotocurrent phase shift
analysis method in conjunction with their other experimental techniques to
correlate, within the same samples, the deep defect distribution above and below
Ef. This will provide a more critical test of the current defect models.
