The project investigates the psychosocial factors that influence learning and
performance for undergraduate students taking introductory science and
mathematics courses at North Carolina Central University. The project extends
prior research where the investigator found that among the factors measured on a
learning motivation and strategies questionnaire, the studentsâ€™ expressed self-
efficacy was found to be the strongest predictor of course performance, and was
the singular predictor when controlling for prior achievement. The current study
will use a generalized latent subgroup approach to allow for a finer-grained
analysis that could detail relationships or interactions that might be missed
otherwise. The project illustrates the possibilities a generalized latent
subgroup perspective yields for addressing the complexity and heterogeneity of
broadening participation STEM education research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
research explores the intersection of the multiple dimensions of a generalized
population, characterized by socioeconomic status, environmental and situational
factors, personal and social identities, and motivational states of students,
and corresponding relationships with behavioral and academic outcome variables
associated with them taking gatekeeper STEM courses. The study will examine four
research questions: (1) What generalized latent subgroups are determined from
background characteristics, motivational, and psychological variables?, (2) Do
background characteristics, motivational, and psychological variables interact
to influence learning behavior in STEM courses?, (3) To what extent does the
psychosocial and behavioral factors associated with learning determine academic
outcomes, such as pass rates and retention in STEM courses? And (4) What
differential effects are reflected on learning behaviors and academic outcomes
in STEM courses from generalized subgroups? Survey data will be collected from
students in introductory STEM courses and analyzed using Latent Class Analysis
as a methodological approach. The research results can contribute to more
effective interventions to improve retention of underrepresented groups in
STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
