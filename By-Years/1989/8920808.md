The grant provides partial funding for a Symposium on Physical Phenomena in
Granular Materials at the Spring Meeting of the Materials Research Society, San
Francisco, California, April 16- 20, 1990. The funds will be used to provide
partial financial support for participation by students. The symposium provides
a forum for the presentation of latest results of research on the topic of
granular materials, and consists of a format that encourages free discussion of
the scientific issues and results. Proceedings will be published in the
Materials Research Society Symposium Proceedings Series, August 1990.
