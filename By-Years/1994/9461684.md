This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks to establish the
feasibility of an innovative approach for designing a toolset that automates
what are perhaps the most complex tasks associated with developing software for
parallel computer systems, i.e., software partitioning and mapping. The
potential of existing and emerging distributed memory parallel computers to
deliver cost effective solutions to computationally challenging problems is well
recognized. However, the major impediment to the widespread use of these
machines is the difficulty of efficiently partitioning and mapping application
algorithms on these machines so as to extract a large portion of the machine's
peak performance. The proposed toolset will solve this problem. The toolset will
provide an ensemble of tools for assisting the system designer at each step of
the application development process, from system definition to code generation
for the target multiprocessor architecture. The toolset includes: 1) an
automated tool for partitioning the application software; 2) a tool for
automatically generating a mapping of the software on to the processors of the
target architecture; and 3) a simulation tool to assess the performance of the
system. All the tools in the interface will be integrated so as to provide
seamless access to them by the user. Also, a sophisticated user interface will
provide a uniform and intuitive interface for a system designer to interact with
the different tools in the toolset and will guide the user through the sequence
of steps associated with the application development process.
