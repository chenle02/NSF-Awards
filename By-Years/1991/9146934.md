This proposal is for the first year of a three-year continuing award for the
Evaluator function for two I/UCRCs located in the State of Washington. One is
the Center for Process Analytical Chemistry at the University of Washington and
the other is the Center for Design of Analog/Digital Integrated Circuits at
Washington State University. The evaluator is a position required by NSF for all
I/UCRCs and is responsible for the implementation of the Centers' assessment
program. The assessment program identifies the factors that will contribute to
the attainment of the Centers' goals. The Program Director recommends that Craig
Scott be awarded $14,000 for the first year of a three-year continuing award.
