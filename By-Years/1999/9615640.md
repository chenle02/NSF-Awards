9615640 Miller This award supports two-thirds of the cost of installing a
network of continuously recording Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers in
the state of Washington for the purpose of measuring ground motion associated
with subduction zone tectonics, volcanic activity, and earthquakes. The
Principal Investigator will coordinate the installation and operation of the
network from Central Washington University. Central Washington University is
committed to providing the remaining funds necessary for the project. The basic
research goal of the measurements to be taken by the network is an understanding
of the processes leading to deformation of the continental crust in the Pacific
Northwest region due to the combination of forces from the oblique subduction of
the Juan de Fuca plate, the entrainment of the Sierra Nevada-Oregon Coast Range
block, and the local forces created by the topographic gradient from the Basin
and Range to the Columbia Basin. The network is also expected to provide
important data for improved assessment of the seismic and volcanic risk in the
region. ***
