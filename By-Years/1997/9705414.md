w:\awards\awards96\num.doc 9705414 Markert This experimental research project
is devoted to exploring unusual phenomena in anisotropic magnetism and
superconductivity. Emphasis is placed on the relation between materials
structure and electronic properties. The work is materials-based and involves
synthesis of new materials, growth of single crystals and of epitaxial films,
and microstructure manipulation. A wide range of experiments to be employed
includes SQUID magnetometry; magnetic, elastic and dissipative measurements
using high-Q oscillators; surface analysis, NMR, and heat capacity. Specific
topics will include magnetic excitations and anisotropy of infinite layer
cuprates; competition between Kondo/heavy fermion behavior and 3d transition
metal magnetism in two Ce-based compounds; and effects of surface structure on
spin excitations in ultrathin ferromagnetic films, including the engineering of
specific magnon dispesion features. In this work, the unity in one project of a
wide array of synthesis, charcterization and analytical techniques will provide
the graduate students with an excellent training in areas of materials science
and physics. %%% This experimental research project is centered on discovering
the relations between structure of materials and those electronic properties
which may be particularly useful in technology, including magnetic properties
and superconductivity. The work includes synthesis of novel materials in the
form of single crystals, epitaxial films and will also explore effects of
microstructure manipulation. Methods will include use of sensitive magnetic
property measurements, surface analysis, and nuclear magnetic resonance. Results
from this research may include unusual new effects or structures which may find
application in technology. This research project is interdisciplinary in nature
and involves undergraduate and graduate students who will be excellently trained
to enter positions in industry, government or education. ***
