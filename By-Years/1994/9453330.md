The project develops an operating system called SPIN that provides fine-grained
control to applications over physical resources in ways that are safe,
predictable and efficient. The SPIN system is structured around an extensible
microkernel architecture. The system is extensible in the sense that application
programs can dynamically install restricted program sequences that execute in
the kernel in response to a set of pre-defined events allowing for flexible and
rapid response. For example, an application program could install a scheduling
filter that runs each time a thread from that program's address space is
preempted. The notion of event filtering can be applied to a wide class of
events and services, including virtual memory, scheduling, network
communication, local interprocess communication and disk management. By viewing
system resource management as a process by which physical resources are
reassigned across applications, and interpreting each reassignment as a discreet
event, SPIN defines critical control points for application feedback, enabling
dynamic resource allocation policies. By associating application-defined control
sequences with these control points, SPIN enforces a wide range of policies at
each event, enabling a single operating system to work well across many types of
applications. By executing the control sequences within the kernel, the dynamic
control is achieved with very low overhead.
