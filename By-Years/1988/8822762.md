This award supports an international symposium on the topic of Computational
Models of Scientific Discovery to be held at Stanford University during the
second week of January 1989. The list of participants will include the top
researchers in the field and a number of selected researchers based upon
submitted summaries of their research. The symposium will contribute
significantly to communication and cooperation between researchers in different
fields, and advance the understanding of the processes underlying scientific
reasoning and discovery.
