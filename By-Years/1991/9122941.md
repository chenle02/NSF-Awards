This project is an effort to determine continental-scale and regional-scale
sources of pollution aerosol collected at the GISP-2 and Dye-3 sites in
Greenland. It will make use of a chemically-based source apportionment technique
known as receptor modelling, which chemical signatures developed for regional-
scale sources in North America and Eurasia are applied to the analyses of snow
and ice samples. Geographically specific industrialized regions display
characteristic patterns of trace element composition of their aerosol emissions,
which include contributions from power plants, smelters, motor vehicles, biomass
burning, etc. Some rely on anomalously high concentrations of exotic trace
elements such as arsenic, indium, selenium, and vanadium, which are found in
extremely low concentrations in Greenland. The project will make use of samples
collected at the GISP-2 site during the past two seasons, and will collect
additional samples in the summer of 1992.
