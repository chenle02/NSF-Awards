This award supports the development of an empirical mid- to low-latitude
meridional wind model. Current neutral wind models are not precise enough for
ionospheric density and temperature modeling. Apart from its intrinsic
usefulness to ionospheric modelers, an improved neutral wind model will provide
a useful bench mark for the thermospheric general circulation models.
