It is proposed that the standard oedometer test, properly conducted, can be used
to determine all the necessary parameters to implement the unrestricted theory
in the consolidation aspects of geotechnical engineering practice for
undisturbed and remolded soils. This research would synthesize and prove the
viability of the use of unrestricted consolidation theory for a wide range of
soft soils, and would develop the methodology for applying the theory in a form
that could be easily used by all geotechnical engineers at a minimum cost in
time and equipment.
