The research is organized in terms of six tasks. First, donor molecules will be
screened to produce conducting organic/inorganic Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films
based on layered transition metal phosphates. Second, systematic studies will be
carried out on model systems to learn about the range of organic molecules that
can be used to form the mixed organic/inorganic metal phosphate LB structures.
Third, a determination will be made on how the functionalized organic molecules
pack in these assemblies. Fourth, the inorganic lattice will be matched to the
organic molecules. Fifth, methods for doping the thin films will be
investigated. Sixth, each film will be structurally and physically
characterized. With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the
research of Dr. Daniel R. Talham of the Department of Chemistry at the
University of Florida. Professor Talham will focus his work on projects that
center on the preparation of Langmuir-Blodgett films that contain mixed
organic/inorganic `dual-network` layered systems. These films will have
conducting or superconducting properties
