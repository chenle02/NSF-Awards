A fundamental question in population and conservation biology is the rate at
which wildlife populations exchange individuals. In this study, the genetics of
both a vertebrate host and an infecting virus will be used to infer movement of
cougars among populations in the northern Rocky Mountains. Because viruses
evolve a million times faster than do higher organisms, changes in host
populations, such as population subdivision, should become manifest in the
genetics of a virus long before they lead to genetic changes in the host.
Estimates of host movement based on virus genetics will be compared to estimates
derived from a more traditional host genetic marker, microsatellites.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The use of a fast-evolving infectious organism as a
genetic marker of animal movements offers an innovative perspective on
population dynamics that can complement existing population genetics approaches.
In addition, the proposed research is significant because it will increase our
understanding of how infectious organisms like viruses are distributed and
maintained on a landscape scale. Furthermore, the research proposed fosters
productive collaborations with hunters, government agencies, and academics.
