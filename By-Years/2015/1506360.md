This award supports the calibration of Advanced LIGO data. Calibration is the
essential first step in the analysis of gravitational wave data, and therefore
in the LIGO critical path. Current LIGO sensitivities have already surpassed
those of Initial LIGO, and the first observing run scheduled for late 2015 is
almost a factor of four better than Initial LIGO. A detection of gravitational
waves from a binary coalescence in the near future is therefore a distinct
possibility. After a period of commissioning and observing runs, Advanced LIGO
is expected to observe gravitational waves routinely. These first detections
will simultaneously test our understanding of fundamental physics and provide a
new means to study the universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports work
to develop and maintain the official Advanced LIGO time-domain calibration
pipeline. This pipeline will deliver calibrated data with sub-second latencies
to gravitational wave data analysts. The team will generate the digital filters
required for the calibration, track changes in the instrument that affect the
calibration, work on the development of a zero-latency calibration system, help
produce the calibration error budget, automate calibration updates, and increase
the robustness of the entire calibration procedure.
