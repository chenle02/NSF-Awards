This composite project involves the collaboration of three departments in two
separate universities. Novel conducting polymers that will be suitable for the
optoelectronics industry will be studied, and will include the synthesis of new
organosilicon polymers based on the incorporation of heteroelements into the
carbon backbone structure of the polymers and their characterization by a
variety of different techniques. Processing methods that will yield homogeneous
thin films, coatings, and fibers of these polymers, that will be suitable for
optical devices such as optical modulators and switches or electroluminescing
(EL) devices will also be explored. Some of these new polymers will attract
considerable scientific interest in the physics and chemistry communities by
providing stable processible degenerate ground state polymers supporting charged
solitons or EL systems, for which nongeminate decay processes will be studied in
detail. This project is being supported jointly by the Division of Materials
Research, and the Division of Electrical and Communications Systems.
