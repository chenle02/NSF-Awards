This project extends the Expanded U.S. Supreme Court Judicial Database to
include variables pertaining to the "relisted" cases of the Burger Court. During
the Burger Court, any justice could have a case relisted - held over until the
next scheduled conference, typically seven days later - to delay the certiorari
decision. Relisting is one of the only features of the Court's decision-making
process not included in any of the NSF databases. Closing this gap is important,
not only for the sake of completeness, but also because it will shed light on
the justices' employment of strategic behavior. Scholars do not know which of
the justices engage in the practice, with what effect, in cases concerning what
legal provisions and issues, and at what cost to the Court's productive process.
In contrast, scholars do know a great deal about other stages and aspects, but
without relevant and systematic information about relisting, we omit
consideration of an aspect of agenda setting that may well affect not only the
behavior of individual justices, but also the adequacy of hypotheses and
theories aimed at explaining the agenda setting behavior of the Court as a
policy-making institution. Implementation of this proposal requires systematic
examination of all of the several thousand docket sheets of Justices William
Brennan and Lewis Powell that identify the occurrence of relisting and the entry
of the pertinent data into the existing Burger Court database. This further
expanded Burger Court database, like all of the others, will be archived on the
World Wide Web.
