Many areas of machine learning (ML) currently rely on heuristic algorithms with
no performance guarantees, and, in fact, the underlying problems are
computationally intractable. The proposed project will lead to new machine
learning algorithms with provable guarantees. The PIs will leverage theoretical
ideas from average case analysis, semi-random models, approximation, solution
stability, and approximate linear algebra, and develop new tools and techniques.
Benefits from this endeavor will occur across fields. Theoretical computer
science will benefit by gaining new problems and research agendas, and further
development of algorithmic and mathematical tools. Machine learning will benefit
by gaining new models (hopefully, more tractable than the ones currently in
use), new modes of thinking, and new algorithms. The task of proving bounds on
algorithms will provide insight into when they do or do not work, as well as
suggest modifications to existing heuristics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project
will involve training a new generation of graduate students and postdocs who
will be fluent both in theoretical algorithms and machine learning. The PIs
gained experience in delivering this kind of training and mentoring during the
past couple of years and will continue this, including working with the
undergraduate students. The PIs will disseminate the ideas of this project by
lecturing, teaching, and creating new course materials, including videos. One
specialized workshop will also be organized, devoted to the topics of study.
Open-source software implementation will be released based upon any new learning
algorithms that are discovered.
