This grant provides funds to the History of Science Society (HSS), the
Philosophy of Science Association (PSA), the Social Studies of Science Society
(4S), and the Society for History of Technology (SHOT) to provide travel awards
to graduate students independent scholars to attend the annual meetings of the
societies in 1994. Three of these societies (HSS, PSA, and 4S) will meet
together in New Orleans October 13-16. SHOT meets in Lowell Massachusetts
October 6-9, 1994. These travel grants are essential for the future of these new
scholars in the STS disciplines. They will be able to present their research
findings to their colleagues within the disciplines, receive constructive
criticism and learn of new approaches and new areas of interest. These meetings
begin the process of introduction of these scholars to their peers. The criteria
for selection include active participation in the organized sessions of the
meetings. Decisions are made by a committee within each society. This award will
provide support for at least 80 graduate students and unaffiliated scholars to
participate in these professional meetings.
