9418306 Butler This award will partially support travel and communications
expenses for Dr. Mark J. Butler of the Department of Biological Sciences at Old
Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia, to enable him to make a six month stay
at the New Zealand Oceanographic Institute in Wellington, New Zealand to conduct
cooperative research with Dr. Alistair MacDiarmid. The research will focus on
field and laboratory experimentation to test hypotheses concerning recruitment
and sustainable resource use of spiny or rock lobsters in the coastal waters of
New Zealand and the Florida Keys. The research will initiate investigations of
the potential factors limiting recruitment of the common New Zealand spiny
lobster and compare results with similar studies of the Caribbean lobster. The
study will also consider the effects of male size on mating success and
fertilization rates in populations of spiny lobsters that differ in size due to
heavy exploitation. This proposal is part of a joint request for activity under
the U.S.-New Zealand Cooperative Science Program. The reciprocal visit to the
United States by Dr. MacDiarmid will occur in early 1996 and is to be supported
through the New Zealand Ministry of Research, Science and Technology.
