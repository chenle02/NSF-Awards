Professor Leary will continue research on geometric group theory, and geometric
topology, both alone and in collaboration. In particular, he will construct
infinite groups having strong fixed point properties. This is expected to have
application to the study of Kropholler's hierarchy of groups. He will also study
a functor that he has developed (from simplicial complexes to locally CAT(0)
cubical complexes) that preserves homology. This work should have applications
to topology, K-theory and group theory. He will also classify all spaces that
can be built by gluing polygons in a certain way that have the `largest
possible' groups of symmetries.

A group is the mathematician's abstraction of the notion of symmetry: groups
measure symmetry in the same way that numbers measure quantity. There are
fascinating connections between group theory and geometry. Professor Leary aims
to construct groups with surprising combinations of properties, which should
lead to new results and insights within both geometry and group theory. He will
also classify a family of geometrical objects which generalize the platonic
solids, five symmetrical shapes that have been studied for at least four
thousand years.
