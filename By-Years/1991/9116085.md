An integrated device capable of performing edge and motion detection in real
time for image processing system is to be built. The device is based on the
"silicon retina" of Carver Mead, but adds optical outputs, allowing the
preprocessed images to be fed directly to further optical parallel processing
stages. These "retinas" are VLSI (very large scale integration) implementations
of neural networks which duplicate many of the functions of the vertebrate
retina. The technology used here, the addition of ferroelectric liquid crystal
light modulators to standard CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor)
VLSI, can utilize the full repertoire of VLSI electronic functionality including
photodetection, and can be applied to individual die, making for rapid research
iterations and the economical application to custom products. its 104Hz readout
rate is accomplished with minimal power dissipation, and is more than fast
enough for neural image processing. The work focuses on developing techniques
for isolating read light from write light in these completely optically
interconnected devices, and on developing retinal binocular images. The device
should have many commercial applications for example, in the fields of optical
inspection and robotics.
