Introduction to Human Geography, like most freshman-level survey courses in the
social sciences, is typically taught using the traditional model of instructor
as lecturer and student as note-taker. The proposed series of one-week summer
workshops engage faculty who teach introductory human geography courses in a
more student-centered model of learning using hands-on materials that challenge
students to collect, manipulate, analyze, and present geographic information.
The workshop will be organized around 13 activities from "Human Geography in
Action," a recently published human geography workbook (New York, Wiley, 1997).
Each freestanding activity demonstrates a basic concept in human geography
including: scale, region, diffusion, spatial interaction, space-time prisms,
location theory, age-sex pyramids, development, urban hierarchy, urban land use,
residential segregation, nations and states, and environmental change. Seven of
the activities are computerized projects on CD-ROM. Each session participant
will be expected to complete several of the activities, and brainstorm topics
and methods for future activities. These workshops will serve as the basis for
disseminating a more innovative approach to human geography, one in which
students literally do geography as they learn geography.
