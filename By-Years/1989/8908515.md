Distributed systems present challenging problems of maintaining consistency of
distributed data in the presence of faults. These problems are currently solved
using agreement protocols that require many messages to be exchanged between
processors with adverse effects on system performance. This project will
investigate a different approach to the design of fault-tolerant distributed
systems that avoids this message exchange, resulting in systems that are
substantially more efficient. The approach is based on broadcast communication
over a local area network, such as the Ethernet, and on two novel protocols, the
Trans and Total protocols. Preliminary analyses indicate at least a 10-fold
improvement over existing methods of reaching agreement.
