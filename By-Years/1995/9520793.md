Antonovics 9520793 To evaluate the appropriateness of using a kin selectionist
framework to explain worker behavior, the origin(s) of sex ratio differences
between colonies of the ant, Leptothorax curvispinosus, will be elucidated.
Oviposition sex ratios will be determined by flow cytometry (a novel application
of this technology) and compared with the following year's adult sex ratios. A
marked disparity between oviposition and adult sex ratios would suggest that
workers may indeed manipulate brood sex ratios to their inclusive fitness
benefit; possible mechanisms will be investigated experimentally. The possible
role of historical distorter invasion will be explored through computer
simulation and genetic models. Initial simulations of this "distorter invasion
hypothesis" suggest an interpretation of eusociality that differs significantly
from the kin selectionist explanation, in essence arguing that invasion creates
predictable, oscillating mate limitations, and that worker behavior is an
adaptive response under such circumstances.
