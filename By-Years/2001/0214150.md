This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project will describe a new way
to use specially designed low loss dielectric ribbons (with attenuation as much
as 100 times less than that of a conventional circular polymer rod at Ka band),
made with either alumina, silicon, InP or GaAs as fundamental building blocks
for electronic integrated circuits or interconnects. The absence of metallic
structures in the ribbon approach provides the possibility of high power
carrying capability.

This technology offers the possibility of directly incorporating active devices
with a low-loss transmission medium, provides the foundation for ultra-high-
speed integrated circuits. Major commercial markets include the automobile,
semiconductor, computer, and satellite industries.
