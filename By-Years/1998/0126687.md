Mathematical Sciences (21)

The standard undergraduate geometry courses are principally designed for pre-
service teachers and prospective research mathematicians. Such courses are
normally not of interest to students in the technical oriented fields of
engineering, computer science, and the applied mathematical sciences. This proof
of concept proposal develops course materials for an applied geometry course for
students pursuing degrees in engineering, computer science, and the applied
mathematical sciences. Also, interactive course materials that can be used in
such an introductory geometric modeling course and that can be used in the pre-
requisite calculus courses are developed.

Effective courses utilize the current skills and abilities of the students in
developing new skills and in developing an understanding of new concepts. In
geometry, the crucial abilities tend to be somewhat intuitive, as geometry is
similar to a language. The current generations of students tend to have an
underdeveloped geometric intuition, possibly because they have played more with
virtual reality than physical reality. However, there is a geometric intuition
in virtual reality, which is not equivalent to geometric intuition of physical
reality. In order to use their virtual geometric intuition, this project
develops materials aimed at unifying these two diverse varieties of geometric
intuition, by using both modern technology (computers and the internet) together
with the traditional tools of geometry (compass, straightedge and physical
models). In addition, the materials are interactive, as it is important to
engage the students with the material.
