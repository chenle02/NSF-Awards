The Minority Research Centers of Excellence (MRCE) program was established in FY
1987 to provide substantial resources to upgrade the research capabilities of
the strongest and most productive predominantly minority institutions. This
planning grant project lays the foundation for a plan that will increase the
institution's quality of research and research-related training. Specifically,
support for this project will permit the establishment of an MRCE advisory
committee of scientists and engineers, local leaders, and industrial
representatives who will assist the institution in evaluating its current and
future potential for performing meritorious research during the next five years.
Virginia State University will have five departments in the School of Natural
Sciences reviewed internally and externally to determine the quality of their
potential to move to a higher level of excellence. The five departments that
will be studied are: Geological Sciences, Life Sciences, Mathematics, Physics,
and Physchology. This institution has the facilities and personnel to develop a
Minority Research Center of Excellence. The Foundation has supported this
project since the proposed work can lead to the performance of meritorious
research and will increase the participation of minorities in science and
engineering.
