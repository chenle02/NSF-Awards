This project studies the computational complexity of communication problems and
quantum computing. Topics explored include: (1) complexity theories for (a)
multiparty communications, (b) probabilistic communications, (c) quantum
communications, and (d) quantum circuits; and (2) complexity questions for
algebraic decision trees. The mathematical techniques employed are drawn from
such areas as: (I) combinatorics; (ii) probability theory; and (iii) topology.
