A gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) with a mass selective detector is
to be purchased with this equipment grant. This will compliment and enhance
existing analytical capabilities within the chemical engineering department,
with specific applications to research on the combustion of chlorinated liquid
and solid fuels aimed at gaining an understanding of the formation and
destruction of intermediate products including dioxins and furans. The specific
objectives are to acquire kinetic data on PCDD/PCDFs in spouted-bed and fixed-
bed reactors in order to understand accepted formation mechanisms better; to
elucidate the role of temperature residence time, precursor partial pressure,
and particle size on rates and yields; to model these processes; and to identify
the steps and parameters that require more intensive study. The GC/MS will
greatly improve the ability to provide quantitative analyses of many samples.
This in turn will enhance the likelihood that relationships to probable
precursors can be better understood, and from that knowledge the role of certain
operation and design parameters on products of incomplete combustion in actual
incinerators can be addressed.
