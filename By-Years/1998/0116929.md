0116929 Oerther This grant funds a workshop to explore the value of applying
molecular biology tools in environmental engineering. The objectives of the
workshop include providing answers to four critical questions: (1) Can junior
faculty in the field of environmental engineering build successful and
sustainable careers by developing, implementing, and conducting research using
molecular biology tools? (2) What are the advantages and disadvantages of
biomolecular technologies, and how should technique development and
standardization proceed within the environmental engineering community? (3) How
and to what degree should the field of environmental engineering teach molecular
biology tools to students, practitioners, and regulators? (4) What are current
and anticipated examples of knowledge provided by molecular biology tools that
were previously unavailable, and what is the real value of this knowledge to the
field? ***
