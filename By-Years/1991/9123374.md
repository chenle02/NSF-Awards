Methane gas hydrates may occur wherever methane and water exist in close
proximity at low temperatures and elevated pressures. These hydrates are thought
to be widespread in both on-shore permafrost regions of the North American and
Soviet Arctic and in the shallow continental shelves of the Arctic Ocean where
sub-sea permafrost is found. Methane gas may be released to the atmosphere
because of hydrate destabilization as a result of climatic warming and changes
in sea level. With present knowledge, it is not possible to predict the timing
or the amount of methane that would be released by gas hydrate decomposition as
a result of permafrost, especially sub-sea permafrost, degradation during
interglacial periods. We proposed to modify a two-dimensional model of climate-
permafrost interaction. The model will be applied to several sites in North
America and in the Soviet Union to elevate the potential for gas hydrate and
permafrost occurrence and degradation in response to changes in climate and sea
level. This information will be used (in collaboration with USGS and Soviet
investigators) to make improved estimates of the possible fluxes of methane onto
the atmosphere as a result of hydrate and permafrost degradation.
