This project investigates the effects of salary history bans on firm practices
and investigates cultural understandings about pay. Some recent legislation has
enacted salary history bans, that is, has outlawed the practice of basing the
salary offered a job candidate on the candidate's past salary. Using interviews,
ethnography, and survey experiments, this project will document how firm
practices may have altered due to such bans and will elaborate more generally
how pay is perceived and understood. Results will identify how firm-level
practices may interact with widely shared cultural ideas to reproduce or
diminish pay differences following this policy change. These findings will
contribute to stakeholder and public understanding of important economic
patterns and how they may be ameliorated.

This research uses multiple methods, including interviews with 60 experts and
practitioners, ethnographic observation inside organizations, and a survey
experiment. The interviews will provide insight into firm-level practices, how
these practices may be changing in response to the salary history ban, and
shared understandings about pay across industries and occupations. Ethnographic
observation inside organizations will validate self-reports against practices in
the field and will document variations across roles within a given firm. The
survey experiment will be used to test hypotheses derived from fieldwork
regarding perceptions of job candidates and starting pay. By employing multiple
methods to gain insight into pay-setting, this research will contribute to the
literature on pay differences and, more broadly, the cultural ideas that
underpin market relations.
