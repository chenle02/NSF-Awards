This action funds Jessica Frances Kamhi of Boston University to conduct a
research project, entitled "Neurobiology of individual and collective behavior
in a superorganism, the weaver ant" during the summer of 2012 at James Cook
University in Townsville, Queensland, Australia. The host scientist is Simon
Robson.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to advance understanding of
the neurobiology of worker behavior and collective intelligence. Ants, as
pinnacles of social evolution in insects, are renowned for their cohesive and
complex group living, yet the extent to which selection for collective behavior
has shaped the worker brain is poorly understood, and how the structure of the
weaver ant brain underscores behavioral differentiation and cooperation has yet
to be explored. By studying both worker task performance and the synaptic
connections in sensory and integrative processing regions of the worker brain,
the research elucidates how worker brain structure in the socially advanced
weaver ant, Oecophylla smaragdina, is involved in individual and colony-level
actions.

The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-
hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science,
science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
