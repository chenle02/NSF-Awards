Mobile devices such as smartphones have changed our daily lives. With the growth
in the capabilities of smartphones as well as wearables such as "smart glasses",
the next decade promises richer capabilities in terms of augmented reality,
improved contextual sensing and more seamless computing that will integrate into
our day-to-day lives. However, vision sensing applications, which are fueled by
the improved understanding of user context, are highly resource and energy
intensive, reducing useful operation time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
will enable the design of such applications by providing a programming framework
that allows future applications to leverage cloud computation seamlessly, to
provide the user with a good quality of service for the intended application
while removing from programmers the burden of reasoning about where the
computation should happen. The project includes plans for integration of
research in education, broadening participation, and educational
outreach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
