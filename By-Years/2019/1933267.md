The 2019 Midwest Several Complex Variables Conference will take place at the
University of Michigan-Dearborn on October 11-13 2019. The conference will
showcase recent developments in several complex variables, functional analysis,
operator algebras, operator theory and related fields. The Midwest Several
Complex Variables Conference series started back in 1980's and has significant
impact in the field. It provides a unique opportunity for senior and junior
researchers to interact and initiate joint projects. The funds from the National
Sciences Foundation will cover travel expenses and accommodation for the invited
speakers, graduate students, and junior researchers without external financial
support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will bring together the leading
experts in these fields with junior researchers and graduate students. The
interaction between these groups will be promoted by an additional workshop-
style problem session on the second day. The conference will particularly
benefit the growing number of junior researchers and graduate students in these
fields at Midwestern and East Coast universities. Conference website:
