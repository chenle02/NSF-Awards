This is a multifaceted study of a fossil fauna comprising about 200 species of
marine bivalve mollusks that occupied southern Florida prior to the recent ice
age and that suffered heavy extinction during the ice age. This fauna is
spectacularly preserved in shell beds exposed by quarrying at Sarasota. PI is
mapping the shell beds over a large area. Using information about habitats of
surviving species and the physical nature of the shell beds, PI has concluded
that the beds represent a complex of barrier island (or spit) and lagoonal
environments. Further work will allow testing of hypotheses as to how the
unusual vertical sequence of shell beds developed. The fauna is the tropical
component of a large marine fauna that occupied the entire East and Gulf coasts
of the U.S. Components of the fauna from northern Florida to Virginia are well
studied. Completing the picture by studying the tropical component will enable
me to investigate geographic patterns of extinction and migration during the ice
age. To this end, PI will complete a species- level taxonomic study of the south
Florida fauna, using general museum collections, his own collections, and type
specimens--and employing morphometrics where appropriate. The precise age
traditionally assigned to the fauna has recently been questioned. PI will
attempt to resolve the issue using radiometric dating of fossil corals and
biostratigraphy based on mollusks and microfossils.
