The purpose of this research is to examine the atomic structure, growth
mechanisms, and kinetics of precipitate interfaces in metal alloys for
comparison with theoretical models that have been developed to describe
interfacial structure and growth kinetics of interphase boundaries. High
resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) is used to determine the
three-dimensional atomic structure of precipitate plates in thin foil specimens
both parallel and perpendicular to the habit plane. Atomic mechanisms and
kinetics of interface growth are determined by in situ hot stage HRTEM
experiments and compared to hot stage experiments on thicker specimens in a high
voltage TEM where the role of surface effects on the transformation are
minimized. Resulting kinetic measurements are compared with kinetic models of
precipitate growth. Three different types of alloy systems are selected for the
studies. %%% The knowledge generated in this program is fundamental to the
understanding of the properties of interphase boundaries in solids. This
understanding can be applied to tailoring the properties of technologically
useful materials.
