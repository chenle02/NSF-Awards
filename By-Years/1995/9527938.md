9527938 MAYDEN The sturgeon family of bony fish (Acipenseridae) includes several
species of commercial value, long sought after by humans of many cultures.
Nearly all of these species are in need of immediate conservation measures.
Among the most imperiled are sturgeon species in the subfamily Scaphirhynchinae,
genera Scaphirhynchus and Pseudoscaphirhynchus. The subfamily is endemic to
North America and Central Asia. Conservation efforts are hampered by an
inadequate knowledge of the taxonomy, systematics and ecology of these fish, in
particular by the uncertainty of species boundaries and the likelihood that
undescribed species are present. This proposal is an international partnership
among scientists of the United States, Russia and Uzbekistan. Principal
investigators Mayden and Birstein, with their colleagues, will examine
morphological characteristics of sturgeon in the subfamily Scaphirhynchinae, and
use these characters to evaluate, and revise where necessary, the taxonomy and
systematics of these fish. The revised taxonomy will then more effectively
inform conservation activities.
