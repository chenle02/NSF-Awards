9502530 Boulanger The objective of this research project is to develop a
fundamental framework for understanding and describing the behavior of
"liquefiable" fine-grained soils subjected to cyclic and monotonic undrained
loading -- a necessary step in the development of reliable design methodologies
for assessing liquefaction potential of soils. The term "liquefiable" is used to
denote fine-grained soils that would be considered susceptible to severe
strength loss during earthquake loading. The primary task towards achieving this
objective is a comprehensive laboratory study of select low-plasticity silts and
clays over the wide range of conditions necessary to establish a fundamental
framework. The project includes monotonic loading, cyclic loading, post-cyclic
monotonic loading, and consolidation tests over a wide range of confining
stresses and void ratios to investigate the interrelationships between the
undrained loading behavior and the conditions of initial state, quasi-steady
state, and steady state. It also includes an investigation of the influence of
sample preparation method, stress history, and loading path (i.e., triaxial
versus torsional shear) over a wide range of void ratios and confining stresses
The results of this study will fill a vital gap in the understanding of the
behavior of fine-grained soils during earthquake loading, and thereby assist in
the development of engineering procedures for assessing potential earthquake
hazards related to the earthquake loading response of fine-grained soils.
EDUCATION PLAN The objective of the education plan is to equip civil engineering
students with a sound philosophy of engineering, a rigorous grounding in
engineering basics and fundamentals, and an appreciation of the complementary
roles of theory and judgment. The education plan covers several details which
will enhance the basic strength of the existing curriculum, and thereby
contribute to an inspiring, well-rounded education in civil and environmental
engineering. It includes the following items: In design courses, have a
practicing professional assist in setting up the design project, and then
discuss alternative designs at the end of the course; select these and other new
course projects to illustrate the complementary roles of fundamental theory and
engineering judgment in the practice of civil and environmental engineering;
develop an instructional video on drilling and sampling procedures for site
characterization; introduce computer- based data-acquisition systems into the
undergraduate laboratory curriculum; involve undergraduates in research projects
via summer employment and independent research electives; and introduce results
from recent research in appropriate courses ***
