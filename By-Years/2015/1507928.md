The goal of the proposed research is to devise rigorous mathematical techniques
that utilize large databases obtained by simulations to develop predictive
models of turbulent flow. Even though the proposal is focused on turbulence, the
tools to be developed will be of general applicability for data-driven modeling
in other areas of science and engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Predictive
models have not yet taken full advantage of the massive amounts of data being
generated by the fluids community. New strategies are needed to extract
information and modeling knowledge from data. Adjoint-driven inverse problems
will be invoked to extract relevant modeling information from data. An important
aspect of this approach is that the data is processed in the context in which it
is needed for prediction. Domain-specific machine learning techniques will be
used to convert information to modeling knowledge. In essence, the inverse
solution infers functional deficiencies in the model and machine learning is
used to reconstruct the missing functional form. The co-PIs plan to investigate
how to identify and formulate a properly-posed data-driven-turbulence-modeling
problem, the implications that these approaches have in more general data-driven
computational physics applications, and the most effective ways to use machine
learning in a predictive physics setting. Applications to be explored include
transition to turbulence, thermal transport, and near-wall turbulent stress
closures. The proposed work is expected to result in improved closure models for
Reynolds-Averaged as well as hybrid Reynolds-Averaged/Large Eddy simulations.
While the focus of the proposed work is on turbulent flow applications, several
aspects of the formulation and tools will be of more general value to the field
of data-driven physical modeling. Educational activities that would integrate
machine learning into fluid dynamics courses are proposed. Tools and
technologies will be shared with the community and the industry
