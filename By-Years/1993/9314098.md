9314098 Pukkila It is known that during meiosis, homologous chromosomes pair and
then synapse in association with the synaptonemal complex (SC). The source of
specificity for homologous pairing is not understood. It has not been possible
to obtain direct evidence for DNA DNA interactions that could mediate homologous
pairing in any system, although such interactions remain an attractive
possibility to provide the required specificity. %%% We have discovered that
prior to meiosis, a genome wide homology search occurs in C. cinereus that
results in the methylation of duplicated sequences. We propose to ask if the
same genes control the homology searches that result in MIP (methylation induced
premeiotically) and the homology searches that result in meiotic pairing. We
will monitor the occurence of MIP in vegetative dikaryotic cells from wild type
and from three meiotic mutants in which chromosome synapsis is defective. If we
can demonstrate an association between a MIP defect and pairing defect, we would
have a powerful and unique assay to identify genes required for homology
recognition, which should permit an understanding of the mechanisms underlying
meiotic chromosome pairing. ***
