9413872 Shlomo The atomic nucleus is a many-body system of strongly interacting
constituents bound together by the strongest forces known in nature. We will
address unsolved problems in the study of nuclei, considering the effects of
short and long range correlations on matter, energy and momentum density
distributions of the constituents of nuclei. We will study important and
fascinating phenomena associated with the motions of single nucleons, the
correlated motions of several nucleons and the collective motions of many
nucleons. Of particular interest are the areas of excitation and decay of giant
resonances, large amplitude motion and dissipation and dynamic and decay of hot
nuclei. For this purpose we will develop the formalism and the numerical
techniques for calculating the nuclear spectral function, nuclear response
function and the nuclear level density. ***
