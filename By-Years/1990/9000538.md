This award supports the research in Lie groups and Lie algebras of Professor
Ronald Irving of the University of Washington. Dr. Irving's project is to study
certain algebraic topics underlying recent work in the representation theory of
complex semisimple Lie algebras and real reductive Lie groups. Many important
representations in Lie theory have finite length and lie in categories of finite
length modules. These categories carry a great deal of additional algebraic
structure, such as translation functors or a filtered character theory.
Professor Irving will study these features and their consequences in greater
detail. Any time there are operations that may be undone as well as done, there
is a group present. Groups were first studied systematically in the last
century, and when the Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie showed that group
theory applied in a very natural way to the study of differential equations, the
strength and significance of group theory became recognized by all
mathematicians. The work supported here is a modern continuation of that first
pioneering work of Lie.
