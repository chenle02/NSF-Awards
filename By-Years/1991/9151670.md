We have developed a new and innovative plant biology course for non-science
majors that will challenge our students to develop and use a scientific approach
to problem solving. Our laboratories are designed to teach the process of
science by having students collect, organize, and interpret quantitative data.
Labs will also require students to formulate hypotheses and design experiments.
By using this approach, we hope to increase scientific literacy by giving our
students skills to critically examine scientific data and to evaluate current
scientific issues. Improvements to this course will significantly affect
undergraduate education at the University of Maryland.
