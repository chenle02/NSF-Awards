9406090 Belmonte This award is under the International Junior Investigator and
Postdoctoral Fellows Program, which enables U.S. scientists and engineers to
conduct three to twelve months of research abroad at research centers of proven
excellence. The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and
the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental
conditions abroad. This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research
visit by Dr. Andrew L. Belmonte to work with Dr. Jorge R. Tredicce at the
Institut NonLineaire de Nice. Dr. Belmonte proposes to study the motion of
spiral wave defects, developing methods to attract and hold them by suppression
of chemical reactivity in controlled regions, and measuring the strength of this
"pinning." He also proposes to explore the creation and disruption of these
defects, and their perturbation by complex boundary conditions and anisotropic
or inhomogeneous media. The unpinning or disruption of such spiral defects would
have important implications for the dynamics of ventricular fibrillation in the
heart (leading to sudden death), which is thought to be caused by pinned spiral
waves of electrical excitation in the muscle. ***
