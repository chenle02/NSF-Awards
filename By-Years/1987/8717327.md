State and Dynamic laboratory tests of structural specimens are conducted to
study the behavior of reinforced concrete is biaxial bending generated by
combined building torsion and translation during earthquakes. The specimens are
designed to permit the dynamic interaction to occur, yet remain independent of
the material interaction. Different combinations of torsional/translational
frequencies, beam flexural strength, and frequency content of base motion, etc.
are considered in the dynamic tests. The research is expected to contribute to
the development of numerical models for torsional-translational response and
reliable seismic design procedures.
