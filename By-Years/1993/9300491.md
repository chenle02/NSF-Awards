This project examines the applicability of a newly developed bio- optical
instrument (pump and probe fluorometer) that may be able to measure the "health"
of oceanic phytoplankton. In theory, this instrument provides a means for non-
destructive measurement of phytoplankton photosynthesis without recourse to
calibration against standard biological measurements. The technique, if
successfully proven, will be able to establish the nutrient status of
phytoplankton from measurements of photosynthetic efficiency. Present studies
indicate that photosynthetic efficiency of phytoplankton is independent of
temperature and irradiance under nutrient replete conditions, but decreases
under nutrient limitation. This project is designed to thoroughly test the
instrument under controlled laboratory conditions using three different species
of phytoplankton whose growth rates are controlled by limiting nitrate,
phosphate, silicate, and iron. Such information is crucial to the development of
a quantitative understanding of environmental regulation of primary productivity
in the sea.
