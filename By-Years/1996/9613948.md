Abstract CTS-9613948 John Lumley et al Cornell University A wavelet
representation of incompressible turbulent flows using divergence-free vector
wavelets will be developed. Better results than Fourier representations are
expected because the coherent structures in turbulent flows have a limited
spatial extend similar to wavelet. The Galerkin projection of the Navier-Stokes
equations on a divergence-free vector wavelet orthogonal basis, and its
incorporation and comparison to the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD)
approach, will be also investigated. Comparisons to detailed two-dimensional
Particle Image Velocimetry measurements in air performed at NASA Langley
Research Center will be performed in order to evaluate the capabilities and
efficiency of the wavelet decomposition. The research work will be performed in
collaboration with Oxford University in UK and Clarkson University. If
successful, the wavelet representation will offer a fundamentally new way to
describe and analyze non-uniform flows such as large turbulent structures.
