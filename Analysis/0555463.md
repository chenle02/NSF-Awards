Abstract for proposal DMS-0555463:

This project investigates aspects of low dimensional dynamical systems. The
study of such transformations, especially area preserving ones, has a long
history going back to Poincare and G. D. Birkhoff. In particular the project
considers smooth group actions on surfaces and the relation between the
algebraic properties of the group and the dynamics the action exhibits. A
related question addressed by this proposal is the question of the existence of
global fixed points for two-dimensional dynamical systems and how this relates
to the algebraic properties of the system.

This project investigates aspects of dynamical systems on surfaces. There are
numerous applications of results in this area to broader fields of science,
especially to classical mechanics and more modern chaos theory. The novelty of
the proposed research is that it addresses the relationship between the
algebraic nature of dynamical systems called ``group actions'' and the geometric
or topological behavior they exhibit. Anticipated results from this proposal
will advance our knowledge of dynamical systems and will explore new
relationships between dynamics and algebra.
