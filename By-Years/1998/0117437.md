ABSTRACT

OCE-0117437

A researcher from Cornell University plans to measure the hafnium (Hf) isotopic
composition (176Hf/177Hf) and eHf values (isotopic composition of Hf normalized
to CHUR, a chondrite with a 176Hf/177Hf ratio of 0.282772) of seawater samples
recovered from both the Atlantic (North Atlantic Deep Water, Arctic Intermediate
Water, Mediterranean Outflow Water and modified Antarctic Intermediate and Deep
Water) and Pacific Ocean (Equatorial Water, Arctic Intermediate Water, North
Central Pacific Water and Ocean Common Water). In addition, the PI will analyze
hydrothermal fluids from 9'N on the East Pacific Rise and metalliferous
sediments collected from the Nazca Plate. The goal of these measurements is to
provide new insights into the geochemistry of this element and ascertain that
ferromanganese crusts indeed record the composition of Hf in seawater. If
ferromanganese crust record seawater Hf concentrations, then the PI contends
that the isotopic composition of Hf can be used as a paleo indicator of
weathering intensity.
