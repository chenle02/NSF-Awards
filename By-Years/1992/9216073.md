Professor Stuart Rice is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to perform studies of elementary processes in
chemical dynamics for the purpose of (i) improving the theory of laser control
of product selectivity in a chemical reaction, and (ii) improving the theory of
unimolecular reaction rates. Existing theories of laser control of the evolution
of a quantum system will be extended to the case of nonadiabatic reactions, and
the theory will be improved by incorporation of a feedback mechanism that shapes
the optimal laser field without precise knowledge of all of the molecular
parameters in the system Hamiltonian. The description of unimolecular reaction
rates based on modern nonlinear mechanics will be improved by extension of the
mapping methods which provide an exact representation of the dynamics of systems
with two degrees of freedom to systems with many degrees of freedom. The results
will be used to study several types of unimolecular fragmentation and
isomerization reactions. A quantum version of the classical theory of
unimolecular reaction rates will also be developed. %%% The achievement of
selective control of product formation in a reaction has been sought
persistently throughout the evolution of chemistry. To date, such control has
only been accomplished at the macroscopic level, by the manipulation of external
factors such as temperature, pressure, solvent character, etc. With the advent
of the tunable laser, it was hoped that product selectivity could be controlled
at the microscopic level, and that individual bonds within a molecule could be
selectively broken. It was very quickly found that energy absorbed by a molecule
was not easily localized in individual bonds, but preferred to redistribute
throughout the molecule. More recently, however, the concept of laser selective
chemistry has had a rebirth, and theories developed by Rice and others have
shown that energy could be localized by carefully choosing a complex sequence of
laser pulses of prescribed shapes. If this theory can be put to practice
experimentally, it may still be possible to realize the goal of microscopic
selective control of chemical reactions.
