Funds are requested for the purchase of a stand-alone molecular modeling system
to be shared by nine scientists for investigating a range of problems in
macromolecular structure. The molecular systems to be investigated include
proteins, nucleic acids, polysaccharides and lipids. For all of these, the
modeling studies are coupled to experimental investigations that use a variety
of spectroscopic and biochemical methods. In addition to serving as a research
tool, the system will be used for the development of new modeling software for
very large nucleic acids and for lipids. It will also serve as the principal
resource for a graduate course in molecular modeling.
