DMI-9505282 Lee A critical deficiency exists in current dielectric materials
that prevents their use in the next generation of semiconductor devices.
Replacing conventional inorganic dielectrics with organic polymers is one of the
more promising approaches to circumventing this problem. Organic materials offer
lower dielectric constants, better planarization, improved dimensional
stability, and require fewer manufacturing steps to process than their inorganic
counterparts. However, current organic polymer dielectrics such as polyimides
are not suitable as interlevel dielectrics for IC applications. Thus new organic
polymers with the right combinations of properties are required. We are
proposing to continue the development of a new class of dielectrics based on
polyquinolines. Polyquinolines do not have the same deficiencies that plague
polyimides and polyquinoines are ideally suited to serve as dielectric materials
due in part to their inherently low dielectric constants, low moisture uptakes,
and unparalleled thermal stabilities. Unfortunately, the glass transition
temperatures (<280 C) of most polyquinoline materials are too low for IC
applications. In Phase I we sought and achieved the preparation of a useful
polyquinoline derivative with a Tg above 300 C. In this Phase II program, we are
proposing to continue the development of these materials and prepare
polyquinoline dielectrics with T,'s2350 C. The new polymers developed in this
program will be subjected to numerous evaluations to qualify them as intermetal
dielectric materials. The final confirmation involves the preparation and
electrical evaluations of IC test structures made from these materials. The
materials polymers that will be developed in this program are being designed to
serve as intermetal dielectrics in IC applications. However, the anticipated
advantages that they will offer are likely to make them attractive in many
dielectric uses including IC passivation and various insulating layers for
liquid crystalline displa y and multichip module applications.
