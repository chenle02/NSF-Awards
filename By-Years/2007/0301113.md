This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial Biology for
FY2003. The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of
protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are
not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides
opportunities for recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in
microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of
established scientists, and to broaden their scientific horizons beyond the
research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These
fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their
research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves
of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign
locations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research and training plan is entitled
"Linking community composition and gene expression of bacterial cells to rates
of carbon and nutrient cycling in marsh sediments with changing salinity." This
research explores bacterial dynamics in marsh sediments as a function of
fluctuating salinity. rRNA analysis is being used to analyze community
composition and identification of dominant taxa. Concurrently, mRNA analysis is
used to determine the expression of key functional genes. This work will link
interactions between individual microbial populations to sediment carbon dioxide
production and nutrient retention.&lt;br/&gt;
