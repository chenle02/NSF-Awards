This research examines in detail a variety of scientific questions where there
is a natural expression of the phenomena or of the search for their explanation
in terms of a sequential process. Such problems arise in the study of the human
genome, particularly in connection with possible sequencing errors which may be
present in the various copies. There are also many examples in quality control
problems, particularly in case of serial dependence. The common mathematical
thread in these particular examples is the derivation of an accurate solution
from a combination of several sources of information each of which may be
subject to noise.
