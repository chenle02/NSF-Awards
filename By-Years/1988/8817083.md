8817083 CASSIDY This award supports the Antarctic Search for Meteorites (ANSMET)
program. The goal of the project has been to locate and collect meteorites in
Antarctica, and return them for curation and distribution to researchers. A
second goal has been to understand how the meteorite concentrations are related
to ice-sheet dynamics. The ANSMET collection includes many meteorites of
previously unknown types and varieties; continued collection is expected to
provide many more such specimens, including new lunar samples and others of
possible martian origin.
