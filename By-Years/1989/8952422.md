Macalester will develop a multi-purpose computer laboratory for the geological
sciences. The laboratory would be configured with a network of MacIntosh II
computers to allow for interaction between the instructor and the students. The
laboratory will be used in four fundamental areas: quantitative and symbolic
modelling and simulation of geologic processes; analysis and interpretation of
geologic data; student development of expert systems; as a link with the image
processing centers and other computer facilities on campus. Laboratory
exercises, experiments, and simulations will be developed for use in courses
ranging from the introductory level to courses designated only for upper
division geology majors. The laboratory will provide the introductory students
with the tools necessary to visualize and understand even the complex geologic
processes and encourage them to continue to explore courses in geology. Also,
early and continued use of the laboratory will help students develop the
quantitative and analytical skills required of geologists. The college is
matching the award with an equal amount of funds.
