The objective of this project is to investigate the feasibility of a new
automated design approach based on using a lattice and complementary energy
method to predict the structural behavior and to quantify the design
sensitivities. The benefits to be realized are a drastic reduction in computer
resources for sensitivity analysis and the optimization of larger and more
complex structures. The final benefit will be to stimulate broader use of
automated design technology.
