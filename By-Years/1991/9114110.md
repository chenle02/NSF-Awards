The revised project scope is for a 12-month investigation of the SYSTEM
performance utilizing a WM processor. In particular, the investigation is to
examine "two potential bottlenecks of WM systems, namely memory bandwidth and
operating system overhead-- especially context switching". Because superscalar
and superpipelined processors are memory "bandwidth hungry" (in the case of the
WM processor up to 11 memory references can be generated per processor
cycle)--there is a need to examine the memory system required to support such a
processor. An instruction cache can only eliminate one of these references,
while for vector strides other than one a data cache may actually REDUCE the
effective bandwidth. Due to the large amount of internal state which an
implementation of the WM processor might have (greater than 700 bytes)--the cost
of a context switch becomes very high as all of this context must be saved
(typically off-chip as most of the on-chip real-estate is filled with registers,
cache,...). The investigators will explore several design alternatives to
address each of these areas in order to determine if it is feasible to build a
high-performance SYSTEM utilizing a WM processor.
