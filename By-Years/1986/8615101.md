The University of Minnesota has a supercomputing center used by several local
researchers, and accessed by remote researchers through ARPANET. However,
because ARPANET is not available to many remote researchers, they are unable to
access the center, and the local and remote researchers are unable to
communicate and collaborate electronically. These problems can be overcome by
connecting the University to the National Science Foundation Network (NSFnet)
through MIDnet, a regional network serving nine midwestern states with medium
speed (56,000 bits per second) communication lines. This funds only a portion of
the system proposed by the University of Minnesota, and is consistent with NSF's
policy regarding connection to existing regional networks. The communications
line to an existing MIDnet node will be provided separately by MIDnet.
