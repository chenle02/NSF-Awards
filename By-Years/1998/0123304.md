AST-0123304&lt;br/&gt;Graham, James R.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The solar
neighborhood within 50 parsecs will be examined for spectral type L and T dwarf
companions using the adaptive optics system at the Advanced Electro-Optical
System telescope on Haleakela, Maui Hawaii. Late-type binaries of low magnitude
contrast will be examined to search for these companions. So few of these stars
are known to exist today using classical techniques of observation, that
discovery of new ones, which may result from the application of adaptive optics,
will have a profound effect on our understanding of these objects.
