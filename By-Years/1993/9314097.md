9314097 Ting The behavior of the atmosphere in midlatitudes is strongly
influenced the sea surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific, particularly
during the periods of anomalous sea surface warming known as El Nino. The
purpose of this research project to understand what mechanisms are at work
during these periods which act to organize the higher frequency atmospheric
motions, particularly the role of the time mean flow. A dry primitive equation
model, derived from a full general circulation model, will be used for this
study. An idealized tropical heating anomaly, representing the tropical signal
during an El Nino event, will be imposed on the time mean climatology.
Sensitivity of the extratropical response will be tested by varying the location
of the tropical heating anomaly and by changing the time mean basic states to
which the anomaly is applied. The results should provide insights into the what
determines the organization of the transients. This research may provide a basis
for improving weather forecasting during El Nino events. ***
