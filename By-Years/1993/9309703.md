This research investigates how cooperating agents in real-world domains can
select the most useful information to communicate to others. The research
focuses on communication between agents in distributed systems performing
complex, problem-solving tasks. Here, only partial knowledge of other agents is
available, and agents have limited computational resources for communication. To
address these constraints, the researchers will examine how an agent's knowledge
of its own use of information can indicate the value of that information to
other agents. Heuristics will be developed to evaluate the usefulness of a given
piece of information based on how that information is used or inferred as an
agent performs its problem-solving task. These heuristics will be integrated
into the communication system for AUV's that is being developed at the
University of New Hampshire. The research will contribute to the ability of
AUV's to work together, as well as providing insights into how other distributed
systems and natural language interfaces can select useful information to
communicate.//
