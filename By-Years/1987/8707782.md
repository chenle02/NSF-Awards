The fundamentals of plasma etching are not understood in general, as so many
different processes occur simultaneously, including substantial electrical
interactions. This study will use powerful diagnostics resources (spectroscopy
of emission, fluorescence, optogalvanic methods) to elucidate the role of
negative charges, of the rf discharge geometry and of the operating variables.
With such knowledge, it will become practical to devise predictive, quantitative
methods for use in the development of new plasma processes.
