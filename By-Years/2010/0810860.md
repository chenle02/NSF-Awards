Abstract 0811860&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Claflin University is acquiring a powder
x-ray diffractometer and a UV-Vis spectrophotometer for integrating exploration
and research-based instructions into the chemistry curriculum and enhancement of
undergraduate research as a means to increase the number and improve the
training of undergraduate students in chemistry. The project is enhancing the
analytical instrumentation facilities at Claflin University?s chemistry
laboratories, providing increased and improved opportunities for students to
have an understanding and appreciation of current developments in research and
related technologies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs are working to establish and
maintain a strong research infrastructure and to incorporate inquiry-based
approaches to upper level chemistry laboratories, which include physical
chemistry, analytical chemistry, instrumental analysis and organic chemistry.
This effort also targets meet the ACS certification sustainability requirements
(the program is already ACS certified). The addition of the powder x-ray
diffractometer and the UV-Vis spectrophotometer also work to complete our
optical spectrophotometers and solid state analysis capabilities, and to assist
us in keeping pace with the advances in the field.&lt;br/&gt;
