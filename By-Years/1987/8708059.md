The trend towards automation in manufacturing is expanding fast. Machine
interfaces, intelligent controls, CAD (computer aided design) packages and
computer aided process planning are increasing. There is a greater demand for an
automatic generation of assembly sequence to match and link these growing areas.
Process planning requires the expertise of experienced process engineers. These
engineers are gradually reaching retirement age and young engineers who have not
yet gained the experience are bombarded by the demands of new technology. The
automatic generation of assembly sequence involves (a) the extraction of
constructive solid geometry and boundary representation, (b) determination of
the type of each assembly step, (c) the type of tools required, (d) the size of
each tool and its working envelope, and (e) check for collision, obstruction and
clearance during assembly. Once the assembly steps are determined, a cost
optimization approach can be used to generate possible assembly sequences. The
engineer can then determine, according to his/her local assembly environment, an
optimal assembly sequence. Heuris algorithms will be generated for these
decision processes. The result is an expert support system which enables the
fast transfer of 3-D CAD (computer aided design) parts and assembly data into a
set of possible assembly sequences to facilitate the process engineer to speed
up the implementation of automated assembly systems.
