Many industries are involved in areas of research, design, and manufacturing
that necessitate increasing their application of advanced computer techniques.
The expansion of high technology fields such as aviation, micro-electronics, and
energy-related industries make the assurance of system safety and reliability
imperative to the future growth and success of these industries. Risk
assessments are now performed at many stages in the design and operation of
complex systems to assure reliable operation and also to reduce design and
maintenance costs. The application of powerful integrated computer systems for
reliability analysis is necessary to respond to the computational needs of
engineers in complex design situations. Fault tree and event tree analyses are
key elements in reliability studies. The accident sequences defined by the event
trees provide the analyst with criteria for system failure as well as the
context that describes the conditions under which the system is required to
perform. Reliability analyses of large systems involving many failure causes are
too complex to be analyzed without the assistance of a computer, not only to
perform the fault tree analysis, but also to organize and present the
information to the analyst. Use of list processing techniques widely used in
artificial intelligence will be investigated in evaluating reliability of large
systems represented by fault trees. Use of LISP will allow advanced techniques
in reliability calculations to be utilized to produce powerful reliability
software. These algorithms will be applicable to the evaluation of any large,
complex system and will benefit many areas of engineering system design.
