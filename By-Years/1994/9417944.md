9417944 Allmendinger This is a proposal for the first phase of a two phase
project which will culminate in the collection of a deep seismic reflection
profile across the Central Andes. The goals of Phase 1 are: 1) Organize a
Workshop on opportunities for deep seismic reflection profiling in the Central
Andes. The purpose of the workshop will be to identify and prioritize possible
reflection transects across the Central Andes and to organize the multi-
institutional scientific team which will be responsible for Phase 2; 2) Inspect
and reprocess selected industry reflection data, including extended correlation
of VIBROSEIS data, to evaluate the reflection data quality potential along the
high priority routes in the field area; 3) Scouting of routes and logistics
along the high priority transects. Phase 1 will provide the necessary groundwork
for Phase 2, the acquisition of new deep seismic data. ***
