Dr. Jennie E. Burnet of the University of Louisville will undertake research on
rescuer behavior, community-level resistance to violence, and rescuer motivation
during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda. The study's central question is: how and why
do some people put themselves at great risk of harm in order to rescue others
during communal violence? The study will compare rescuer behavior among
different ethnic and religious groups in that country to identify the intrinsic
factors (such as character, identity, religious belief, and religious practice)
and extrinsic factors (such as geography, proximity to victims, opportunity, and
community structure) that make rescuer behavior possible. The researchers will
investigate the potential impact of social network characteristics on resistance
to genocide and will attempt to identify aspects of faith, practice, leadership,
or community structure that led to community-level resistance to genocide in
certain locales. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using social science research methods,
the project will gather life history narratives, key informant interviews,
testimony about the genocide, and social network data from more than 250
Rwandans in eight communities in Rwanda. A range of actors, including publicly
recognized rescuers, bystanders, perpetrators, and victims will be
interviewed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will contribute to the
scientific understanding of rescuer behavior, resistance to communal violence,
and the impact of religion on these behaviors. It will also assist policymakers
in developing interventions to improve resistance to communal violence. The
project will contribute to basic understanding of the Rwandan religious
communities and the connections between Rwandan local social movements and
global religious communities. Finally, this study can offer a timely
contribution to national and international policy debates about religion and
violence.
