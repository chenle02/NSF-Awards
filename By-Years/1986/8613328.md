Two campaigns to measure transient tracers in the Atlantic Ocean (TTO/NAS and
TTO/Equatorial) were funded by NSF during the period from 1980 to 1985. A
complete data base for modelling this ocean basin would include a South Atlantic
Study to: 1.Determine CO2 transports and their influence on world climate,
2.Constrain models of major ocean currents in this area, and 3.Confirm an
observed 5-fold increase in the addition rate of new carbon to the thermocline.
Eight components of such a study (SAVE) will be performed by investigators from
LDGO, Princeton, University of Washington, WHOI, and SIO. The track record of
these scientists is well established by successful completion of previous
studies in the Equatorial and North Atlantic. They will provide physical and
chemical expertise which will be directed toward a cooperative effort to reach
the goals of the geochemical study. This component is aimed at tracing water
mass movement in the South Atlantic using radiocarbon (C-14). About 1000 tracer
samples will be collected by LDGO and analyzed under the direction of Drs.
Ostlund and Tap at the University of Miami; Dr. Broecker at Columbia University
will interpret the data. Both principle investigators have developed a valuable
understanding of water movement through C-14 studies around the world and are
well qualified to perform this task in the SAVE project.
