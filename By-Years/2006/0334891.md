The Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Nondestructive
Evaluation (NDE) at Iowa State University was originally formed with the
objectives of pursuing research in NDE problems of interest to industrial
sponsors; increasing the base of students with expertise in NDE engineering; and
establishing a focal point for NDE technology transfer. In response to the
changing needs of society, these have been significantly extended to address new
issues of system integration and other societal measurement needs. The new goals
include enabling the integration of NDE with manufacturing and life-cycle
planning of modern structural systems, leading the international development of
advanced NDE capabilities, and applying core measurement expertise to
nonstructural material applications.
