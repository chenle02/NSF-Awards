The proposed research involves the synthesis of novel `orthogonal` solid phase
supports. These will be used for the preparation of protected oligonucleotides,
and oligonucleotide conjugates with functional groups or peptides attached at
defined positions. Related oligoribonucleotides will also be prepared. The
research will extend the types of reactions that can be used to cleave the
oligonucleotides from the solid support to include reductive and enzymatic
reactions, and extend the scope of chemistry available for conjugating protected
oligonucleotides. With this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular
Chemistry Program supports the research of Dr. Marc M. Greenberg of the
Department of Chemistry at Colorado State University. The research focuses on
developing solid phase supports from which protected fragments of DNA and RNA
can be cleaved under mild conditions, and on expanding the repertoire of
reactions available for extending the number of nucleotides linked to form the
oligomers. The work will provide useful approaches to others attempting to
synthesize oligonucleotides, and will have practical biomedical applications.
Graduate students and post-doctoral fellows will receive training in the
synthesis of small molecules and biopolymers, and get the kind of training
needed in the growing biotechnology area.
