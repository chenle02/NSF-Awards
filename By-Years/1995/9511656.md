Akins, Chana IBN-9511656 Abstract Reproductive behavior is central to the
evolutionary biology of organisms, and learning experiences have been shown to
influence various aspects of reproductive behavior. One learning mechanism that
animals use to predict biologically significant events is Pavlovian
conditioning. For example, an animal may learn, via Pavlovian conditioning, to
predict food, an encounter with a predator, or access to a potential mate. The
anticipatory conditioned responses that animals make may enable them to optimize
their interaction with a subsequently presented biologically significant event
(an unconditioned stimulus or US). Conditioned stimuli paired with US's such as
food, water, and mating opportunity come to elicit orienting, approach and
search responses. Obtaining food, water or a reproductive opportunity can be a
long complicated process involving a sequence of many different behavior
patterns. For example, under certain conditions, the mating behavior of male
quail may be similar to general search behavior, characterized by increased
locomotor activity. Other conditions may evoke more direct approach behavior to
cues that signal a mating opportunity. Dr. Akins' research will provide
information about the circumstances that evoke various conditioned responses and
about the mechanisms of those responses in reproductive behavior systems.
Furthermore, the results of this investigation will contribute to our knowledge
of the generality of learning processes in social behavior and the importance of
predictability in social situations.
