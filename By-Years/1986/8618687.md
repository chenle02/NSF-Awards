Abstract Analyses of longitudinal data bases have led to many important
sociological findings in recent years. They have provided detailed insights into
a number of social change processes that were unattainable with conventional
cross-sectional analyses of discrete data bases. These recent analyses have
helped to clarify both macro process, such as occuptional mobility, and micro
processes, such as socialization. One of the most powerful techniques currently
available for examining social processes in longitudinal data bases is event
history analysis. It entails an analysis of when a series of events (e.g.
births, job changes, or the like) occured. However, the use of event history
analysis has been impeded by very difficult data management problems, and data
storage and retrieval problems, in particular. The development of an event
history software package will make this important technique more accessible to a
large research community in the social sciences.
