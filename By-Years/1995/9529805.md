9529805 Pu Organic materials with second-order nonlinear optical properties are
potentially very useful in optical information storage and processing, and in
telecommunication. Three dimensional organic polymeric materials with similar
NLO chromophore geometry are unknown. Organic polymers have better mechanical
flexibility and processability than inorganic salts. We therefore propose to use
optically active binaphthyls to build propeller polymers. These propeller
polymers are expected to exhibit second-order NLO properties. The NLO properties
of the propeller polymers can be adjusted and optimized by systematically
modifying the conjugation length, the electron donors and acceptors of the
repeat unit. Macroscopic organization of the propeller polymers will also be
conducted by using ionic self-assembly technique. %%% This study will not only
lead to potentially useful materials, but will also provide us the fundamental
knowledge of these structurally fascinating new polymers. Potential implications
are in the broad areas of electrical and electronic materials, thin-film
devices, optical waveguides and similar active components. ***
