This award will support a two-year collaborative research project between
Professor Emil Reisler of the University of California, Los Angeles, and
Professor Kazuo Sutoh of the University of Tokyo. The objectives of the project
are to clarify the mechanism of actomyosin interactions by mapping actomyosin
binding sites in the presence and absence of ATP and to identify structural
determinants of actin's function in force generation and motility. It is
anticipated that this research will contribute to the understanding of
biological energy transduction processes. The group at the University of Tokyo
will generate a large number of Dictyostelium actin mutants, particularly in
subdomains I and II of actin, and will test these mutants for actomyosin ATPase
activity, in vitro motility, and force generation functions. The UCLA group will
carry out in depth biochemical analysis of actin mutants with altered or
impaired functional properties. In addition to the principal investigator, a
graduate student and a postdoctoral fellow will each visit Japan for an extended
period to participate in the project.
