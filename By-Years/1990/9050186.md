Creative Enterprises Abstract Creative Enterprises will develop a project to
motivate minority students to prepare for careers in science and mathematics-
based professions, especially engineering. The technical approach is to create
interactive media, both a computer program and text based materials, to
stimulate and inform the students concerning the activities of professional
engineers, academic and social life in college, course requirements for both
High School and College, etc. The combined media will use an "adventure" format
with many possible scenarios dependent upon the student's selection, plus humor,
and special effects (e.g. computer sound and animation) to sustain interest.
Examples will relate the secondary school course content with the engineer's
practices. The program will be conducted in conjunction with the California
State University, Long Beach MESA (minority outreach) and MEP (Minority
Engineering Programs), and in conjunction with Compton Middle schools (grades
6-8). A computer simulation with text accompaniments and teacher's guides will
be completed and field tested in the junior high schools. The success of this
model will lead to a range of materials for economical, nationwide dissemination
and application on many educational levels for minorities, women, disabled, and
other special and general populations.
