The objective of this research is to develop the methodologies required to
filament wind thin and thick structural elements made of thermoplastic matrix
composites. Models will be developed which simulate the filament winding of
thermoplastics, and (a) provide the required relationships between geometry,
material properties, filament winding process variables, (b) specify the
appropriate process variables for a given application, and (c) yield information
needed for computer aided simulation and control of the manufacturing process.
The models will be implemented by "user-friendly" ready-to-use computer codes.
The problems associated with filament winding of thermoplastic composites are
also being considered, and techniques for filament winding such composites will
be developed. In order to evaluate the validities of the winding techniques and
the models developed during the course of this research, thin and thick
cylinders will be wound using thermoplastic matrix composites. These cylinders
will be inspected and tested, and the data thus obtained will be compared to the
results of the analytical predictions. The results of this research are expected
to provide understanding of the filament winding process of thermoplastic matrix
composite structures, and to lead to practical and cost- effective procedures
for filament winding such structures.
