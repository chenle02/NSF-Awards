9451944 Cushing An interdisciplinary team of faculty in biology, chemistry and
computer science recognize both the criticality and challenge of integrating
scientific visualization into the undergraduate curriculum. They propose to use
the computer graphics hardware and software in conjunction with existing
personal computer laboratories and computation workstations to support (1)
advanced student projects using and developing software for scientific
visualization, (2) undergraduate student research, and (3) image generation for
use in sophomore-level introductory science programs.
