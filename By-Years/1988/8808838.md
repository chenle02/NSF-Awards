This equipment is for the support of an interdisciplinary effort to address
both scientific issues and technological problems related to extremely
thermophilic archaebacteria and their associated biomolecules. Initially, two
microorganisms capable of growth at temperatures at or above 100>C (Pyrodictium
brockii and Pyrococcus furiosus) will be used in these studies. Work will focus
on their microbial physiology, optimization of growth rate and biomass yield,
protein purification, and structure/function relationships for selected enzymes
(including hydrogenases). Efforts to clone genes for selected enzymes from these
thermophilic bacteria into mesophilic bacteria will also be pursued. The results
from this study will be important in several areas ranging from understanding
the basis for protein thermostability to the myriad of engineering problems
associated with large-scale cultivation of these and related microorganisms.
Among the many applications that might result from this work are the isolation
of thermally stable enzymes that offer advantages over those now finding
widespread use, such as proteases, amylases, lipases, ligases, polymerases, etc.
These advantages include higher reaction rates, better stability, and lower
sensitivity to denaturing conditions. Another interesting application of the
sulfur-reducing potential of these bacteria is the removal of certain sulfur
forms from coal. Opportunities involving novel biotransformations should also
arise and will have to be explored as our understanding of these unique bacteria
develops.
