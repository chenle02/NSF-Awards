The principal focus of this research is to carry out high precision
calculations on the lithium and beryllium atoms using highly correlated atomic
wavefunctions. To accomplish this, it is necessary to develop sophisticated
techniques for the calculation of the electron-electron repulsion integrals
which appear in multi-electron atoms.
