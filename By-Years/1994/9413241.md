9413241 Tirrell This award to a group of 15 neurobiologist, cell biologists and
biomedical engineers will support a training program focused on an important and
as yet poorly understood area of biology, the interaction of cells with collagen
and other matrices on which they grow. The research and training program will
emphasize four aspects of this focus: one addresses the fundamentals of these
interactions in both natural and artificial matrices, and the otheps address
interactions occurring in connective, neural and vascular tissue. The award will
support training of undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students through a
mix of new and existing courses, rotations and optional internships that is
sufficiently flexible to accommodate the needs of students that enter with
backgrounds in either engineering or biology. The trainees who emerge from the
program are expected to contribute to fundamental biology and to more applied
areas such as tissue engineering and the development of biomimetic composite
materials. This award is also being supported by the Bioengineering Program
within the Division of Bioengineering and Environmental Systems and by the Human
Resource Development Program within the Division of Engineering Education and
Centers. ***
