The physics department at Cornell College will acquire instruments and apparatus
for computer-based data acquisition and analysis to modernize the laboratory
curriculum for physics majors. The instruments will: o Replace a worn-out pulse-
height analyzer from the 1960's with a computer-based system with a plug-in
analyzer board. o Replace some nuclear pulse electronics modules with new ones
having increased capabilities. The new circuits will be used to introduce an
experiment measuring the lifetime of cosmic-ray produced muons. In this
experiment, as in several others, the computer acting as a pulse-height analyzer
will be helpful in data reduction. o Add a general-purpose laboratory computer
with a high-speed analog/digital interface, a plotter, diskette storage of data,
and software for data reduction and preparation of graphs. This laboratory
computer will have immediate application with experiments in acoustic resonance
with transient excitation and fast Fourier transform analysis of audio frequency
signals, data logging in quantitative measurements of optical diffraction
patterns, and data logging with an infrared spectrometer.
