9760193 Lin Applied Optoelectronics will develop mid infra-red (3-5 microns)
semiconductor lasers, capable of operating at temperatures greater than 220K,
with pulse lengths greater than 10 microseconds, and at average output powers
exceeding 10 mW. Type II quantum well lasers will be grown on GaAs universal
substrates, allowing epitaxial side-down mounting, and using 980 nm InGaAs diode
laser arrays as a pump source. Commercial applications for this technology
include in-situ process control, remote chemical sensing, IR spectroscopy and
glucose analysis.
