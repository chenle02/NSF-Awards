things equal, more likely to be welfare recipients themselves. In order for
policy to address the issue of welfare transmission, policy-makers need to know
more than the fact that there is an intergenerational link in welfare
dependency. The nature of the transmission mechanism has important implications
for which types of policy interventions will be effective. This project will
partition the intergenerational correlation into components attributable to
unobserved heterogeneity, associated with the transmission of preferences and/or
constraints (which would be present in the absence of parental welfare
participation), and state dependence, or scarring (which is directly
attributable to parental welfare participation). Data from the Panel Study of
Income Dynamics (PSID) will be used to investigate these questions. Two
different statistical models are developed and tested using the PSID. One is
based on a sequential choice approach in which the welfare participation
decision is conditional on the fertility decision. The other allows for
concurrent choice among fertility and welfare status. Within each model two
approaches to distinguish the heterogeneity and state dependence components are
used. One approach allows for both family- and individual- specific
heterogeneity components and relies on a timing assumption for the
decomposition. In the other, the two components can be identified without a
timing assumption, but at the cost of allowing for only a family-specific
effect.
