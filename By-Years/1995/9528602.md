9528602 Holt As the tide of environmental change rises inexorably around us, it
is becoming increasingly urgent to understand the capacity of species to
respond. An inspection of the fossil record suggests that species vary widely in
their abilities to adapt to changed circumstances. Some species seem to adapt
very readily to change, whereas others are quite conservative in their basic
"ecological niches" (i.e., the environmental conditions in which populations of
a species can persist without repeated immigration or introductions of new
individuals from external sources). The aim of this research project is to
develop a conceptual framework for interpreting both conservatism and rapid
change in species' niches, combining a contemporary understanding of genetic
change in populations with an understanding of the determinants of change in
population size. The basic approach taken is to use mathematical and computer
analyses which combine ecology (controls on population size) and genetics
(controls on the genetic makeup of populations) to examine how species respond
both genetically and numerically to different kinds of variation in their
environments. For example, climate change can lead to either an altered
environment across the entire range of a species, or possibly just part of its
range, in a short period of time. We thus consider a range of scenarios that
incorporate both environmental change in time and variations across geographic
locations. Findings from this research will address significant fundamental
problems in biology--why some species adapt readily and others more slowly (or
not at all) in the face of environmental change. The research has implications
for important applied problems, such as the design of conservation plans and
understanding genetic responses of pest organisms to control programs.
