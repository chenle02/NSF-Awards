9411572 Davis This is an award to assist in the purchase of equipment for
conduct of research the objectives of which are to study the behavior of
aerosols in indoor air. The equipment is planned for use in optimizing design of
filters for removing air pollutants, formulating a filtration model for
prediction of filter efficiency, identification of conditions for minimizing the
production of bioaerosols and validation of the signature lipid biomarker method
of bioaerosol air sampling. A result of this award is expected to provide the
investigators with a biocontaminant indoor air quality laboratory that can be
used in conducting research as noted above. In addition, the investigators plan
on conducting research on indoor air quality in residential and commercial
buildings and in facilities used for transportation of people. The proposal
leading to this award was submitted in response to NSF 93-155, Research
Equipment Grant Program. ***
