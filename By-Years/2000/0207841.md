This project involves the development and utilization of 3-dimensional
photochemical models and their application to field data from the eastern U.S.
The models will be used to elucidate the chemical mechanisms for the formation
of ozone, odd hydrogen, peroxides, nitric acid, and secondary reaction products
of biogenic hydrocarbons. This project will use data from recent field programs
including the Texas Air Quality Study in Houston in 2000, and the ongoing (since
1996) ozone Photochemistry and Climatology Experiment at a rural site in
Pellston, Michigan.
