Internetworking software allows computers attached to physically distinct data
networks to communicate with one another. The recent advent of portable
computers suggest that soon a substantial fraction of all computers can and will
move. Because present computers rarely move, new approaches to internetworking
are required. This research investigates how to extend present internetworking
protocols to support mobile computers. The approach is a combination of
forwarding, multicasting, address reassignment, and link-level techniques. The
results will be a suite of protocols for locale discovery, dynamic address
assignment, establishment and destruction of forwarding chains, and notification
to higher-level protocols of a change of locale. The work will be evaluated via
simulation and demonstration implementation of their ideas within IP
internetworking software.
