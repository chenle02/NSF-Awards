This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program
is made to Dr. Daniel A. Straus of the Chemistry Department, San Jose State
University to study zirconium-based alkylation of organic substrates.
Alkylzirconocene compounds in the presence of strong bases promote either
alkylation of aldehydes and ketones to form alcohols or abstraction of alpha-
protons to yield enolates. Straus will expand the range of such reactions and
investigate the mechanism by which they occur. The reactions may involve the
formation of an anionic zirconium complex or the production of a mixed alkoxide
alkyl compound. %%% Alkyl zirconium compounds have been extensively studied
under acidic conditions because of their utility in olefin polymerization and
metathesis. Here, the compounds will be studied under basic conditions, in which
preliminary studies have shown they can be effective in some circumstances in
forming carbon-carbon bonds. There is potential for the research to identify
some reactions that will be valuable for synthetic organic chemistry. The
project will be carried out primarily by undergraduate students and will provide
an opportunity for them to learn a variety of advanced laboratory skills.
