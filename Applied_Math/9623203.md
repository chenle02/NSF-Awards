9623203 Chen This proposal is directed toward research on nonlinear problems in
fluid mechanics and related partial differential equations, along with the
analysis and development of efficient nonlinear methods. The objective of this
proposed research program is threefold: investigate important multidimensional
nonlinear problems such as geometric flows, transonic flows, and the Riemann
problem to find the correct function spaces in which to pose the
multidimensional hyperbolic conservation laws and in which to develop the
numerical algorithms that converge stably and rapidly; analyze and develop
existing shock capturing methods and related potential techniques to formulate
new, more efficient nonlinear methods and to solve global solutions of the
nonlinear systems; probe in the regularizing mechanism for nonlinear partial
differential equations to gain new physical insights and to guide the
formulation of the efficient nonlinear methods. The nonlinear problems arise in
all areas of science and engineering. In particular, they arise in material
sciences, biophysics, and environmental and global change processes, in which
fluid motions are essential features. Such features are predominant in such
areas as elasticity, plasticity, semiconductor, biological transport of ions,
phase transition, multi-phase process, and combustion. The fluid motions are
generally governed by the principles of fluid mechanics and, in turn, by certain
nonlinear systems of partial differential equations. Understanding solutions of
such nonlinear systems enables ones to understand the corresponding fluid
motions, to gain new physical insights, to discover the intrinsic laws in these
areas. The proposed nonlinear problems include the well-posedness of solutions
of these nonlinear systems and the qualitative behavior of new nonlinear
phenomena as well as the analysis and development of numerical computational
methods and related potential nonlinear methods.
