With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
Multiuser Program (CRIF:MU), Professor Jacob W. Petrich and colleague Arkady
Ellern from Iowa State University will upgrade and cyber-enable an X-ray CCD
diffractometer. This instrument will support research by a large number of users
that include chemistry professors Verkade, Sadow, Jeffries-EL, Bakac, and Fang
as well as the broader Iowa State University research community. Research will
include stereoselective transformations to develop new catalytic reactions
useful in syntheses ranging from petrochemical through commodity and fine
chemicals to pharmaceuticals, molecular magnetic materials and molecule based
magnetism, new pi-conjugated organic materials, studies of chromium(V) which
promise to shed light on the reduction process of chromate in chemical and
biological systems and improved catalytic processes, including those used for
the production of value-added products from soybean oil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An
X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three
dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and
provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of the molecule
relative to the neighboring molecules. The studies described here will impact a
number of areas, including chemistry, materials chemistry, biochemistry and
agricultural chemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as
well as research.
