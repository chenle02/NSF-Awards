Partial support is requested for the purchase of equipment to fund an
interdisciplinary thermal radiation laboratory, to be used to support
engineering research in the Program of Computer Graphics and the School of
Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. The equipment will allow new computer-
graphics-based algorithms for the analysis of radiant exchange. These algorithms
have the potential for greatly enhancing the speed and accuracy of radiant
calculations in complex geometries. The CCD camera will be calibrated as a
spectrophotometer to provide fast spectral images of an illuminated environment.
Spectral information will be achieved by using broadband filters and computer-
based spectral inversion. The measured images will be compared with calculated
images. The equipment will allow detailed assessment of calculation methods in
geometrically complex environments. The requested spectroradiometer and
reflectometers will allow a variety of hemispherical and bidirectional
reflectivities to be measured over a wide wavelength range. Such data is
required as input for simulation algorithms. It will also be used to assess new
wave-optics-based bidirectional reflectance models.
