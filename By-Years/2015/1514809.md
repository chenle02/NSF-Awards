Warm dense matter (WDM) has been the focus of research for astrophysics, fusion
physics, high-energy physics, and energy applications among others. Due to the
limitation in the instrument's spatial resolution, one fundamental question
remains: how will electrons behave after being ejected from a material? The
recent advancements in picosecond electron schlieren radiography (PESR) is now
making it possible to investigate this problem. Through collaboration with Dr.
Jie Chen from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China, an expert in ultrafast
dynamics, the EAPSI fellow will conduct the experiment, develop and perform the
data analysis to participate in the mapping of the physical shape and time
evolution of the ejected electrons. Understanding the behavior of ejected
electrons is expected to contribute to advancement in fundamental knowledge in
physics.

Specifically, in this project, the EAPSI fellow will explore the possibility of
extending the current picosecond electron schlieren capability from the time
consuming multiple-shot to the more efficient single-shot mode. This will
increase the spatial resolution to a level of sensitivity capable of directly
measuring the ejected charge dynamics, which can be further converted to
transient electric fields by using Maxwell?s equations. These new measurement
capabilities will offer insight into the physics governing the laser-induced
plasma dynamics. This NSF EAPSI award supports the research of a U.S. graduate
student and is funded in collaboration with the Chinese Ministry of Science and
Technology.
