This research is intended to demonstrate that climate dynamics understanding
and climate predictability can be advanced from the study of long time series of
atmospheric climate variables. Complementary microscopic and macroscopic
approaches are to be pursued. In the former, the methods of modern non-linear
dynamics will be applied to highly-sampled observations to investigate the
limits of short-term predictability. In the macroscopic method, the classical
methods of statistical mechanics will be applied to slowly-changing climatic
variables. Both approaches potentially lead to quantitative estimates of the
sensitivity of simulated or observed climates to small perturbations. A program
of developing, testing, and applying these methods to a sequence of increasingly
sophisticated models and to data is included under this grant. The research will
involve the training of undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral
fellows. This request is important because it examines alternative and
potentially fruitful alternative approaches to modeling and predicting the
climate system.
