ABSTRACT

09 July 2009 Proposal Number: 0943737 Institution: San Jose State University,
MLML PI: S. Lamerdin Co-PI: K. Coale

This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).

The proposal requests numerous Shipboard Scientific Support (SSSE) items for the
vessel operated by Moss Landing Marine Labs (MLML); namely the R/V POINT SUR.
The requests specifically include items that have been recommended from past NSF
inspections, or Post-Cruise Assessments (PCA's) and have been otherwise deferred
by the operators due to cost. All of the items requested will either improve
safety, enhance science support capability, or extend vessel service life. Due
to the nature and timing of these requests, the vendor quotation standards
normally required by the SSSE Program were waived out of necessity with many of
the figures provided as estimates for budgetary purposes and based mainly on
past experience of the vessel operators for similar work.

Broader Impacts: The R/V POINT SUR supports federally funded scientific research
in the Pacific Northwest in order to expand human knowledge of the ocean
environment. During operations, the vessel routinely exposes graduate and
undergraduate students to seagoing oceanography. Pubic outreach is also achieved
through the State's Center for Integrative Coastal Observation, Research and
Education program (CI-CORE) and the Alliance for Coastal Technologies program
(ACT), real-time satellite connectivity from ship to shore, and open house
events. The POINT SUR scheduled to complete over 130 NSF sponsored days in 2009.
