The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a Fourier Transform infrared
spectrophotometer, a mass spectrometer and constructing a stainless steel vacuum
system for the study of surface science. The instruments are also being used in
the organic chemistry laboratories and analytical chemistry students are using
them in investigations of polymers and automobile exhaust pollutants and
heterogeneous catalytic reactions. Participants in the undergraduate research
program are also using the equipment in their investigations.
