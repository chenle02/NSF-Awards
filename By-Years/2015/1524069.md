There are many engineering concepts that, to an expert eye, are clearly related
to each other but seem quite disconnected to novices and students. The
Engineering Genome project builds on previous NSF work and is developing
learner-centered tools for linking these engineering concepts, thus enabling
students to better recognize the interrelationships of the concepts. It is
expected that by enabling students to recognize these relationships, students
will more quickly develop expert-like behavior and understanding. The
understanding of these relationships also serves to assist students as they
search for learning materials related to a subject they are studying.

Analogous to Pandora, the internet radio search application that relates and
finds similar music using a music genome, the Engineering Genome project will
implement a search method for finding related engineering concepts using the
Engineering Genome. The project is developing the Engineering Genome for a
subset of engineering topics and is assessing the efficacy of the genome for
enhancing student learning.
