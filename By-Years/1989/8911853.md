Professor Coplan is supported by a grant from The Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program to host an international workshop on (e,2e) spectroscopy to be
held at University of Maryland on August 1, 1989. This spectroscopic technique
is a powerful method for probing atomic and molecular bound electronic states,
and has provided an important tool for studying single particle wavefunctions
for both simple and complex chemical systems. Both theoretical and experimental
aspects of the technique will be addressed in this two day workshop.
