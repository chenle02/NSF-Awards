This program is to study and develop single-photon detectors that employ
photoconductive gain regions associated with trapping photo-excited carriers in
quantum dots. These detectors have a unique ability to sense individual photons
and are a key enabling technology for linear optics quantum computing and the
security of quantum communications. In addition, the realization of quantum
repeaters requires the storage of quantum information. Quantum-dot-based
detectors have the unique ability to function in both capacities and may play a
fundamental role in developing quantum networks. The UW-La Crosse Physics
Department has ~150 majors and offers an optics emphasis track in physics and
engineering. This collaborative research program will help UW-L attract students
interested in optoelectronics and quantum technologies and prepare them for
future careers in these fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed
research will be a collaborative effort between the PI at UW-L and Dr. Richard
Mirin at NIST-Boulder. The goal is to advance the state of quantum-dot-based
single-photon detectors, making these devices suitable for practical
applications. The PI will design the single-photon detectors, conduct
measurements, model the detection system, and analyze the data. The research
group at NIST will grow prototype samples using to a state-of-the-art molecular
beam epitaxy system and fabricate the devices in their clean-room facilities.
The goals of this collaboration are to improve the number resolution, speed, and
efficiency of the single-photon detectors while raising their operating
temperature by optimizing the detection circuitry and integrating the devices
with solid-immersion lenses, and optical cavities. These novel detectors provide
a key enabling technology for linear-optics quantum computing, for increasing
the security of quantum communications, and for studying the quantum nature of
light.
