The Southwest Educational Development Laboratory (SEDL) will conduct a regional
conference on December 12-15, 2001, in San Antonio, Texas, for the Division of
Educational System Reform's (ESR) 19 grantees in the southwestern region of the
nation. The purpose of the conference is to provide assistance to these awardees
on critical issues and challenges related to educational reform in mathematics
and science education and to explore effective and promising strategies to
address these.

The conference has three major outcomes: (1) to provide for a deeper
understanding of common critical issues and challenges in the region as systemic
reform initiatives are implemented; (2) to examine current research and
practices that address the selected issues and challenges, including the
exploration of existing exemplary practices; and (3) to share information,
concerns, and questions through effective networking with other regional reform
initiatives aimed at building the awardees' capacity to address the issues and
challenges.

The two central topics for the conference arise from the growing need in the
Southwest for a reliable supply of quality mathematics and science teachers.
