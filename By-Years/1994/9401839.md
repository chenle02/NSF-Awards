9401839 Hadjipanayis This award for a modern analytical electron microscope will
support and augment the materials research programs in the Department of Physics
and Astronomy and in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Delaware.
Programs include magnetic domain and Microstructural studies in permanent
magnets and magnetic thin films, melting and freezing of small particles and
multilayers, and the structure morphology of ultrafine particles. The microscope
is a JEOL JEM 2000FX scanning transmission electron microscope equipped with
several accessories including an X-ray detector, special lenses for magnetic
imaging (both Lorentz microscopy and DPC imaging), and heating and cooling
stages. It will replace a 28 year-old JOEL JEM 100 C TEM. The high resolution
capability of the JEM 2000FX is needed to characterize the grain boundary phases
observed in novel permanent magnet materials, the core-shell-type structure
morphology of ultrafine particles, interfacial effects in nanocomposites, the
role of defects in freezing and melting of small particles, and the structure
morphology of small semiconductor particles. Several other Departments and
Research Centers also have ongoing programs which urgently require the use of
this instrument, which does not exist at the University of Delaware. Each of
these research programs will benefit greatly from the presence of the modern
electron microscope and interdisciplinary research will be enhanced. In
addition, the microscope will offer the type of education and training in state-
of-the-art electron microscopy skills needed by students and post-doctors. ***
