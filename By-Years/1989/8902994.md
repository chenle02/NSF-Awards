Research will be carried out on nonlinear control theory, continuing the
Principal Investigator's previous work in this area on a broad class of problems
on local and global controllability, observability, minimal realizations,
applications to robotics, optimal control and feedback stabilization. The
methods used will be those commonly known as "differential geometric control
theory," the theory of real analytic maps and their associated stratifications,
and the theory of real analytic desingularization. Specifically, efforts will be
made to solve a number of open problems in the areas of optimal control,
controllability, and realization theory of both continuous time and sampled
continuous time systems, while pursuing the development of the necessary
mathematical tools -- especially on the theory of real analytic stratifications.
