The Minority Research Centers of Excellence (MRCE) program was established in FY
1987 to provide substantial resources to upgrade the research capabilities of
the strongest and most productive predominantly minority institutions. This
planning grant project lays the foundation for a plan that will increase the
institution's quality of research and research-related training. Specifically,
support for this project will permit the establishment of an MRCE advisory
committee of scientists and engineers, local leaders, and industrial
representatives who will assist the institution in evaluating its current and
future potential for performing meritorious research during the next five years.
Chicago State University will develop strategies to identify those programs and
individuals within the university that have the potential for increasing
minority participation in the sciences. The need for this institution to assess
its research capabilities and to increase the participation of minorities in
research was well documented. The Foundation has supported this project since
the proposed work will lead to increased research performance in an urban
university.
