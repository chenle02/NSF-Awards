This award supports Dr. Frederick F. Lange, a postdoc, and three graduate
students from the University of California-Santa Barbara in a collaboration with
Fritz Aldinger and Wolfgang Sigmond of the Institute of Non-Metallic Inorganic
Materials at the University of Stuttgart. Both groups are working on developing
short-range repulsive potentials for silicon nitride (Si3N4) powders to allow
consolidated powder bodies to have a clay-like consistency needed for forming
reliable engineering shapes. The U.S. group has already shown that short-range
potentials can be created for Si3N4. The German group are investigating various
chem-adsorption techniques, and are studying the processes involved with state-
of-the-art methods and facilities such as Atomic Force Microscopy. Silicon
nitride is the most promising structural ceramic for use in advanced heat
engines.
