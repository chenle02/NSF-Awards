Parhi Research efforts are directed towards the design of dedicated, high-
performance digital signal and image processors. The emphasis is on real-time
processing, where samples are processed as they are received from the source, as
opposed to being stored in buffers and then processed in batch. Design of
algorithm topologies for recursive signal processing algorithms were once
considered a major challenge. Using the relaxed look-ahead technique, new
concurrent algorithms and topologies for adaptive LMS and lattice filters,
cascade and lattice recursive digital filters, and predictive speech and image
coders have been developed. Design of concurrent topologies for wave digital
filters, decision-feedback equalizers, and adaptive differential vector
quantizers are being pursued. The decoding speed in Huffman and arithmetic
coders (used for lossless compression) is limited due to the feedback. For the
Huffman decoder, the codeword length multiplicity constraint is being exploited
to design codes where multiple bits can be simultaneously decoded in parallel.
The performance of these decoders is further improved by the use of conditional
coding. Novel approaches for design of parallel arithmetic coders are also being
pursued.
