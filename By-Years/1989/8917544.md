The proposed workshop will bring together scientists and database researchers
to identify the requirements and design criteria appropriate for scientific
database software. In particular, the workshop participants will seek to
identify the problems which can be solved by existing database software and,
more importantly, determine those problems which are not being addressed by
existing database software and for which solutions needs to be developed. The
goal will be to produce a planning document to help guide research toward
producing viable scientific database management systems.
