The study will extend previous work on the global circulation of the Miocene
deep ocean. Previous work has centered on the Pacific Ocean and that work will
be expanded to include the Indian and Atlantic Oceans. The deep paleo-
circulation patterns will be inferred from stable isotopic analyses and benthic
foraminiferal assemblages in DSDP and ODP cores. The results of this study will
provide an important link in reconstructing the response of the ocean to major
climatic changes that occurred as the modern ocean regime was initiated.
