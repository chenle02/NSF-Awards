The project will use the controlled and predictable ground subsidence above an
advancing coal mine longwall panel to monitor the response of test foundations
built above it. Conventional foundations as well as those incorporating various
mitigation techniques will be instrumented and monitored. A series of numerical
analyses will be carried out on the diverse materials used and the observed
subsidence and the foundation behavior will be predicted and compared with the
actual behavior. The suitability of various construction, retrofitting, and
repair measures as well as the location and mechanisms of structural failures
will be determined. Engineers and the mining, construction and insurance
industries will benefit from this work. Two undergraduate students will
participate in the field measurements and numerical analyses to be carried out
under this award. They will benefit from this exposure to research work and
possibly reinforce their decision to pursue a graduate education.
