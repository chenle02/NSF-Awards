Resources for Software Engineering Research&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal
from an EPSCoR state, enhancing capabilities for software-engineering research,
aims at acquiring a data base server, a configuration management system, and
workstations to support the following projects:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. CAREER:
Assessment of Open-Source Software for High-Performance Computing,&lt;br/&gt;2.
Using Pathfinder Networks to Model Perceptions of Software
Requirements,&lt;br/&gt;3. Automating Steps in Software Evolution,
and&lt;br/&gt;4. Integrated Information Sifting for Scientific
Instruments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first project ascertains the quality of
the software using retrospective case studies by building and evaluating models
that could have developed during the historical projects or releases. The second
provides methods for uncovering divergent perceptions of software requirements
by stakeholders and developers, thus giving an early indication of potential
requirements issues in light of conceptual differences among groups. The third,
creating automated techniques for semantics-based slicing and change-merging
that will facilitate the reliable delivery of small increments, devises
automated methods for incorporating incremental changes into software systems as
they evolve. The last project, producing of imagery, develops an integrated set
of algorithms and tools for analysis of scientific-instrument data to support
on-line monitoring and process control. The information sifting approach
includes artificial neural networks for classification of spectral images,
statistical methods for rapid comparison of spectra, rule-based models of
thermal imaging, and fuzzy classification using autonomous agents.&lt;br/&gt;
