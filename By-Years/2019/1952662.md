This award supports participation in the conference "The Circle at Infinity" to
take place May 22-24, 2020 at Harvard University, Cambridge, MA. The conference
will focus on select areas within dynamics and geometry where recent progress
has led to the emergence of significant new directions. A key goal is to expose
junior mathematicians to the deeper unifying themes that underlie the areas
represented in the conference and to connect them to leading experts in their
own and in other fields. The organizers expect about 200 attendees. This award
primarily supports U.S. speakers and early-career participants in the
conference, including women and members of other groups that are currently
underrepresented in the mathematical sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Topics
discussed at the conference include: the structure of moduli spaces of Riemann
surfaces, dynamics on complex surfaces, arithmetic dynamics, homogeneous
dynamics and relations to ergodic theory, diophantine approximation, geometric
topology, and related areas, especially number theory. The list of speakers and
additional information are available at the conference website:

statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
