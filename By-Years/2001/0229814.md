EAR-0229814&lt;br/&gt;DeGroot-Hedlin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators
propose to use magnetotelluric (MT) sounding to constrain the temperature and
melt fraction of plume material in the Yellowstone-Snake River region, and
provide constraints on models of the dynamics of the Yellowstone plume flow and
its interaction with a continent. Several previous studies have indicated the
presence of a narrow, low P-wave velocity beneath the eastern Snake River Plain
in Idaho, aligned in the direction of motion of the Yellowstone hotspot. The
lower seismic velocities can be attributed to the combined effects of
temperature differences, partial melt, and compositional differences resulting
from melt segregation. The investigators propose to deploy long period MT
sounding instruments along two perpendicular lines: the first a northwest to
southeast transect for which a P-wave velocity model was previously obtained
from tomographic inversion, the second centered along the Snake River Plain.
Given that the conductivity of olivine-rich rocks is strongly dependent upon
both melt fraction and temperature, interpretation of MT sounding data can be
used to determine mantle temperatures and melt fraction, hence yielding an
estimate of plume viscosity. &lt;br/&gt;
