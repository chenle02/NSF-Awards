It is a fundamental problem to construct appropriate spaces of various geometric
structures in both algebraic and differential geometry. These spaces, referred
to as moduli spaces, have played a fundamental role in mathematical subjects
ranging from analysis, geometry, and topology to number theory. More than a
century ago, Riemann, Poincare, and Hilbert pioneered the study of "canonical"
metric structures on a surface. Through the connection to the Einstein
equations, the projects under investigation will help understand astronomy and
Cosmology. The methods of analyzing Einstein type equations in this project will
also lead to applications in Engineering and economics. The principal
investigator organizes and participates in the integrated research/education
programs that aim to attract students from under-represented groups to the study
of more advanced mathematics subjects such as geometric analysis, thus helping
to improve the overall education level of the nation.

The PI will investigate the following projects, all of which emerge from the
study of the algebraic/analytic aspects of the moduli spaces. First, he will
study the geometry of the moduli space of polarized Kahler manifolds via
algebraic and analytic means (e.g., the positivity of the line bundles and
heights over the moduli space). Second, he will study the effective scope of
geometric invariant theory (GIT) invented by Hilbert and Mumford on the
construction of algebraic moduli based on the work of the PI and his
collaborators. In particular, the PI investigates more examples in order to
develop a general framework that is more flexible than the classical GIT. Third,
he will study the limiting behavior of Kahler-Ricci flow on low-dimensional
manifolds, in particular the situation when the complex structure jumps. Fourth,
he will study the canonical embedding of Riemannian manifolds into the infinite-
dimensional unit sphere and relate the extrinsic geometry of the embedding to
the canonical metrics on the underlying Riemannian manifold. This is intended as
the first step in attempting to unify the similarities between conformal and
Kahler geometry. The projects proposed above will apply both analytic and
algebraic tools coming from algebraic/differential geometry as well as the new
ideas introduced by the principal investigator and his collaborators over the
years.
