This research project will apply recently developed geometrical methods for
analyzing dynamical systems towards the area of large amplitude motions of a
small fishing vessel. The methods to be applied include Poincare, maps,
invariant manifolds, lobe analysis and Melnikov vector analysis. To achieve a
more realistic model of ship capsizing, the approach will be global, admitting
multiple degrees of freedom and multiple frequency excitations. The products of
this research effort are expected to lead to a better understanding of the
interaction of vessel and environment characteristics influencing vessel
stability.***
