The ionized portion of the equatorial upper atmosphere exhibits significant
variability from one day to the next. One important source of this day-to-day
variability are plumes of plasma that contain complex - and poorly understood -
internal structure that is collectively known as equatorial spread F (ESF). ESF
is a complex phenomenon that involves a wide range of scales from equatorial
plasma bubbles of tens of km in size to meter-scale irregularities in the plasma
density. Recent results using ESF observations and numerical simulations
suggested that ESF is difficult to predict by considering condition of the
plasma (ionosphere) alone and that one reason may be different conditions in the
neutral gas (thermosphere). In addition, vertical coupling between different
altitudinal layers can be important in formation of plasma structures at various
scales, and it has been previously suggested that metallic ions associated with
meteoric deposition may be indirectly responsible for ESF. The goal of this
research is to study thermospheric dynamics and metallic ions as possible causes
of ESF. The global ionospheric model SAMI3 (Sami3 is Also a Model of the
Ionosphere) will be further developed and complemented by a variety of models of
thermospheric dynamics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work will involve (1) study of
day-to-day variability of ESF by running the high-resolution version of SAMI3
for different thermospheric conditions as given by a variety of thermosphere
models, (2) SAMI3 simulations of the effect of metallic ions (Fe+ and Mg+) on
the onset and evolution of ESF through changing conductivity in the post-sunset
ionosphere, and (3) further improvements in SAMI3 including implementing the 4th
order partial donor cell transport scheme and the nested grid technique to
achieve sufficiently high resolution without being computationally
prohibitive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
