9510489 Peterson This dissertation research investigation addresses the role
played by institutional arrangements, political behavior, and environmental
constraints in explaining the diffusion and outputs of school reform efforts
across 63 American cities. The key question of the research is: what conditions
made school reform more likely during 1992-1995? The dependent variable is the
incidence and out put of reform, as measured in scaled responses produced by
interviewing seven knowledgeable sources in each sample city. This investigation
is the first attempt to examine the fate of a number of reform policies across a
large sample of cities. By creating an original data set measuring the
appearance of five educational reforms across the U.S., the rate at which they
were debated and implemented, the role of key hypothetical actors, and board
behaviors, this study will be able to offer unprecedented insights into the
determinants of school reform. Meshing this data with existent demographic,
fiscal, and institutional data, as well as the results from two questionnaires,
proved effective in the pilot study in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. ***
