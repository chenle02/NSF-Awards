DMS-0300126&lt;br/&gt;Bowman,
Douglas&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Combinatorics
and Analysis of Special Functions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposed
project uses two classes of broad mathematical
techniques,&lt;br/&gt;combinatorics and analysis, to expand knowledge of special
functions in &lt;br/&gt;two ways. First it introduces new classes of special
functions and &lt;br/&gt;catalogue their properties. Second, it studies new
properties of &lt;br/&gt;known special functions. In particular, this project
comprises ten &lt;br/&gt;subprojects. These include discovering and classifying
algebraic &lt;br/&gt;relationships between special values of multidimensional
polylogarithms,&lt;br/&gt;studying the combinatorics of shuffles and their
q-analogues, analyzing &lt;br/&gt;the almost everywhere behavior of the Rogers-
Ramanujan continued&lt;br/&gt;fraction on the unit circle, and studying
continued fractions with multiple&lt;br/&gt;limit
values.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special functions are those mathematical
functions which have recurred &lt;br/&gt;often enough that they have been
distinguished with their own name and &lt;br/&gt;have had their properties
catalogued. Indeed, the famous mathematician &lt;br/&gt;Paul Turan once said
that special functions would be better named&lt;br/&gt;"useful functions". The
most famous examples are perhaps the trigonometric &lt;br/&gt;functions, which
are of critical use in all areas of technology. As time &lt;br/&gt;progresses
and physical, technological, and mathematical knowledge grow,&lt;br/&gt;the set
of functions dignified with the term "special" also gets
larger.&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, new properties of functions already in the
pantheon of&lt;br/&gt;special functions are discovered and these properties are
added to the &lt;br/&gt;banks of human knowledge. This project investigates
certain natural new &lt;br/&gt;special functions as well as explores novel
properties of known special&lt;br/&gt;functions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
