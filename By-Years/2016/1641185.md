The Mathematisches Forschungsinstitut Oberwolfach (MFO) is an international
mathematical research center that supports the dissemination of new knowledge in
mathematics and its applications, the initiation of new research projects, and
the interaction of leading junior and senior researchers. Annually nearly 3,000
selected scientific visitors engage in weeklong intensive research programs,
which are monitored by an international scientific committee. The broad scope of
the program at the MFO includes research topics in pure mathematics as well as a
wide range of interdisciplinary topics that reflect mathematical techniques
prevalent in all areas of science and technology. This award annually supports
the participation in these programs of 100 US-based graduate students,
postdoctoral researchers, and junior faculty within ten years of the PhD.
Participation in the MFO programs gives these US Junior Oberwolfach Fellows the
opportunity at an early stage of their careers to interact with top senior
scientists from all over the world in an intense research atmosphere without
distractions. In this way the next generation of US mathematicians receives
training and access to senior colleagues at the highest level, benefitting the
whole field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The MFO runs its weeklong scientific
activities in four central programs that cover all fields of mathematics,
including applications in other sciences: the Oberwolfach Workshops, the Mini-
Workshops, the Arbeitsgemeinschaften, and the Oberwolfach Seminars. The main
scientific program consists of 40 weeklong workshops per year, each with about
50 participants, organized by leading experts selected by a scientific
committee. The Mini-Workshop Program offers 12 weeklong mini-workshops with
about 15 participants. In all workshops the US Junior Oberwolfach fellows have
the opportunity to attend lectures, to work with senior participants, and
possibly to present results of their own. In an Arbeitsgemeinschaft (Study
Group) junior as well as senior researchers learn about a new active topic
outside their current area of research by active presentations of the material.
The six Oberwolfach Seminars are graduate schools organized by leading experts
in the field and address Ph.D. students and postdocs from all over the world. On
average, the project "US Junior Oberwolfach Fellows" allows the MFO to support
two fellows per week from 2016 to 2021, for a total of 500 fellows over a five-
year period.
