The first part of this project will be studying the physical and chemical
processes associated with formation of thin metallic-ion structures in the very-
high-latitude upper atmosphere. Experiments will be conducted at the incoherent-
scatter radar facility at Sondrestrom, Greenland. The PI will use a routine
measurement program (currently underway) to establish a database that
characterizes different structures, such as single versus double layers,
latitudinal and altitude distributions. He will also use a new experimental mode
that simultaneously determines latitudinal variation of electric fields and high
resolution density structures. In conjunction with a new numerical model, these
data will investigate the relative roles of electric fields and neutral winds in
layer formation, determine the effects of time-varying E-fields, and discover
the effects of aeronomic parameters, such as the ion-neutral collision
frequency. Secondly, the PI will further develop a new Eulerian 3-D time-
dependent model of the polar ionosphere. This approach is advantageous to the
traditional Lagrangian method in permitting efficient high spatial resolution,
in turn allowing time-dependent studies of polar plasma structures and better
comparisons with data. Using a new electric field model, the PI will investigate
time-dependent ionospheric effects, particularly for northward interplanetary
magnetic field (IMF) conditions. This model can determine the continuous
ionospheric response to a time-varying IMF. He can then predict "space weather"
effects, if appropriate IMF and space-particle data inputs are available to the
model.
