The 2014 IEEE North American School for Information Theory (NASIT?14) will be
held at the Fields Institute for Research in Mathematical Sciences in Toronto,
Canada, from June 18th to June 21st, 2014. This Project provides support for the
expenses of school participants from the United States, including graduate
students and postdocs. These participants will benefit from attending the
school, learning from senior colleagues, presenting their own research in poster
sessions, and expanding their network contacts within the community, but who
lack funds and would not be able to attend without travel support. The student
selection criteria emphasize ethnic diversity, gender equality, and geographic
diversity, to ensure broad participation in the workshop.
