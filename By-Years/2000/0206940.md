The goal of this project is to automatically classify emotion in speech. In
addition to using standard acoustic parameters, this work use will also use
syllabic patterns and speech formant contours within syllables. These features,
along with pattern recognition techniques, will first be used to produce an
optimal separation of presence or absence of selected emotions in single words
and short phrases. The software will then be adapted to recognizing and
classifying these emotions where they occur in longer speech samples.
Experiments will also be conducted in applying the software to "impoverished
speech" where the linguistic content has been obscured. If successful, this will
be a major contribution to automatic recognition and classification of emotion
in speech.
