This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will lead to the
development of a new type of widely tunable external cavity diode laser for use
in next generation optical networks. These networks, parts of which are being
deployed now, will rely on a high degree of network flexibility, especially on
the ability to dynamically provision wavelengths throughout the communication
grid upon demand. Key to deployment of such networks will be the availability of
widely tunable source lasers at price points that are competitive with present
fixed-wavelength telecommunications lasers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The result of
this multiphase R&amp;D effort will be production and marketing of a widely
tunable transmitter module for long-haul telecommunications. &lt;br/&gt;
