The project concerns the development and implementation of a workshop to get
feedback about the draft of the Computer Engineering component of Computing
Curricula 2001 (CC2001). CC2001 is a joint multi-year (since 1998) undertaking
of the Computer Society of the Institute for Electrical and Electronic Engineers
(IEEE-CS) and the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) to develop new
guidelines for undergraduate programs that deal with computers in general.
CC2001 provides innovative approaches and recommendations for implementing
computing curricula looking at low-level, transition, and upper-level courses
that are tailorable to a particular program's needs. In addition the document
states what the "core" set of material that every program should contain as well
as providing information about possible focus areas that a department can
utilize in tailoring their program. Tasks include collecting the materials,
developing a readable volume, and producing the volume (Activity 1), conducting
a workshop to solicit comments from the community (Activity 2), and the ongoing
assessment of the Computer Engineering component of CC2001 (Activity 3). The
purpose of the proposed workshop is to convene a group of experts in the area of
Computer Engineering to review the draft of the Computer Engineering Curricula
and obtain feedback about the draft. Project plans call for disseminating the
resulting document the comnputer engineering community after it is completed.
