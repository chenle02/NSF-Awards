In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, John Moore and
John Tossell of the University of Maryland will investigate the processes
involved in electron-molecule collisions. Such processes include: dissociative
electron attachment, yielding a radical and a negative ion; direct dissociation,
resulting in two radicals; dipolar dissociation, resulting in the simultaneous
production of a positive and a negative ion; and dissociative ionization,
yielding an ion and a radical. The project involves both experimental and
theoretical characterization of such processes as they occur in the gas phase as
well as on surfaces. Systems chosen for study include halocarbons, halosilanes,
halogenated alkenes, and halofluorocarbons. These precursors and their products
are thought to be crucial in understanding the chemistry involved in plasma
reactors such as those used for plasma etching and in the fabrication of
semiconductor devices. An electrical discharge in a gas creates an electron-rich
environment which induces chemical changes in normally unreactive gases. This
highly charged mixture is known as a plasma, and the chemical reactions taking
place are termed plasma chemistry. Such reactors have found widespread use in
the semiconductor industry for fabrication of both materials and devices. This
research will provide detailed information on the nature of the species involved
in such reactions, as well as fundamental knowledge of their reactions.
