This study focuses on the absorption and oxidation of acid gases in water
droplets. These processes are important in theunderstanding of acid rain and the
design of air pollution control devices. The theoretical analysis and
mathematical modelling of these processes will be performed, as will an
experimental investigation. The fluid flow fields and the mass transfer with
chemical reaction which occurs in single drops and two drop sets will be
analyzed. These submodels will form the basis of a comprehensive analysis of
trace gas absorption with chemical reaction in falling drops. Two research
papers dealing with the research effort will be submitted to the Chemical
Engineering Journal and Chemical Engineering Science.
