With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at California State University in Northridge will
acquire a single crystal X-ray diffractometer. This equipment will enhance
research in a number of areas including the following: a) bifunctional transfer
hydrogenation catalysts based on entirely hard donor ligand environments; b)
discovery of new methods and strategies for the synthesis of complex molecules;
and c) development of new synthetic methodologies in inorganic chemistry.

The X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full
three dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles,
and it provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of the
molecule relative to the neighboring molecules. These studies will have an
impact in synthetic chemistry.
