The goal of this project is to develop protocols for highly available
Distributed Shared Memory (DSM) systems. Such protocol designs require handling
multi-site failures and network partitions. This project is investigating issue
related to highly available DSM from three different perspectives. First, its
goal is to develop a stochastic model of highly available DSM to serve as the
basis for further analytical work in this area. Second, a DSM simulator is
planned to be developed to help analyze coherence protocols for high
availability. Third, an experimental DSM system is being extended to support
high availability based on a new protocol called Boundary Restricted Coherence
Protocol (BR). Finally, this project aims at demonstrating the use of highly
available DSM systems for a variety of applications such as scientific computing
and database systems.
