This award to Stanford University will allow the PI to analyze the interaction
between reproductive behavior and family process in Japan during the Tokugawa
regime (1702-1872). The data will be drawn from unusually complete household
records for eight villages, covering some 10,000 persons, 4,200 births and 1,000
conjugal units. The general objectives of the project are to complete a full-
scale multivariate analysis of family reproductive process (using log-linear
contingency table models) relying on historical ethnography and a reconstruction
of environmental conditions both to inform the analytical design and to help
interpret the results. Infanticide was practiced by households in these villages
throughout the period of study. This research will test the hypothesis that in
general infanticide was a form of family planning designed to serve the long run
interests of the corporate stem family. This research will contribute to
demographic anthropology, historical anthropology and family-kinship studies. It
will provide important theoretical material about the status of women in
agrarian families and may help illuminate the passive infanticide found in the
Third World today.
