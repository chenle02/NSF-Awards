This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will aid the
Chemistry Department at the University of California--Riverside (UCR) purchase a
high resolution mass spectrometer dedicated to high performance liquid
chromatography mass spectrometry-mass- spectrometry (HPLC-MS) and electrospray
mass spectrometry analyses using atmospheric pressure, chemical
ionization/electrospray (APCI/ESI) interfaces. The research studies to be
performed include the following: (a) Spectroscopy of Linear Polyenes; (b)
Establishing Structure/Functional Relationships in a Cytostatic Protein Kinase;
(c) Analogies Between Enzyme Active Sites and Receptor Sites; (d) Development of
New Membrane-Based Analytical Methods; (e) Synthetic and Mechanistic Organic
Chemistry; (f) Thiol/Disulfide Chemistry of the Neurohypophyseal Peptide Hormone
and Related Peptides. Mass Spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to probe
intimate structural details and to obtain the molecular compositions of a vast
array of organic, bioorganic and organometallic molecules. The addition of the
technique of electrospray extends the range of MS to protein and nucleic acid
molecular weights far beyond any other technique. The use of electrospray
ionization in combination with high resolution provides the latest techniques
available in mass spectrometry. It affords the chemist one of the most powerful
tools available for the characterization of compounds. The acquisition of this
capability in mass spectrometry is essential for the prosecution of frontier
research in many fields of chemistry.
