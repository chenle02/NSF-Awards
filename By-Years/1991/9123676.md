This is a binational study involving collaboration between researchers in the
U.S. and Italy. Disaster mitigation and environmental protection policy will be
the primary focus of the research. In the U.S., four case studies will be
conducted on recent events that have implications for mitigation and
preparedness policies: the Loma Prieta earthquake (1989), Hurricane Hugo (1989),
the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill (1989), and the Oakland, California fire (1991). This
project is an exploratory effort in binational cooperation as well as in viewing
disasters in a broader environmental context.
