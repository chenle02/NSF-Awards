This award provides funding for a new Computing Research Infrastructure (CRI)
project focused on power- and thermal-aware computing at Wayne State University.
PORTAL (the proposed POweR and Thermal Aware computing Laboratory) will support
a broad range of research on software-controlled power and thermal optimization
of both general-purpose and embedded systems, by providing: 1) a diverse set of
hardware test beds, ranging from server-level processors to smart phones; 2)
precision power and thermal measurement capabilities permitting the development
and verification of accurate power and thermal models; 3) battery power-
dissipation measurement capabilities for investigation of systems in a compact
environment; and 4) performance evaluation data collection mechanisms used in
both research and education settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Power and heat
management are critical concerns for sustainable computing. Progress in this
area benefits society through reduction in energy usage and enablement of new
portable electronic devices with reduced battery lifetime limitations. The
project improves educational opportunities and work-force development at Wayne
State University through development of new courses on power and thermal effects
in computing, improving coverage of energy and power dissipation in existing
courses within the core curriculum, and providing hands-on experience for
experimentation by students. The investigators are committed to making use of
the new facilities in their efforts to involve more female and under-represented
minority students in computing systems research, and their outreach activities
to K-12 students.
