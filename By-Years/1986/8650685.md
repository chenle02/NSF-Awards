This project will provide the Department of Biology at the College of St.
Catherine with equipment for the in vitro growth, quantification and observation
of higher eucaryotic cells. Acquisition of this equipment will allow them to:
(1) expand the scope of previous laboratory exercises in Immunology,
Microbiology, Genetics and Physiology to include areas such as animal virology,
cellular immunology and somatic cell genetics; (2) provide students with hands-
on experience with modern biotechnological equipment; and (3) encourage student
research projects. The bulk of the equipment requested is for cell culture work.
This includes two tissue culture hoods, two inverted phase contrast microscopes,
a carbon dioxide incubator and a liquid nitrogen cell storage freezer.
Additionally, two fluorescent microscopes will facilitate observation of
immunofluorescently stained cells. The project will take advantage of the
training of two recently appointed faculty members who, with this equipment,
will be able to introduce important new modern biological work into the
curriculum, thus advancing this Department's already strong record for
supporting the education of women in science.
