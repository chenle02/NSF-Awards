This award will be used to support participants from US institutions attending
an Advanced School and Discussion Meeting on Groups, Geometry and Dynamics at
the International Centre for Theoretical Sciences at the Tata Institute in
Bangalore, India during December 3-16, 2012. Special areas of consideration
include: Lorentzian geometry, geometry of negatively curved spaces, geometry of
discrete groups, arithmetic of hyperbolic manifolds, lattices in Lie groups,
geometry and dynamics of real and complex Kleinian groups, and flows on
homogeneous spaces. The aim of this Advanced School and Discussion Meeting is to
introduce young mathematicians to the foundations of the fields, their major
developments, and the tools used for their study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study
of discrete group actions on various spaces been an important area of research
for many decades, originating in the pioneering work of H. Poincare in the early
20th Century. The study of of solutions of certain differential equations on the
complex line led to the concept of Fuchsian and Kleinian groups, which are
discrete groups of automorphisms of the Riemann sphere, also acting as
isometries of hyperbolic geometries in two and three dimensions. The study of
these types of discrete group actions on complex spaces, and their
generalizations to higher dimensions and to other geometries, continues to be a
rich source of current research. This Advanced School and Discussion Meeting
will foster interaction and promote research in these areas, and will explain
the core problems at the frontiers of these fields a new generation of
geometers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://www.icts.res.in/program/GGD2012
