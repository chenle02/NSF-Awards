Juries often rely on and interpret evidence based on scientific research when
making decisions in civil and criminal cases. The validity and reliability of
scientific information varies, yet jurors generally are non-experts who do not
possess the necessary tools to differentiate between weak and strong scientific
information when making decisions. To assess the issue of interpretation of
scientific evidence in court, this project uses an experimental approach to
examine jurors' ability to interpret and act on scientific evidence. To do so,
this project consists of jury simulations that will examine jurors' and juries'
sensitivity to strong versus weak scientific information presented in court.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project includes two jury simulation experiments
designed to test whether fuzzy trace theory, a well-developed theory in
cognitive science, applies in the context of jury research, particularly when
compared to other safeguards for jury decision making with respect to scientific
evidence. This multidisciplinary, multi-method research will examine when and
how jurors' inferences are appropriately calibrated to the strength of
scientific information, whether a safeguard derived from decision-making theory
can improve that calibration, and how various measures relevant to the
processing of scientific information are related to one another. The project
addresses fundamental questions about how humans reason with and make inferences
and decisions based on the quality of relevant scientific data.
