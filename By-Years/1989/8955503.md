Francis Marion College will initiate a 3-week residential Young Scholars
project in Physics for 25 students in grade 12. This project introduces high
school students to the excitement and methodology of scientific research via a
three-week residential summer research camp on modern physics and a monthly
program of school year follow-up activities. The camp includes classroom
discussions, laboratory exercises and library research, all designed to
encourage students to function as researchers. Students begin by investigating
atomic spectra, follow with experiments designed to discover more about the
structure of the nucleus, and finally the project concludes with a study of
elementary particle physics and the quark model of the nucleon. Career
exploration activities include invited lecturers, library research and field
trips chosen to expose students to a variety of scientific careers.
