This project is concerned with the simulation and emulation of common motor
behaviors. Its goal is a task-level animation system in which the animated
agents perform certain simple but general kinds of problem solving in order to
move among and interact with other figures and objects in their environment.
Such a system would not require its human user to specify most of the details of
what's to happen in the simulated world of interest. To that end, the
investigator seeks to develop and implement a hierarchical, inheritance-based
scheme for representing physical objects and their relationships, including
common-sense knowledge about their uses, and to develop low-level motor control
models based on inverse kinematics and finite-state control of jointed figures.
