Communities in rural Appalachia have a rich cultural history of innovating
solutions to a myriad of local challenges. The underlying problem solving skills
inherent to this “Appalachian Ingenuity” are conceptually similar to those used
in computational thinking. This partnership between Digital Promise Global,
Floyd County Schools, and Pikeville Independent School District in Eastern
Kentucky will leverage these similarities to help educators and students
understand computer science in a more intuitive way, increasing the agency and
participation of Appalachian youth in computing. By supporting K-8 students to
connect computing with their heritage as problem-solvers, this project will help
address the pressing priority of many rural communities to cultivate rural STEM
talent for explicit use in rural communities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
Research Practitioner Partnership between Digital Promise Global, Floyd County
Schools, and Pikeville Independent School District builds on prior work to
create a rurally sustaining computational thinking (CT) pathway that benefits
students and the broader community. The project team will use a design-based
research approach to support small teams of teacher-leaders in two Eastern KY
districts of Floyd and Pikeville to create, implement, study and refine CT
lessons that are connected to their local cultural heritage of problem solving.
The team will conduct explanatory case study research with an evaluation
orientation to examine how, why and which elements of a rurally sustaining CT
pathway appear to influence students’ perceived importance and usefulness of CT,
and their expectations of success to learn and use these
skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
