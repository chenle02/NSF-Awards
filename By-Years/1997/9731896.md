ABSTRACT Proposal Number: CTS-9731896 Principal Investigator: Shaqfeh This is a
grant to address a number of important problems in the study of polymer rheology
that can be characterized as non-continuum or non-local. These are typically
associated with the influence of boundaries or constrained environments on the
stress-strain rate relationship. The burgeoning interest in these problems
arises from the growing need to process materials at the molecular level. In
most cases, new physical principles need to be applied to such problems because
the most fundamental relationships, e.g. the relationship between the tension
along a molecular backbone and the average extra stress in the mixture, need to
be derived anew. Moreover these highly constrained flow fields are now only
beginning to be experimentally interrogated, but the early data suggests that
qualitatively new Theological behavior needs to be understood in these cases.
Three problems that can serve as paradigms for theoretical model-building have
been selected for study: a) the Couette-Poiseuille flow of flexible chains in
solution when the pore or channel thickness is comparable to the radius of
gyration of the polymers, b) the bulk shearing flow of polymer solutions near a
boundary where the interface may contain adsorbed or grafted polymer layers, and
c) the squeeze flow lubrication of "wet" polymer brush covered surfaces. The
technique will be used is a novel hybrid scheme involving self-consistent flow
calculations using HP adaptive finite elements and large scale Brownian dynamics
simulations of bead-rod (Kramer's) chains.
