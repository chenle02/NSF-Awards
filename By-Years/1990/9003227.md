This proposal concerns itself with several problems involving random media,
namely the propagation of pulse waves and the focussing of singularities of
solutions of the nonlinear Schroedinger equation. In particular, the principal
investigator will study direct and inverse problems for pulse reflection of
waves in random media, reflection and transmission of gravity waves in irregular
channels, and singular solutions of the Schroedinger equation due to nonlinear
focussing of light beams. Such problems arise in a host of areas, for example,
seismology, plasma physics and nonlinear optics. Many phenomena involve the
propagation of waves through inhomogeneous media. Think of seismic waves
travelling inside the earth after an earthquake. Since the medium is not uniform
or orderly, we call it random and scientists use a variety of mathematical
models to help understand how local microscopic properties influence macroscopic
ones. The macroscopic effects are the the ones we can measure and they usually
are of most interest to us. In this proposal the principal investigator will use
analytical and numerical tools to study how waves and light beams behave as they
travel inside of random media.//
