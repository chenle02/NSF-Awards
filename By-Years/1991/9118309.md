This research investigates seismic phases by stacking, or summing, long-period
seismograms from the Global Seismic Network. Work to date using this technique
has successfully imaged dozens of seismic phases, including many reflections
from upper mantle discontinuities, some of which had not previously been
observed. This work will be intensified with a goal of producing maps of upper
mantle discontinuity topography, an important clue to the nature of mantle
convection models now undergoing intense discussion. Close attention will be
given to possible reflectors in the D" region above the core-mantle boundary, an
area important to models of plume convection in the mantle.
