In conjunction with the March 1992 Maize Genetics Meeting in Pacific Grove,
California, a U.S.- Soviet Workshop on Maize Genetics will be held under the
leadership of Drs. William F. Sheridan (University of North Dakota) and Edward
H. Coe, Jr. (University of Missouri) and Dr. Ye. V. Ananiev of the Russian
Academy of Sciences' Vavilov Institute of General Genetics, Moscow. The primary
objective of the workshop is to give U.S. and Soviet specialists in this
important area the opportunity to familiarize themselves with each other's work
and to develop concrete proposals for long-term cooperative research projects
for subsequent submission and competitive review. This project fulfills the
program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading
researchers in the United States and Russia to combine complementary efforts and
capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence in the field of
basic scientific research on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality
of benefit.
