Modern astronomy depends on theoretical models of the life cycles of stars.
These models are then used to suggest new ways to study planets around other
stars and to determine our own Solar System compares with other planetary
systems. Their predictions can be tested by observing pairs of stars orbiting
each other. Their orbital speed reveals the masses of the stars, while the
dimming produced when they eclipse each other reveals their sizes. This team
will study a large sample of very young eclipsing binary star systems in order
to measure fundamental stellar properties. Undergraduate students will be
involved at all stages of the investigation. The Principal Investigator (PI)
will bring the scientific discovery process into his classroom, serving the
national interest by promoting STEM education and improving the retention of
members of underrepresented groups in STEM
fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Predictions from evolutionary models of pre-main
sequence stars remain largely untested, especially for masses below that of the
Sun. The investigation will characterize 15 young eclipsing binary systems
observed by K2 (the repurposed Kepler mission) in the Upper Scorpius star-
forming region, measuring masses, radii, luminosities, temperatures, and
magnetic field strengths. The proposed program also will compare observed
magnetic field strengths to the values required in new magnetized stellar
evolutionary models. The PI will use upper-level undergraduate classes in
stellar astrophysics to test new experiential learning techniques and as a
gateway for recruiting students to become involved in this research, joined by
summer interns recruited from underrepresented/underserved populations at other
institutions. The on-campus research students will then serve the following year
as peer mentors and role models.
