A series of Solar Cycle Workshops have been geld in the years since 1984. The
Australian government has agreed to host the next workshop (November, 1988) and
pay the local expenses for American scientists. This grant will provide the
travel costs for eight participants. Previous workshops have been successful and
this one promises to be equally so. The timing is propitious given the rise of
solar activity and the upcoming MAX91 program. Publications from the meeting
will be submitted to the journal "Solar Physics."
