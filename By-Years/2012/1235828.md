The overall goal of the Jornada Basin Long Term Ecological Research Program is
to understand and quantify the mechanisms that generate alternative natural and
human-dominated states in dryland ecosystems, and to predict future states and
their consequences for the provisioning of ecosystem services. Based on long-
term databases beginning in 1858, research over the next six years will focus on
five types of dynamics: (1) a shift from perennial grasslands to desertified
shrublands, (2) a reversal to grassland states, (3) transitions among shrub-
dominated states, (4) invasion by non-native grasses, and (5) transitions to
human-dominated states. This research combines rigorous hypothesis testing
through initiation of new experiments, novel integration of long-term studies to
address new questions, forecasts of alternative future landscapes and
consequences for ecosystem services under a changing environment, and extension
of cross-site and regional studies. Simulation modeling will improve
understanding of current patterns and prediction of future dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Training opportunities will be provided for graduate and
undergraduate students at four Hispanic-serving institutions in New Mexico,
Arizona, and Texas. A K-12 and teacher-training program will provide inquiry-
based curricula, field trips, teacher workshops, and public education events.
Research findings will be distributed to scientists, land managers, and
educators via workshops, seminars, and an on-line newsletter. International
collaborations will occur on five continents (North and South America, Asia,
Europe, Australia) to address the global challenge of increasing
desertification.
