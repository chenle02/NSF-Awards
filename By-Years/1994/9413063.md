Professor Salisbury and his students will continue their research into computer
solutions to the complex equations of gravitation describing the behavior of
gravitational waves. He will emphasize studies of colliding plane waves using
the new formalism of Ashtekar for computation, and will initiate other studies
of both vacuum space-times, and ones with material sources. The ultimate
objective of this program is to develop powerful numerical techniques to study
the generation of gravitational waves from astronomical sources.
