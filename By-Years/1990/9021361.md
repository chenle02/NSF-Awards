This study is designed to determine whether nerve cell to nerve cell
interactions direct or influence the short cell body projections called
dendrites and the synaptic connectivity between nerve cells which takes place in
the central nervous system during development. Cell to cell interactions as well
as steroid hormones have been implicated in regulating the postembryonic
structure of nerve cells. This study uses the moth to examine individual nerve
cells during hormonally-controlled metamorphosis. Hormonal, surgical and
chemical manipulations are used to determine if the interactions between nerve
cells trigger or shape the growth of dendrites on the cell body.
Electrophysiological and morphological methods are used to define the changes
that take place in dendritic growth. These studies will contribute to our
understanding of how nerve cells interact and how hormones affect nerve cell
structure during development.
