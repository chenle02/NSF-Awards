An REU Site will be established at the University of Toledo, Department of
Physics and Astronomy for eight out of twelve total supported undergraduate
students. The students will be able to collaborate with departmental faculty in
the fields of Astrophysics/Astronomy, Atomic/Molecular/-Optical, and Condensed
Matter Physics. The NSF-REU program will enhance the departmental undergraduate
research program, which has been in existence since 1988, by providing full time
summer support for the students, as well as allowing non-Univ. of Toledo
students to participate in the research.
