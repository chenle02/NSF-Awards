Funds are requested for the investigation of radiocarbon and stable carbon
isotope ratios and various other chemical properties in the major organic and
inorganic carbon pools in the North Atlantic Ocean. Measurements will be made of
dissolved organic and inorganic carbon (DOC and DIC) in a detailed profile
collected at a site near Station S off Bermuda in the Sargasso Sea. In addition,
the radiocarbon and stable carbon isotope ratios in specific organic components
of the DOC (humic and labile constituents) will be measured. Suspended
particulate organic carbon (POC) will be collected from 10 depth and sinking POC
from 3 depth (1000, 2600 and 3600 meters at the same site. The goals of this
project are to formulate the pathways that carbon follows in the open ocean
water column of the North Atlantic, and to compare these results with those
obtained earlier for the North Pacific. In particular, there is interest in
determining the sources and time constants involved in the cycling of DOC,
especially those which involves sedimentary organic carbon (SOC) and POC in the
water column. The goals of this project is directly related to those of the
Global Ocean Flux Study (GOFS).
