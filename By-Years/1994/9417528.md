Abstract ATM-9417528 McKeague, Ian W. Florida State University Title:
Empirically Determined Climate Predictability Using Nonlinear Time Series Models
This grant is to apply various modern methods of nonlinear time series analysis
to look at the problem of climate predictability. Observed and GCM simulated
time series will be examined using the tools of nonlinear dynamical systems
theory to construct nonlinear statistical models. This will enable the PIs to
assess the predictability of climate.
