Past snapshots of the fraction of professional astronomers who are women at
various career stages have suggested a higher attrition rate than for men. While
anecdotal evidence suggests possible reasons, reliable statistical data and
analyses are lacking. This award will enable the PI to follow a cohort of men
and women astronomers over a decade, track the decisions they make, and make
links to underlying causes. The time period is key to success, collecting data
from the cohort in three staged surveys. The award will support the analysis of
data from the second survey round, the preparation of the third survey and its
analysis, and linking together the ultimate findings and conclusions from the
complete program. Using data from all three rounds, the Longitudinal Study will
ultimately: (1) provide detailed data on trends in employment over 10+ years for
a single cohort, (2) collect data on people who leave the field of astronomy
during or after graduate school, (3) determine whether there are sex differences
in attrition from astronomy and reasons for this, and (4) examine factors that
precede decisions to persist in, or leave, the field of astronomy.
