9622283 Carmen This Research Equipment Grant will broaden the scope of the
research and education being conducted in Department of Mechanical, Aerospace
and Nuclear Engineering at the University of California, Los Angeles. The
purchase of an unique sputtering system capable of depositing thin film TiNi
onto various substrates is novel &amp; should yield interesting and important
results. Developing a dedicated ultra-high-high vacuum this sputtering system in
a clean- room facility with lithographic capability will provide a nationally
unique facility for thin film research at UCLA. If the sputtering equipment can
be controlled so that the chemistry variations are small then the potential for
a breakthrough is clearly present. Objectives are well-addressed and the need
for such equipment is adequately described. Researchers have an excellent
background for the proposed work and have demonstrated considerable
productivity. ***
