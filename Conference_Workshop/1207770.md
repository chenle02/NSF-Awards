The workshop ``Algebraic Monoids, Group Embeddings and Algebraic Combinatorics"
will take place at the Fields Institute, Toronto, Ontario on July 3--6, 2012. It
consists of two major components. First of all, there will be 3 minicourses on
introductory topics aimed at graduate students staggered throughout the four
days. These tutorials will introduce the necessary background for the remaining
research talks, which form the second component of the workshop. The organizers
of the workshop are Mahir Can (Tulane University), Zhenheng Li (University of
South Carolina), Benjamin Steinberg (City College of New York) and Qiang Wang
(Carleton University, Canada).

The theory of algebraic monoids, originated independently by M. Putcha and L.
Renner in 1980, is a natural synthesis of algebraic group theory (Chevalley,
Borel, Tits) and torus embeddings (Mumford, Kempf, et al). It is a significant
part of the theory of spherical embeddings (Brion, Luna, Vust) and horospherical
varieties (Popov, Vinberg). Symmetric varieties (De Concini, Procesi) are
closely related to algebraic monoids.

Algebraic combinatorics studies discrete structures arising from an algebraic
context. It is a broad and important discipline of mathematics with applications
in quantum chemistry, statistical biology, statistical physics, theoretical
computer science and so forth. In recent years there has been a tremendous
progress on the combinatorial aspects of the above mentioned embedding theories,
relating their underlying algebraic structures to the classical notions in
algebraic combinatorics.

The workshop will provide a unique opportunity to bring together some of the
principal investigators from different countries, junior researchers, and
graduate students. It will outline future directions of research on algebraic
monoids, group embeddings, and algebraic combinatorics. This workshop will
prepare graduate students for research in related areas and suggest thesis
projects. More information about the workshop can be found at:

This grant will provide funding for U.S. researchers to participate and benefit
from this timely international workshop, which will stimulate research on the
interplay between algebraic monoids, group embeddings, and algebraic
combinatorics. It will help establish collaborations among the participants,
including students and faculty from non-Ph.D.-granting institutions, as well as
female students and professors. It will potentially help establish connections
between U.S. and international academic institutions.
