9522644 Glatz This proposal is on research to establish a data base to aid in
the use of transgenic soy beans for the large-scale production of recombinant
proteins. Of particular interest are the degradation and purification processes
involved when producing and isolating a recombinant protein from transgenic soy
beans. Basic goals of this research include two main activities: (1) to
determine which steps in conventional soy bean processing are likely to
influence the yield and activity of recombinant proteins from transgenic soy
beans, and (2) to investigate the feasibility of using "purification fusion"
technologies to aid in the recovery of recombinant proteins from soy bean
extracts. The latter activity is to be investigated using experiments by adding
the proteins, beta-glucuronidase and lysozyme, as well as experiments with
actual transgenic soy which will contain these proteins along with the protein
neomycin phosphotransferase II in beans supplied by Pioneer Hi-Bred
International, Inc. located in Johnstown, Iowa. ***
