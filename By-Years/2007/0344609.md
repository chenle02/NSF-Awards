This proposal combines an experimental program intended to fabricate proof-of-
concept solid-state THz sources and evaluate their technological promise (in
terms of real-world benchmarks, such as power output over the attainable
freqcuency range). together with a theoretical effort intended to clarity the
high-frequency generation mechanisms and guide the experimental work among
different device geometries. This proposal will complete the envisioned program
fully with regard to fabricating and characterizing proof-or-concept devices and
developing the theoretical framework.
