Solving a system of linear inequalities with parameters is essential in various
applications, such as engineering, science, sociology, economics, industry, and
even medicine (such as the optimal combination of drugs for efficacy and
safety). The efficient algorithms on constrained interpolation can be applied to
analyze big data such as Twitter data. This endeavor will help promote
interdisciplinary research and improve the current computing infrastructure.
Research opportunities will be provided for postdocs, graduate students, and
undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Smooth solutions to systems of
linear inequalities will be addressed. Attention will also be paid to efficient
algorithms for constrained interpolation by smooth functions and extension
questions on arbitrary domains. The methods to be developed will revolve around
common mathematical themes, such as Calderon-Zygmund decomposition, well-
separated pairs, and convex optimization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
