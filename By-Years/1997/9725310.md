9725310 McNutt Volcanic earthquakes and tremor commonly precede volcanic
eruptions. However, these special signals are poorly understood. To improve our
understanding, an international team of 25 scientists and technicians from the
United States, Japan, and Italy joined the staff of the U.S.G.S. Hawaiian
Volcano Observatory in January 1996 and February 1997 to make the most detailed
seismic recordings on Kilauea Volcano ever, using the largest total number of
seismic instruments ever installed on a volcano. One hundred-sixteen portable
seismographs were installed beginning January 11, 1996 in and near Kilauea
Crater in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park as a joint Japan-United States research
project to record volcanic earthquakes and tremor. On February 1, 1996, a swarm
of over 500 earthquakes was recorded by the dense network, providing the best
recording of an earthquake swarm at Kilauea. In February 1997, a second
intrusion of molten rock was recorded by the networks in place for Phase II of
the experiment. The data collected offer an unprecedented opportunity to
understand earthquakes associated with magma transport. Similar events occur at
many volcanoes and they will be useful to forecast eruptions. We will study: 1)
P- and S-wave tomography to learn about the structure of the volcano, 2) array
sufficiency to find the best places to locate instruments, and 3) site response
and signal variability to understand volcanic complexity. These were chosen for
initial analyses because of our interest and expertise and because of the broad
applicability of the expected results.
