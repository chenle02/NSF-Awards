Under this Small Grant for Exploratory Research the Principal Investigator will
examine the suitability of various liquid crystal materials for use as
programmable apertures in astronomical instruments. If successful this technique
could result in very flexible designs for multi-object spectrographs, allowing
rapid reconfiguration of the focal plane to match any observing field and
condition.
