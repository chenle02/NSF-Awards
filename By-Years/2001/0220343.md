The emerging area of algorithmic game theory carries much promise because of new
game theoretic issues arising from the Internet and because of the opportunity
of applying recently developed powerful ideas from the yield of approximation
algorithms to these issues.&lt;br/&gt;BGP is an important network protocol whose
performance affects many applications, and in&lt;br/&gt;fact is critical to the
integrity of the network. It is also one of the rare cases for which some
routing&lt;br/&gt;data is available. We propose to study BGP routing stability
from a game theoretic perspective.&lt;br/&gt;Our work will span all the way from
mathematical modeling to a concrete proposal for developing&lt;br/&gt;network
performance evaluation primitives. Our project is interdisciplinary. Our team,
together with our collaborators in the networking community, combine excellent
complementary expertise and has successfully carried out a theory/networking
project in the past. The impact of this work lies both in developing
mathematical techniques and opening a new channel in technology transfer. We
report several preliminary results. We also touch on other computational game
theoretic issues such as cost sharing and protmaximizing pricing.
