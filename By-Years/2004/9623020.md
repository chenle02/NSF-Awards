Shen 9623020 The investigator develops fast algorithms and robust software for
elliptic problems and constructs, analyzes, and implements fast and accurate
schemes for numerical simulation of unsteady incompressible flows. The numerical
simulation of incompressible flows, which plays an important role in numerous
scientific and industrial applications of current interest, is a challenging
task for both numerical analysts and computational dynamicists. The proposed
fast algorithms are based on the spectral discretization for the space variables
and high-order projection schemes for the time variable. The proposed algorithms
allow accurate numerical simulation of incompressible flows with significantly
less computational effort than the traditional lower-order methods. Fast and
accurate numerical solution of partial differential equations is of major
importance in many fields of science and engineering, including among others
high performance computing, turbulence modeling and numerical weather
prediction. A main objective of this project is to develop fast algorithms with
optimal computational complexity for a large class of elliptic equations, and to
implement them in a high performance software package that is made available to
the public through anonymous ftp and World Wide Web. It is expected that the
proposed fast algorithms and software will become an important tool for many
scientists and engineers.
