With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Alice Harris will coordinate a
meeting to plan a variety of activities associated with the eventual development
of a new initiative within NSF. The long-range goal of these activities is to
dedicate funding to projects that document endangered languages. Such
documentation is significant for (1) the relation between language variation and
hypothesized limitations in cognitive capacity; (2) the ways that constituence
and history of language families inform research on human pre-history; (3) how
knowledge of the natural world is encoded in dying languages.&lt;br/&gt;
