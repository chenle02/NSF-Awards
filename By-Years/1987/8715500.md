This award will support a seminar, jointly organized by Professor Arthur
Bienenstock of Stanford University and Dr. C.E. Williams and D. Raoux of the
Laboratoire de l'Utilisation du Rayonnement Electromagnetique (LURE), University
of Paris XI, Orsay, on the subject of Utilization of Anomalous X-Ray Scattering.
The seminar will bring together scientists from the various disciplines expected
to benefit from this newly emerging materials analysis technique in order to
plan for the optimum utilization of new X-ray sources now being built.
Biologists, chemists, materials scientists, and physicists will be invited to
discuss applications of this technique to the study, for example, of amorphous
and crystalline solids, protein crystals, metallurgy, colloids, and poorly
crystallized solids. This seminar should lead to a rapid diffusion of this new
technique among the various scientific communities represented, and also should
generate new ideas for applications and techniques. The Stanford Synchrotron
Radiation Laboratory and LURE are laboratories which have been pioneers in this
field. The timing of the seminar is opportune in light of the fact that three
new high-brightness X-ray sources--two in the U.S. and one in France--are
presently being developed.
