This project is a three-year laboratory study involving the reactions of ozone
with alkenes and the reactions of peroxy radicals with nitrogen oxide in the
lower troposphere. This study is focused on identifying and characterizing the
role of short-lived intermediates (Criegee intermediates) in these reactions.
The P.I. is in the process of building a system of flow reactors with infrared
and ultraviolet/visible spectroscopy to carry out the study. This project is
expected to contribute to a better understanding of atmospheric oxidation
mechanisms leading to the formation to tropospheric ozone.
