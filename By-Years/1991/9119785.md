Todd J. Martinez has been awarded a Minority Graduate Assistantship in
Chemistry. The Minority Graduate Assistantships in Chemistry are viewed as an
infrastructural investment designed to broaden the participation, knowledge, and
experience of students who are members of minority groups underrepresented in
Chemistry, and attract them into meaningful careers in chemical research and
teaching. %%% Mr. Martinez has a B.S. degree from Calvin College and is
currently in the Ph.D. program at UCLA in the area of Theoretical Chemistry. His
research adviser, Prof. Emily Carter, writes that he has worked out the
equations to do the configuration interaction problem using Friesner's
pseudospectral method. In his proposed plan of research he describes the Monte
Carlo calculations of the electronic structure of iron dimer.
