This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).

With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program Professor
Gregory J. Grant and colleagues Jisook Kim and Kyle Knight from the University
of Tennessee Chattanooga will acquire an automated benchtop X-ray
diffractometer. The instrument will be used to support research activities such
as: 1) transition metal mediated self-assembly of molecular squares and hexagons
using thiacrown ligands, 2) organometallic catalysis of stereoselective organic
reactions, and 3) study of reduction methods in organic synthesis.

An X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full
three dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles,
and provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of a molecule
relative to neighboring molecules. The studies described here will impact a
number of areas, including but not limited to chemistry and materials chemistry.
This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research.
