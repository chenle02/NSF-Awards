Webb 9805515 The principal investigator studies mathematical models of cell
population dynamics. The models consist of linear and nonlinear ordinary and
partial differential equations. Applications of the research are made to the
following projects: (1) population models of the blood production system and the
continuous maturation-proliferation of precursor stem cells; (2) population
models of the pathogenesis of HIV infection of the human immune system and the
depletion of CD4 T lymphocytes during the stages of AIDS progression; (3)
population models of replicative histories of cell lines as indicated by
shortening of telomere fragment lengths on the ends of chromosomes; and (4)
population models of cell loss processes specific to the position G1, S, G2, M,
or G0 in the cell cycle. In these models the principal investigator studies the
behavior of cells at the population level and the dynamic processes of cell
division, cell maturation, cell mortality, naive cell sources, and cell
transition to and from quiescence. The principal investigator utilizes
differential equations theory, operator theory, functional analysis, numerical
analysis, and computational simulation. The significance of the research is in
the development of mathematical methods to analyze the qualitative behavior of
solutions to the differential equations that describe cell population processes.
The principal investigator applies these methods to the qualitative and
quantitative understanding of cell population problems. In this research the
mathematical theory of population processes is applied to analyze normal and
abnormal blood cell production systems, the depletion of CD4 T cells in the HIV
infected immune system during HIV progression to AIDS, and the growth of tumors.
The principal investigator studies these biological phenomena as dynamic
processes described by mathematical models of population behavior. The research
combines theoretical mathematical analysis and numerical computer simulations of
the models. The goal of the research is to advance understanding of normal and
abnormal cell proliferation processes.
