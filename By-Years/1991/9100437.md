PI proposes experimental test of a new model of coalition for- mation in
cooperative exchange networks. Several earlier models predict coalitions
depending upon available communication chan- nels. This model adds several game
theory considerations - most importantly, side payments and concerns with equity
- to ratio- nal actor considerations. The experiments will enable com- parative
assessment of predictions from this model and from earlier, competing models.
Potential applications include calculating the power of actors as a function of
their organiza- tional positions, and designing communication patterns to create
desired power positions in organizations.
