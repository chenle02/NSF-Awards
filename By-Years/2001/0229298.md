ABSTRACT

Proposal Number: CTS-0229298 Principal Investigator: Jimmy J Feng Affiliation:
CUNY City College Title: Orientation coupling between solid particles and liquid
crystalline matrix

The liquid-crystalline polymers (LCP) used in various products show a strong
tendency to align along the flow direction. Since the LCP orientation is frozen
in the solid state product, because of the anisotropy, the tensile strength and
modulus will be small in the transverse direction. In some products, such as
injection molded LCP materials, the product isotropy is important and highly
desirable. The method based on surface-anchoring filler additives to alter the
transport properties of the LCP during the manufacturing processes, is an
innovative approach proposed by the PI in this exploratory project.
