Topology is a very qualitative part of mathematics; it does not distinguish a
round ball from an ellipsoid or a plate or bowl. The measurements done by
topologists are usually mediated by algebraic structures, as the usual notions
of length or volume are meaningless in this setting. The main thrusts of this
proposal are to improve our understanding of the connection between the
algebraic measurements and the geometry and to study the role quantitative
measurements into topology. There are anticipated applications within topology
(e.g., to a deeper understand of the symmetry) and outside of it (e.g., to
differential geometry and possibly data science).

This project is an attempt to deal with fundamental problems in geometric
topology. The classical paradigm in that field is to reduce geometric problems
to ones in algebra, either via homotopy theory or via K-theory or quadratic form
theory. Typically involved, at its most successful, is some version of a Whitney
lemma. This proposal deals with (1) problems involving symmetry, where the
relevant Whitney lemma is known to be false and (2) with the understanding of
quantitative aspects of solutions to topological problems that are sidestepped
in the algebraic treatments. The methods involve Goodwillie's calculus of
homotopy functors, controlled topology, stratified surgery, rational homotopy
theory, and index theory. Besides its impact within topology, this work could
expand our understanding of the geometry of function spaces, with implications
in analysis, and also, indirectly, geometric methods of data analysis.
