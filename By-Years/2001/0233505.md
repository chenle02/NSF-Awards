CCSSO has established a collaborative research team involving Wisconsin Center
for Education Research (WCER) and American Institutes for Research (AIR) to
investigate how professional development programs and activities in multiple
sites (approximately 5 districts participating in MSP) can be evaluated using a
common set of research-based measures, and how a survey methodology can be used
to evaluate the effects of professional development in improving instruction in
mathematics and science. The project will survey 640 middle school teachers
about what and how they teach. Specifically, the study will address the
following research questions. 1) To what extent is the quality of the
professional development supported by MSP activities consistent with a research-
based definition of quality?&lt;br/&gt;2) What effects do teachers' professional
development experiences have on instructional practices and content taught in
math and science classes? Are high-quality professional development activities
more likely than lower-quality activities to increase the alignment of content
with state standards and assessments? 3) How can MSP projects use study findings
to improve professional development and the content and instruction of
mathematics and science classes?&lt;br/&gt;
