The objective of this program is to demonstrate to African-American and
Hispanic students in the Calumet region the real life relevance of and
opportunities in engineering and science. This s a five-week summer program for
students completing grades 6, 7, and 8 with follow-up activities in subsequent
years. This is a cooperative effort between Purdue University-Calumet and Gary
and East Chicago school systems. The key feature is the structure which ties
math, science, and applications together; thus topics are chosen so that the
participants see the importance of math as a basic tool, and its application to
engineering and science. Hands- on laboratory and computer usage sessions and
industrial tours are provided.
