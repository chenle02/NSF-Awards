Computer symbolic manipulation systems will be developed to treat many of the
most interesting tensorial problems that appear in higher-dimensional, higher-
loop and higher-order theories of gravity. Using the extremely powerful
microprocessor-based scientific work-stations (with speeds that rival
supercomputers for some applications), current symbolic manipulation languages
will be extended and supplemented to perform very detailed computations in
quantum gravity and related theories. As one example, "symbol crunching" will be
applied to the study of the so-called heat kernel techniques for computing
important mathematical structures like trace and axial anomalies, effective
action counterterms, Green's functions, index theorems, stress tensors and other
related objects. Such computations, which must be done with perfect accuracy,
are possible only with high-speed computers armed with special software beyond
any that currently exists in any symbolic manipulation system. Artificial
intelligence techniques may have to be applied to help the physicist with the
analysis of the possible routes toward simplification of the very large
expressions that result.
