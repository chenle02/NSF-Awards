9730682 Gersmehl Activities and Reading in the Geography of the World (ARGWorld)
is a CDROM and a comprehensive set of related hands-on student activities for
use in world geography courses in grades 7, 8 and 9. The CDROMs and the
activities can be used together, but each stands alone. Students use the tools
of geographic analysis to address intuitively interesting problems in compelling
situations. Extensive use is made of original maps, remotely sensed imagery, and
links to relevant web sites and other sources of real-world geographic
information. The CDROM features photographs, interactive maps, and animated
explanations of key concepts of scientific geographic analysis. Weaving together
multiple strands of basic locations, place, images, analytical skills,
explanatory theories and value issues increases the learning of geographic
facts, concepts and skills. The development team has produced previous materials
and has been active in developing the geography standards. An international
steering committee selects case study locations that serve as contexts for
activities. The materials are tested by teachers in state geographic alliances.
Dissemination is assisted by the NASA Education Division.
