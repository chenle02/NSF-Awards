This project will continue analysis of image data and perform in- depth
collaborative studies for investigating the intrinsic properties and sources of
short period gravity waves. This work takes advantage of the high linearity of
CCD data for quantitative measurements of the wave field using 2-dimensional
spectral analysis techniques. In addition, the PI will participate in two
campaigns to further knowledge of the abundance, geographic distribution and
properties of short period gravity waves. These campaigns will gain novel data
important for assessing the "global" impact of gravity waves on the upper
atmosphere meteorology.***
