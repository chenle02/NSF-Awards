9322808 Cetinkunt The award is for research aimed at improving the accuracy of
low speed motion in ultra-precision machine tools by improving control
algorithms. The control algorithm is based on the cerebellar model articulation
controller architecture and is expected to learn machine characteristics such as
friction and backlash, which have a significant effect on machine accuracy at
the low speeds. Nanometer level positioning accuracy is sought. Experimental
work will be conducted at the National Institute of Standards and Technology and
at the grantee institution on a single point diamond turning machine. Ultra-
precision machining is needed for components such as metallic and non-metallic
mirrors for high power laser focusing, mirrors for compact discs and video-
cassette recorders, molds for aspherical lenses, and planarization of silicon
wafers. Achievement of the motion accuracies sought here would therefore have a
beneficial impact on these manufacturing applications.
