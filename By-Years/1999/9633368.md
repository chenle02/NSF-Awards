The focus of this work is fourfold. First, methodology will be developed whereby
biocatalytically synthesized inositol hydroaromatics are abiotically converted
into pyrogallol, phloroglucinol, hydroxyhydroquinone, hydroquinone, catechol and
resorcinol. Second, the uptake of D-glucose in E. coli will be altered to
increase the percent yield of D-glucose into 3-dehydroshikimic acid, a key
intermediate in the biocatalytic synthesis of adipic acid, catechol and gallic
acid. Third, a biocatalytic route to hydroquinone will be created by expressing
the P. chrysosporium gene encoding vanillate hydroxylase in p-hydroxybenzoate-
synthesizing E. coli. Fourth, a biocatalytic synthesis of resorsinol will be
developed using genes encoding gallate-synthesizing and gallate-degrading
enzymes from P. blakesleeanus, K. pneumoniae, P. acidigallici and E.
oxidoreducens. With this Environmentally Benign Chemical Synthesis and
Processing award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of
Dr. John W. Frost of the Department of Chemistry at Michigan State University.
Dr. Frost will focus his work on developing synthetic methodology that allows a
variety of chemicals to be economically derived from carbohydrate feedstocks. In
this way, nontoxic D-glucose, D-xylose and L-arabinose, derived from renewable
corn starch and fiber, can replace carcinogenic benzene, derived from
nonrenewable fossil fuels, as a synthetic starting material.
