This award supports the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site in
Physics and Astrophysics at the University of Rochester. The objective of this
site is to offer undergraduate students nationwide the opportunity to take part
in forefront physics research in eight subfields: particle and nuclear physics,
quantum optics, condensed matter, biological, plasma, astrophysics, geo- and
environmental physics, and physics education. Each student works with a faculty
adviser on a specific project within the context of the overall research focus
of the group. The program may include minicourses in machining, Linux/Unix,
MATLAB and a GRE preparation course offered in conjunction with other summer
undergraduate programs. REU students attend weekly presentations by University
faculty, tours of University research facilities, social outings and may also
take part in the department's summer outreach activities. The program concludes
with a student symposium, at which each student speaks on his/her research
project; in addition students submit written abstracts and reports of their
research experiences. Students are strongly encouraged to continue their
projects toward publication and are eligible for additional support to present
their results at national student and professional conferences. REU activities
engage undergraduates in projects such as physical chemistry, cosmic ray and
high-energy particle detection, and geo- and astrophysics data analysis using
web-based databases.
