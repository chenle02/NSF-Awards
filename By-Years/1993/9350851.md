This project aims to reform the chemistry curriculum and increase retention
through hands-on student use of visualization computers in introductory
chemistry courses. Wide variation in ability to comprehend concepts, poor
college preparation and inadequate writing and language skills of many students,
demand that concepts be presented in an engaging fashion so as to allow
immediate grasp of principles regardless of the students' background. Customized
applications will be quickly and easily developed by combining courseware
already written by the author with the large amount of shareware available at
public archive sites and commercial software such as Mathematica, Interface
Builder, and Renderman. This interactive courseware will be used to illustrate
abstract concepts and model complex phenomena. Students will explore the effect
of changing parameters on a variety of complicated chemical systems. Pre-lab
exercises using computer simulations will familiarize students with equipment
and laboratory protocols before performing experiments. Students will
electronically mail data and lab reports, with graphics and sound annotations as
well, and receive the instructor's voice- annotated and written comments in
return.
