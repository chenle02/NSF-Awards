This research project will investigate wavelength stabilization of a laser
diode for use in a distance measuring interferometer or related device. The long
range benefits of this program will be a low cost linear distance measuring
interferometer for use in precision machine tools, semiconductor manufacturing
equipment, precision metrology and laboratory measurements. A stabilization
technique based upon temperature control of the laser diode will be researched.
The temperature is controlled either by an attached thermoelectric (TE) cooler,
varying the injection current to the laser diode or both. This approach requires
an external interferometer to develop a control signal based upon wavelength
drift if more than crude wavelength stability is to be obtained. In a distance
measuring interferometer, this control signal can be obtained with little
additional effort. Successful completion of this research program will result in
a wavelength stabilized source for use in a compact and low cost linear distance
measuring interferometer which can compete in the same markets as glass scales
as well as many markets currently served by helium-neon based linear distance
measuring interferometer.
