Experimental research will be carried out on the collisions of ions with highly
excited Rydberg states of sodium. Collisions that change the orbital angular
momentum of the target atom will be studied at lower energies than before, down
to a few eV. Measurements will investigate a recently confirmed strong-coupling
effect in which several units h of angular momentum may be transferred in
sufficiently slow encounters. Charge transfer from Rydberg target atoms into
Rydberg projectile states will also be investigated at lower energies in order
to make a definitive comparison between ground-state hydrogen and Rydberg-state
targets. Other effects will be investigated that are related to slow-ion
collisions: the behavior of highly excited states in pulsed or transient
electric fields and the behavior near anticrossings within or between n
manifolds.
