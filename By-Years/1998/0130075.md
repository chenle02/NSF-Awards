This work will begin to map brain circuits that carry the reward signal believed
to be generated when animals successfully meet motivational goals, such as
finding food when hungry. Such a signal is thought to inform the animal that its
current behavior is important to its survival, and to reinforce the continuation
of that behavior. Electrical stimulation of the medial forebrain bundle has long
been believed to create a potent and non-satiating version of the reward signal,
yet the circuitry traversed by this signal outside of this major axon pathway is
still unknown. Brain areas critical to carrying the signal will be revealed by
psychophysically tracking changes in the reward magnitude of medial forebrain
bundle stimulation when target areas distant from the bundle are temporarily
anesthetized. Once reward-relevant targets are identified, the anatomical
relationship of these targets to the stimulation sites will be explored
electrophysiologically. The stimulation-induced neural activity wilkl be
followed to those areas to see whether the neural signals have conduction
properties known to characterize the putative reward signal, and whether the
target areas are directly or indirectly (i.e., transynaptically) linked to the
medial forebrain bundle. This project will increase our understanding of brain
circuits involved in reward, with a long term goal of understanding their role
in consumptive and other motivated behaviors.
