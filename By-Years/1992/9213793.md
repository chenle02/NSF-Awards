Theoretical studies will be conducted on localization problems associated with
the propagation of light in crystals. In particular, research will be done on
(1) band structure and localized impurity modes associated with the propagation
of electromagnetic waves in two- and three-dimensional periodic dielectric
media; (2) transverse Anderson localization effects associated with the
propagation of electromagnetic waves in random dielectric media; and, (3)
localization effects in the heat conductivity associated with the propagation of
acoustic waves in amorphous materials. The band structure and impurity mode
spectra of periodic dielectric media are of potential importance in the
development of laser and solar cell technologies. On the other hand, fundamental
studies of classical waves propagating in random media offer the opportunity for
the prediction of new Anderson localization related phenomena which do not have
complications associated with self-interactions of the system excitations. %%%
The theoretical research will study the propagation of electromagnetic waves,
such as light, through media of different dimensionalities and structure. These
different media can cause the light to behave in strange ways such as bunching
in specific regions. Effects such as these are of fundamental interest in
condensed matter physics and are also of interest to the technology of
photonics.
