Midwest State University will initiate a 6-week residential Young Scholars
project for 12 students in grades 10-11 in earth science. Midwestern State
University will initiate an 8-week residential Young Scholars project for 14
students in grade 12 in chemistry. The Chemistry Department at Midwestern State
University, which has 11 years experience in research projects with high school
students, has designed eight-week research projects for 14 rural high school
students with no more than three students to a professor. These students will
come from within an 80 mile radius of Wichita Falls. They will also receive
formal career counseling, computer training, minicourses in technical writing,
research methodology, and special topics in chemistry. Field trips to several
outstanding research laboratories and participation in two student-faculty
panels on philosophy and ethics are also included. Most of these activities will
continue at M.S.U. on one or more Saturdays each month during the academic year.
