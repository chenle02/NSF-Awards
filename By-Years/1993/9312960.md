This reimbursable agreement provides for the conduct of a statistical survey of
the scientific and technical resources utilized by U.S. companies in the
performance of research and development (R&D) activities. This survey will
produce measures of the dollar volume of R&D performed domestically and abroad,
sources of finance, employment of R&D scientists and engineers, and other
characteristics of R&D and science and technology (S&T) in industry. Under
authority granted by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, NSF collects
and disseminates descriptive economic statistics, as well as other pertinent
information, about scientific and technological resource utilization and
activities. Data collected by the Survey of Industrial Research and Development,
when used in combination with data obtained through other NSF statistical and
analytical activities, provides policy makers with an overview of R&D funding
and performance in the United States.
