A research program in electromagnetic studies of few body systems will be
carried out at Bates, SLAC, and CEBAF. Specifically, electron-proton coincidence
reactions will be used to probe nucleon momentum distributions and short range
2-nucleon correlations. Development work will be carried out on high power
cryogenic gas targets needed for the groups research program. M.S. level
graduate students and undergraduate students will be involved in this research
program.
