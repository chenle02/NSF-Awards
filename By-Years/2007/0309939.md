Geology (42) A new course titled "Environmental Geology Service Learning
Research Projects" is being adapted from the service learning course described
by Mogk and King in the Journal of Geoscience Education (1995). Curriculum
objectives of the course are addressing the National Science Standards of
"Science as Inquiry" by involving students in service learning, environmental
geology, and group research projects. The service learning projects are being
developed in cooperation with resource management staff of Metro Parks, Serving
Summit County and the Cuyahoga Valley National Park. The course structure is
simulating a consulting firm with students working collaboratively as research
teams on a resource management project. The teams are developing the method of
investigating the problem, preparing a proposal and budget, collecting and
analyzing the data, preparing a final report, poster and press release. At the
culmination of the course, students are presenting the results of their project
to the public at an open house. The primary audiences for this course are 2nd
and 3rd year geology majors, and middle school through high school pre-service
science teachers. The program is being evaluated using a variety of quantitative
and qualitative assessments such as pre- and post-writing assignments, student
self-reports, the "Nature of Scientific Knowledge Scale" standardized
instrument, and standard student evaluations (IDEA form). The broader impacts of
this project include improving student learning of "Science as Inquiry" by
integrating service learning into a collaborative research experience in
environmental geology. The course is enhancing the education of students
planning to pursue careers in Geoscience and Environmental Science, and should
enable future teachers to better incorporate inquiry-based methods into their
teaching.&lt;br/&gt;
