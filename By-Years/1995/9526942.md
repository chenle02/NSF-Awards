Imagining an event and watching it unfold in the mind's eye is a common
experience of most people. It has often been proposed that this is one basis for
thinking about events and predicting their outcomes, and that thereby it is an
important method of reasoning, planning, communicating, and understanding. This
research attempts to place such imagistic reasoning on a firm theoretical
footing by characterizing it as precisely defined computations performed on
mental representations. The research focuses on the use of diagrams as a vehicle
for reasoning about spatial relations and mathematical concepts that can be
understood by spatial analogies. Spatial reasoning and diagram interpretation
are important abilities of humans, and machines with similar abilities have
advantages over machines without them, including a more natural mode of
interaction with people. The goal of this research is a better scientific
understanding of human cognitive psychology, and the basis of a technology for
machines that can think directly in images. Potential applications of spatial
reasoning programs and theory include automated navigation systems, improved
computer-human interfaces, improved methods for clearly presenting scientific
data and control panel information, methods of diagnosing faults in machines,
and improved methods of technical instruction.
