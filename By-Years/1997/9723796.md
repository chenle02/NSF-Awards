Nerve cells use calcium ions to convert electrical signals into biochemical
changes within the cell. Electrical activity increases intracellular calcium.
Once inside the cell, calcium acts as a messenger carrying information to
various parts of the cell interior where it acts to trigger processes ranging
from gene expression to the release of neurotransmitters and hormones. Only
during electrical stimulation, or during certain pathologies, is the calcium
concentration in the cell elevated. Under normal conditions the intracellular
calcium concentration is kept very low by a complex series of pathways which
pump calcium out of the cell. The objective of this proposal is to study the
modulation of three calcium regulatory processes. 1) Within the cell are
specialized organelles that take up, store and release calcium. The signals that
regulate the coupling of electrical activity at the cell surface to the release
of calcium from these internal stores will be studied. 2) Another intracellular
organelle that can take up calcium is the mitochondrion, the cell's powerhouse.
Using recently developed methods to measure calcium within the mitochondrion,
factors that influence mitochondrial calcium uptake will be determined. 3)
Calcium loads are ultimately removed from the cell by pumps embedded in the
cell-surface membrane. There are many genetic varieties of these pumps. It is
not known how these variants differ functionally. The functional characteristics
of individual pump variants, particularly their sensitivity to modulation, will
be determined. To achieve these goals neurons will be grown in culture (in a
dish), and studied individually with optical and electrophysiological
instrumentation developed by the investigator. This work will increase our
understanding of how neurons process information at the molecular and cellular
level, and may reveal new targets for drugs.
