This award will support the planning activities for the development of the
Global Ocean Ecosystems Dynamics Initiative of the NSF Global Geoscience Program
and the U.S. Global Change Program for a period of two years. This initiative
will address the role of physical ocean processes in the variability of
populations of animals in the world's oceans and thereby assess the potential
influences of changing global climate on animal abundance, distribution and
production. Support will be used for workshops on technology conceptualization,
theory and model international development and coordination of GLOBEC research;
and for publications of the initiative.
