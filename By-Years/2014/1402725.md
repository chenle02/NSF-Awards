The western blacklegged tick, Ixodes pacificus, is an important vector of
diseases between wildlife and humans in the West, transmitting both Lyme disease
and anaplasmosis. The ecology of these ticks is complicated and poorly
understood, with many animal hosts that may serve as intermediaries in the
spread of the diseases. Using next generation DNA sequence data from both ticks
and the animal hosts from which they were collected, as well as cutting-edge
spatial genetic statistical methods, the researchers investigate (1) whether
ticks collected from different host species are more genetically differentiated
than would be expected given their geographic separation, and (2) whether the
relatedness between host individuals of the same species predicts the
relatedness of the ticks that infest them.

It is difficult to observe the spread of vectors and pathogens in nature, but a
grasp of the dynamics that govern the distribution of a disease and its vectors
can be of crucial epidemiological or economic importance. In this study,
researchers will use genetic data to uncover critical clues about the natural
history and ecology of an important vector of human diseases, as well as
valuable insights into the ecology of the diseases themselves.
