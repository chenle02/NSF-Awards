With the advent of emerging e-Science applications, today's scientific research
increasingly relies on petascale-and-beyond computing over large data sets with
petabyte-and-beyond sizes. Representatives include analytics- and simulation-
driven applications such as the human vision simulation, astrophysics data
analysis, earthquake modeling, climate modeling using ensemble runs, etc. In
many of the above-mentioned fields, scientists are dealing with large amounts of
data and analyzing them to explore new concepts and ideas. These applications
make up data-intensive HPC analytics, which lies at the intersection of current
HPC and Data-Intensive Scalable Computing (DISC).&lt;br/&gt;When HPC systems use
traditional configurations to support data-intensive HPC analytics, data is
copied from a large remote storage system to diskless compute nodes for
processing. Copying data back and forth is an expensive and time consuming
process. These data-intensive applications do not require compute intensive
resources, but rather moderate compute power machines with the capability of
local storage so that data can be processed in-place. One such example of this
configuration is the Hadoop framework. However, there are currently limitations
in this framework which must be overcome in order to make Hadoop an effective
HPC tool. The investigator is leveraging the Hadoop framework to process large
amount of patterned data in HPC. This research program includes three thrusts.
It is developing the MapReduce API to support a wider range of I/O access
patterns, various data restructuring schemes to improve I/O performance for
these access patterns, and an efficient scheduling scheme considering multiple
chunk locations and data transfer latencies over the network. The research is
integrated into several educational activities, such as the development of data-
intensive HPC curricula.
