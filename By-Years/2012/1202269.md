Objective: The objective of this project is to investigate a tunable wetting
mechanism on a smart polymer - dodecylbenzenesulfonate-doped polypyrrole
(PPy(DBS)) - for manipulating liquid droplets at ultra-low-voltages (~1.5V).
&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This research will address fundamentals of
wetting mechanism on a smart polymer surface, which are not well understood for
microfluidic applications. In particular, this experimental study will provide
insights to what extent Marangoni stress contributes to the overall droplet
behavior, facilitating better understanding of inter-relationship between
surface wetting and droplet manipulation. Further, this project will enable the
development of lab-on-a-chip devices which can bi-directionally transport liquid
droplets, but at orders of magnitude lower voltages than existing techniques.
&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: Successful research on this tunable wetting concept
will impact a wide range of microfluidics applications including on-chip sample
preparation and handling, and lab-on-a-chip devices manipulating complex
biological fluids, attributed to the low-voltage operation. In particular, it
will enhance portability and in-field operation of digital microfluidic devices,
since the system can be operated using standard batteries. In addition, this
research will serve as the basis for educational initiatives with a special
emphasis on recruiting and mentoring students from under-represented minorities,
while forging institutional affiliations with organizations such as the Women in
Engineering Program and Advocates Network, the National Action Council for
Minorities in Engineering, and Alliances for Graduate Education and the
Professoriate. Furthermore, the program will work with the Center for Innovation
in Science and Engineering Education at Stevens to extend this effort to K-12
outreach endeavors.
