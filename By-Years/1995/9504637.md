Dr. Carmichael S. Roberts has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral Research
Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. Roberts received his doctoral degree from Duke
University under the supervision of Professor Bertram Fraser-Reid. Dr. Roberts
will continue research at Harvard University under the sponsorship of Professor
George M. Whitesides. His postdoctoral research will target cell adhesion
processes relevant to the influenza virus. The research will focus on
understanding better a structure-activity relationship of neuraminidase, a
catalyst in post-infection release of newly formed virions from the host cell,
by developing polymeric inhibitors of its activity. The interaction of
biocompatible polymers with the influenza virus will help define the importance
of polyvalency and multicooperative binding observed during infection, and in
the cell adhesion processes in general. The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in
Chemistry Program is viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to
broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph. D.s and attract them into
meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and teaching.
