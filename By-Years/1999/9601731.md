This award from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program (ARI) will assist
the Department of Chemistry at Florida State University acquire an EPR. This
equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including the following:
(1) photosynthesis (2) photochemistry involving transient paramagnetic Species,
and (3) transient EPR of kinetics processes. An electron paramagnetic resonance
(EPR) spectrometer is an instrument used to obtain information about the
molecular and electronic structure of molecules. It may also be used to obtain
information about the lifetimes of free radicals which are often essential for
the initiation of tumor growth and/or a variety of chemical reactions.
