Title: Environmental Transportation Technology In response to environmental
concerns and nation's dependence on foreign produced oil, government mandates
have forced the transportation industry to identify, develop, and employ
alternatives to the internal combustion engine. At the same time, the
development of new fuels and technologies has outpaced the supply of adequately
educated technicians to satisfy industry demand. Traditionally, transportation
technicians have been trained in short term programs, but these programs are no
longer adequate since the new technologies require a different core of
knowledge. This project is developing a new 11 - 14 program leading to as
associate degree in environmental transportation technology with particular
emphasis on new curriculum in technical areas in gaseous fuels technology
combined with a broad general education component in science, information
science, communications, mathematics, and applied physics. Participating
directly with College of the Desert to create and test this new program are
three other community colleges in California (San Diego Mirimar, Alameda, and
Rio Hondo). These institutions are joined in this effort by five other
California community colleges who form the Advanced Transportation Technology
Initiative, the Desert Tech Prep Consortium, the American Society of Advanced
Fuels Technology, and numerous industrial and government partners. Workshops for
two-year college faculty and secondary school teachers are being conducted to
develop expertise in this new curriculum.
