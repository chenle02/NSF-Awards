This proposal outlined a program to use the sol-gel and polymer pyrolysis
processes to produce oxides (mullite and stabilized zirconia) and non-oxides
(SiC and Si3N4) fibers. The emphasis will be on developing a fundamental
understanding the processes. %%%% This proposed program aims in developing a
fundamental understanding the processes used to produce oxides and non-oxides
via the sol-gel route. Mullite and stabilized zirconia are the oxides planned
for study, SiC and Si3N4 are non-oxides planned. The study will make significant
contributions to a very useful and important field of reserach
