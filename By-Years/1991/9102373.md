This proposal is for continuation of thermospheric tidal studies being
conducted with NCAR Thermosphere/Ionosphere General Circular Model. This work
directly addresses two goals of the NSF CEDAR program; detailed understanding of
the low thermosphere global dynamics and mesosphere/thermosphere coupling. There
have been advances in tidal studies. Key developments are; 1) the
parameterization of the waves excited in the lower atmosphere in the
thermosphere models to better represent the coupling between the lower and upper
atmosphere; 2) the inclusion of both the upward propagating diurnal and
semidiurnal waves in the thermospheric models; 3) the self-consistent
ionosphere/thermosphere coupling in models; 4) the availability of simulation of
simultaneous observations of thermospheric winds and temperatures for the first
time from loe, mid and high latitude stations. Such data sets are invaluable for
testing theoretical tidal models. The research proposed has two main emphasis:
1) the provision of model simulations in support of campaigns; and 2) the
continuation of theoretical tidal studies. The main topics of interest for the
latter are: monthly simulations of the thermospheric tides during the solar
cycles minimum and maximum; the effects of geomagnetic activity on the
thermosphere, including the zonal mean/tide/gravity wave interaction; the
effects of diurnal tides on the thermosphere/ionosphere; and the latitude
atmosphere/ionosphere. Investigation may be extended to the vertical velocities,
the terdiurnal and quatradiurnal tides, the midnight temperatures anomaly, and
the possible derivation of tidal information from the descent of sporadic E and
F1 layer.
