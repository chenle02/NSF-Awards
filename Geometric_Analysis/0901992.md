Abstract

Award: DMS-0101050 Principal Investigator: Fengbo Hang

This project will study the impact of topology on some variational problems for
maps between manifolds and investigate some conformal invariant differential
equations. Sobolev spaces of weakly differentiable maps appear naturally in the
solution of variational or differential equations problems, but the fundamental
theorems on Sobolev spaces of maps between regions in Euclidean spaces are not
necessarily reproduced for maps between manifolds. Topology in the domain and
range of a mapping space can prevent approximation of an arbitrary Sobolev map
by smooth maps and can force singularities to appear in solutions to variational
problems. The principal investigator's work aims to understand the analytical
description of some of these topologically forced singularities. Some particular
topics include the rectifiability of defect measure of a general Sobolev map,
Ginzburg-Landau type approximation for maps which are not weak limits of smooth
maps, gap phenomena, extension of maps with energy control, travelling waves in
planar antiferromagnets, and singularities of minimizing p-harmonic maps. Tools
include geometric measure theory, analytical techniques for simplified Ginzburg-
Landau models, differential topology, and homotopy theory.

Physical problems often admit formulations that seek to minimize energy or some
energy-like quantity over a large family of allowable configurations. For
example, the path of a beam of light follows the shortest route between two
points, minimizing time and distance. An important mathematical device for
solving such "variational problems" is sometimes called the direct method: a
sequence of realizable configurations that drive energy down toward a lowest
possible value is used to construct a genuine minimizer, usually by picking out
a subsequence that converges. To make this process work mathematicians tend to
work in enriched environments such as the Sobolev spaces cited above. These make
convergence easier to establish, and then one has to show that the candidate
minimizer is actually present in the original setting. It is a relatively recent
discovery that this procedure sometimes fails if the domain and range of the
maps being studied has a bit of topological complexity, and the principal
investigator's projects seek to analyze the nature of these occasional failures.
