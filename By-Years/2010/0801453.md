&lt;br/&gt;Transparent Solar Cell Antennas for Small
Satellites&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to develop
modular transparent antenna designs that can be placed on top of commercially
available solar cells. This is an important step forward for small satellite
designs, allowing an inexpensive after-market antenna to be integrated with an
off-the-shelf solar panel to provide the least expensive, most flexible design.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The approach is to use wire
meshes to build patch antennas that can be adhered to the surface of the solar
cell, or to use ink-jet printing to print these designs. The materials and
designs will be optimized using a genetic algorithm to create patterned antennas
that may appear random but provide significant improvements in performance. This
project will provide a significant cost reduction for small satellites, which
are becoming the backbone of inexpensive space science for universities and low-
cost deployment for industry. Other applications for transparent antennas
include integration onto window glass of buildings or vehicles, wearable
antennas (on clothing) and antennas for vehicles built from non-conducting
composites (the future of most cars and airplanes).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impact&lt;br/&gt;The technology broadens communication system architecture where
security, amiable appearance, and space limitations are important. The design
and prototyping methods used for this project can also be used in student
courses, potentially allowing college and high school students to participate in
highly creative antenna design projects. The project will broaden participation
of under-represented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
