This is a proposal to fund the early planning, design and development of the
KOPIO detector in FY 2003. The KOPIO experiment is a part of the Rare Symmetry
Violating Processes (RSVP) program approved by the National Science Board in
February 2001. However, for a variety of reasons MREFC funding for construction
of the experiments has not yet begun. In order to proceed in an orderly manner
with the RSVP experiments, the Physics Division has provided modest R&amp;D
funds to develop the experimental detectors required. This proposal is part of
that activity.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Specifically, this proposal seeks R&amp;D
funds for:&lt;br/&gt;Engineering of KOPIO's most critical elements, which
include micro-bunching of the AGS beam at the Brookhaven National Laboratory,
design and prototyping of the neutral beam, and the decay vacuum
tank,&lt;br/&gt;Detector sub-system development,&lt;br/&gt;Design and
integration of the experimental area with the detector,
and&lt;br/&gt;Establishment of a Project Office.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Apart
from the education and training of undergraduate students, graduate students and
postdocs, and the general impact of frontier scientific discovery on society,
the broader impacts of this proposed research are not discussed specifically in
this proposal. However, reference is made to the RSVP construction proposal
(MREFC) in which activities to reach a much broader audience for science are
discussed. &lt;br/&gt;
