This project explores the foundation for innovative uses of the emerging
consumer technology Google Glass in scientific fieldwork applied to polar
regions. The new and disruptive Google Glass wearable computing device presents
a unique opportunity for researchers to engage in the early development stages
of a device poised to heavily impact the course of technological innovation.
Glass? hands free operation gives the device particularly strong potential as a
research tool in remote, harsh regions, such as the North Slope of Alaska. As
proof of concept, this project will produce several&lt;br/&gt;small Glass
specific software applications that align with research projects currently in
progress. It will also lay framework the development of supporting
cyberinfrastructure activities, such as innovative network approaches for remote
fieldwork, cost effective&lt;br/&gt;sensor integration, new methods of
communication for remote classroom programs, and smarter data collection
methodologies through technology. The project directly addresses the development
of a polar cyberinfrastructure. &lt;br/&gt;
