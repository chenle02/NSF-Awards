The feasibility of the double spiral reactor/heat exchanger was shown in Phase
I. Phase II research comprises three main tasks: 1. To design and build a spiral
reactor that closely resembles the commercial model. 2. To determine its
performance. 3. To develop an improved mathematical model of the reactor. The
aim of Task 1 is to make the spiral reactor leak tight, heat tight, and of
minimum weight. Task 2 will include measurements of temperature and heat
transfer coefficients. The improved model from Task 3 will be used to calculate
the dimensions of a commercial reactor for any given flowrate and heat input.
The goals in Phase II are to produce: 1. A procedure for manufacturing the
double spiral reactor and an estimate of the cost. 2. An improved mathematical
model. 3. Experimental data to confirm the model. This Phase II SBIR research is
to bring to technical commercialization a device for cleaning contaminated air
in confined working and living spaces. The decontamination is to be accomplished
by incineration, and the novel feature of the device is the attainment of the
requisite temperature level without causing intolerable heating of the confined
space whose air is to be cleaned. The Phase I work demonstrated that the
temperature level could be attained. Phase II must deal with the heat loss issue
as well as with the manufacturing of the device.
