This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY 2008. The
fellowship supports a research and training plan entitled "Phylogenetic and
Biogeographic Patterns of Coral Triangle Fishes: Illustrating Biodiversity
Patterns in the Encyclopedia of Life" for Joshua A. Drew. The host institution
for this research is the Field Museum of Chicago, and the sponsoring scientist
is Dr. Mark Westneat. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The coral reefs of the Indo-Pacific
are home to the greatest diversity of species in the world. How so many species
have evolved there remains one of the central questions of marine biodiversity
studies. This research is looking at whether the high number of species in the
Indo-Pacific is due to home grown diversity or due to imports from other regions
such as the central Pacific or Indian Ocean. To figure out where this diversity
originates this research is building a "family tree" for two highly diverse
groups of fishes. The origin of the species (whether native to the Indo-Pacific
or from other regions) is determined depending on where the species falls on the
tree. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Training objectives include computational techniques
for analyzing large data rich nucleotide matrices and using web-based databases.
Since marine biodiversity in the Indo-Pacific is under several threats ranging
from over-fishing to climate change, this cutting edge information is being
brought to the widest number of stakeholders, including being presented directly
to the managers in the Indo-Pacific who need to make the conservation decisions
necessary to wisely manage these highly diverse coral reefs.
