This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to establish
the&lt;br/&gt;technical and economic feasibility of a novel technology to
utilize reactive distillation to&lt;br/&gt;produce vinyl ethers, the production
of which is otherwise plagued by equilibrium&lt;br/&gt;limitations and side
reactions. The program will combine the catalysis expertise of
KSE,&lt;br/&gt;Inc. with the reactive distillation strengths of the Department
of Chemical Engineering of&lt;br/&gt;the University of Massachusetts, to develop
the new technology. The resulting work&lt;br/&gt;product will not only advance
the practice of the field of organic synthesis, but also will&lt;br/&gt;provide
useful case study examples for academic teaching and research.&lt;br/&gt;The
Phase I program requires completion of three tasks. First, research is
needed&lt;br/&gt;to improve the catalyst compositions to promote vinyl ether
synthesis, to match distillation&lt;br/&gt;requirements. Second, laboratory
reactor tests, including reactive distillation, must be&lt;br/&gt;performed to
guide catalyst improvement and to demonstrate success of the
technology.&lt;br/&gt;Third, design and competitive economic analyses are
required to complete the feasibility&lt;br/&gt;assessment. The proposed research
will solve a major problem in vinyl ether synthesis,&lt;br/&gt;reducing
byproducts and eliminating solvents. It will also provide valuable teaching
and&lt;br/&gt;research tools for the practice of reactive
distillation.&lt;br/&gt;Commercial applications of the reactive distillation
technology will allow&lt;br/&gt;production of vinyl ethers as an important
building block in organic synthesis,&lt;br/&gt;eliminating the energy intensive
acetylene route based on World War II technology. It&lt;br/&gt;allows new
synthesis methods to be used, by eliminating critical equilibrium
and&lt;br/&gt;byproduct constraints.
