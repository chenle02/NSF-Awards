Four New Brunswick Bioflow III bench top fermentors along with software and a
microcomputer facilitate instruction in fermentation engineering. Projects and
experiments in eight classes instruct students in the fundamentals of fermentor
design, operation, and day-to-day maintenance. Students also use the fermentors
for independent projects.
