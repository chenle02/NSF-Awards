This action funds Joshua M. Grolman of the University of Illinois at Urbana-
Champaign to conduct a research project in Biology and Engineering during the
summer of 2013 at Yonsei University in Seoul, South Korea. The project title is
"Nerves on a Chip: Artificial Neuronal Fibers as Model Biological Systems." The
host scientist is Professor Injae Shin.

Alginate hydrogels have been widely used as encapsulant materials due to their
biocompatibility and ease of forming a gel. However, producing alginate
hydrogels in the desired form and function can be impractical, particularly when
considering the complicated patterns required for tissue engineering
applications. To address these limitations, this work demonstrates a method of
forming intricate fibers using a simple micro-scale device and subsequently
seeding the constructs with P19 cancer cells. These cell-laden fibers can then
be mounted and exposed to retinoic acid to induce change into neural tissue,
which may serve as biological models to study White Matter Tracks and neural
networks. The implications of a successful biological model of neuronal fibers
would be far-reaching, both in treatement applications, as well as a tool for
deeper understanding of the underlying biology. Typically, such systems in vivo
are very complex and difficult to study due to a lack of control over many of
the variables.

Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce. Furthermore, the results of these studies will be
published in a peer-reviewed journal and disseminated within the academic
community help further medical research.
