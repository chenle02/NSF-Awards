Networks of computers have become very common, so it is very important to
develop methods for reliable and efficient communication between computers. One
low cost scheme is to have a single shared communication medium, called a
multiple access channel, such that every computer can receive all messages sent
over the channel. This scheme is currently used by the Ethernet and other
networks. If two or more computers send messages simultaneously, they will
interfere with each other, and no useful information will be transmitted. The
main goal of this research project is to develop improved probabilistic and
deterministic algorithms which coordinate the computers' access to the channel
so that the percentage of time in which useful information is transmitted is
maximized. Also, the maximum possible percentage of useful time on multiple
access channels will be determined. The algorithms for multiple access channels
will be used to develop efficient algorithms for parallel computers. A second
focus is to develop fast algorithms which design minimum cost network topologies
that are resistant to failures.
