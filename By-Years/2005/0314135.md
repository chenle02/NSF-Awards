ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;The International Conference and Research Center for Computer
Science in Dagstuhl regularly organizes scientific workshops, called Dagstuhl
Seminars. These are not a fixed series of workshops, rather are individually
arranged. A few scientists are responsible for each seminar, and they must apply
to the Scientific Directorate of the Center for a seminar to be held. Only
proposals with high scientific merit are accepted. The 2003 Dagstuhl Seminar on
Deduction was proposed by an international team of researchers led by Deepak
Kapur, University of New Mexico, Andreas Podelski, Max-Planck-Institut fuer
Informatik, and Andrei Voronkov, University of Manchester (UK), and is being
held April 21-25, 2003. Fifteen researchers and students are participating in
the workshop.&lt;br/&gt;
