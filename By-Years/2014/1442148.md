The yeasts are model organisms for understanding and integrating the genetic and
ecological factors that drive species diversification and generate biodiversity.
Yeasts show remarkably different types of metabolism, allowing them to
successfully inhabit every continent and every major aquatic and terrestrial
habitat, however little is known about the distribution of these traits among
the diversity of yeast species. By creating and analyzing the first
comprehensive genomic dataset and catalog of metabolic diversity for a high-
level taxonomic rank (subphylum), this project will provide insight into how key
changes in metabolism shape eukaryotic microbial ecology and diversity.
Inclusive large-scale analysis of the genome data will be fostered by creating
an interactive web-based interface for researchers, clinicians, teachers, and
students to explore the subphylum as a model for understanding the making of
biodiversity. These data will be of potential value for practitioners using
yeast to improve industrial and medical processes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
goals of this project are to determine the metabolic and ecological diversity of
the Saccharomycotina subphylum at the genetic and phenotypic (e.g. metabolism,
morphology) levels, and then to infer the tempo and mode of change across its
history. To determine the genetic basis of metabolic diversity, the project will
generate functionally annotated genome sequences for all ~1,000 known species
and compare genome content with ecological and metabolic data from the entire
subphylum. The project will accurately reconstruct the phylogenetic
relationships of all known species and will use these relationships to develop a
stable taxonomy of medically and biotechnologically important yeasts. The
project will provide new insights into the manner in which biodiversity arises
and the key changes that drive and shape it by tracing the history of yeast
metabolism, ecology, and pathogenicity.
