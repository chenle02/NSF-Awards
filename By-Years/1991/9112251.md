Theoretical and experimental studies are conducted on metal alloy
microstructural evolution during rapid thermal cycling. Particle dissolution,
grain growth, liquid film formation, and subsequent solidification of
intergranular liquid are considered. A physical model of the process is being
developed, computer simulation employed, and experimental verification pursued.
Analytical transmission electron microscopy is the primary microanalytical
technique. The completed research should produce a computational model of
microstructural evolution during a complete thermal cycle typical of a weld
heat-affected zone. %%% Many multiphase alloys are subjected to rapid thermal
processing, such as welding and surface modification through high energy beam
melting or thermal spraying. This research will provide a verified computational
model applicable to these processes.
