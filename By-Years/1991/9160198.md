The pollution control field is in need of an efficient, cost- effective in situ
treatment process to remediate aquifers contaminated with chlorinated aliphatic
compounds such as trichloroethylene (TCE). Successful in situ treatment of
saturated zone soils and liquid requires the presence of metabolically capable
bacteria in the polluted target zone. In many cases, metabolically desirable
microorganisms may not be present in the contaminated zone, or may be unevenly
distributed throughout the subsurface. TCE is a common ground water contaminant
that is very efficiently degraded by the aerobic methanotroph Methylosinus
trichosporium OB3b. However, M. trichosporium, like most soil isolates, has
natural adhesive properties which cause them to bind to soil surfaces, thus
limiting their accessibility to the contaminant. We are generating an adhesion
deficient mutant of OB3b capable of moving through an aquifer while actively
degrading TCE and related toxic substances. An organism with this capability
would serve as the basis for a cost-effective in situ treatment technology, or
provide synergistic benefits when combined with current pump-and-treat methods
of purifying aquifers.
