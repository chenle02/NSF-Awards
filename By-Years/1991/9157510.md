With support from the Organic Dynamics Program, Dr. Gellman will study
noncovalent interactions in organic molecules. In particular, Dr. Gellman will:
(i) investigate molecular recognition of carbohydrates by synthetic receptors,
(ii) perform model studies on the non-covalent determinants of protein folding
patterns via investigation of hydrogen bonding and the hydrophobic effect, (iii)
pursue the synthesis of amphiphilic molecules and study some aspects of their
chemistry, and (iv) develop new thioether-based heavy metal ion chelators. %%%
Dr. Gellman's research program seeks to elucidate the role of attractive non-
bonded interactions in determining the structure and function of biomolecules. A
particularly important interaction of this type in biomolecules is provided by
hydrogen bonding. As part of his overall research program, Dr. Gellman is
studying the effects of spatial orientation of bonding partners on overall
hydrogen bond strength. In other work, Dr. Gellman is investigating a new class
of molecules that can adjust their surface polarity in response to the polarity
of the surrounding medium. Such molecules are of potential interest as drug-
delivery agents.
