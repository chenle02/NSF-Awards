The 2018 Maurice Auslander International Conference will be held at the Woods
Hole Oceanographic Institute, Quissett Campus in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, USA
on April 25-31, 2018. Conferences are also planned for the last week of April in
2019 and 2020. These meetings will be a center of activity for the
representation theory of finite dimensional algebras. Each conference will be a
combination workshop/conference/student presentation event and will serve three
principal objectives: (a) to improve understanding of basic background knowledge
in the field of representations of finite dimensional algebras and related
topics, (b) to keep participants up to date on the newest developments in the
field and (c) to give early-career, US-based researchers an opportunity to
showcase their results to an international audience. The conferences will bring
together researchers working in representation theory and related areas of
combinatorics, invariant theory, commutative algebra, homological algebra, and
mathematical physics. Each day of the conference will start with an expository
lecture by a prominent international expert. This will be followed by one or two
presentations by students. The rest of the lectures will be traditional
conference talks. The last day of the conference will be devoted to mathematical
physics and its relation to representation theory. The conference website is
