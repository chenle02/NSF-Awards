Most information is communicated in the form of waves, and it is critical to
carry out wave simulations to advance science and engineering disciplines. In
fact, computational wave propagation has become a fundamental, vigorously
growing technology in diverse disciplines ranging from radar, sonar, seismic
imaging, medical imaging, submarine detection, stealth technology, remote
sensing, and electronics to microscopy and nanotechnology. These fields and
applications are of great strategic value in the petroleum industry, in medical
imaging, and in materials science. One of the most challenging problems in
computational wave propagation is how to carry out large-scale high frequency
wave propagation efficiently and accurately. This research project develops
novel, fast numerical methods for high frequency wave propagation to tackle this
long-standing challenge.

The investigator will develop and implement new data-enabled fast Huygens
sweeping methods for large-scale high-frequency wave modeling and imaging with
big data sets motivated by industrial and military applications. The goal is to
develop efficient and accurate sweeping methods for the Helmholtz and Maxwell
equations in inhomogeneous media in the high frequency regime and in the
presence of caustics. This project will foster breakthrough innovations in at
least four theoretical and computational aspects: first, fast higher-order
sweeping methods for computing Eulerian geometrical-optics ingredients, such as
eikonals and amplitudes; second, butterfly-algorithm-based fast Huygens sweeping
methods for large-scale high-frequency wave modeling and simulation; third, fast
Huygens sweeping-imaging methods for big seismic data sets; and fourth,
implementations of these new algorithms on a range of novel parallel-computing
architectures. Data-enabled fast Huygens sweeping algorithms will be developed
for the first time for these large-scale imaging applications.
