This project is designed to further develop the Lewis Dots iOS app, expanding
its features. There is an educational need for improved sharing and
collaboration tools in the classroom and the team is working to develop a
prototype to test additional features of their app that harness collaborative
learning, instant metadata feedback, and gamified learning. The Lewis Dots
invention provides user with a touch-screen experience of chemistry. Future
development of this technology plans to enable a more visual tool for
communicating chemistry concepts, allowing teachers to communicate with
students, but also students to communicate with teachers and amongst each other.
The project team's approach considers learning in the classroom as a user
experience from both the teacher and student perspectives.

There are few ubiquitous interactive methods to communicate chemistry amongst
K-12 or higher-education students. Furthermore, the influx of gadgets and media
into students' lives consistently bombard the focus and engagement of students
toward subject material. If this project is successful, the team hopes that the
Lewis Dots app will enhance the learning of chemistry amongst students by
offering a new platform for communication. With the education technology market
experiencing a glut of existing solutions for independent study and
assessment/testing, this project may prove to be a disruptive innovation in the
education technology market, allowing students to better learn from teachers and
from each other.
