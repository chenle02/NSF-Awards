This research project is focused on the measurement of stable isotope ratios in
several important atmospheric gases, that is, ozone (O3), carbon dioxide (CO2),
carbon monoxide (CO), and water (H2O) vapor. The previous NSF-supported project
demonstrated from precise isotopic measurements of oxygen-17 and oxygen-18 in
stratospheric ozone samples that a chemical link exists between stratospheric
ozone and carbon dioxide. In addition, the results from this prior research
revealed that stratospheric ozone is enriched in the two oxygen isotopes of O-
17 and O-18, and that this isotopic enrichment is transferred to CO2 by its
reaction with excited oxygen atoms O(1D) derived from the photolysis of this
isotopically enriched ozone. During the next three years this same research team
will continue to expand their isotopic measurement program so as to isotopically
analyze air samples collected from ground level to 30 km and from 68oN to the
south pole. These measurements will address the questions of the global and
altitudinal variations of the CO2-O3 interactions; the chemical and dynamical
processes responsible for the observed isotopic fractionations of molecular
oxygen (O2), O3, CO2, CO, nitrous oxide (N2O), and water vapor; the possibility
of an unknown stratospheric source of N2O; and the potential utility of CO2 with
its unique stratospheric isotopic signature for quantification of mesosphere-
stratosphere- troposphere mixing. The gas samples will be collected in
collaboration with a number of national and international scientists who are
performing vertical atmospheric measurements with aircraft and balloon
platforms, The samples will be analyzed with the isotope ratio mass
spectrometers that are available in the Department of Chemistry at the
University of California--San Diego. Two graduate students will participate in
this research under the direct supervision of the senior scientist.
