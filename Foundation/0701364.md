The proposal addresses problems in the model theory of o-minimal structures. The
principal investigator plans to develop Borel-Moore homology for sets definable
in o-minimal expansions of fields. One of the goals is to study characteristic
cycles of definable sets. The principal investigator will also consider model
theoretical aspects of non-archimedean amoebas of algebraic varieties.

The proposal is in a branch of mathematical logic called model theory. Model
theory studies mathematical structures by considering the first-order sentences
true in those structures, and the family of alternate structures that also
satisfy all of those first-order sentences. (Sentences in logic are built out of
a small repertoire of elements and constructions. "First-order" refers to the
number of quantifiers in a sentence, a measure of complexity.) In many cases
these alternative structures illuminate some properties of the original
mathematical objects. A good example is the non-standard analysis. A part of
this proposal is an extension on ideas of non-standard analysis to analytic-
geometric categories.
