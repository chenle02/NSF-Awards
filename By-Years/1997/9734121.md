The modeling and numerical approximation of the anomalous diffusion of low
molecular weight penetrates in glassy polymeric systems is developed. This is a
coupled physics problem that involves the theory of deformable mechanics,
nonlinear diffusion, and polymer chemistry Case II diffusion is analyzed. Areas
of application include lithography and adhesive failure. Innovation in teaching
in mechanics and materials is provided through the use of interdisciplinary
problems addressed in the research. Graduate education is enhanced through
mentoring and modernization of course work to reflect practical methodologies
for solution of complex mechanics problems.
