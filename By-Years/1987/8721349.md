This project will support improvements to the research vessel R. G. SPROUL,
owned and operated by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and dedicated to
use in support of ocean science research. The Construction or Conversion
activity of the Oceanographic Centers and Facilities Section provides funds for
upgrading the capabilities of ocean science research vessels through support of
ship construction or conversion. Support is provided for such things as new
deckhouses, improved science laboratory spaces, equipment, the lengthening of
ships and even new ship construction. The Project Director, Dr.George G. Shor,
Associate Director, Scripps, is fully qualified to direct this project having
had considerable experience in overseeing similar activities. This project will
complete the installation of an array of boltdown fittings in the main deck,
reconfigure a head/shower/washroom space for more privacy, and install an intake
compartment for uncontaminated seawater experiments.
