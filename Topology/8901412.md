8901412 Freedman The fundamental group restrictions presently required on the
basic tools of 4-dimensional topology will be further explored. An effort will
be made to evaluate -- zero or non-zero -- previously defined obstructions to
the unfettered application of these tools. Towers of two-fold covers are to be
employed as a useful way of organizing the secondary information whose efficient
handling is a necessity for any successful outcome. The investigator is also
alert to the contrary possibility that the obstruction vanishes, and the present
approach is designed to pursue both possibilities together.
