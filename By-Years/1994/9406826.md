9406826 Barker This proposal for connection of Hiwassee College, Tennessee
Wesleyan College, Sweetwater High School, Vonore High School, Tellico Plains
High School, Madisonville High School, and the Monroe County Vocational School
to NSFNET through SURAnet. SURAnet is the midlevel network located in the
southern United States. These connections will provide operations management and
information services and it will give the colleges and high schools a 56
thousand bits per second connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45
million bits per second) National Backbone network. The benefits of the NSFNET
connection include e-mail between local and remote researchers and educators,
file transfer capability and the ability to use remote computer resources. Also
the colleges and high schools will have the ability to investigate innovation in
educational resources and incorporate them into their curricula.
