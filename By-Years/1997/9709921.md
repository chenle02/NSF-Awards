The investigator continues studying middle atmosphere chemistry and dynamics by
(1) analyzing and interpreting the extensive MesoD dataset on tides and gravity
waves, and (2) deploying the Na wind/temperature lidar at the Starfire Optical
range to study gravity wave momentum, heat and constituent transport. His
dataset covers tidal perturbations in middle atmosphere wind and temperature
profiles, gravity wave propagation directions and their relationships to lower
atmosphere sources and middle atmosphere winds, airglow gravity wave
interactions, and sodium chemistry. The Starfire Campaign focuses on sodium
wind/temperature lidar measurements of gravity wave momentum, heat, and sodium
fluxes, and the associated mean flow accelerations and cooling rates.
