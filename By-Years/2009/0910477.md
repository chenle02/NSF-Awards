This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).

This project focuses on the synthesis and characterization of two new classes of
conjugated oligomers, as the next-generation technologies require the
manipulation of charge and energy of new organic materials with unusual
conjugated features on the nanoscale. Specifically, methods will be developed
for the synthesis of ortho-phenylene oligomers, which will be used as substrates
for oxidative planarization to graphene-based nanostructures. The project
encompasses both the development of synthetic methods and the characterization
of the resulting materials in terms of their electronic structure,
conformational behavior, and supramolecular self-assembly.

With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting
the research of Professor Christopher S. Hartley of the Department of Chemistry
and Biochemistry at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. Professor Hartley's
research efforts focus on the preparation and study of organic molecules with
unusual electronic structure. These materials have great potential for
applications including photovoltaics, organic electronics, and single-molecule
devices.
