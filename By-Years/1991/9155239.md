Clark County School District(CCSD) will provide staff development for
elementary teachers (72 in mathematics, 72 in science) and administrators to
become leaders and agents of change. By means of this systematic plan to empower
educators an opportunity will be created for every K-6 grade student to become
an active learner and scientifically and mathematically literate. The
participants are well prepared teachers who are knowledgeable about content and
conversant with current instructional strategies on how children learn
mathematics and science. The staff for the project include nationally recognized
experts from the Lawrence Hall of Science(U.C Berkeley),The Math Learning
Center(Portland State University), The Center for Excellence in Mathematics
Education(Western Washington University) and TERC. The materials to be adopted
stress the use of manipulatives and hands on learning and include Math and the
Mind's Eye, FOSS and SAVI/SELPH. The leadership component will be patterned on
the California Mathematics Leadership Program(CMLP) an NSF funded project under
the leadership of Ruth Parker who will serve as a consultant on this project. In
the third and fourth years of the program the participants will assume their
responsibilities for leadership by teaching in Staff Development centers
throughout the school district and working with peer teachers in schools. A
history of the project will be maintained by the co- directors. This will serve
to document the process of change and the consequences for teachers,
administrators and students in a large and diverse school district which
includes rural, suburban and inner city schools. This will serve as a model for
other districts planning similar in depth staff development to empower teachers
as agents of change. Cost sharing is equal to 94% of NSF funding requested.//
