A new method for the analysis and design of time integration algorithms is to be
developed. This method will allow an algorithm to be determined from a given set
of error acceptability criteria for the numerical response. Basically, an
algorithm will be analyzed as a filter which converts input (load) into output
(response) and in the process distorts the response above which is normally
associated with the structural transfer function. Thus, a numerical transfer
function is used to measure the effect in phase and amplitude measures for a
particular integrator. a parametric analysis of structural parameters (load,
structure, load-structure interaction spectra) and numerical parameters will be
performed to obtain an overall view of how the method will perform under
different situations. Since the behavior of these measures is a function of
these parameters, appropriate integrators and associated parameters can be
chosen depending on individual simulation characteristics in conjunction with
defined error criteria. This methodology will enable more realistic values of
timesteps to chosen as well as appropriate integrators. The introduction of
these more efficient methods will allow simulation to be longer and finer in
spatial resolution. Ultimately more realistic simulations experiments.
Applications will include the development of an integrator for dynamic fracture
propagation which involves a stiff system having both high accuracy requirements
as well as high and low frequency content.
