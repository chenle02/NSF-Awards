Intellectual Merit: The Pittsburgh Children's Museum (PCM) is developing a 2,700
sq ft traveling exhibition, "How People Make Things," in collaboration with
Family Communications, the producers of "Mister Rogers' Neighborhood." The
exhibition will use the factory visit segments from this popular television
program, the longest running on PBS, as a jumping off point for engaging
children in the processes by which familiar objects are manufactured.

PCM is building on its prior success with "Design It!," an after-school program
funded by a prior NSF grant. This project extends that work to expose children
to the hidden science and technology that form the basis for manufacturing. The
exhibition will include the Neighborhood Factory orientation area and sections
on Making Things: Designing Things, Forming Things (Additive, Subtractive,
Deformational), and Assembling Things. Project collaborators include members of
the Carnegie Mellon University Industrial and Engineering Design program and the
University of Pittsburgh Learning Research and Development Center UPCLOSE.

Broader Impact: The exhibition is projected to reach at least 750,000 visitors
in nine museum venues through its nationwide tour; the target audience is
families with children ages 3 to 10. Promotion and dissemination will be
enhanced by the connection with PBS, which continues to air the "Mister Roger's
Neighborhood" program. Partnerships with the AFL-CIO, Catalyst Communications,
and Society of Manufacturing Engineers will extend the outreach effort. Special
efforts will be made to target girls and underserved audiences.
