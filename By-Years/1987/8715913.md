This grant provides for the participation of David Hofmann of the University of
Wyoming in the third National Ozone Expedition (NOZE-3). He will make balloon
borne measurements of ozone, temperature, humidity and aerosol profiles from
McMurdo, Antarctica during the late winter and early spring. Hofmann's previous
work has lent much insight into the development and causes of the annual
springtime depletion of ozone over Antarctica. Balloons will be flown from
August, throughout September and into October. A variety of payloads will be
flown that will provide not only ozone profiles, but aerosol size distributions
and profiles as well. It is becoming increasingly evident that the aerosols and
Polar Stratospheric Clouds (PSC) play an important role in the destruction of
the ozone and understanding them is crucial to increasing understanding the
ozone hole. This group has been extremely productive in the past, and without
doubt they are the world's experts in stratospheric aerosol studies of this
kind. The facilities are unparalleled.
