This project will identify all the shocks in 1 AU spacecraft data from IMP 8
(1973-2001), WIND (1994-2001), and ACE (1997-end of grant) and characterize
their strength and orientation. Comparisons of multi-spacecraft data for the
same shock will be used to determine the scale size of the events. These long
data sets will then be employed to document the solar-cycle variations in shock
frequency and characteristics. A cross-correlation of the determined shock
characteristics with geomagnetic activity indices will be carried out in order
to determine if knowledge of upstream shock characteristics is useful in
predicting the duration and severity of geomagnetic storms.
