The research involves studying a number of questions in minimal surface theory
and harmonic maps. These mainly concern moduli studies relative to the intrinsic
analytic and topological properties of the surfaces: their conformal structure
and genus in particular. Rigidity questions are also proposed as well as
constructions of classes of minimal tori in the complex projective plane using
methods of soliton theory and algebraic geometry.
