Engineering - Other (59)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project supports a highly
visible dissemination outlet for grant holders in the Course, Curriculum, and
Laboratory Improvement (CCLI) and Advanced Technological Education (ATE)
Programs. The investigators are organizing poster sessions at the American
Society for Engineering Education's (ASEE) Annual Conference in 2009, 2010, and
2011. The project invites engineering grant award recipients in CCLI and ATE to
submit an abstract for inclusion in the poster session. Submissions are reviewed
for quality and, if accepted, award recipients submit a paper that is published
in the meeting proceedings and present a poster in a special session at the
meeting.
