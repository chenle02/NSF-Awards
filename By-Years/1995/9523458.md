NSF and NASA will jointly sponsor a one-day workshop on the interplanetary
aspects of Space Weather. The workshop is proposed to fall between the Solar
Wind Conference, GEM and CEDAR meetings to take advantage of potential
participants in transit. Primary topics to be included are the solar particle,
photon and plasma influences on space weather, their relative importance, their
causes, and their potential predictability through use of observations and
physical models.***
