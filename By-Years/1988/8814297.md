Dr. William Weltner is supported by a grant from The Experimental Physical
Chemistry Program to investigate the physical properties of small clusters of
metals, semiconductors, carbon and silicon which are trapped in low temperature
inert gas matrices. The primary experimental techniques used in these studies
include optical spectroscopy and ESR/ENDOR spectroscopy. A large body of
experimental data consisting of spin multiplicities, symmetries, optical
transitions, vibrational frequencies, g-tensor elements, hyperfine splittings,
zero-field parameters, and exchange coupling constants will be used to
characterize low temperature matrix isolated clusters of the follow types: 1)
clusters of transition and rare-earth metals, neutrals and ions; 2) clusters of
carbon, silicon, and silicon carbide, neutrals and ions; 3) ionic clusters of
inorganic antiferrro- and ferro-magnetic crystals such as manganese difluoride;
4) microparticles of noble metals; and 5) reaction products of small metal
clusters with oxygen, hydrogen and carbon monixide. An extensive program of ESR
and vibrational spectroscopy in the far-infrared is proposed to allow the
observation of transition metal clusters with large zero-field splittings.
