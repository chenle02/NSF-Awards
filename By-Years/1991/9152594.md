The majority of the students in introductory physics courses experience serious
conceptual difficulties in relating time- dependent kinematic and dynamic
observables. The current literature suggests that (a) this problem is not unique
to one institution, and (b) that microcomputer based laboratories (MBL's) can be
used effectively to develop higher order cognitive skills. The most successful
documented approach uses position, velocity, and force sensors interfaced with a
microcomputer equipped with the software to perform real-time analysis. The
project uses hardware and software currently available on the market, and
standard laboratory investigations are adapted to a cognitive science approach
to instruction. The same microcomputer is being used as measuring instrument,
analytical tool, graphic display unit, repository of assignment write-ups, and
tutorial aid. Pedagogical effectiveness is assessed through a standard
hypothesis-testing procedure. Results are being disseminated through standard
publication channels, workshops for local high school physics instructors, and
ultimately summer student workshops.
