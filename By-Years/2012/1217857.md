The motivation behind this research is to enable broader (and valid) usage of
recent breakthroughs in the field of compressed sensing by improving the
performance of sparse signal reconstruction algorithms. Compressed or sparse
sensing is a new way to recover an analog signal (signal reconstruction) from a
small number of measurements when the signal's support - points where the signal
in question assumes nonzero values - is finite. Sparse signals are the
counterpart to band-limited signals in conventional Nyquist sampling. What makes
this approach so attractive is that the number of samples required to achieve
"perfect" reconstruction is generally very small, and fast optimization
algorithms can accomplish reconstruction. The first step in this research
program will be to find ways to exploit prior knowledge about the nature of the
support of the signal. The ultimate goal is to develop algorithmic approaches
(theoretical/practical) to aid practitioners in formulating realistic
assumptions in applications ranging from wireless communications, machine
learning, DNA micro arrays, and various problems arising in image
reconstruction.

The research focus is on designing polynomial reconstruction algorithms that
could provably bridge the gap between sparsity to measurement density ratios
(S/MDR) recoverable by the current state-of-the-art algorithms and the best
possible situation where the S/MDR approaches 1. Specifically, the region where
there has been a substantial lack of success for current state of the art
approaches. More broadly, the objective is to obtain theoretical guarantees on
the performance quality (complexity, precision etc.) of certain practically
feasible optimization algorithms. Beyond the stated objectives, this work has
the potential for creating powerful mathematical formalisms for solving other
challenging fundamental optimization problems.
