ABSTRACT
&lt;br/&gt;Tarduno&lt;br/&gt;OPP-0241033&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is
a renewal grant based on the Principal Investigator's previous findings which
focused on Late Cretaceous volcanic and sedimentary rocks, preserved in several
basins on north Ellesmere Island that are spatially associated with the Strand
Fiord Large Igneous Province (LIP). Preliminary data demonstrate that the
basalts were emplaced during reversed polarity chron 33R or younger, less than
83 million years ago. Hence, these rocks provide an ideal opportunity to further
examine the evolution of the geomagnetic field (through comparisons of high
latitude records from lavas erupted during and younger than the Cretaceous
Normal Polarity Superchron), and to understand the geodynamic significance of
the Strand Fiord LIP (especially with respect to plume and nonplume models of
formation). The shallow marine to terrestrial sediments associated with these
rocks is also ideal for preserving climatically sensitive&lt;br/&gt;fossils,
which they hope to continue to investigate. The proposed work will support a PhD
student and undergraduate students. Four to six undergraduates per field season
typically take part in the field work. Many of these students will continue
analyses of samples in the laboratory as part of independent study projects and
as part of undergraduate senior theses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
