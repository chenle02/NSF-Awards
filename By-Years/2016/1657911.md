This project, which trains a graduate student in methods of empirical,
scientific data collection and analysis, explores network formation and survival
strategies among forced migrant populations. Forced migrants who move within and
across national borders as a result of events such as conflict, natural or
environmental disasters, and famine are a particularly vulnerable part of the
world's population. Often living in the margins of their new societies, most
live in poverty and face a difficult future. Throughout the U.S., forced
migrants are resettled into diverse places but often the specific kinds of
challenges they face through the resettlement process are not well recognized. A
better understanding of how forced migrants experience displacement and what
resources they rely on to secure livelihoods and improve their well-being is
critical for developing programs and policies that will improve the outcomes of
resettlement efforts and help to build strong communities both in and beyond the
U.S. Findings will be disseminated to aid organizations that explore and manage
the causes, consequences, and complexities of forced migration. The research
also fosters international scientific cooperation, and will broaden
participation of an underrepresented group in the sciences.

Daniel Joseph, under the supervision of Dr. Kristin Monroe of the University of
Kentucky, will examine what strategies are deployed by displaced persons, facing
statelessness and precarious social and economic conditions, to mobilize
resources within and across their communities. This research is based in Anse-Ã -
Pitres, a Haitian city along the border with the Dominican Republic where
thousands of displaced people currently live in makeshift camps. These people,
illegal Haitian migrants and Dominicans born of undocumented Haitian descent,
were forced from the Dominican Republic in August 2015. The researcher will
conduct participant observation and semi-structured interviews over a period of
12 months in different locations including camps, churches, market places,
public gatherings, and food distribution sites. Relations with the displaced
people and the establishment of networks will be facilitated through
coordinating with an on-site relief organization. This research will contribute
to theories of agency and conceptualizations of citizenship beyond the juridico-
legal framework. Furthermore, insights from this research will help to develop
programs and policies aimed at the empowerment of refugees and internally
displaced persons.
