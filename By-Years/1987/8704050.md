Drought is a complex and recurring physical phenomenon that affects large
portions of the United States. Drought contingency plans are a logical mechanism
for state and federal governments to use in improved drought monitoring,
assessment and response. Currently, very few states have fledgling drought
contingency plans. The goal of this climate impacts related research is to
develop an efficient strategy for state level governments to assess and respond
to drought related water shortages. This work is important because it will
produce a comprehensive data base of drought and water supply realted parameters
and indices. The study will also develop a methodology that state governments
could adopt to prepare, test, implement, and evaluate drought contingency plans.
Results will be disseminated to relevant state and federal agencies.
