A comprehensive study of quantum two-atom, few-atom, and many-atom systems will
be investigated. The theory is based on a new understanding of atomic
interactions that has emerged from recent works by the P.I. on slow atomic
collisions and long-range molecules. The theory is focused on a novel use of
multichannel quantum defect theory to develop a universal, effective potential
to describe a variety of long-range many-body interactions.
