Collingwood will investigate the relationship between the singularity theory of
Harish-Chandra modules and the matrix coefficient asymptotics of Harish-Chandra
modules. He will also study several problems related to qualitative features
such as the weight filtration of any degenerate series or generalized principal
series representation. This builds upon recent work of Collingwood which carries
over the highest weight module work of Enright and Shelton to a more general
Harish-Chandra module setting. The theory of Lie groups, named in honor of the
Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie, has been one of the major themes in
twentieth century mathematics. As the mathematical vehicle for exploiting the
symmetries inherent in a system, the representation theory of Lie groups has had
a profound impact upon mathematics itself, particularly in analysis and number
theory, and upon theoretical physics, especially quantum mechanics and
elementary particle physics.
