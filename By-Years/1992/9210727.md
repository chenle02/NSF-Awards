The objective of the proposed research is twofold: (i) to theoretically
understand and predict the radiation properties of thin metallic films from the
fundamentals of microscopic electron transport and electromagnetic wave
propagation, and (ii) to experimentally evaluate the radiation properties of
such films. The theoretical study will evaluate radiation properties by
analyzing coupled Boltzmann and Maxwell's equations. The experimental aspects
will include fabrication of thin films of different materials and thicknesses by
sputter deposition, comprehensive microstructure and surface characterization,
and laser reflection and transmission evaluations.
