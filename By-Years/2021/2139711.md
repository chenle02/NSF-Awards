This award provides funds to the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI)/
National Deep Submergence Facility, which operates the Human Occupied Vehicle
(HOV) Alvin, the Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) Jason II, and the Autonomous
Underwater Vehicle (AUV) Sentry as a National Facility (NDSF). The award is for
operational funds for the deep submergence science vehicles, listed above, in
support of NSF-sponsored research for calendar years 2022-2026. The National
Facility, of which the Alvin, Jason and Sentry are the major vehicles, is
supported primarily by NSF, but also by awards from the Office of Naval Research
(ONR), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and other
federal and non-federal sources. All users of the facility contribute equally to
annual operations through a consistent, vehicle-specific, day rate. NSF is the
cognizant agency with respect to developing NDSF vehicle day
rates.&lt;br/&gt;The vehicles plan a combined 489 operating days in 2022: Alvin
106; Jason 218; and Sentry 165. NSF plans to support 440 of these days: Alvin
105; Jason, 194; and Sentry 141.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
