This award in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program supports the
attendance of several graduate student and post- doctoral researchers at the
Eighth International Conference on Resonance Ionization Spectroscopy. This
conference brings together a multi-disciplinary group of scientists and
engineers interested in the use of tuned lasers to selectively and sensitively
ionize atoms and molecules for analytical measurement applications. The focus of
the conference in 1996 is on the use of these methods in surface analytical
chemistry. The participation of graduate students and post-doctoral researchers
in this conference is important to the future of this important analytical
methodology. This award enables the participation of several young researchers
in the Eighth International Conference on Resonance Ionization Spectroscopy.
Applications of this methodology to surface analytical chemistry is the focus of
this year's conference.
