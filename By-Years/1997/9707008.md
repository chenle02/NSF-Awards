This project involves an award to a junior archaeologist from the University of
Illinois. The research addresses a fascinating archaeological question. In
Western Europe anatomically modem humans replaced Neanderthal populations ca.
40,000 years ago. This physical change is accompanied by an equally marked
cultural change and marks the first appearance in Europe of art, religion,
ethnicity and a series of other `modern` traits. In Western Europe these new
groups are clearly intrusive and the question is where did this transition from
`Middle Paleolithic` to `Upper Paleolithic` take place. If one can solve the
less interesting `when` and `where` issues it is then possible to address the
central questions which involve process. Relatively little is known about the
most likely time period in Eastern Europe and the researcher has located two
potentially relevant sites. These are both well worthy of excavation and it is
especially important to collect dating samples. This pilot project involves a
brief field season will provide the data necessary to plan a full scale project.
