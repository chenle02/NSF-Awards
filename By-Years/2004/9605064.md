*** Palmer This grant will provide initial support for the Ohio State University
Summer Physics Institute which is designed to encourage students to pursue
research careers in physics by introducing them to and engaging in the research
activities of a major research university physics department. The Institute will
support ten-week research internships, including a stipend, subsistence, and
travel. Students will live and work together, guided by their faculty mentors,
in research groups that include graduate students and post- doctoral students.
They will engage in tutorials on computational physics, instrumentation and
electronics, and shop safety and procedures, but the main focus will be the
project that the faculty mentor and the students jointly develop. Group
activities are designed to promote interactions and relationships among the
intern students and the Department's student and faculty researchers. Each
intern will write a project prospectus early in the summer and a final oral and
written report at the end of the summer. The program is intended for students
who are physics majors in undergraduate programs and who are between their
sophomore and junior year or their junior and senior year, but all
undergraduates are encouraged to apply. The focus will be regional, but the
Institute will be advertised nationally. A particular attempt will be made to
involve women and minorities. The many small undergraduate institutions in the
region will be strongly encouraged to send applicants. The recruitment and
selection committee includes a representative of a local small college, as well
as faculty members nationally prominent in areas of outreach to minorities and
women. ***
