Magnetic reconnection is a fundamental process in highly conducting plasmas that
involves rapid changes in the configuration of the magnetic flux lines, with the
conversion of magnetic to kinetic energy. Solar flares, violent events with
significant impact to telecommunications and the electric grid, may involve
magnetic reconnection in a large scale. Magnetic reconnection is inherently a
multi-scale process and causes difficulties in laboratory experimental study,
satellite observations, and computational simulations. During magnetic
reconnection, the magnetic force can create thin localized region wherein the
elevated voltage difference generates intense electric currents and dissipation
- the Hall effect. The Hall magnetohydrodynamics (Hall MHD) model has recently
received increasing attention because of its improvements in predicting the
fast-changing nature of magnetic reconnection compared to other models.
Nevertheless, the mathematical theory of this model is far from being complete.
This project will further advance the fundamental theoretical understanding of
the Hall MHD model by addressing the issues such as existence and uniqueness of
solutions, anomalous dissipation, and long-time behavior of the solutions. The
project will provide opportunities for students to participate in the research.

The Hall MHD model couples the Navier-Stokes equations and Maxwell's equations.
The Hall MHD system is mathematically challenging due to the usual convective
nonlinearities and the additional source term given by the Hall effect. The
project includes investigations on the conservation or anomalous dissipation of
energy and magnetic helicity for weak solutions, uniqueness, or lack thereof for
weak solutions, weak-strong type of uniqueness, and asymptotic uniqueness in
energy space within the framework of determining wavenumber.
