This proposal was received in response to NSE, NSF 01-157. The project focuses
on the development of a new approach to structured atomic deposition and
lithography. Lithography using neutral atom beams focused by standing wave light
fields shows great promise for nanoscale fabrication. However, the method has so
far been limited to the production of spatially periodic patterns, which greatly
limits the versatility of the technique. In this new approach a new method of
synthesizing light induced lenses which permit the creation of a single
localized spot at an arbitrary position in the plane will be used. The spot can
be scanned without mechanical motion using spatial light modulators, such that
arbitrary two-dimensional patterns can be generated. The project is jointly
funded by the Divisions of Physics and Materials Research in the Mathematical
and Physical Sciences Directorate.
