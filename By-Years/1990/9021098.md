Under the direction of Dr. Alan Kolata, a professor of Anthropology at the
University of Chicago, Mr. John Janusek will collect and analyze data for his
doctoral dissertation. Continuing on his previous work, he will conduct
archaeological excavation in the Tiwanaku region in the highlands of Bolivia. He
will focus on domestic areas which served as foci not only for habitation but
also production and excavate at both the core site of Tiwanaku itself as well as
the nearby regional center of Lukurmata. His goal is to compare the two and
thereby gain insight into the Tiwanakian social, political and economic
organization. Through the analysis of artifactual, faunal and floral remains he
will attempt to determine: 1. the extent to which occupational specialization is
present at either site; 2. the role the state played in the redistribution of
materials; 3. whether status differential is evident between sites; and 4. the
local variability in lifestyle and status among residential units in each site.
Tiwanaku marks one of the pinnacles in the development of pre- Columbian social
achievements. In a relatively inhospitable high Andean environment, an empire
was established which incorporated large portions of present day Bolivia and
Peru. At Tiwanaku itself elaborate monuments were constructed and the population
is estimated at between 60,000 - 80,000 individuals. It is unclear however how,
in the absence of a system of writing and such elements as wheeled vehicles,
such an empire developed and was maintained. The goal of Mr. Janusek's work is
to shed light on the social, economic and political factors responsible. This
research is important for several reasons. First, it will increase our
understanding of how complex societies emerge. It will also provide data on an
extremely important and little known site and this will be of interest to a wide
archaeological audience. Finally it will assist in the training of an extremely
promising scientist.
