The major goal of subatomic physics is understanding the structure of the
nucleon. The structure can determined by scattering proton, electron, or
neutrino probes from nucleons. Each probe is sensitive to different aspects of
the nucleon structure. By varying the energy of the probe, the structure can be
determined at different length scales. The objectives of this project are to
measure the structure of the nucleon at distances from about 10% of the nucleon
size up to the size of the nucleon. In addition, the characteristics of neutrino
interactions with various nuclei will be determined with the MINERvA experiment.
The results of these measurements are an important ingredient for other
experiments which aim to understand the properties of
neutrinos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides the scientific impact, this work will
serve to train both undergraduate and graduate students, as well as post-
doctoral students, in the methods of scientific research. This training in
fundamental research provides a strong basis for careers in and outside of
physics. Our students and post-docs have successfully moved to varied careers in
medical physics, homeland security, and finance, as well as continuing in
fundamental research.
