PIs will conduct a "Future Faculty Workshop: Diverse Leaders of Tomorrow" at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This 3 day workshop aims to encourage and
promote careers in academia of underrepresented minorities. The workshop
differentiates itself from other such workshops by focusing on materials
chemistry and engineering. The target participants are PhD students and Post-
doctoral scholars from underrepresented minority (URMs) groups. It is
anticipated that there will be at least 38 highly qualified
participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participants in the workshop will be
introduced to faculty who will serve as mentors during the workshop and
throughout their early career. These mentors will lead discussions on the
benefits of academia, how to obtain positions in academia, and give intervention
strategies on how to overcome barriers to retention and promotion. Workshop
participants will receive feedback and coaching on their research proposal ideas
which will serve as the basis for discussing how to form interdisciplinary
research programs and seek appropriate funding for these programs.
