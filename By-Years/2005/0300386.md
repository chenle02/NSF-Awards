The solutions to today's energy challenges need to be found through increased
electricity generation using alternative, renewable and clean energy sources.
The PI's have determined that an extremely promising source of energy exists in
the world's oceans. The proposed research will be a multi-faceted endeavor
spring-boarding off the PI's prior investigations, and experiences working with
ocean energy companies. The primary focus of the proposed research program is to
perform a comprehensive study of the issues involved in ocean energy extraction.
Endeavors will be focused on: (i) completion of an extensive investigation of
ocean energy extraction technologies followed by analyses and comparisons of the
most promising technologies; (ii) studies of the issues involved in ocean energy
extraction and system integrations; (iii) design, simulation, implementation,
and laboratory testing of a prototype ocean energy extraction generation and
conversion system. This work will be conducted under the GOALI program in
collaboration with a renewable energy pioneer company called Energy Northwest,
whose mission includes fostering the development of renewable technologies.
Additional collaborative support is being extended by the Bonneville
Environmental Foundation (BEF), Portland District of U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers (USACE) and the Oregon Department of Energy (ODOE).
