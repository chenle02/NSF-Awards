The main objective of the research is the development of portable and scalable
algorithms for large scale nonlinear optimization on high performance computers.
The research will be guided by areas of applications such as the optimization of
manufacturing systems, the simulation of superconductivity, and parameter
estimation in meteorology and oceanography. Four classes of optimization
problems will be studied: (1) large unconstrained problems; (2) large problems
with simple bounds on the variables; (3) nonlinearly constrained optimization
with a large number of variables and few degrees of freedom; (4) structured
nonlinearly constrained problems. The long-term goal of this project is to fill
the demand for high-quality algorithms and software for large scale
optimization. The research will encompass a theoretical analysis of new
algorithms, as well as the study of computational issues related to their
effective implementation on advanced computer architectures.
