Nuclei with a large neutron or proton excess can be&lt;br/&gt;produced in
accelerators and exhibit exotic properties,&lt;br/&gt;some of which are crucial
for Astrophysics.&lt;br/&gt;The properties of these unstable nuclei can be
extracted through&lt;br/&gt;reactions with stable targets. It is then clear
that, in order&lt;br/&gt;to determine the structure of these nuclei, one needs
reliable&lt;br/&gt;reaction models. These models should take into account,
from&lt;br/&gt;the start, a realistic picture of the exotic nucleus. One of
the&lt;br/&gt;most important aspects of these unstable nuclei is the
fact&lt;br/&gt;that they break up very easily.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several
simplifications are usually performed in nuclear reaction models.&lt;br/&gt;A
questionable one is the assumption that the exotic nucleus
(projectile)&lt;br/&gt;behaves are two inert fragments, bound together, which
can easily breakup.&lt;br/&gt;In this project we will develop a new reaction
model that goes beyond&lt;br/&gt;this approximation. This new model will
incorporate more detail in the&lt;br/&gt;description of the projectile, allowing
all its parts to dynamically&lt;br/&gt;feel the influence of the target, as a
step toward a microscopic&lt;br/&gt;treatment of the
reaction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
