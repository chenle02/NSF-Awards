The science literacy of college graduates is not acceptable for today's
technological society. To hold jobs and to be responsible, voting citizens, non-
science graduates need fewer facts from specific science disciplines and more
skills with which to understand, approach, and reason about science issues. This
project will develop a science course designed to instill an awareness of how
science is practiced and the skills needed to approach science issues with
responsible confidence. While addressing a national need for increased science
literacy, it will also fulfill the science requirement in the core curriculum.
The primary audience for this new course will be students in the liberal arts,
education, and the social sciences. The project will reach its desired goal by
designing a course in which students carry out hands-on science activities in a
controlled discovery environment. Students will not be given the content details
in a formal lecture setting. Rather they will be given activities that bring out
important variables in observed phenomena, instead of in theories. The course
and its development will be guided by four objectives: to train students in the
process of observation, to assist students in developing explanations for what
they observe, to assist students to create models which will test their
explanations, and to lead to students to apply their explanations to other
examples. At the conclusion of this project a complete, stand alone one semester
course in scientific inquiry will be packaged. There will be a full series of
student activities that can be conducted in an 80 minute class period with
preparatory material, further explanations for students and resource material
for teachers.
