This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a standard
method of providing computer access to people with physical disabilities. In
recent years the use of personal computers in education has increased
dramatically. Because many people with physical disabilities are not able to use
a keyboard or a mouse, it is difficult to provide them with equal access to this
education. A variety of devices have been developed which provide an alternate
means of controlling computers but their usefulness is seriously compromised by
the lack of a standard method of providing computer control. The recent
introduction of the PCMCIA bus, a technology which uses credit card sized
interface devices, provides an opportunity to standardize computer access for
people with disabilities. This project will develop software interfaces which
will allow personal computers to be controlled through the PCMCIA bus. A family
of interface devices will also be developed. The design characteristics of the
software will be documented in an open standard which will be provided to both
the computer industry and manufacturers of assistive technology.
