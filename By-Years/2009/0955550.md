In this CAREER project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and
Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Nathan Hammer of the University
of Mississippi will study the fundamental chemistry of noncovalent interactions
in condensed phases. Various sized aggregates of molecules displaying
noncovalent interactions will be prepared in a variety of chemical environments,
and they will be studied using vibrational spectroscopy and computational
modeling. The educational plan focuses on integrating computational methods and
experiment in all levels of physical chemistry curricula and includes a summer
research program in physical chemistry. This work will enhance our fundamental
understanding of nocovalent interactions in condensed phases. Such weak
interactions play important roles in a range of chemical and biological systems
and are emerging as central in systems-level control over complex biological
processes.
