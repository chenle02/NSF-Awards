0112325 Baird

An opportunity exists for a Sea Grant Fellow to participate in the development
of new and revised management plans to protect both marine and terrestrial areas
in Antarctica which have been designated for their unique scientific values.
Guidelines exist to assist in the process, but the Fellow would be responsible
for developing a finished draft plan. Additional responsibilities would involve
assistance in coordinating with international organizations involved in the
review of the plans to ensure that the concerns of other Antarctic Treaty
parties had been taken into account before the final plans were presented at an
Antarctic Treaty Consultative meeting for approval.
