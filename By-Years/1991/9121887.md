This award is for the purchase of a Tektronix DAS 9200 logic analyzer and
DECstation 5000 workstation to support research and development of a high
performance GaAs microcomputer system, implementation and evaluation of a
distributed real-time fault-tolerant system, and studies on the interaction
between operating systems and computer architecture. Microcomputer systems have
enjoyed a performance increase of 100% to 200% every three years. Much of this
increase of performance is due to the growth in chip integration. The University
of Michigan plans to develop a prototype "micro- supercomputer" that will
achieve the best of both the supercomputer and microprocessor traditions by
using a high- speed technology that has good integration density, and a state-
of-the-art packaging technology to prevent chip- crossings from dominating the
overall speed of the system.//
