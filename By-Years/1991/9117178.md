This meeting will focus on recent insights into the molecular mechanisms
responsible for genome replication and for general and site specific
recombination. Recent work has uncovered an impressive similarity between the
mechanisms involved in recombination and replication, and between the pathways
used for these DNA transactions in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. This symposium
will highlight the most recent findings in all of the most relevant areas, with
special emphasis on those of high current interest and progress. These topics
include: the initiation and termination of DNA replication; DNA-unwinding and
strand transfer reactions; cell cycle control; fidelity mechanisms for genome
duplication; site-specific recombination (including reactions involved in
immunoglobulin gene rearrangements); and transposition (including retroviral
integration). In addition to their fundamental importance, these topics are
relevant to medical research in cancer, gene transfer and AIDS.
