The proposed research involves various aspects of branes, Supersymmetry and
massless higher spin gauge theories. These are key ingredients of string theory
in ten dimensions and membrane theory in eleven dimensions providing a unified
framework for describing all the forces of nature including gravity. Since our
world is an embedding of four dimensional space-time in these higher dimensions,
the encoding of information can be holographic and at high energies new
symmetries can arise. This proposal intends to search for deeper understanding
of these new developments and to systematically study supergravity theories in
higher dimensions.
