This grant is for studying the physical processes fundamental to solar wind-
magnetosphere-ionosphere interactions. This is an important area in solar-
terrestrial physics. The work will be divided into two major categories: (1)
Magnetospheric Substorms, (2) Quasi-Parallel Collisionless Shocks. The first
study will attempt to merge the M-I coupling model with the X-line model. An
important outcome of this merging will be to quantitatively model field-aligned
currents, to model the dynamo region on an open magnetopause, and to investigate
the relationship between Alfven waves and double layers. Three specific problems
are singled out for in-depth theoretical study in the second area. Quasi-
parallel shocks are of fundamental importance to solar wind-magnetosphere
coupling. The dependence of quasi- parallel shock structures on initial
conditions will be investigated as well as Alfven shocks and ion distribution
functions.
