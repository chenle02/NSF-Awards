This award will support a two-year U.S.-Japan cooperative research project
between Professor Wojbor Woyczynski, Center for Stochastic and Chaotic Processes
in Science and Technology, Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Case
Western Reserve University, Cleveland, and Professor Tadahisa Funaki, Department
of Mathematics, Nagoya University. The purpose is to establish a sustained,
direct cooperation in the area of hydrodynamic limits and nonlinear stochastic
partial differential equations between the two centers in the United States and
Japan. Other investigators involved in the project are Professor Peter
Kotelenez, Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Case Western Reserve
University, and Professor Kohei Uchiyama, Department of Applied Physics, Tokyo
Institute of Technology, and Professor Hideo Nagai, Department of Mathematics,
Nagoya University. The objective of the research is to develop a broad spectrum
of techniques in the area of stochastic models for physically relevant
phenomena, in particular in the areas of physical chemistry and geophysical
fluid dynamics and oceanography, The analysis, prediction and identification of
the models would be based on statistical, mechanical, and probabilistic
techniques that take into account microscopic and mezoscopic behavior of
interacting particle systems to obtain, in the thermodynamic or hydrodynamic
limits, the macroscopic behavior as described by kinetic often nonlinear partial
differential equations. The project will bring together the different techniques
developed by the U.S. and Japanese scientists that will permit development of
new techniques that utilize the best parts of the two approaches.
