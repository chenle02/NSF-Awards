Magnetic reconnection underlies important phenomena in nature in a broad range
environment, including solar flares, magnetospheric substorms and disruptions in
laboratory fusion experiments. The topological change in the magnetic field
which occurs during magnetic reconnection requires a breaking of the ideal MHD
frozen flux constraint. The present evidence is that collisionless magnetic
reconnection can only be understood in the context of a full 3-D system. Given
the understanding of the basic physics issues controlling collisionless magnetic
reconnection and the numerical tools which are available, the time is ripe to
finally solve important magnetic reconnection problems. The proposal will
outline an ambitious analytical and computational program to understand
collisionless magnetic reconnection in a 3-D system. The role of electron versus
ion dynamics in controlling the rate of reconnection, the role of turbulence in
breaking up the electron and ion current layers and finally the branching ratio
of energy flow from the magnetic field into electrons and ions will be explored.
Comparisons will be made to ongoing and past laboratory reconnection experiments
as well as satellite observations in the magnetosphere.
