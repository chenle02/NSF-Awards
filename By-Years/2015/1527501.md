The basic design of the camera has remained unchanged for centuries. To acquire
an image, light from the scene is focused using a lens onto an image sensor.
This design has served users well in a broad range of applications, with lenses
forming the bedrock of current imaging practice. Unfortunately, lenses also
introduce a number of limitations. First, while image sensors are typically
thin, cameras end up being thick due to the lens complexity and the large
distance between the lens and sensor required to achieve focus. Second, while
Moore?s Law has cut the cost of image sensors exponentially over time, lenses,
and thus cameras, do not benefit from this exponential scaling, particularly at
wavelengths further into the infrared and ultraviolet, where inexpensive glass
and plastics cannot be used. Third, lens-based cameras invariably require post-
fabrication assembly, resulting in manufacturing
inefficiencies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, the PIs develop new camera
architectures that dispense with lenses completely. Lens-free cameras retain the
high light-throughput of lens-based cameras, have a thin form factor, and are
amenable to direct fabrication while operating over a wide spectral range. The
design replaces the lens with a series of coded masks placed almost immediately
atop a bare conventional sensor and uses a computational algorithm to recover
the image from the sensor measurements. The goal of this project is a modern
signal processing based framework for the design, optimization and development
of lens free and refractive optics-free imaging systems that will establish the
fundamental limits of imaging with such systems. This will revolutionize imaging
capabilities and, for the first time, enable thin, cameras that can directly be
fabricated using traditional semiconductor fabrication tools.
