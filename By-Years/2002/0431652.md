The goal of the STEPMT program is to improve retention and graduation rates in
the science, technology, engineering, and math disciplines at Middle Tennessee
State University through the use of undergraduate research as a broad defining
theme. Three strategies are being implemented to realize these goals: (1)
curriculum reform that emphasizes discovery-based learning and introduces
elements of research, (2) creation of an undergraduate research community, and
(3) partnerships with area high schools, universities, and industry. This three
pronged approach provides a broad cross-section of STEM students beginning in
their freshman year with an appreciation of the role of research in STEM
disciplines, a peer support structure, and direct interaction with faculty and
upperclassmen involved in research. The program impacts large numbers of
students through the curricular reform efforts while offering focused attention
to the diverse core of students in the undergraduate research community. The
success of STEPMT is based on two premises: first, that incorporation of
discovery-based learning can considerably reduce student dropout and failure
rates, and second, that the one-on-one contact between a faculty mentor and an
undergraduate research student has a significant impact on student retention.
Both of these premises are supported by the literature and local experience.
