This award will support a workshop to improve negotiation and communication
skills for female professionals attending the 2017 American Control Conference,
a premier scientific and engineering conference dedicated to the advancement of
control theory and practice. The intended outcome of the workshop is to foster
the professional growth of female mathematicians, scientists, and engineers
working, so that their contributions are fully integrated into the advancement
of this field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this workshop is mentoring
the new generation of scientists with the focus on negotiation and communication
skills. The workshop is an initiative of the "Women in Control" (WiC) and COACh
programs. The half-day workshop will incorporate case studies and role-playing
exercises in order to allow early-career academics to improve their
communication skills.
