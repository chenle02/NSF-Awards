The objective of this project is to validate the present dynamic characteristics
of typical Mexico City buildings and to measure the damping characteristics of
these buildings. One steel and four reinforced concrete buildings are chosen and
their ambient responses are monitored using seismometers and analog data
recorders. These analog measurements of ambient data are uniformly processed and
analyzed for spectral characteristics and modal properties. Further, correlation
of analytical and experimental results is made to identify good design features,
stress distribution in critical elements, torsional effects, effects of in-plane
flexibility, and relationship between observed damage and stress intensity.
