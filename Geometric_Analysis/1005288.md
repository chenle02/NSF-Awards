The project concerns symplectic topology, mirror symmetry, and their
relationship. On the topological side, we study symplectic cohomology and its
analogue for Lagrangian intersections (wrapped Floer cohomology). Recent
advances of Bourgeois-Ekholm-Eliashberg and the author yield powerful
computational tools, which we intend to exploit in order to study non-uniqueness
questions for symplectic structures on open manifolds. On the mirror symmetry
side, we consider decompositions of symplectic manifolds into pairs-of-pants, in
the sense of Mikhalkin. One question under consideration is whether the Fukaya
category can be reconstructed by gluing together pieces corresponding to each
pair-of-pants. In general, this is not true and has to be modified by instanton
contributions. However, there are cases where such contributions should be
absent, and this would give a new viewpoint on Kontsevich's homological mirror
symmetry conjecture.

From a broader perspective, a crucial issue in many current investigations in
physics and mathematics is the emergence of the classical notion of space from a
quantum description. In the situation under study here, the main feature is that
the construction of the classical space involves a series of gradual
distortions, which can be determined by complicated but explicit formulae. This
is a simplified mathematical model of a general class of physical theories, and
not realistic as such. However, studying such models shows us where we are
facing conceptual difficulties, which is important in order to develop our
understanding further.
