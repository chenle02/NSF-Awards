The replicon P4 propagates as a helper-dependent lytic virus, as a prophage end
as a stable plasmid of E. coli. P4 may act as a 'regulatory element' effecting
in trans an integrated or coinfecting helper virus, altering its expression in
several different ways that support the lytic cycle of P4. The gross phenotype
of this interaction is the encapsidation of P4 DNA within viral capsids the
subunits of which are specified by morphogenic operons of the helper virus. The
broad objectives of this proposal are to investigate interactions between
phasmid P4 and helper virus P2. The purpose of this award is to supply limited
support of this project for a six month period.//
