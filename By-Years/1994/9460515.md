This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project describes a novel
processing route to develop an improved, thermal shock resistant, high strength
glass-ceramic composed essentially of pollucite (CsAlSi2O6) crystals.
Crystalline pollucite has excellent refractoriness (melts above 1900ÝC), a low
coefficient of thermal expansion, high mechanical strength and good chemical
durability. Previous attempts to prepare essentially pollucite-based glass-
ceramics have been largely unsuccessful due to high melting temperatures,
significant volatilization of cesium at temperatures above 1800ÝC, and the
unavailability of a suitable container to hold these high temperature melts. A
nonconventional method, which uses pollucite glass microspheres (beads) as
precursors, followed by hot-pressing and crystallization, will be used to
fabricate glass-ceramics in the present investigation. The precursor glass beads
will be prepared by a flame spraying method (&gt;2500ÝC), which avoids the
volatilization of cesium that occurred in all previous attempts to make
pollucite glass-ceramics. A few selected properties which establish the
suitability of a material for practical use, such as the thermal expansion
coefficient, chemical durability, and flexural strength will also be measured
for these glass-ceramics.
