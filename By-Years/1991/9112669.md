Interactions arising from effects on resource quality have not received as much
attention as those interactions (for example, exploitative competition)
resulting from effects on resource quantity. When two species use the same
resource in different physical/chemical states, and the transformation of the
resource between states is influenced by one of the species, this relationship
is referred to as a "processing chain." The influence of one species in a
processing chain may be commensal or amensal, depending on the relative rates of
processing in its presence or absence. Processing chains are widespread in
nature, especially among detritivores, yet they have garnered little attention.
Such a system is the subject of this research: the detritivorous- insect larvae
inhabiting pitchers of the purple pitcher plant (Sarrecenia purpurea), native to
many bogs across eastern North America. Three species feed on captured prey
items in different states of decomposition: a sarcophagid fly, a midge, and a
mosquito. Patch-level consequences of processing chain interactions, the
possible sensitivity of patch selection (oviposition) to these interactions, and
the implications for coexistence and success of species at a supra-patch or
regional scale (across pitchers within a bog) will be studied. Because
processing chains are common in nature, results from this study in Newfoundland,
Canada, will have pertinence for a wide array of other organisms.
