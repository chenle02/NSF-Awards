This project studies the effects of similarity on individual judgement and
choice. Three sets of experiments are proposed. The first set of experiments
investigates multiattribute stimuli with similar levels along one dimension and
dissimilar levels on another. The hypothesis that similarity along one dimension
will enhance differences along another dimension is tested. The second set of
experiments investigates the effect of the stimulus range on attribute
importance. The hypothesis that similarity along a stimulus dimension will
decrease the importance of that dimension is tested. The third set of studies
examines similarity between stimulus and response scales and tests the
conjecture that when a stimulus dimension is more closely related to the
response scale, that stimulus will receive greater weight to the extent that it
is perceived to be more valid. When the validity of the stimulus is unconfounded
with response scale similarity, the more valid cue is weighted more heavily. By
contributing to a better understanding of how individuals evaluate
multiattribute items, this project may lead to more realistic models of
individual valuation for use in decision making, marketing and voting. ***//
