Professor Alena Kubatova and colleagues are requesting funding for their REU
Site at the University of North Dakota. This project, funded by the REU Sites
Program in the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation, provides a
10-week summer research experience for 2nd and 3rd year undergraduate students
from primarily undergraduate institutions using interdisciplinary research
projects at the intersection of chemistry, chemical engineering, and atmospheric
sciences. The interdisciplinary design of the IREC research experience is
intended to achieve a two-fold learning goal for all students involved: it
highlights the chemistry principles underlying their work and demonstrates the
relevance and significance of chemistry principles to other fields. The specific
research projects are based on current expertise of faculty at UND and target
development of renewable chemicals from lignin and lignocellulose, measurement
and modeling of atmospheric processes, and the determination of contaminants in
tribal wells. Research projects are pursued from the combined perspectives of
organic, analytical and physical chemists, chemical engineers, atmospheric
scientists, and geologists.

A distinguishing feature of the IREC (Interdisciplinary Renewable and
Environmental Chemistry) REU is that all students are jointly mentored by a team
of interdisciplinary faculty mentors, providing students with unique exposure to
scientific approaches from different disciplines. The IREC experience focuses on
underrepresented minorities, targeting students from tribal community colleges,
through initial research projects at the college, followed by a summer research
experience for both Native American students and their faculty at UND. As a part
of the project, students receive training in science communication, community
outreach, and research ethics. Besides enhancing the presentation abilities of
IREC participants, this training helps motivate both young students and IREC
participants to pursue science and science-related careers.
