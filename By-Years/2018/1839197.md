Quantum science and technology promises realization of powerful quantum
computational resource, a&lt;br/&gt;quantum cloud. While the exact
implementation of quantum processing nodes and qubits to be used
in&lt;br/&gt;such networks are still the topic of research and debate, the
information between the nodes will surely be&lt;br/&gt;carried by photons.
Therefore, interfacing different types of qubits with photons at
telecommunication wavelengths is critical for realization of scalable
distributed quantum computational systems. This can lead to realization of high-
speed electro-optic modulators and microwave photonics&lt;br/&gt;systems that
will find applications in classical and quantum optical networks, as well as the
study of&lt;br/&gt;interesting and emerging physical phenomena including gauge
field for photons, topological photonics,&lt;br/&gt;strongly-coupled quantum
systems and so on. This program is focused on superconducting quantum
technology, a leading quantum computing platform, that faces a challenge:
efficient transfer of quantum information encoded into microwave photons over
large distances.&lt;br/&gt;The program will provide a unique training ground for
involved students and help train a&lt;br/&gt;new generation of quantum engineers
and scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical: The goal of the proposed program
is to achieve low-noise microwave-to-optical photon conversion with unity
efficiency, and then leverage this to demonstrate quantum state transfer between
superconducting qubit and a telecom photon. Superconducting qubit will be used
as an on-demand source of microwave photons, by leveraging quantum interference
effects. The qubit will be strongly coupled to a microwave resonator realized in
few-atomic-layer superconducting films that exhibit unique microwave-plasmonic
properties. These include low dissipation, high nonlinearity, and exceptionally
high kinetic inductance, resulting in extraordinarily slow signal propagation.
This will enable realization of compact microwave resonators that allow for
strong coupling to a qubit on one end, and that match the dimensions of the
optical circuits on the other end. Microwave-to-optical photon conversion will
be based on the electrooptics approach using ultra low loss integrated lithium-
niobate platform. The process will be enhanced by using triply resonant geometry
that combines two optical and one microwave resonator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
