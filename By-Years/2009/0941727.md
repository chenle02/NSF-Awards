It has long been recognized that while the World Wide Web (WWW) has a wealth of
information, there is a severe lack of tools to access and analyze its contents.
The tool proposed here, if the effort is fully successful has the potential to
radically extend use of WWW contentsThis project will construct a new set of
tools that will make World Wide Web archives and present web data available to a
wide group of researchers whose efforts depend upon examination of large amounts
of data captured in different forms over extensive periods of time. This would
include such researchers from the social sciences, health information management
research, political science, an environmental sciences, to name a few. The
project will comprise two components: a user interface to analysis tools that
operate and an architecture for supporting the tools. The analysis tools will
provide fundamental data management operations such as formula creation, and
data summarization.
