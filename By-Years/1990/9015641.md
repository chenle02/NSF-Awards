Research is in the area of materials engineering and manufacturing processes
aimed at acquiring in-depth knowledge of basic physical phenomena in Czochralski
(CZ) crystal growth equipment processes, major scientific and engineering
considerations in computer-aided design and manufacturing of an automated "one
button control" puller, cost consideration, and United States competitiveness in
world market for CZ crystal puller. Preliminary research will be performed on
continuously-charged Czochralski (CCZ) growth of silicon single crystals. The
CCZ process is expected to produce crystals of uniform properties, better
quality and lesser costs. The research on CCZ process will include theoretical
work in order to make modifications in the conventional CZ crystal puller for
experiments, and develop a basic understanding of flow and temperature fields in
the melt. Experiments to obtain data on crucible size, melt height, power
requirement, growth and feed rates, appropriate location for addition of silicon
charge and several other parameters which help in developing a commercial unit
will be investigated.
