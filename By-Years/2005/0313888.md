The focus of this research involves the development of polymerization
methodology. Cross-linked functionalized resins, functional polymer disks,
dendrimeric disks, beads within disks and hybrid dendrimer/monolith and
bead/monolith approaches to flow-through systems will all be studied. Further,
polyheterocyclic macromolecules will be prepared on solid phases and novel mass
spectrometric (MS) based techniques will be developed for bead tagging to enable
diversity characterization of combinatorial libraries.

With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting
the research of Dr. Mark J. Kurth and Dr. Neil E. Schore in the Department of
Chemistry at the University of California-Davis. This collaborative effort will
focus on developing methodology for the preparation and evaluation of reactive
polymer systems for use in organic synthesis. There is potential for broader
impact of the work in the area of environmentally friendly chemistry and for the
pharmaceutical industry. Also, the project presents an excellent arena for the
training of graduate students.
