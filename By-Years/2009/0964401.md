Studies in computational complexity in three directions are proposed:
holographic algorithms, Darwinian evolution, and multicore algorithms. In the
first of these areas, holographic reductions have been shown to be a fruitful
source of new efficient algorithms for certain problems, and evidence of
intractability for othrs. In this research the aim is to arrive at a better
understanding of the possibilities and limitations of holographic algorithms, by
exploring ways in which specific currently known limitations of this class of
methods can be circumvented. For evolution the goal is to understand better what
classes of mechanisms can evolve through the Darwinian processes of variation
and selection when only feasible resources in terms of population sizes and
numbers of generations are available. In the area of multi-core algorithms, a
methodology will be developed for expressing and analyzing parallel algorithms
that are optimal for a wide range of hardware performance parameters. Such
algorithms would make possible portable software, that is aware of the
parameters of the machine on which it executes, and can run efficiently on all
such machines.

The work on multi-core algorithms aims to have the practical goal of increasing
the effective exploitation of multi-core computers as these become more
pervasive. The work on evolution will highlight the fact that the question of
how complex mechanisms could have evolved within the resources available, is a
question that is resolvable by the methods of computational complexity, and aims
to provide more precise mathematical specifications of what the Darwinian
process can achieve. The work on holographic algorithms aims to make progress in
our understanding of what are widely regarded as the most fundamental questions
regarding the power of practical computation.
