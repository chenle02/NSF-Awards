There are photosensitive polymers which undergo transformation (isomerization,
ring closure, etc.) upon irradiation by UV light. Preliminary Japanese work
indicated that the permeabilities of enzymes were reduced by a factor of ten
when a polymer membrane was irradiated. This research will explore and extend
the concept to gas separations, to cover eight commercially important gases and
a number of photosensitive polymer membranes. The research will include
preparation/characterization of membranes, permeability (solubility and
diffusivity) measurements, and interpretation of the data by existing theories.
