9361143 COLEMAN This project will develop wind turbine technology for polar
applications as an avenue to expanding the ability to develop wind and wind
hybrid energy projects in cold weather and polar environments. The development
program will be focused on the identification of technical problems,
specifically related to the polar environment, and performing analysis, detailed
engineering and conceptual designs to address the specific set of identified
concerns. The outcome of the program will be the development of wind turbines
for a wide range of commercial cold regions applications. These new turbines
will fill a void in the current marketplace, and may make a significant
reduction in cost of electrical energy in polar regions. ***
