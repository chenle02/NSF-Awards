This project focuses on the study of certain special functions which appear
naturally in several physical applications as well as in important problems in
mathematics: the uniformization functions of geometric structures, the Painlevé
transcendents and the Schwarzian functions. The investigator will use model
theory, a branch of mathematical logic, combined with other areas of
mathematics, such as geometry and algebra, to answer far-reaching questions in
functional transcendence theory related to the existence of algebraic relations
among the special functions. Applications of this study to other areas of
mathematics, such as number theory, is also a major goal of the project.

Over the past decades, following works around the Pila-Wilkie counting theorem
in the context of o-minimality, there has been a surge in interest around
functional transcendence results, in part due to their connection with special
points conjectures. In this project, the investigator will use an entirely new
approach, centered around the model theory of differential fields, to attack
some of the main open questions about the algebraic nature of automorphic
functions. A major goal is to establish the Ax-Lindemann-Weierstrass and Ax-
Schanuel Theorems with derivatives for uniformization functions of Shimura
varieties as well as other geometric structures. The project will also
investigate the classification of geometrically trivial strongly minimal sets in
differentially closed fields and aim to characterize the structure of the sets
of solutions of the Painlevé equations and the Schwarzian equations.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
