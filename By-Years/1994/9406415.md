9406415 Tassiulas Research will be conducted on congestion control strategies
for providing network performance guarantees on end-to-end loss and delay. The
goal is the analysis of networks with general topology and multiclass traffic,
and the design of simple and effective congestion control strategies. The study
will also consider certain specialized topologies (ring with spatial reuse) as
well. The focus of the research will be particularly on the interaction at the
network level, of localized control schemes acting at the link or single node
level. Both deterministic and stochastic arrival models will be considered.
Rigorous analytical techniques and simulations will be employed for the analysis
and evaluation of the congestion control algorithms. Special attention will be
given to the inherent practical constraints of high speed networks and the
limitations they pose on possible congestion control strategies. The impact of
the proposed research will be the provision of new congestion control schemes,
of guidelines for the design and evaluation of congestion control strategies and
of enhanced knowledge, and understanding of the impact of distributed control
strategies on network level performance. ***
