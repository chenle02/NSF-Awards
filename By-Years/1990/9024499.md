This award funds initial research on integration of methods for reflexive gait
synthesis and adaptation to difficult terrains, for a biped walking robot. The
research will explore neural- network-based mechanisms for training a central
pattern generator to generate a new gait that is learned by a terrain-monitoring
learning and adaptation unit. It will also study the convergence properties of
backpropagation and reinforcement learning mechanisms for use in the learning
and adaptation unit. The long-term goal of this research in biped robotics is to
achieve more agility and mobility than is possible in multilegged walking
machines or other forms of machine locomotion, and ultimately to provide
capability for mobile robots to augment or replace humans in hazardous
operations or in rough terrain.
