Dr. Jason Barnes is awarded an NSF Earth Science Postdoctoral Fellowship to
carry out a program of research and education at Durham University. Dr. Barnes
will examine changes in the landscape in the southern Himalayas in response to
the collision of the Indian subcontinent against Eurasia. Dr. Barnes will study
in detail topographic features, measure fault lengths and displacements,
determine the rates of erosion and deposition, and explore the possibility of
using topography to infer seismic hazards. To reach the scientific goals, Dr.
Barnes will construct detailed geologic maps, examine satellite images, digital
topography maps, and measure isotopes in sand grains (10Be) from the Siwaliks
Hills, northwest India. The results from this investigation will provide
information that is needed to understand the relationship between changes in
landscape and earthquakes in regions where geologic faults may not be visible at
the surface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, Dr. Barnes will interact with
scientists from Britain and India and participate in the development of programs
that will disseminate the findings of the research not only to other scientists
from these countries, but also to others working in hazards and risk
management.&lt;br/&gt;
