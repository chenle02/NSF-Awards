The Chemistry Department is purchasing a nitrogen/dye laser, a scanning
monochromator, and a photomultiplier tube for use in physical chemistry and
undergraduate research. The system is being used to introduce Raman
spectroscopy, laser-induced fluorescence, phosphorescence, and fast kinetics to
students in Physical Chemistry Laboratory. Students are learning to combine
laser technology with other modern techniques such as computer interfacing and
theoretical quantum mechanical calculations as an introduction to research. The
equipment is also to students participating in undergraduate research.
