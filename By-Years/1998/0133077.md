This proposal tackles fundamental problems in system design using a two-pronged
approach including both queueing theory and kernel-level implementation.
Particular emphasis is placed on understanding the impact of heavy-tailed
properties in compute workloads. The proposal&lt;br/&gt;focuses on two specific
research questions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(1) Is it possible to reduce the
expected response time of every request at a server, simply by changing the
order in which requests are scheduled? Todays web servers employ FAIR
scheduling, wherein requests are time-shared fairly. This proposal considers
instead&lt;br/&gt;scheduling which biases towards SHORT requests, and argues
analytically and via implementation that biasing towards SHORT requests improves
response times for all requests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(2) How should servers be
designed to cope with transient overload conditions? Most of client
dissatisfaction can be attributed to moments of temporary overload at the
server. This proposal aims to understand exactly what happens to systems during
overload, both via a formal queueing analysis and via a rigorous systematic
study of server/OS internals.&lt;br/&gt;
