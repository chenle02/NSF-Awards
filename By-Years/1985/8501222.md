This project deals with a communication systems problem which has great
potential interest. As relatively inexpensive satellite earth stations become
more universally available, it is crucial to efficiently couple these stations
to terrestrial local area networks. Several satellite interconnection network
architectures have been developed; however, in none of these architectures is
any provision made for dealing with satellite link congestion. Link congestion
refers to a gateway receiving input traffic from the link at a rate exceeding
the output to the local area network. This research focuses on the congestion
problem and its effect on performance. Specifically, researchers will develop
queueing network performance models, develop simulation models of network
behavior, investigate and compare the congestion effect of various network
protocols, and evaluate the performance of current network architectures.
