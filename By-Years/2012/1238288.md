PROGRAM DIRECTOR'S RECOMMENDATION

IIP 1238288 University of Tennessee Knoxville (UTK) Duscher

The University of Tennessee Knoxville is planning to join the
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) entitled Center for
Next Generation Photovoltaics which is a multi-university center comprised of
the University of Texas-Austin (UTA) and the Colorado State University (CSU).
The existing Center focuses on the advancement of CdTe & CIGS thin films,
thermal process modeling, imaging, and nanocrystal systems.

The goal of this proposal is to seek NSF funding to for a planning meeting to
allow the University of Tennessee Knoxville to recruit industry support to allow
it to join an existing I/UCRC Center focused on Next-Generation Photovoltaics
(NGP). Participation by UTK will expand the scope of the existing I/UCRC to
include research on organic materials, thin-film silicon materials and
artificial photosynthesis.

Low-cost, reliable photovoltaics would lead to widespread adoption of solar
energy as a renewable energy source. Solar energy utilization is critically
important to the future of the planet. It is also an excellent training arena
for future scientists and engineers because it is highly interdisciplinary,
necessitating communication and interaction across disciplines. The I/UCRC
efforts will also be interfaced with key educational programs at UTK, CSU, and
UTA, as well as leveraging capabilities at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.
The industrial partnerships in the I/UCRC will be vital to the success of this
program. The Center will have a team of faculty and students that is diverse in
gender, race and ethnicity.
