This project investigates the properties of new semantics for possibly
unstratified knowledge bases, called the well.founded semantics. The study
addresses theoretical issues that have bearing on the usability and
implementability of the semantics. These issues include the expressive power of
semantics, compared to alternatives: algorithms for ecognizing programs that can
be implemented efficiently, and algorithms for executing such programs. The
implementation of prototype analyzers and translators will also be initiated.
