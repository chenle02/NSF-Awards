This is the second award to the faculty members in Physics and Chemistry at
NMIMT to establish an REU site to involve undergraduate students in campus
research projects in atmospheric sciences. Present research projects include
studies in atmospheric electricity and chemistry. Undergraduate students to
participate in this program will come from NMIMT and other regional academic
institutions.
