In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor Xi Chen of the Department of Chemistry at the University of
California-Davis will explore the development of chemoenzymatic synthesis and
simple cartridge-purification methods for complex glycosphingolipids. The focus
of the current project will be on neolacto-series glycosphingolipids with
various lengths. While chemoenzymatic synthetic methods have been increasingly
developed and used for producing oligosaccharides, less progress has been made
in preparative-scale and large-scale synthesis of long and complex
glycosphingolipids. This is mainly due to the limited access to suitable
glycosyltransferases and sugar nucleotides as well as challenges in product
purification. This work combines highly efficient glycosyltransferase-based one-
pot multienzyme glycosylation systems with facile cartridge-purification schemes
to allow the synthesis of complex glycosphingolipids with high yield, low cost,
and in a short period of time from inexpensive monosaccharides, common
nucleotides, and other simple starting materials. The process can be adapted to
automated synthesis of glycolipids. The easy accessibility of glycolipids will
provide essential probes and standards for basic research and greatly facilitate
the understanding of their important roles and accelerate their therapeutic
applications as cancer vaccines, cancer markers, and antimicrobial treatment.
The proposed chemoenzymatic synthetic approaches and cartridge purification
scheme are sustainable, as they use bioregenerable catalysts, a minimal amount
of chemical reagents and organic solvents, and are environmentally friendly.
This project will provide training to graduate students, undergraduate students,
and high school students of diverse economic, gender, cultural, and ethnic
backgrounds, allowing them to gain valuable skills, independence, and confidence
in interdisciplinary research.
