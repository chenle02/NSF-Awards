Hopkins There is still much to learn about the structure and dynamics of various
sequences of DNA that are critical to understanding its biological function.
Drs. Robinson and Hopkins will use NMR and EPR techniques to further their
research. They will also continue to develop computerized theoretical models to
simulate data, develop data analysis techniques and develop new methodologies
for obtaining data and extracting useful dynamic information. The work will
focus on the structure and dynamics of DNA by examining various forms of
different secondary structure. It is currently unknown whether there are dynamic
differences between these forms of DNA and, if they exist, the role they may
play in biological function.
