A Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrophotometer with multiple internal
reflectance accessory, diffuse reflectance accessory, and associated software
will be used primarily in instrumental, organic, and physical chemistry courses.
It will also be used in first year chemistry to introduce students to
computerized data acquisition and processing, and in biochemistry to investigate
the infrared spectra of biomolecules. The grantee will match the NSF award from
non-Federal sources.
