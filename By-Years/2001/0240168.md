In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Tubergen will use a Fourier Transform Microwave Spectrometer
to study the influence of solvent molecules on molecular conformation. The PI
will develop a Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption source for a Fourier transform
microwave spectrometer. The source will be designed to vaporize biomolecules
without decomposition. Specifically, biomolecules, including amino acids and
peptides and their complexes with water, will be
investigated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will engage graduate and undergraduate
students in his research. They will thereby receive training in forefront areas
of contemporary physical chemistry. The PI will also develop new spectroscopic
experiments suitable for a physical chemistry instructional
laboratory.&lt;br/&gt;
