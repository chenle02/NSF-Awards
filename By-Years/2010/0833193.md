Scaling scientific problems to 10,000,000 processors for the next generation
HEC systems is today severely challenged by conventional practices of
programming models, languages, and their supporting compilation systems. To
achieve this goal one must expose greater degree of parallelism and improve
parallel computing efficiency than is otherwise feasible with conventional
methods such as MPI. &lt;br/&gt;The goal of this collaborative research project
is to dramatically enhance the scalability of challenging physics problems,
through the application of an innovative programming model. The strategy is to
replace static message-passing course grained processes using global barrier
synchronization in a distributed memory space with a model using dynamic
message-driven multiple threads using lightweight synchronization objects in a
partitioned global address space. Parallelism is to be extracted directly from
the large irregular sparse and time varying data structures. Ephemeral user-
threads will permit many simultaneous tasks over the data structures, exposing
the intrinsic near-fine grain parallelism. System-wide latency will be hidden by
overlapping computation with communication through the advanced communication
strategy of asynchronous message-driven processing. Consequently this will
enable a class of physics problems that cannot currently be done using
conventional methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
