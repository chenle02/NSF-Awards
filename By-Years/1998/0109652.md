This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will apply
fluidic self-assembly (FSA) technology to the fabrication of large area silicon-
based X-ray imaging arrays. FSA technology offers potential for cost-effective
production of high-speed, high-performance X-ray imaging arrays that are now in
demand for synchrotron protein crystallography, X-ray astronomy, and
mammography. Silicon X-ray diode arrays and complementary metal oxide
semiconductor (CMOS) circuit chips will be micro-machined into the appropriate
shapes for subsequent assembly using FSA. The FSA apparatus for transporting the
micro-machined chips to the receptor substrate will be assembled and evaluated.
Phase I will evaluate these techniques in fabrication of an X-ray imaging array.
Phase II would include the design and fabrication of optimized detector
structures and custom CMOS readout circuits, and optimization of the assembly
procedures for a prototype-imaging array for synchrotron protein
crystallography.

Potential applications are expected in the commercial production of X-ray
imaging devices for medical, scientific, and other purposes.
