This project is adapting and implementing a multidisciplinary Tribology course
for undergraduate engineering students. Tribology is the field which attempts to
understand and mitigate the damaging effects of friction and wear. The two
objectives of the course are: 1) to educate a diverse population of students in
tribological mechanisms and 2) aid in the development of students into critical
thinking, problem-solving professionals through active, higher order learning.
The course involves adapting and creating a lecture and laboratory experience
that will require design, teamwork, and innovative thinking by students. The
project is modeled after a program at the University of
Florida.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The course is exposing undergraduate students to a
technologically important field, which is expanding rapidly as engineering
systems become more complex and energy resources scarcer. The course reflects
contemporary issues and the development is based on established methodology in
learning theory. The course experience is emphasizing solving real-world
technical challenges. Students who otherwise would know little about tribology
are developing a core competency. Young engineers will enter industry or
graduate school with greater aptitude to tackle engineering challenges. This
aptitude will be applied in numerous industries from biomedical implants to MEMS
devices to automobiles- and will remain a fundamental skill to be utilized in
our ever-increasing technical society. In addition, developing an
interdisciplinary course will promote collaboration between departments and lead
to further cross-disciplinary course development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
