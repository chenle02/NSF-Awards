ABSTRACT

The PI's propose to study the formation of colloidal arrays within emulsion
droplets to template 'supraballs' (which they define as solid spheres containing
arrays of colloidal spheres or holes templated by colloidal spheres). Some of
the goals include achievement of better control over suprasphere sizes by
optimizing a previously developed break-off process and by employing a
microfluidic device; understanding of hole/colloid ordering in supraballs and
emulsification of colloidal particles; and understanding of optical properties
of supraballs (light diffusion). In addition, the PI will attempt to prepare
directional colloids within emulsion droplets, intending to assemble these in
non close-packed structures which are advantageous for photonic materials.
