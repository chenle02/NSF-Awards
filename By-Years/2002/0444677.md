A workshop is being conducted to help define the major issues in the effort to
address technological literacy at the undergraduate level. Topics of discussion
include: identification of successful implementations, obstacles to courses on
technology, learning objectives and student outcomes, relevant assessment tools
and techniques, strategies for developing a scholarly community in the area,
potential means of stimulating growth of interest in the topic, implementation
in different types of institutions including community colleges, perspectives
and issues concerning women, underrepresented minorities, and considerations
regarding inclusion of persons with disabilities. The intellectual merit of this
work stems from furthering an understanding of the how to promote technological
literacy among undergraduate students. Broader impacts to society will result by
the workshop having a direct influence on the ability of undergraduate education
to contribute to the development of a technically literate citizenry. A report
summarizing the findings of the workshop is being prepared and will be
disseminated widely.
