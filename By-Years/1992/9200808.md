This grant provides partial support for the purchase of a reduced instruction
set computer system for use by the designers of a major detector for the
Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. The design group is centered at the State
University of New York at Stony Brook. The computer will be used for event
simulations and development of codes for event reconstruction and analysis.
