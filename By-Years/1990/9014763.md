The objective of this research is the investigation, using instrumented
aircraft, of the existence, structure, and evaluation of large super cooled
water drops in stratus clouds which are the thought to be necessary ingredients
for aircraft icing, a principle objective of the WISP experiment in Colorado. In
addition, selected snow bands will be investigated by the same aircraft in
Colorado. The aircraft measurements will be complemented by a variety of remote
sensing devices-doppler radars, microwave radiometers, profilers-operated by
NOAA.
