This is an ROW/Planning Grant. In recent years, work in speech act theory has
yielded results of practical interest, particularly for the design of user
interfaces, intelligent systems, and programming languages. Techniques have been
developed for general reasoning about actions, and for inference of intentions
from typewritten dialogue. This project adds intonation to the model's language
cues. A parametric study of spoken language use will be conducted, to support
the hypothesisthat computing intentions is improved by exploiting acoustic
parameters (particularly the fundamental frequency contours) of utterances.
Speakers' reports of their own intentions, and hearers' judgements of intent
will be used, to determine the roleof intonation relative to linguistic
structure and contextual cues. The work will attempt to develop a calculus
relating international features and speech act types, and fold it into the
existing speech act recognition system. Acoustic cues may provide new insight
into the dynamic nature of action and communication.
