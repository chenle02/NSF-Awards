ABSTRACT

Bayesian Methods for Large-Scale Applications

The investigators work on Bayesian statistical methods for large-scale
applications. Three applications provide the backdrop for the work. "Text
categorization" concerns the automatic assignment of documents to predefined
categories and requires ultra-high dimensional supervised learning models.
"Authorship attribution" uses similar methodology but attempts to identify
authors of anonymous documents. The "Localization" problem uses signal
characteristics to locate users in wireless networks. The investigators focus on
technical challenges that span these applications including sequential Bayesian
analysis, non-linear optimization, and novelty detection algorithms.

In both the business and scientific realms, computing advances have drastically
altered the role of data analysis. Historically, analysts produced data locally
to address specific research questions. Now, ubiquitous computing and cheap
storage have decoupled the production of data from the research questions. Data
of all kinds are produced and deposited in remotely accessible databases with
myriad questions in mind, both foreseen and unforeseen. Statistics has
historically focused on squeezing the maximum amount of information out of
limited data. The investigator's work focuses instead on so-called Bayesian
statistical methods for these emerging larger-scale applications
