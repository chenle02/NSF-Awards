DMS-0201695&lt;br/&gt;John R. Klein&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal contains
two programs. The first is to study &lt;br/&gt;a variety of homotopy theoretic
problems associated with &lt;br/&gt;space of smooth embeddings of one manifold
in another. Among &lt;br/&gt;these problems are obstruction theory for
embeddings, linking phenomena, compression problems and splitting questions. The
&lt;br/&gt;second program is a new approach to the study of the equivariant
structure sets of topological manifolds equipped with a &lt;br/&gt;tame action
of a finite group. The new ingredient is to use &lt;br/&gt;Poincare embeddings
to analyse the difference between the &lt;br/&gt;equivariant structures and the
isovariant ones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A manifold is a topological space which is
locally euclidean. &lt;br/&gt;A fundamental problem in topology is to enumerate
the embeddings &lt;br/&gt;one manifold into another one. The set of all such
embeddings &lt;br/&gt;forms a topological space. The first part of this proposal
is &lt;br/&gt;to study various topological aspects of the space of embeddings.
&lt;br/&gt;The second part concerns the classification of manifolds equipped
&lt;br/&gt;with a finite group of symmetries.&lt;br/&gt;
