As the ubiquity and acceptance of mobile devices increases, a variety of new
applications are emerging. One noticeable trend is the desire for media-rich
content. The delivery of media-rich content is poised to transform computing.
One specific area that will reap significant benefit from this new content is
on-line collaboration. The focus of this work is the mobile network support of
collaboration services for on-line collaborations, and the target application is
a Collaborative Learning Environment. The requirements for this environment
include the integrated use of real-time multimedia streaming, stored media
streaming and voice streams, as well as automatic detection of services embedded
in the environment. To support the collaborative environment, the following
challenges are being addressed: (i) the design and analysis of network support
for advanced media that is optimized for the characteristics of mobile wireless
environments; (ii) the specification of mechanisms for resource monitoring and
proactive networking, whereby the optimal service quality can be delivered to
users based on the network and end device resources; and (iii) the development
of automatic detection and provisioning of services, such that mobile users can
discover and utilize services near their current location, as well as offer
services to other mobile users. This work will result in the development of
techniques for supporting collaboration services within mobile networks.
Numerous applications, such as disaster control, administration, education, and
public safety are likely to benefit. An immediate impact of this work is the
education of undergraduate and graduate students through participation in this
research.
