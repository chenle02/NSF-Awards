Multicore processors have become main-stream. At the same time, CPU clock rates
are no longer increasing. Operating within this environment, application
developers are under competitive pressure to parallelize software in order to
achieve an aceptable performance level for computationally intensive features.
Unfortunately, fully automated parallelization is constrained by sequential
semantics and by limits of a compiler?s analytical abilities. Consequently,
designing parallel programming languages for developing efficient yet reliable
main-stream applications continues to be a challenge. Rewriting software
completely by hand is undesireable, because this kind of activity may waste
years of investment in large scale software. Therefore, ideally, existing
software should be automatically converted to new parallel forms.

To address this problem, new program slicing techniques are investigated in this
project to enable programmers to convert existing sequential programs, with
minimum hand-made changes, into forms which can be safely parallelized by
automatic tools. This research will result in a set of novel program analysis
and transformation techniques to support the new slicing methods.

The project will have a broad impact on the US software industry?s ability to
compete globally in its endeavor to retrofit existing software for the emerging
hardware platforms. The tool and techniques developed in the project will be
used in compiler and architecture courses offered at both graduate and
undergraduate levels. The project also engages both graduate and undergraduate
students in the key research activities, providing advanced technical training
which will be critical to future success of a new generation of computer
scientists and software engineers.
