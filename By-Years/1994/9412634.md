9412634 Williams An Engineering Faculty Internship will support a joint study
with Durametallic Corporation on the performance of mechanical end face seals.
Specifically, the study will address the effect of industrially produced surface
finishes on the friction, wear, leakage, and evolution of surface topography
during running-in. The goal is to develop guidelines for selection of materials
and manufacturing and finishing processes that will assure optimally performing
seals. ***
