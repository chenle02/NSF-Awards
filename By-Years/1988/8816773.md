This research on the heat shock response in cultured avian cells will determine
how heat shock proteins enable cells to survive stress damage. Antibodies raised
against purified preparations of three chicken heat shock proteins have helped
to identify several properties of closely-related, "cognate" proteins which are
normally found in cells. From a cDNA library selected for heat shock mRNA
expression, ubiquitin was identified as a heat shock protein and one of the
chicken ubiquitin genes was sequenced. More recently, changes in ubiquitin
metabolism during heat shock and chemical stress were described and studies on
the biosynthesis of ubiquitin will be continued as part of the research program.
Cells in virtually all organisms are protected from damage and death arising
from environmental stresses such as heat shock, strong oxidants and heavy metals
by a small number of very highly conserved proteins. Genes encoding these
proteins are selectively activated immediately upon exposure to stress by
regulatory elements which appear to be similar in widely divergent organisms--
from yeast to human. This research focuses on the heat shock protein ubiquitin.
This research will provide a better understanding of how this heat shock protein
protects cells from damage and helps restore them to their normal physiological
state after the stress.
