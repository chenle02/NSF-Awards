This award funds the research conference ?Algebra 2022 and Beyond." The aim of
this event is to bring together established and early-career researchers in
algebra to both disseminate recent work in the field and to foster
collaborations and connections ? especially among scholars from the Midwest.
Under the broad umbrella of Algebra, the focus will be on three areas, algebraic
number theory, arithmetic geometry, and group theory, which are among central
areas of modern mathematics, with natural connections to physics, chemistry, and
information science. The list of speakers will include established scholars
whose participation in the event will contribute to the training of the next
generation of algebraists. In particular, the conference will include a
professional development workshop to help early-career mathematicians further
their careers. The main research areas of the conference are algebraic number
theory, arithmetic geometry, and group theory. The list of scholars who have
agreed to lecture includes six invited speakers at International Congresses of
Mathematicians. The conference will be forward-looking; speakers will be
encouraged to aim their talks at broad audiences of algebraists and emphasize
the connections among the three major mathematical areas of the conference.
Funding provided by the grant will be used to support early career
mathematicians and graduate students to attend the conference. The conference
proceedings will be published. For more information see the conference website

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
