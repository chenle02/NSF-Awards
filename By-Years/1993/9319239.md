9319239 Johansen An advanced research optical microscope fitted for differential
interference contrast will be used in the study of the structure of diatoms, a
study of the ecology of algal communities in four Lake Erie estuaries, genetic
and developmental biology studies of C. elegans, and systematic studies of
fishes using early ontogeny of the Weberian apparatus and visceral arches in
cyprinids. The instrument will be used for faculty and student research in an
institution dedicated to undergraduate and masters-level education.
