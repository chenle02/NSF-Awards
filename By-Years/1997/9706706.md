ABSTRACT This proposal deals with boiling heat transfer in miniature passages
that have micro grooves. The miniature passages are rectangular channels with a
hydraulic diameter of about 2 mm. There can be sub-millimeter size microgrooves
on the inner surfaces of the channels. Experiments using channels with and
without microgrooves will be conducted under conditions that will allow the
effects of forced convection and capillary action to be delineated. Data to be
collected include critical heat fluxes, pressure drops, and thermal resistances
for various operating pressures and mass flow rates. Flow visualization will be
performed to obtain relevant transport information such as the average lengths
and velocities of liquid slugs and vapor bubbles. Mathematical modeling will be
carried out to establish the relevant mechanisms for the heat transfer process.
