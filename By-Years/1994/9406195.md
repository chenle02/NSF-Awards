9406195 Kay Throughout Tertiary time, Kamchatka has collected fragments of
continental crust (terranes) that formed as oceanic island arcs and plateaus in
the Bering Sea and the Pacific Ocean. Accretion of the fragments has resulted in
a subcontinental mass. The process is thought by many to be the main mechanism
of present day continental growth. Kamchatka is a particularly good site to
study this type of continental growth due to its youth, due to the availability
of information on similar but as yet unaccreted oceanic fragments (especially,
the Aleutian islands) and due to widespread post-accretion magmatism that
records conditions at depth. This investigation focuses on alkaline basaltic
magmas that originate in mantle that lies under the Kamchatka terranes. Existing
trace element data on these magmas lack typical signatures (e.g. high Ba/La,
La/Ta ratios), and support delamination models that call fro wholesale
replacement of mantle lithosphere by underlying Oceanic Island Basalt (OIB)-like
asthenosphere. Isotope analyses (Pb, Sr, Nd) as well as additional trace element
analyses will permit identification of mas reservoirs and quantification of mas
fluxes related to fundamental processes of crustal growth and consolidation.
