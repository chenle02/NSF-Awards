This CAREER project will develop new mathematical models and numerical methods
for simulating blood clotting and identifying regulatory mechanisms within the
blood clotting system. In response to vessel injuries, blood will clot to
prevent bleeding. The clotting response is complex and involves numerous
biochemical and biophysical components working together under the influence of
flow. Certain diseases or drugs may cause clots to form improperly, resulting in
life-threatening bleeding or pathological clot growth with vessel occlusion. Due
to the intricate biochemical and biophysical aspects of the clotting system,
predicting its responses and identifying the regulatory mechanisms underlying
these responses is difficult. Mathematical models of blood clotting provide
powerful tools for designing new drugs, experiments, and patient-specific
therapies, but there are still great challenges in formulating such models. This
research focuses on developing new mathematical models of essential biochemical
players and their involvement in complex biophysical processes. These models
will be used to test hypotheses related to regulation of blood clotting and
optimal drug design. Additionally, graduate students will be trained in
interdisciplinary research and help to organize summer workshops in mathematical
biology. The workshops will be offered to local community college students, with
the goal being their recruitment and retention into four-year programs by
offering active learning, faculty and graduate student mentoring, peer
networking, and timely advising.

This research will build a comprehensive modeling framework coupling the
biochemistry, biophysics, and biomechanics of blood clotting. It will address
mechanistic questions about regulating the generation and sequestration of
thrombin, the most important enzyme in the clotting process. Specifically, the
research will focus on (1) development of a mathematical model that accurately
describes thrombin's binding to fibrin (the polymer that stabilizes growing
blood clots) and explains the extended periods of time that thrombin has been
observed to stay bound to fibrin under flow, (2) development of a mathematical
model that incorporates a new, platelet-dependent mechanism to inhibit thrombin
generation and explains observed inhibition under flow, and (3) development of a
new numerical method to model platelets as discrete objects immersed in a fluid,
interacting elastically, responding to molecules in the surrounding fluid, and
carrying information via molecules bound to their surfaces.
