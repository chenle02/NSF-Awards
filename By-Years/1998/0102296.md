This action provides support for U.S. participation in the tsunami symposium to
be held in Nice, France, March 2001. This symposium is a part of the Natural
Hazards program within the 26th General Assembly of the European Geophysical
Society. It will present the state-of-the-art as regards tsunami generation,
propagation and impact along coastlines, as well as discuss the tools needed to
assess and mitigate the tsunami hazard. The participants supported by this grant
include key researchers and junior members of the U.S. tsunami community; their
presence at this meeting is critical for future cooperative research efforts.
The symposium topics include contributions from geophysics, geology, numerical
modeling, social and economical sciences, urban planning, and warning
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tsunami research has become increasingly important
and international in its focus. Strong international cooperation is necessary
since tsunamis can affect not only the region near the source but also distant
regions through propagation across oceans. There were eleven major tsunami
disasters around the world during the last decade, starting with the 1992
Nicaragua tsunami. A spectrum of challenging tsunami-related research will be
presented and discussed at this symposium; it is expected that collaborative
projects in many of these topics will be initiated by the
participants.&lt;br/&gt;
