9418207 Quade Weathering of sediments derived from uplift of the Himalayas has
had a major impact on the chemistry of the oceans, on regional (now monsoonal)
climate, and probably on atmospheric pCO2. One of the clearest proxies of the
effects of Himalayan uplift is the marine 87Sr/86Sr record. However, the
specific links between the marine Sr record and tectonism and weathering rates
in the Himalayan hinterland are virtually undocumented. The Miocene-Pleistocene
detrital record of erosion of the Himalayas is contained in the Siwalik Group
foreland-basin sediments exposed in the Himalayan frontal ranges, and in the
Bengal submarine fan. This research will examine changes in the 87Sr/86Sr ratio
of sediment, weathering products, and aquatic (riverine) shells in Siwalik
sediments deposited in central and western Nepal over the past 12 Ma. These
isotopic compositions will be correlated with specific tectonic and erosional
events in the Himalayas, providing a direct link between physical processes in
the orogenic belt (e.g., individual thrust-displacement events) and changes in
sediment and water composition. In turn, these studies will permit comparison of
changes in 87Sr/86Sr ratios and other aspects of Siwalik sediments to the
isotopic evolution of the ocean and Bengal submarine fan sediments.
