This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A generous donor is providing
Appalachian State University in Boone, North Carolina with a new 17-inch
telescope to be used jointly by the donor and ASU. The telescope will be housed
in an existing dome at the university's "Dark Sky Observatory" (DSO) located at
an elevation of over 3,000 feet about 20 miles from Boone. This telescope will
join three others already operating at DSO and the costs for its installation
will be aided by an award from NSF's Major Research Instrumentation program from
the Division of Astronomical Sciences. Dr. Daniel Caton, a professor of
astronomy at ASU and director of the DSO, is the principal investigator for the
award. The funding will also be used to fully automate this and other DSO
telescopes so that they can be operated remotely over the internet, either from
the ASU campus or from other locations. The telescopes will be used to train
students in observational astronomy and to carry out on-going research program
in variable stars, Quasar and Active Galactic Nuclei variability, Gamma Ray
Burst follow-up observations, and studies of binary asteroids.
