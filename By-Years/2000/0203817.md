A combined global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model of the solar corona and inner
heliosphere will be used to interpret SOHO and Yohkoh solar observations in
addition to ACE and Ulysses in-situ measurements of coronal mass ejections
(CMEs). SAIC's global model will be employed to initiate the CME disturbance and
follow its evolution out to 20 solar radii. NOAA/SEC's heliospheric model will
subsequently pick up these structures at 20 solar radii and propagate them out
to 5 AU. Thus a global context will be constructed wherein one may connect the
disparate solar and in situ observations. A unique and powerful perspective is
thus provided to address fundamental issues concerning the origin, magnetic
topology, and space weather evolution of CMEs. The events identified for
simulation are to be selected by the SHINE community, and the simulation results
will be available to the community on-line, in order to enhance the scientific
return of this investigation.
