Interdisciplinary (99) Students in earth and environmental science courses use
ion chromatography (IC), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and
portable field meters to study the concentration and distribution of pollutants
in surface and subsurface aquatic systems. Chemistry majors, including
environmental chemistry majors, use IC and GC-MS at multiple times to study
concentrations of trace organic pollutants in the Hudson River, an in-class
environmental forensics investigation, and in organic chemistry. Using this
equipment, dual chemistry/education majors develop materials for use in their
future classrooms. These students use project-related equipment during student
teaching and after graduation. Guiding non-chemistry majors with limited
instrumental analysis experience is a student peer-educator. The project expands
cross-disciplinary research efforts by means of a series of undergraduate
projects.
