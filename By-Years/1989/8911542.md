This research project will be an analysis of typical microdynamic machine
elements and anticipated operating conditions to obtain a quantitative estimate
of the static and dynamic stresses encountered during normal steady state
operation, during transient operation, and during possible abusive operation|
These stress levels will be compared to the material mechanical properties data
generated during the experiments to determine whether or not certain materials
could be expected to operate reliably under the foreseen conditions. This
comparison might also reveal if reinforcing materials, layers, or materials
processing, such as in situ annealing, must be explored to develop the
mechanical properties for the desired application.
