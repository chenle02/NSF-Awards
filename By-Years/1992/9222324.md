9222324 KORNBLUM These studies are part of a broad, ongoing research program on
the basic, elemental, cognitive processes involved in the performance of simple
and complex tasks. In this research, the focus will be on a family of eight
classic experimental paradigms in cognitive psychology. According to the
taxonomy derived from Kornblum's recently published model, the dimensional
overlap model, these paradigms are all variants of either stimulus-stimulus
and/or stimulus-response compatibility. Fundamental problems come to light in
the course of attempting to identify the processing mechanisms that mediate the
facilitation and interference effects observed in performance with those tasks.
According to the model, these effects are consequences of the dimensional
overlap (i.e., the similarity) between the sets of stimuli and responses, and/or
the relevant and irrelevant aspects of these tasks. The experiments will test
specific predictions of the model. In particular, the first experiment will test
the model's predictions concerning the effects of irrelevant dimensions in four
related paradigmatic tasks, while the second experiment will seek to identify
the limits within which the model applies in single response tasks. The results
will not only contribute to our understanding of the cognitive and attentional
processes involved in performance, but will enable us to assess the consequences
of varying work load in these and other similar tasks. ***
