The Stanford Medical Youth Science Program (SMYSP) began in 1988 as a student-
directed program with strong faculty and Stanford support. SMYSP aims to
increase knowledge about the sciences and health professions and to offer
guidance about the college admissions process to low-income and underrepresented
minority students in the communities they serve. SMYSP provides value by
supporting Stanford's outreach efforts to academically talented low-income and
minority high school students through its university- and school-based programs,
raising the awareness of Stanford in diverse communities. Of the over 500 alumni
who have graduated from the Summer Residential Program, 99% have been admitted
to colleges and universities. Over 40% of the four-year college graduates are in
the process of becoming or have become health professionals.
