This award adds an experimental component to ongoing research on exploiting
type systems as a basis for interfacing dissimilar programming languages. The
experimentation will apply fundamental computer science insights to support
software for parallel numeric supercomputing. Three specific new efforts are
included: 1. Adaption of polymorphic type checking and inference, as found in
Standard ML, to deal with vectors, arrays and various numeric data types as in
Fortran 77; 2. Evaluation of "mixin" based inheritance as a framework for
structuring C-based numeric libraries into more modern and secure C++ clauses
and 3. Exploitaion of declarative language concepts as a high level "harness"
for parallelizing large blocks of existing imperative code. This work will be
performed while the Principal Investigator is on sabbatical leave at Cornell
University. this opportunity will take advantage of several unique resources:
(i) collaboration with research groups in constructive type theory, language
design for physical and mathematical scientists, and applications of dataflow
programming; (ii) interaction with the staff and users of the Cornell Center for
Theory and Simulation in Science and Engineering, and (iii) development of
prototype software on Cornell's 48-node BBN Butterfly multiprocessor.
