There are three main areas of proposed activity. The first one is developing a
technique based on quasiderivatives of solutions of Ito's equations and applying
it to processes considered up to the first exit time from domains. The second
area is investigating smoothness of solutions of SPDEs arising in filtering
problems and the theory of measure--valued processes in order to be able to
guarantee certain rates of convergence of approximations to their solutions. The
third area is estimating the rate of convergence of numerical approximations for
degenerate controlled diffusion processes. The project relates to the
investigation of the probabilistic behavior of certain objects. Part one is
aimed at better understanding of averaged quantities related to optimal control
of random processes arising in all types of applications from finance to
aerospace engineering. Part two aims at problems directly related to many
practical issues such as image reconstruction or high-performance computing in
eliminating "friendly fire". It is also vital in dealing with problems like
evolution of bacteria population which may be important in biotechnology. Part
three deals with ways of solving practical problems of optimal control of random
processes which arise in the applications mentioned above.
