The central equatorial Pacific is a very large region with high primary
production, which is hypothesized to support a substantial faction of global new
production. New production is important because of its link to the vertical flux
of meterial from the upper to the lower ocean and the implied role of that link
in how the ocean cycles radiatively-active gases (the greenhouse problem). This
project constitues a part of the US joint global ocean flux study (JGOFS) in the
central equatorial pacific and seeks to answer some baic questions about the
role of heterotrophic bacteria in the equatorial Pacific. Heterotrophic bacteria
are believed to be an important component of the equatorial pacific system as:
1. they are one of the predominant sinks of dissolved organic nitrogen and
carbon; 2. they are nitrogen rich with a carbon to nitrogen ratio of about 4.5;
3. they comprise a large portion of the biomass, and may at times be greater
than the phytoplankton; and 4. they account for a large fraction of ammonium
uptake in a number of marine systems. This project will examine the role of
heterotrophic bacteria in nitrogen cycling in the equatorial pacific and will
specifically measure bacterial production, biomass, and nitrogen uptake by
bacteria.
