This project, entitled "Digital Libraries Supporting Innovative Approaches to
Learning and Teaching in Geography" is a collaborative effort of University of
California, Santa Barbara and the Pennsylvania State University in the USA and
the Universities and Southampton and Leeds in the United Kingdom. The project
also informally engages partners at other institutions. The primary aims of the
proposed project are to develop a distributed enabling information
infrastructure for the support of learning and teaching Geography and to devise
innovative approaches to teaching and learning based on this infrastructure. The
project will deliver shared UK/US electronic resources associated with course in
several topic areas, including Human Geography, Geographical Information
Science, Geomorphology and Earth Observation. The project will build on a
variety of impressive digital resources which have been created by government
agencies, universities and other organizations. A primary resource will be the
Alexandria geo-referenced digital library, developed within the previous NSF-led
Digital Library Initiatives.
