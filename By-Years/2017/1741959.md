With funding from the National Science Foundation's Scholarships in Science,
Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) program, the Carroll
University Pro-STEM Initiative: Promoting STEM Retention through Self-Efficacy
will provide support to low-income students with demonstrated financial need and
academic promise to succeed in STEM disciplines at Carroll University. The
project will fund 128 scholarships over five years for students who are pursuing
bachelor's degrees in applied physics, biochemistry, chemistry, computer
science, and mathematics. To promote academic success and retention within these
STEM majors, the program will: (1) incorporate self-efficacy building strategies
in general education courses of Carroll University's liberal arts curriculum,
(2) foster support of project goals through a faculty professional learning
community populated by those who teach first-year courses in the targeted
fields, and (3) use peer-led study groups and community building activities that
support self-efficacy and retention.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will
integrate focused instruction that promotes self-efficacy development into
foundational general education courses for first year students. It will examine
whether or not this instruction improves persistence in the targeted STEM
majors, and if so how it does so. Building on self-efficacy research, this
project applies Habits of Mind strategies and practices (e.g., persisting,
thinking flexibly metacognition, striving for accuracy, and questioning and
posing problems) to help students build academic skills and self-awareness.
Activities of the project contribute to the knowledge base on STEM retention and
student academic success. The results will further serve as a model to aid other
small schools in increasing completion rates and effectively preparing students
for success beyond college.
