Structures of metals are examined at the atomic level, as follows: (1) reaction
rates of diffusing point defects with complexes of probe atoms and point defects
are studied to determine local lattice strains in metals; (2) Lattice sites of
probe atoms in nanoscale metal clusters with radii less than 100 nm are measured
to characterize how the structures of clusters depend on their size; (3) High
temperature ordered alloys are examined to find equilibrium point defects and
diffusion mechanisms; (4) Phase transitions and defect structures are analyzed
in shape memory alloys. Perturbed angular correlation measurements and Mossbauer
spectroscopy are the primary experimental tools employed in the research.
