9532056 Jiles This award is to provide a better understanding of certain
magnetic properties of steels that can be used for the nondestructive evaluation
of its mechanical state. a theoretical model will also be developed to permit
the phenomena to be used for safety predictions of steel structural members.
Prior research has demonstrated the phenomena but its physical basis is poorly
understood and how to use it under service conditions is therefore needed. The
key idea is to use both surface and bulk measurements to assess the residual
stress in these materials. Magnetic data has been shown to be highly sensitive
to the mechanical condition of the material. ***
