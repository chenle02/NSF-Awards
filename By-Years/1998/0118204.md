Abstract CTS-0118204 T. R. Blake and K. Jakus University of Massachusetts

One of the major needs in particle manufacturing is the separation of fine
particles into a narrow size distribution. This is particularly important in
manufacturing of nanoscale particles where separation becomes very difficult and
inefficient. Regular gas-particle separation techniques will not work when the
particles are very small because of the small ratio of particle inertia to drag.
The idea proposed in this project is to increase this ratio and, therefore,
significantly increase the efficiency of the fine particle separation by
decreasing the pressure in the separation chamber to near vacuum. As pressure
decreases, the drag on the particle decreases relative to the particle inertia
resulting in larger deviation of particle trajectory with the air streamline.
This will allow more efficient separation of the particles in an impact
separator. The proposed project is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the idea
by experiments and computational modeling of the process.

The proposed idea is innovative with considerable benefits to fine particle
manufacturing industry, if successful. The project contains a strong education
and research integration component with extensive outreach and community
service. The Principal Investigators have considerable knowledge and experience
in this area, as well.
