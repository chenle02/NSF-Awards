In preparation for airborne sampling of insoluble particles in atmospheric
chemistry field experiments this project in designed to develop insoluble
particle collectors with the highest possible efficiency for particles in the
diameter range 0.1 - 2.62 micrometer and for particles larger than 5 micrometer.
To overcome the fact that atmospheric particle concentrations are relatively low
and to minimize flight time, particles will be collected on large 90 mm diameter
Nuclepore filters. The system and its placement and orientation on the aircraft
will be designed in such a way as to minimize loss of particles in the intake.
This will compare the extent to which airborne particle recovery is
representative of particles collected on stationary, high elevation platforms.
