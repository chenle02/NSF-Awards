Most work on language acquisition examines acquisition of language in stable and
relatively homogeneous environments. In these environments typically developing
children become competent speakers of the language they are exposed to quickly
and efficiently. This project examines children's acquisition of grammatical
properties in a much less stable but very common situation, that of language and
dialect contact. Mutually intelligible dialects sometimes use the same
morphological units in different ways and with different interpretations. This
creates a lot of variability in the linguistic input for the learner, who then
faces a linguistic situation that may provide evidence for two different and
possibly incompatible grammars. Yet such children do develop their linguistic
abilities and the capacity to produce and understand sentences they never heard
before. Contact environments, therefore, provide a window for the researcher to
examine how the learning mechanisms decide which properties of the input are
"good evidence" and which are not. These environments can therefore shed light
on how the learning mechanisms cope with contradictory or ambiguous
input.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principle activities will be to build two
corpora of naturalistic child and adult speech of the two Spanish varieties in
contact (Rioplatense Spanish and Paraguayan Spanish spoken in Buenos Aires,
Argentina) and to analyze children's acquisition of grammatical properties,
which exhibit variability across the two dialects. The completed corpora will be
made available to other researchers worldwide (via the CHILDES database). Corpus
analyses will be supplemented with experimental data and regular linguistic
analysis with adult consultants. The goal is to provide both qualitative and
quantitative results that can shed light on the nature of the language
acquisition process and how it is affected by unstable variability.
