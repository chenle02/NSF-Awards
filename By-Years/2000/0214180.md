Summary: The project will reconstruct Holocene millennial-scale changes in upper
NADW properties in three cores on the Laurentian Slope that form a transect
between 1035 and 1854m water depth. Oxygen isotope, Mg/Ca, Cd/Ca and Zn/Ca
measurements will be done on benthic foraminifers to characterize deep water
properties including temperature and salinity estimates. Chronology will be
constrained by AMS 14C dates. Preliminary data indicate the cores have
accumulation rates of 20-50cm/kyr. Sampling intervals will range from 40-60
years. Oxygen isotope and Mg/Ca measurements of the planktic foraminifer G.
bulloides in the Holocene section of a core near the mouth of the Labrador sea
to relate the deep water changes to surface water changes.
