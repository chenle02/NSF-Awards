Sputter Initiated Resonance Ionization Spectroscopy (SIRIS), based on the
concept of laser-induced resonance ionization of sputtered atoms, offers the
potential to make in-situ chemical and isotopic microanalyses possible with
excellent sensitivity to low concentrations and combined excellent spatial
resolution. This project is a Phase I award under the Small Business Innovation
Research Program that will test SIRIS methods for analysis of calcium and
titanium isotopes in geological samples. The research plan is to assess
interference problems from sputtered ions and nonresonant photo-ions and to
identify analytical procedures for SIRIS analysis of calcium and titanium. The
studies will form a basis for more general development of SIRIS microanalytical
techniques for geological samples.
