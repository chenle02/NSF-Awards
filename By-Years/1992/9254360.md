In a cooperative effort between the College of Education and the College of
Engineering, various techniques will be tested in the basic and required course,
Materials Selection, (taught by one of the PI's) to involve students more
intensely in the learning process. Among the techniques that will be used are:
video tapes study with faculty and TA's as facilitators, student projects, and
an interactive socratic-type classroom environment. Naturalistic evaluation
techniques will be supervised by the College of Education. Students preparing to
become teachers of science will also be involved in the project as participants
and later assistants in the engineering course. They will also be affiliated
with ongoing research projects in materials engineering and will participate in
the research activities.
