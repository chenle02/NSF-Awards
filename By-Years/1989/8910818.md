This award will support Dr. Richard D. Schlichting of the University of Arizona
to conduct collaborative research for seven months with Dr. Takuya Katayama of
the Tokyo Institute of Technology. They will investigate the high-level design
processes that are involved in fault-tolerant distributed systems, and will
attempt to begin development of a programming environment to facilitate
implementation and testing of software for such systems. Problems of particular
interest in distributed systems include that of the construction of distributed
mixed-language programming; the development of a high-level approach to handling
failure in mixed programming languages; and the validation of fault-tolerant
programs. These problems, among others, will be addressed in this research. The
Japanese collaborator's expertise in language translation, software design, and
programming environments will strongly complement the U.S. Principal
Investigator's expertise in distributed and fault- tolerant computing, and
ongoing projects in distributed computing at the Tokyo Institute of Technology
will synergistically contribute to the success of this work.
