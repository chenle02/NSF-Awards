The Twelfth International Congress for Electron Microscopy will convene in
Seattle in August, 1990, as the first world EM Congress to be held in the United
States since 1962. This mile- stone event will establish the directions and
objectives for the theory and practice of microscopy and determine research
priorities for the remainder of the century. Although the emphasis will be on
electron microscopy, other advanced forms of imaging, such as confocal
microscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy, will also receive full coverage.
The scientific program is arranged around some 55 symposia and about 250
lectures by recognized international experts on imaging of crystalline and
amorphous materials, surface and bulk microanalysis and applications to
structural and microelectronic materials. More than 2600 scientific participants
are expected to attend and contribute at least 2800 platform and poster papers.
