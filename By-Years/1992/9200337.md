This Minority Research Award Planning activity is directed toward the use of
enzymes to facilitate organic functional group transformation under extremely
mild conditions often providing products in high yield. Enzymes have been shown
to be useful reagents in synthetic organic chemistry. This project suggests the
utilization of enzymes in the synthesis of macrocyclic lactones, porphyrins, and
certain classes of tropane alkaloids. A major goal of this planning activity is
to identify those enzymes capable of these transformations and to devise
synthetic methodology involving enzymes in the preparation of these three
classes of compounds. Preliminary experiments to strengthen the planned research
proposal will be conducted utilizing undergraduate students. %%% Enzymes are
catalysts for many biochemical reactions. In the past decade they have shown
great promise as laboratory reagents in the synthesis of new organic compounds
with great specificity and in high yield. A research proposal will be prepared
concurrently with the activities planned in this project.
