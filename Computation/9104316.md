This grant supports the research of Professor J. Pila to work in number theory.
In particular, he wishes to work on algorithms for counting points on the
reductions of Jacobians of hyperelliptic curves of genus 2. He also intends to
work on obtaining improved bounds for the number of integral lattice points on
curves lying inside squares. This is research in the field of number theory.
Number theory starts with the whole numbers and questions such as the
divisibility of one whole number by another. It is among the oldest fields of
mathematics and it was originally pursued for purely aesthetic reasons. However,
within the last half century, it has become an essential tool in areas such as
developing new algorithms for computer science and new error correcting codes
for electronics.
