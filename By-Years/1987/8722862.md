Masonry construction comprises a large portion of building construction in the
U. S. and the world. Reinforced masonry construction use is increasing in
moderate to higher seismic zones because of its apparent features of economy,
fire safety, architectural flexibility and ease of construction. The present
state of masonry structural analysis and design, and materials and construction
technologies does not enable an accurate prediction of building behavior under
lateral loads such as seismic loads. In the U.S., masonry buildings are designed
and built with methods, codes and standards that rely upon a mixture of working
stress methods, empirical rules, and questionable methods for determining
allowable stress values. Masonry is also a complex building material because of
the large number of design and construction variables which influence the final
product configuration and its response under seismic loads. In order to describe
the seismic response of masonry buildings it is necessary to develop the
fundamental knowledge base to determine basic design methodologies consistent
with safety and economic requirements. This research project includes a
preliminary and final design of a full-scale test structure, planning and
construction of a test facility, preparation of a test plan, construction of the
test structure, and conducting a full-scale test of a multistory reinforced
masonry building. Analytical modeling developed by other researchers is used to
estimate limit states such as yield, peak strength and interstory displacements
for families of earthquake probable in the full range of U.S. seismic zones.
This project is part of the U.S.-Japan Coordinated Program for Masonry Building
Research and the Technical Coordinating Committee for Masonry Research (TCCMAR)
Program.
