Project studies the existence and cause of shear-wave splitting and its
tectonic significance, using data from two areas, one of (intrusive) uplift, the
other of subduction. Shear wave splitting parameters are determined using
previously developed methods, and will be tested using a newly acquired,
independently developed program. Possible causes of shear wave birefringence are
investigated.
