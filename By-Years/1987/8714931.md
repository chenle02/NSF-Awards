This project continues an investigation of the physical phenomena underlying
the functioning of musical instruments, with ramifications that include
vibrating systems in general, sound production and control, computer modeling,
and nonlinear mechanics. Of special interest are: the mechanical admittance of a
violin at the bridge, and its dependence on the mechanical structures; the
stability of Helmholtz oscillations of a bowed string under various conditions,
including the location of the bowing point; the mechanism by which a violin
radiates sound; and the computer modeling and analysis of sound sources. The
results will be of broad interest in analyzing and interpreting audio-
vibrations from a variety of sources.
