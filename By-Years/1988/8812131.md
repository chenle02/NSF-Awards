It is proposed to investigate the roles of two organs, the yolk sac and the
kidney in hormonal regulations of calcium and phosphate in the chicken embryo.
The kidney functions during embryogenesis but its role in calcium and phosphate
regulation during this time is largely unknown. During the first half of
incubation the mesonephros develops; however during the latter half of
incubation both meso-and metanephros (the definitive adult kidney) are
functional. The mesonephros gradually regresses and ceases functioning about day
18. Dr. Clark proposes to measure the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and
clearance of calcium and phosphate in embryos of different ages and in response
to the presence or absence of calcium-regulating hormones Ä±parathyroid hormone
(PTH), calcium (CT) or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3!. The yolk sac is an embryonic
structure that the first provides calcium and phosphate from the yolk to the
embryo; later in development excess calcium derived from the shell is deposited
in the yolk. Dr. Clark will study the structure and function of the yolk sac in
normal and hormone-treated embryos in regard to uptake and transport of 45Ca and
32p, presence of calcium binding protein, and calcium and phosphate content of
the yolk. This work should provide new basic information regarding the function
of yolk sac and embryonic kidney, and add much to our understanding of the
ontogeny of calcium-regulating hormones and targets in birds.
