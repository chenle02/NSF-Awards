The proposal is aimed at transferring the implementation of certain large-scale
system stability calculations (the so-called Transient Energy Function) from its
current serial-computation environment. Since these algorithms are intended for
eventual use in an on-line decision making environment, demonstration of a
significant speed advantage gained by large-scale parallel coputation, together
with the experience of remote computational access is crucial to continuation of
scientific inquiry into the technique.
