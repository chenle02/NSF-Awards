9417585 Veblen This award provides partial funding for a technical support
position in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at The Johns Hopkins
University. The technician will support the operation and maintenance of the
combined electron microprobe and electron microscope laboratories at Johns
Hopkins. The University is committed to providing the remaining funds necessary
to support the technician's position during the two year duration of this award
and will underwrite the total cost of the position after the award period. The
operation of the electron microprobe and electron microscope laboratories is
essential to a number of ongoing research and graduate training programs in the
Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences and other departments at Johns
Hopkins, including Biophysics, Materials Science and Engineering, Mechanical
Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Geography and Environmental Engineering, and
Physics and Astronomy, as well as a significant number of off-campus
researchers. ***
