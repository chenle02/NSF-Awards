9527777 Francois This project will generate global maps of deep-sea calcite
burial over the last 30,000 years, using fluxes of calcite calculated from
230-Th accumulation. The results combined with models of alkalinity will be used
to evaluate the role of deepsea burial of calcite in the global carbon cycle.
