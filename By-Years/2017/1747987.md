The NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) was established by the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) as a national astronomical
observatory primarily to support spacecraft missions and to obtain infrared
observations of Solar System objects. The IRTF is managed, operated and
maintained for NASA under a Cooperative Agreement with the University of Hawaii
(UH) through its Institute for Astronomy. NASA provides the majority of the
operating cost of the facility as well as visitor support for the astronomers
carrying out programs focused on Solar System objects. Fifty percent of the
available observing time is allocated to Solar System observing programs. The
rest of the observing time is allocated to observational programs emphasizing
scientific programs outside the Solar System. The IRTF visitor use for these
non-Solar System programs has been supported by the NSF in the past. This grant
will continue the NSF funding support for visiting astronomers for the IRTF for
an additional two years.

From 2012-2016, 539 refereed publications have resulted from IRTF observations,
of which 395 are non-Solar System publications. Most of the IRTF staff is based
at the UH facilities in Hilo, situated in a largely rural setting with large
minority communities. Several underrepresented groups (e.g., native Hawaiian)
are employees of UH or are UH students with the IRTF. The IRTF contributes to
educational and public outreach within the Hilo community through three major
programs: Journey through the Universe, the Imiloa Astronomy Center, and the
Maunakea Scholars Program.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
