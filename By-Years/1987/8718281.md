This award is in support of geochemical research on the Greenland Ice Sheet. The
investigation's objective is to obtain temporal lead concentrations for the
2000=year period 600 BC to 1300 AD in the hard ice zone at about 200 to
600-meter depth. Temporal changes of lead in this period will be correlated with
historic periods of maximum industrial production at about 450 BC, 50 BC and
1300 AD interspersed by minima at about 200 BC and 400 AD.
