The Center for Advanced Non-Ferrous Structural Alloys (CANFSA) at Colorado
School of Mines (Mines) and Iowa State University (ISU) is the only university-
led consortium performing non-ferrous alloy physical metallurgy research, from
lightweight magnesium to high-temperature refractory alloys. CANFSA generates
and applies new knowledge to solve challenging problems identified by
university, government, and industry stakeholders via pre-competitive research,
supporting faculty, and building a student workforce pipeline trained in areas
of strategic importance to U.S. manufacturing, especially relevant to aerospace
and defense. CANFSA investigates industrially-relevant processing-
microstructure-property-performance relationships with state-of-the-art
experimentation and modeling, trains the next generation of non-ferrous physical
metallurgists, and supports students, faculty, and curricula in physical
metallurgy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CANFSAâ€™s thrust areas include lightweight, high
temperature, and other materials, including coatings, spanning the aerospace,
energy, defense, national security, infrastructure, automotive, and biomedical
sectors. ISU has the equipment, infrastructure, and personnel to support
research in non-ferrous physical metallurgy and the expertise in physical
metallurgy, materials characterization across scales and modalities, and
materials processing to tackle difficult problems through basic and applied
science, with state-of-the-art experimentation and modeling and application- and
manufacturing-based insights. CANFSA projects are structured to leverage the
outstanding capabilities and personnel at Mines and ISU along with industry
partners and national laboratories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
