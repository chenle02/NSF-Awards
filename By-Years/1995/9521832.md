In this project in the Physical Chemistry program of the Chemistry Division,
Professors F. Barry Dunning and Ken A. Smith of the Chemistry Department of
William Marsh Rice University will engage in a continuing series of
investigations of electron-molecule and ion-molecule reactions. In the present
work the emphasis is on reactions in which atoms in high Rydberg states
participate. Specific problems addressed are the lifetimes of collision
intermediates and their stabilization through energy transfer via interactions
with a third collision partner. In addition, Rydberg atoms will be used to study
energy transfer in ion-ion collisions, and create dipole bound negative ions and
investigate their properties. Rydberg atoms (or molecules) are systems in which
an electron is in a sufficiently large orbit so that the whole system resembles
that of an excited hydrogen atom. With increasing excitation the electron goes
into increasingly larger orbits until it becomes free of the rest of the atom
which thereby becomes an ion. Chemical reactions in which ions participate play
a major role and a full understanding of the reaction kinetics and dynamics
requires, among others, a detailed knowledge of the ion-ion, ion-molecule, and
electron- molecule collision processes. The research conducted here is directed
toward obtaining such knowledge.
