*** 9704190 Conrad Artificial neuromolecular (ANM) architectures are brain-like
computer designs in which the input-output capabilities of the neuronal units
are controlled by internal dynamics that serve to fuse signals in space and
time. These internal (or intra-neuronal) dynamics are motivated by molecular
process believed to be operative in real neurons. The pattern processing and
control capabilities of the global architecture this draw on neuronal as well as
network level dynamics. Evolutionary algorithms orchestrate this repertoire into
groupings suitable for coherent perception-action tasks, including tasks
involving complex sequences of actions. The system is being applied to Chinese
character differentiation and recognition/effector control behavior in a maze-
like environment. The objective of this project is to develop a methodology for
designing networks to increase the effectiveness of evolutionary computing as an
adaptation technique. The AM architecture is use as the testbed. Four submodels
with different types of dynamics have bee developed for this purpose. The first
is an abstract (dual dynamics), network model that consist of pattern
recognizing components subject to weak collective interactions. The second, the
cytomatrix neuron, is a softened cellular automaton. the third is a coupled
oscillator model motivated by the neuron cytoskeleton. the fourth is a general
simulation system that can be used to model motivated by the neuronal
cytoskeleton. The fourth is a general simulation system that can be used to
model a wide variety of intracellular dynamic processes involving the co-action
of kinetic and structural processes. These different submodels con be studied in
their own right and also can be embedded in the neural units of ANM system. The
comparative experimental study of these models complement theoretical analysis
and provided guidelines for adaptive surface engineering pertinent to a wide
variety of neural architectures. ***
