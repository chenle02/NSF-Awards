This award will establish a Research Training Group in Language Acquisition at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The faculty group includes 19 members
of two departments: that of Linguistics and Philosophy, and that of Brain and
Cognitive Science. The RTG will establish a new, 5 year graduate program with
elements drawn from the curricula of both departments. The funds awarded will
provide stipends for graduate students, equipment needed for the training
program, and limited travel funds and specialized technical assistance for the
trainees. An central focus of research in both linguistics and in cognition has
been understanding how the ability to use language develops in humans, both
historically and individually. Related questions involve the representation of
language in the brain, and the mechanism by which such representation is
computed or manipulated by the brain. Separate progress in our understanding of
the structure of languages, and of the structure and function of the brain and
of the other organs involved in speech has set the stage for significant
multidisciplinary research that synthesizes the experimental approaches and
results of traditional linguistics, of psycholinguistics and of computational
science. The training provided by this program will provide students will the
varied backgrounds and skills needed to do this kind of research.
