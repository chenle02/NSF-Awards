The goal of this study is to improve dramatically the quality of data on
homicides for the United States since 1959. By augmenting the data gathered in
recent years by the National Violent Death Reporting System, and by using
statistical tools to estimate the number of homicides that occurred in various
social, demographic, and geographical groups, the Project will for the first
time give scholars and law enforcement officers a highly accurate long-term
homicide series. Preliminary analyses document the extent to which reliance on
extant datasets has distorted knowledge of homicide in the United States. For
some categories of homicide, the researchers have found that merging police and
vital statistics homicide records at the state level can increase the tally of
homicides by as much as 30 percent over the numbers available from police
reports alone. By combining (a) data reported by police to the FBI, with (b)
data reported by health officials to their state vital statistics agencies and
to the National Center for Health Statistics and the National Child Abuse and
Neglect Data System, augmented when necessary by (c) internal police records and
newspaper accounts, the project will create homicide data series that are as
complete as possible. The research will be conducted initially in Ohio and then
in four more "open record" states (California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and
North Carolina), so named because their death records are available for
examination and chosen because they represent four different regions of the
country.

This research may improve the development and implementation of policies
concerning child abuse, domestic violence, and homicides among unrelated adults,
and will permit the testing of hypotheses concerning the impact of homicide
rates on clearance rates and other forms of deterrence.
