This US-Czech mathematics research project on Symbolic Derivation, Analysis,
and Programming of Finite Difference Schemes is between Dr. Stanly Steinberg of
the University of New Mexico and Dr. Richard Liska of the Czech Technical
University, Prague. Their research effort will extend the current symbolic
techniques used to study finite-difference approximations. The researchers hope
to improve the existing technology for analyzing truncation errors and
stability, and the algorithms for generating code. Cylindrical decomposition
algorithms will be used to study a system of inequalities that arise in a Routh-
Hurwitz problem obtained from the Von Neumann stability condition. Techniques
for comparing finite-diffence algorithms on non-orthogonal grids will be
developed. The researchers will pursue work with numerical diffusion and
dispersion, group velocities, stability of boundary conditions, conservation
laws, and stability analysis via the energy method. As a result of their
collaboration, the researchers expect to extend the FORTRAN-code generation
algorithms to a high-performance computing environment for use in study of a
five- dimensional Fokker-Planck equation and the three-dimensional Navier Stokes
equation. This project in mathematics fulfills the program objective of
advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States
and Eastern Europe to combine complimentary talents and pool research resources
in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
