The primary objective of this U.S.-Poland research project between Dr. Mitchell
Begelman of the University of Colorado, Boulder, and Dr. Marek Sikora of the
Copernicus Astronomical Center, Warsaw, is to improve our understanding of the
workings of active galactic nuclei. The researchers will do this by studying the
astrophysical consequences of their hypothesis that relativistic protons are
produced in quasars and other active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Their work should
yield quantitative predictions about the fluxes of very high energy gamma rays
and neutrinos. Detections of these particles would demonstrate the significance
of relativistic hadrons in AGNs and potentially support the theory that they
play a key role in formation of strong quasar winds. Results may solve several
theoretical problems related to the observed galactic phenomena of BEL (broad
emission line) and BAL (broad absorption line) regions. This project in
extragalactic astronomy fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific
knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to
combine complimentary talents and pool research resources in areas at strong
mutual interest and competence.
