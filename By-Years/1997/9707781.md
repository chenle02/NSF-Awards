THOMPSON DEB-9707781 Recent hypotheses on the coevolutionary process have
suggested that ongoing coevolution between species may require networks of
geographically interconnected populations. A major component of the overall
geographic mosaic theory of coevolution is that interactions between species
evolve through interconnected coevolutionary hotspots (i.e., communities in
which reciprocal evolution occurs between particular pairs of species) and
coldspots (i.e., communities in which the interactions are not coevolving). This
study will use the interaction between the moth Greya politella and its major
hostplant Lithophragma parviflorum to provide a direct test of whether
coevolutionary hotspots actually occur. This work will use the observation that
the Greya-Lithophragma interaction may vary from mutualism to commensalism to
antagonism among communities as a way of determining how coevolutionary hotspots
may be distributed geographically. Critical tests of the geographic mosaic
theory of coevolution are important for our applied use of ecological processes
for three reasons. First, these studies will help evaluate whether biological
priorities for conservation of species and the genetic richness they harbor need
to take these geographic mosaics into account. Second, results of these studies
will be useful in developing protocols for programs involving the geographic
mixing or homogenization of populations, as occurs in species reintroduction
programs and biological control programs. Finally, these studies will aid
directly in the development of a broader landscape approach to the application
of ecological processes and principles.
