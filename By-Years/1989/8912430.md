This research is an interdisciplinary program on the production of nanometer
sized metal clusters as a potential source of new materials. Clusters of gold,
silver, copper, and aluminum will be produced by a two stage rapid expansion of
these vapors in an inert carrier gas. Particles will be captured, transferred,
and compacted to "macroscopic" samples under high vacuum conditions to preserve
surface purity of the nanosized particles. These macroscopic samples, both as
produced and after sintering or hot pressing, will be characterized as to grain
size, grain shape, degree of consolidation, elasticity, and hardness. Nucleation
and growth of the clusters will be modeled using Monte Carlo calculations
employing the embedded atom method for computation of the potential energies of
various atoms in clusters of modest sizes and different configurations.
