The objective of this project is to develop a framework within which more than
one mathematical environmental model that simulates environmental processes can
be used and the results rationally considered in determination of optimum
solutions to environmental problems. The specific, extensively mathematically
modeled, environmental issues the investigator plans to address include those
characterizing sources and effects of acid- rain, those used in the
implementation of surface water quality management procedures that allocate
waste-loads, and the modeling of dose-response to low-levels of exposure to
ionizing radiation. Stochastic mathematical modeling of environmental problems
in support of engineering design to address these problems has been
traditionally based on the assumption that the simulation mechanics of the
system are correct and the input is random. This project is directed toward
dealing with the uncertainties of the simulation model itself. Results of this
project are expected to be utilized in improvement of the engineering design of
environmental processes and systems for addressing and dealing with the impacts
of pollutants on environmental resources of land, water and air.
