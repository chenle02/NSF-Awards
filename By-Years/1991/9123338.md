This award from the U.S.- Argentina Cooperative Science Program supports
research in chemistry to be conducted by Dr. Harold A. Scheraga of Cornell
University and Dr. Jorge Vilas of the Institute of Applied Mathematics (IMASL),
National Research Council of Argentina (CONICET), Argentina. The main goal of
the work is to understand the physical origin of the relationship between the
amino-acid sequence and the stability of alpha-helices in small peptides at
different pH's and temperatures. The project will combine two approaches, namely
molecular mechanics calculations and statistical mechanics theory. Statistical
mechanics incorporates the information obtained by molecular mechanics in order
to predict the most stable conformations of both new copolypeptide sequences and
more complex systems. The numerous experimental observations on short peptides
that are available from both NMR and CD measurements will be used in concert
with the proposed analysis to provide an understanding of the factors leading to
helix stability, and a reliable test of the empirical potentials used to
describe peptides and proteins. The project involves two established experts in
the field of molecular and statistical mechanics. ***//
