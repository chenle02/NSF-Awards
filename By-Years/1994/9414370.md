INT-9414370 Matkowsky This U.S.-Russia workshop will be held in September 1994
in Moscow and will bring together leading experts from both countries to discuss
Combustion. Dr. Bernard Matkowsky of Northwestern University will serve as the
U.S. organizer. His Russian counterpart is Dr. A. G. Merzhanov of the Combustion
Institute. The workshop will focus on both fundamental and applied problems of
combustion. The workshop will precede an international conference on combustion
dedicated to Ya. B. Zeldovich, who is regarded as the father of modern
combustion science and founder of the world class school of combustion research
in the former Soviet Union. This timing will enable U.S. engineers to meet a
very large group of experts from all parts of the Newly Independent States
(NIS). For many years, interaction with former Soviet experts in combustion was
very limited because of political barriers. U.S. experts will be able to
invigorate ties with their colleagues in the NIS, who are leaders in the field.
This joint workshop in combustion fulfills the program objective of advancing
scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States and NIS to
combine complementary talents and pool research resources in areas of strong
mutual interest and competence. It is expected that the meeting will foster new
U.S.-Russian partnerships as well as promote dissemination of information on
current research in combustion.
