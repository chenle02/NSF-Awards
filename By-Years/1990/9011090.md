A joint Mass Spectrometry Facility has been created by the Department of
Environmental Sciences and Engineering and Chemistry at the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC). The objectives of the Facility are to support and
promote chemical research and teaching in mass spectrometry at UNC. The Facility
will provide the capability for identification and structural characterization
of many different classes of compounds. Specific aims of some of the projects of
the major users are to gain insight into mechanisms responsible for the
activation of polycyclic aromatics to ultimate carcinogens; to understand sterol
metabolic pathways in the plant parasites; to synthesize nongenetic proteins; to
characterize intermediates in the biosynthesis of ecodysteroids in insects and
to identify neuropeptides controlling insect development; to understand the role
of -carboxyglutamyl (Gla) residues in blood coagulation processes; to
characterize potent enzyme inhibitors and to separate and identify products of
chlorination and ionization of humics in water. For these purposes, an mass
spectrometer is needed that is capable of high- resolution and accurate mass
measurements, chemical ionization, collisional activation ionization,
collisional activation, gas- chromatography and fast-atom-bombardment. The most
appropriate instrument is a hybrid-mass spectrometer.
