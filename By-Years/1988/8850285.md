Since 1971, the Exploratorium Explainer Program has provided more than 1,000
young men and women of high school age with meaningful work and education
opportunities in science and public education. In 1988, eighty to one hundred
students from San Francisco and greater Bay Area high schools will be chosen to
work as Explainers for one or two semesters. The Explainers' "job" is to help
the Exploratorium's large and diverse public use and understand our collection
of interactive exhibits. The Explainers undergo intensive training in aspects of
science before they begin working, and continue to attend weekend sessions on
specific phenomena throughout their tenure at the museum. Explainers receive
about seventy hours of formal instruction in science which is augmented by
extensive one-on-one association between each Explainer and our Senior
education, research and exhibit development staff. In addition, throughout the
year the Exploratorium host visiting scholars and scientists who meet with the
Explainers to discuss their work, as well as more general issues of scientific
controversy and philosophy. Through hands-on experience -- building and
operating actual demonstrations of phenomena, setting up biological experiments
for the public, and maintaining exhibit apparatus -- the Explainers gain a deep
familiarity with the fundamental concepts and activities of several scientific
disciplines. Through daily contact with museum staff and visiting scientists,
field trips to research sites, and other enrichment activities, they become
acquainted with the day-to-day experiences of working in scientific fields.
