The Environmental Chemical Sciences Program in the Chemistry Division at the
National Science Foundation supports Professor Cort Anastasio of the University
of California- Davis to study how photochemical reactions in snow can
significantly affect the chemistry and composition of snow and the overlying
atmosphere. We know relatively little about the rates or mechanisms of these
processes, and further complicating matters, it appears that the photochemistry
of a given solute depends on where the solute is located in/on ice. The two main
goals of this proposal are to: (1) quantify how the photoreaction rates of
environmentally relevant solutes vary with location in/on ice and (2) determine
whether a freezing point depression model can predict solute reactivity. These
goals will be achieved using laboratory experiments with carefully characterized
ice samples and illumination conditions. This work has the potential to
transform our understanding of molecular reactions in/on ice by revealing how
chemistry varies with ice compartment and by providing an experimentally-
confirmed kinetic framework that could be used to model snow chemistry. The
broader impacts of this work include: (1) training and mentoring a postdoctoral
fellow, a graduate student, and several undergraduate students, (2) integrating
research results into undergraduate and graduate courses, and (3) developing a
seminar series on climate change to be offered in Sacramento to engage state,
county, and city policy makers as well as the public.
