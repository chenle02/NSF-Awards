This proposal requests funds to establish and Analytical Ultracentrifuge
Facility at the University of Connecticut in its new Biotechnology Center. The
facility will employ centrifuges outfitted with the most advanced optical,
electronic, and mechanical improvements. In addition, a number of computer-
assisted data analysis methods will be installed for use by outside users.
Documentation of hardware and software will be made available to other
laboratories. The facility will meet many of the needs of the academic and
industrial research communities and set standards for new commercial
instrumentation in this field. In addition, the training, which will be promoted
by conferences and workshops, is expected to provide a broader personnel base
for transferring instrumentation developments from this facility to other
academic and industrial laboratories throughout the country. establishment of
this facility should have a major impact in making readily available the most
sophisticated analytical ultracentrifuge as well as some of the foremost experts
with whom to discuss research problems. Support is strongly recommended.
