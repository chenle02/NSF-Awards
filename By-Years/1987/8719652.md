This is an expedited award to assist in the Japanese Technology Evaluation
(JTECH) program. The JTECH program began at NSF about four years ago, and has
the purpose of examining selected areas of technology where the Japanese appear
to pose a significant threat to US economic competitiveness. To date, seven
technologies have been examined, including for example, telecommunications
hardware, computer science, advanced scientific computing, robotics, and
biotechnology. The reports of the JTECH panels have received widespread
circulation, and summaries have been published in a variety of technical
magazines. The JTECH program is now entering a third phase, with funding in
excess of $400,000, from NSF, DARPA, and the Department of Commerce. The
research to be performed by this study is on the process of performing studies
of the JTECH type. This study will be done in real time with feedback that could
improve the quality of the product significantly. The project is intended to
explore a number of issues that relate to the conduct and dissemination of
JTECH-type studies. Issues to be addressed include the assessment methodology
itself, the process of choosing technologies to study, methods for reducing the
costs of studying each technology, dissemination of results, and
institutionalization of studies of this sort.
