9307318 Hale In this work, molecular models, effective atom-atom potentials, and
Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics computer simulations are used to examine the
state, structure, vibrational spectrum, and free energy of formation of small
ice/water systems and to develop reliable macroscopic models for the prediction
of ice formation rates at low temperatures characteristics of cirrus cloud ice
and stratospheric ice. The projects in this proposal are directed at determining
the physical characteristics of small ice particles at low temperatures and of
small binary water-sulfuric acid clusters. The projects proposed are: (1) a
study of "effective surface tensions" for small H2O clusters at low temperatures
(-20oC to -80oC); (2) a study of the state (liquid versus solid) and the
infrared vibrational spectrum of small H2O clusters at low temperatures; (3) a
study of small water-sulfuric acid clusters, with the major emphasis devoted to
developing a tractable model for H2O-H2SO4 interactions; and (4) a study of ice
formation in four to eight monolayers of H2O on a model substrate. ***
