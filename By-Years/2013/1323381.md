A microlab is a form of active learning where students are asked to complete a
5-10 minute conceptual or programming activity during lecture. These labs can be
delivered on tablets, laptops or desktops. In a logical microlab, students are
asked to solve a conceptual problem by arranging and connecting on-screen icons
and submitting their solutions to an automated grading system (the exploration
phase of the microlab learning cycle). Then the instructor helps students
discover an algorithm to solve the problem (the invention phase). In the
application phase, students are asked to implement this algorithm by dragging
and dropping program statements, known as code magnets, to form a method that is
then compiled and tested. This approach had been evaluated over the last two
years by an independent evaluator and proved to be both educationally effective
and popular with students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is a collaboration
among three universities: Appalachian State University, SUNY Stony Brook, and
UNC Greensboro. The goals are (1) expand the development of microlabs as an
effective form of active learning and (2) in workshops organized by the
collaborative universities, train other faculty at regional universities to use
existing microlabs and develop new microlabs. Independent assessment of learning
outcomes is continuing for these new activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
intellectual merit includes further development of the microlab approach and
expanded application to new courses in the computer science curriculum. Broader
impact involves the development of cost-effective on-site workshops to train
other faculty to adopt the microlab approach and develop new microlabs,
implementation of a microlab repository for sharing these materials nationwide,
and development of a proactive model using small stipends to encourage new
contributions to the repository.
