The proposed project on US-EU Two-Dimensional (2D) Layered Materials and Devices
Workshop seeks financial support to support researcher participation in a
workshop to be held October 23-25, 2017 in Arlington, VA. The Workshop will
address research areas of a wide range of non-graphene 2D atomic layers such as
phosphorene, transition metal di-chalcogenides, hexagonal boron nitride,
tertiary compounds of carbo-nitrides, and complex oxides. Techniques of scalable
synthesis of these materials on multiple substrates and control of layer number
and defect density will be addressed. The Workshop will bring together leading
scientists working on graphene and beyond graphene 2D materials and devices from
Europe and the United States to help promote future collaborations and address
common challenges. It will also bring together program managers and
administrators from the two regions to discuss mechanisms that can be put in
place to facilitate future joint research programs. The workshop should
positively impact learning in the science and engineering disciplines through
personnel exchange programs that are likely to catalyze from this workshop,
including bi-lateral exchange of faculty, graduate students and post-doctoral
fellows. This workshop will have significant broader impact by catalyzing
potential international partnerships between leading researchers in the US and
Europe to discuss broad directions for future research in this highly dynamic
and interdisciplinary area. It is expected that it will promote bi-lateral
exchange of faculty, graduate students and post-doctoral fellows. Through such
exchange, the workshop will also facilitate the training of a globally engaged
workforce which should help promote science and engineering breakthroughs in
present-day global economy. A final report detailing the discussion topics and
conclusions/recommendations will also be posted.
