This project will investigate the effects of acrylamide as an agent for
disrupting normal distributions of intermediate filaments in cultured epithelial
cells. Part of the work is designed to understand the mechanism by which
acrylamide causes alterations in intermediate filament distribution. Effects of
acrylamide on keratin phosphoryation will be investigated, using both living
acrylamide-treated cells and a cell-free phosphorylation system. The effects of
phosphorylation on keratin structure will be studing by cross polarization magic
angle spinning 13-C NMR. Other work will focus on effects of acrylamide on
living cells in culture, e.g., effects on motility, cytoplasmic organization,
and cell division. Acrylamide will be used in conjunction with other
cytoskeleton inhibitors to investigate interactions among different cytoskeletal
elements. These studies should provide new information about the potential uses
of acrylamide as an intermediate filament inhibitor, as well as provide data
about the function of these cytoskeletal elements.
