Professor Mitchell plans to investigate the implications for algebraic K-theory
of recent developments in homotopy theory. In particular, he plans to study
aspects of algebraic K-theory connected with the Lichtenbaum-Quillen conjectures
from the point of view of higher periodicity in homotopy theory, using the
spectacular work of Devinatz, Hopkins and Smith; the point being that by work of
Thomason there shouldn't be any higher periodicity in algebraic K-theory. In a
related project he plans to study periodic self-maps of finite complexes, the
problem of realizing subalgebras of the Steenrod algebra geometrically, and
stable splittings obtained from the modular representation theory of symmetric
groups. These investigations will help to integrate two of the major algebraic
machines for investigating geometric spaces, namely homotopy theory, which has
been advancing particularly rapidly in recent years, and algebraic K-theory,
also the scene of intense current exploration.
