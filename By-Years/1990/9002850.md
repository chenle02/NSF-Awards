This work addresses wave propagation in extended, inhomogeneous,
multidimensional environments capable of channeling energy over many
wavelengths. Sound propagation in the ocean and electromagnetic guided-wave
propagation are two examples. The objective of this research is to further
develop and apply "microscopic" phase space (pseudo-differential and generalized
Fourier integral operator) methods and global path integral constructions to
derive new multidimensional algorithms for forward acoustic propagation and
generalized acoustic tomography at the level of the n-dimensional scalar
Helmholtz equation.
