There are many randomly growing systems. Spreads of fire, the cavity of melting
ice cube, and growth of bacterial colonies are some of the examples of this
kind. Such growth patterns have the common feature that if one location is
already a part of the pattern, then its neighborhoods are also likely to a part
of the pattern. In this project, we study some of the underlying fundamental
mathematical properties for certain classes of such randomly growing systems.
&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The underlying fluctuations of some of randomly growing
systems are governed by the random matrix theory. We plan to study the scope and
the limitations of the universality of random matrices. By studying the random
matrix models with rapidly changing potential for which the bulk universality is
not expected to hold, we should gain more insights on the limitations of the
universality. On the other hand, the analysis of the totally asymmetric simple
exclusion process on a ring and directed polymers will improve out understanding
of the universality class. We also plan to study the fundamental properties of
the Airy process and the Tracy-Widom, and also the asymptotics of discrete
Toeplitz determinants. In the projects, the integrable/solvable structure of the
underlying system will place a key technical role.
