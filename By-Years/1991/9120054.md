The current lack of commercially available Open Systems Interconnect (OSI)
dynamic routing technology represents a major impediment to the deployment of
viable large-scale networks based upon OSI. This project will exploit the
National Institute of Stnadards and Technology's (NIST) unique position within
government and industry in a program of work that is vital to eliminiating this
impediment. This proposal seeks funding to provide partial support for the first
12 months of the program of work. This program will establish a cooperative
laboratory for OSI routing technology and has mulitiple objectives: 1. Establish
a cooperative research program with participants from industry, academia, and
government interested in fostering conformant, interoperable OSI routing
products; 2. Provide an open testbed facility for OSI routing products; 3.
Foster mature commercially available OSI routing products; 4. Research and
develop methodologies and prototype tools to support conformance testing,
interoperability testing, and product level evaluation of OSI routing
technology.***
