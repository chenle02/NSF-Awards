This three-year award supports US-Ireland cooperative research on the origin and
distribution of sulfide mineralization in the Irish Midlands, epigenetic open-
space-filling dolomite and calcite cements, and dolomites as replacements for
limestone. The collaboration involves Jay Gregg and Kevin Shelton and their
graduate students at the University of Missouri and Ian Somerville's research
group at University College Dublin. The project's focus on fluid sources and
flow paths, and regional physical and chemical changes in sedimentary rocks is
important to understanding the distribution of base metals and petroleum in
basins.

The project brings together the complementary expertise of American and Irish
scientists and takes advantage of sharing of available facilities and equipment
in Ireland and the US.
