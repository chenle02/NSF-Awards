Abstract

Award: DMS-9971834 Principal Investigator: Kirill L. Vaninsky

We consider the problem of computation of partition function (in thermodynamic
limit) of classical particles interacting with Moser-Calogero potentials. Our
approach to the computation of the partition function can be viewed as a version
of the well-known in symplectic geometry Duistermaat-Heckman localization
theorem. The standard requirement in such theorem is that the Hamiltonian
produces a circle action. Many physically interesting systems, for example,
finite-particle Moser-Calogero systems do not satisfy this condition. We study
our versions of localization and convexity theorems when the dimension of
symplectic manifold become large.

At the present time the Moser-Calogero systems are subject of intensive
investigations. It turned out that some Super-Symmetric Yang--Mills (SUSY YM)
theories can be identified with the space of spectral curves of the Moser-
Calogero systems. We found a novel and deep connection between problem of
computation of partition function of Moser-Calogero particles and problems of
SUSY YM theory. The physics can be formulated in two different languages, but
mathematical nature of the problem is the same. Progress in these directions
offers new insights into the geometry of spectral curves, symplectic geometry
and, in particular, convexity theorems, theory of Toeplitz determinants and
spectral theory.
