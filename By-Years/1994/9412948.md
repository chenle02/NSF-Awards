In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry
Division, Warren will use ultrafast laser pulse-shaping techniques to produce
molecules in selected quantum states. A new pulse shaping approach will produce
easily adjustable waveforms with femtosecond structural features. A very rapid
method of pulse shape detection will also be developed. These techniques will be
applied to molecular systems to try to alter relaxation rates, selectively
excite molecules in the presence of competing absorbers, or force molecules up
anharmonic ladders. Experimentally measured molecular responses will be used to
make the target molecule itself optimize the design of the manipulation pulse.
%%% In these experiments Warren will be studying how to excite molecules which
are about to react so that the reactions will go along one desired pathway
rather than along one or several undesired pathways. This type of ability to
control the outcome of chemical reactions will have an effect on many chemical
manufacturing processes, making some possible which previously were not, or
making others more efficient and cost-effective.
