All cells must maintain a relatively constant volume in order to function
properly. The PI will use fish to study cell volume regulation since they are
excellent subjects in which to study this process. When marine fish move into
brackish water from sea water they are confronted with a dilution of their body
fluids because of the more dilute environment. To avoid a resultant swelling of
their cells they unload ions and small organic molecules from their cells and
thus balance the osmolarity (concentration of salts) between the inside and
outside of their cells. A non-essential amino acid, taurine, is a prime
component of this regulatory mechanism. Following dilution of the extracellular
fluid taurine is released from the cells into the blood and must then be
eliminated from the body. As it is not metabolised it must be excreted by the
kidneys. The PI has shown that the marine fish secrete this compound across the
kidney tubule cell by a transport system that is dependent on sodium ion and
partially dependent on chloride ion. The mammalian kidney appears to have a
similar transport system but it moves in the opposite direction; taurine is
reabsorbed by the kidney. In this project the PI intends to further characterize
this transport system and study its regulatory mechanisms. The information
gained in these studies should increase understanding of how cells regulate
their volume when confronted by changes in the concentration of the
extracellular fluids.
