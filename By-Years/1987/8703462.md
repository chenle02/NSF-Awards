The unicellular alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii possesses a CO2-concentrating
system that allows this organism to grow photoautotrophically at carbon dioxide
concentrations lower than most higher plants could survive. Recent work has
indicated that the chloroplast envelope may play an important role in carbon
dioxide accumulation. Two goals of this research are to characterize this
transport by C. reinhardtii chloroplasts and to identify the transport proteins
involved. Using intact chloroplasts, the role of pH gradients, monovalent ions,
and ATP in the accumulation of inorganic carbon will be examined. The long-term
goal of this project is to understand how the delivery of carbon dioxide to the
chloroplast is enhanced by membrane transport processes in higher plants and
algae.
