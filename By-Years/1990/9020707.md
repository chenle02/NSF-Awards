White dwarfs are the evolutionary end product of most kinds of stars, including
the Sun. Studies of them are important not only from this standpoint but because
they are well suited to determine the age of the disk of our Galaxy and also
because they excite internal oscillations that can be used to probe their
structures. The Principal Investigator (PI) wishes to upgrade a wide field
camera he has built with a new large Charged Coupled Device detector that he has
already constructed. This camera will be placed on the end of a small telescope
and used by a Ph. D. candidate to survey the brightness of up to a million faint
objects across the northern sky. This work will give a census of these objects
and will improve our understanding of their distribution in luminosity in color,
from which one can infer their ages. Thus, this work will provide many new white
dwarf candidates for later study as well as lead to a refined determination of
the disk of our Galaxy.
