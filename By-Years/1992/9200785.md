The detailed understanding of the deposition and transfer of energy in the upper
atmosphere requires a detailed understanding of the basic interactions between
the various ions, atoms, and molecules in the atmosphere. Laboratory measurement
of these properties is complicated because of the many states involved. This
award provides continuing support for laboratory measurements aimed at
determining important cross sections for interactions between selected states
involving the aeronomically important ion O+ and the N2 molecule. Similar
reactions of generally lesser importance involving other atmosphere species can
also be studies. Especially important is the prospect of obtaining results at
the low electron energies of most importance for aeronomy of the earth's
atmosphere. The PI has made important progress in developing specialized
equipment for this research, and it is expected that the results of this work
will be important for many fundamental problems in the understanding of the
atmospheres of the terrestrial planets.
