The project will investigate ways of making robots more user-friendly via an
innovative approach whereby the robot will be able to recognized the affecting
state of the interacting human and modify it's (robot's) own actions to make the
human feel comfortable to work with the robot. Wearable biofeedback sensors will
be used to measure a variety of physiological indices to infer the underlying
affective human states.
