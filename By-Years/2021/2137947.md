This award is made as part of the FY 2021 Mathematical and Physical Sciences
Ascending Postdoctoral Research Fellowships, MPS-Ascend Program. Emmanuel
Fleurantin is awarded this fellowship to conduct a program of research and
education at the Renaissance Computing Institute (RENCI) located at the
University of North Carolina (UNC) at Chapel Hill in the mathematical sciences,
including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of the
sponsoring scientist Prof. Christopher K. Jones. This project will develop new
computational tools concerning tipping phenomena in complex dynamical systems,
such as sudden abrupt changes in a climate subsystem. Along with this research,
Fleurantin will initiate training and outreach efforts to broaden participation
of Underrepresented Minorities in mathematical
sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will develop new theory in the
mathematics behind rate and noise induced tipping through research on: 1)
computations of stable/unstable manifolds of base attractors and complex basin
boundaries and their connecting orbits in a compactified system with a varying
rate parameter, 2) capturing the effect of noise-facilitated tipping through a
most probable path connecting orbit, and 3) understanding transversality of
intersections of manifolds in the complex systems arising in tipping point
problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
