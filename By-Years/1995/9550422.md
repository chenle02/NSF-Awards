An innovative technique for strengthening and retrofitting steel girders in
composite steel concrete bridges by epoxy bonding carbon fiber tape/plate to the
girder tension flange is presented. The feasibility of this technique will be
established via experimental and analytical modeling of coupon specimens.
Development of a project to study full-scale composite specimens which utilize
this innovative technique will follow. The research is anticipated to result in
new knowledge, add to the data base for integrating advanced modern materials
into Civil Engineering structures, and help bridge design engineers extend the
service life of existing bridges. The knowledge learned will guide a durability
study of steel girder bridges with carbon composite laminates. The interactive
activities are designed to provide greater visibility of women engineers on
campus and thus to encourage female students to pursue a career in engineering.
They include: teaching a sophomore level course and senior/graduate level
course; organizing a seminar series enhancing the visibility of women who hold
academic, industry, or government, positions within various specialties of Civil
Engineering; and assisting SWE members in organizing an engineering activity
during National Engineers Week to enhance visibility of female engineering
students to high school and/or grammar school students.
