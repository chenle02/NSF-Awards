A water drop, like any elastic body, will oscillate when subjected to a
suitable external force, while the resulting oscillations are intrinsically
interesting, they could be essential to understanding the merit and limitations
of various remote sensing devices employing microwaves, including various
meteorological radars. The work, largely experimental though guided by existing
theory, will attempt to examine the oscillations of water drops (0.8 to 5 mm
diameter) in a reasonably realistic though controlled environment and determine
the causes of the observed shapes.
