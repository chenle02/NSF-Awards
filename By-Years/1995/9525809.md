9525809 FLIERL The Southern Ocean is a region of great importance in the global
carbon cycle, yet the biogeochemical cycling there is not well understood. In
part this lack of understanding is attributable to paucity of observations, but
it is also a consequence of the multiplicity of spatial scales that control the
biology and chemistry of the Circumpolar Current-- from mesoscale to global
scale. This team of ocean modelers from the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology will focus on the biological, chemical, and physical processes
affecting the production, consumption, and transport of nutrients, inorganic and
organic carbon at mesoscale and higher spatial scales by modeling the mass
balance of carbon and its various pathways of transformation. Tracer studies
will resolve these processes down to the level of eddies. Then, the role of
eddies will be considered in the definition of the patchy distributions of
populations of marine organisms in the Southern Ocean. Finally, the results of
this modeling study will be combined with other models of the global carbon
cycle to better assess the role of the Southern Ocean in the global carbon
picture.
