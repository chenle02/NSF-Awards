The primary goal of this research program is to identify principles that will
help predict how arbuscular mycorrhizae function in natural and human-managed
ecosystems. Arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM) are composed of widespread beneficial
interactions between plant roots and specialized fungi. The availability of
nutrients and light, patterns of resource allocation to fungal structures, and
evolutionary history may all be important factors controlling the beneficial
effects of these organisms. The research proposed here will test the importance
of each of these three factors, and use the results to develop a unified
hypothesis of mycorrhizal function. Mycorrhizal structure and how it relates to
their beneficial functions will be studied at three grassland sites that differ
in soil nutrient characteristics ( Konza Prairie, Kansas; Cedar Creek,
Minnesota; Fermilab Department of Energy (DOE) site, Illinois). The effects of
soil nutrient concentrations and of light availability on how mycorrhizae
allocate resources to different structures and functions will be assessed in
field and greenhouse studies. The proposed research will work towards linking
field-based measurements of AM structure with their mutualistic function. There
are several broader impacts of this study. It will forge partnerships among
several institutions, including an international collaboration. Northern Arizona
University is uniquely positioned to train Native American and Hispanic students
by involving them directly in research and in student-initiated projects.
