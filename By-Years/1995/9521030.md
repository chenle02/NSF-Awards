9521030 Grischkowsky Ultra-dense, ultra-fast digital computing of the future
will require the transmission and reception of ps/subps electromagnetic signals
along wires and directly through free space, in a 0.1 um/sub-0.1 um minimum
feature size environment. This interconnect requirement is largely independent
of the ultimate choice of the type of active device. Using optoelectronic
techniques to generate ps/subps waveforms, we will have demonstrated that guided
wave propagation effects must be considered on the electronic chip level.
Through our measurements, we will have generated a knowledge base on which a
realistic transmission-line based wire interconnect could be designed. Using
optoelectronic techniques, we will have demonstrated both free-space, chip-to-
chip and freely propagating wave, on-chip THz interconnects. We believe this
project will set important new directions for the development of ultrahigh
performance interconnect and will also lead to a whole new perspective on the
characteristics of ideal ultrahigh performance active devices of the future. ***
