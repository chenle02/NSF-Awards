The correspondence between homotopy types and higher categorical analogs of
groupoids, first conjectured by Alexander Grothendieck, naturally leads to a
view of mathematics where sets are used to parametrize collections of objects
without "internal structure", while collections of objects with "internal
structure" are parametrized by more general homotopy types. Univalent
foundations are based on the combination of this view with the discovery that it
is possible to directly formalize reasoning about homotopy types using Matin-Lof
type theories.

We expect that this new approach to the foundations will finally make it
practical for mathematicians to use proof development software in their everyday
work. The sophistication and user friendliness of such software ("proof
assistants") have been growing steadily for decades and its use in computer
science is becoming standard. Enabling its use in pure mathematics will be of
great benefit to the new generations of mathematicians and to the mathematical
community as a whole.
