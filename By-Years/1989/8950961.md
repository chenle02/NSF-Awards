Harvey Mudd College is using a Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) camera and image
processing system to enable students to make a variety of observations in
astronomy. The camera is attached to a recently- completed 1-meter telescope
constructed by the college at nearby Table Mountain Observatory. It is being
used by students to search for supernovae in external galaxies and to do
photometry on galaxies and on globular clusters. Every physics major at the
college must complete a research project before graduation, and the imaging
system allows them to do projects in observational astronomy of extended objects
in a particularly appropriate way. Harvey Mudd College will match the grant with
an equal amount of funds.
