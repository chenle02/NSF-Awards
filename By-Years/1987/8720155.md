New Zealand streams near the Hope fault have responded rapidly to late
Quaternary uplift and climatic changes, and thus are ideal for the development
of new concepts. These powerful streams cut broad straths in bedrock at about
30,000 years ago, and at the present. Confirmation of the 30,000 years age
estimate, and measuring amounts of stream-channel downcutting since then, will
(1) identify active faults and folds and (2) provide the data for a regional map
of late Quaternary uplift rates. This map will be used to separate local from
regional uplift and to describe subareas with different tectonic styles that
have results from the oblique convergence of the Pacific and Australian plates.
Stream-gradient indices describe variations in channel slope and will be used to
further examine amounts of recent faulting and to study rates of upstream
migration of rapids and waterfalls caused by faulting in streams in with
different amounts of power. Terrace tread and strath surfaces will also be
evaluated as time lines passing through rapidly deforming landscapes. Stream
terraces are common in the valleys of the western United States, but are not as
suitable for efficient and complete testing of the tectonic model as the more
abundant and extensive New Zealand terraces. Concepts and methods resulting from
this study will be applicable to many other tectonically active regions, with
different climates, rock erodibility, terrace ages, and streams power. After
thorough testing in New Zealand, the proposed model should be used as a new
approach to better define areas of high seismic risk in the western United
States.
