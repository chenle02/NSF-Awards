The Platforms for Advanced Wireless Research (PAWR) program, as administered by
the PAWR Project Office (PPO), is building a shared intellectual foundation in
wireless research through the deployment of four large-scale network testbeds
across the U.S. These platforms provide unique capabilities for testing next-
generation network technologies, and for ensuring a healthy and inclusive
ecosystem for wireless innovation. With an emphasis on open and programmable
network systems, the PAWR program enables wireless research through 5G, 6G, and
beyond. It also forms a hub for academic, commercial, and government interests,
creating new opportunities for research collaboration designed to sustain U.S.
wireless leadership and economic competitiveness.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The PPO
will extend the success of the PAWR program by strengthening platform operations
to support research in areas such as spectrum sharing, open and software-driven
networks, and machine learning to optimize network performance. The PPO will
continue many existing efforts to drive the testbeds toward sustainable
operations and the production of meaningful research and independent datasets.
It will also introduce new activities to improve platform usability, target
high-value industry and government partnerships, and extend outreach activities
across the research community. These efforts will help to expand and accelerate
wireless innovation, and enhance both the connectivity and security of U.S.
networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
