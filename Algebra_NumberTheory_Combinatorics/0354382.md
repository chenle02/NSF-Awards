This project involves arithmetic geometry and number theory and focuses on a
systematic study of cycles on Shimura varieties and applications. The
fascination of diophantine problems -- the study of whole number solutions of
polynomial equations-- goes back to ancient times. The mathematical techniques
developed in the last 50 year to attack such questions have lead to significant
advances in our knowledge of this subject, for example the proof of Fermat's
last theorem. These same tools have, meanwhile, proved to be of great importance
in cryptography, the construction of new algorithms for computer science and new
error correcting codes for electronics. Shimura varieties are the geometric
objects associated to systems of diophantine equations with a great degree of
symmetry. Their diophantine properties have deep connection with many important
parts of mathematics.

An extensive study will be made of the arithmetic geometry of cycles on Shimura
varieties, with an emphasis on the interaction of their heights, arithmetic
intersections and density properties with modular forms and special values of
L-functions and their derivatives. Applications will be made to Gauss's class
number problem, equidistribution problems for cycles on Shimura varieties, and
the Andre-Oort conjecture, and the Tate and Bloch-Beilinson conjectures. This
collaborative project will take advantage of recent developments including
nonvanishing properties of Fourier coefficients of modular forms, the theory of
Borcherds forms and their connections with theta functions, and integral
representations of Langlands L-functions. A long range goal of the project is to
establish relations between the height pairings, periods, and algebraic cycles
and the derivatives of L-functions.
