A Dark Matter Workshop will be held February 14-16, 1992 at the University of
Florida. The workshop will bring together workers from several backgrounds to
discuss the nature of the non-luminous matter in the universe. The discussion
will consider the observational evidence for this non-luminous matter, its
nature, and prospects for direct detection of dark-matter particles. The nature
of the dark matter is one of the outstanding riddles in astrophysics. A workshop
bringing together theorists, experimentalists, and astronomical observers to
consider the problem is an important step.
