The method of Least Squares has been employed successfully to solve problems in
many scientific disciplines, including signal processing. The class of fast
Recursive Least Squares Algorithms was introduced in order to address certain
desirable performance traits, such as computational complexity, tracking, and
misadjustment. Although these algorithms have evolved over many years and are
widely used in signal processing, a common approach addressing the issue of
algorithmic stability has been lacking. This research provides an analysis that
fills this critical void in the research and development of these algorithms.
Descriptive definitions of stability are being examined which are consistent
with current and previous algorithmic analyses. The effects of the forgetting
factor - the extent to which prior information is weighted - with respect to
matrix perturbation theory and the control and propagation of arithmetic
roundoff errors are being studied. This research is also providing useful and
insightful gains in the important areas of filter misadjustment, filter
tracking, the conditioning of the auto-correlation matrix, and the usefulness of
the filter output. This research program joins the science of Numerical Analysis
with the science of Signal Processing, providing tools by which algorithms for
signal processing can be better designed and used, so that they will give more
accurate results.
