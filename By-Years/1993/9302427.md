Scott F. Singleton has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Singleton's doctoral degree was from the California Institute of
Technology under the supervision of Professor Peter Dervan. Dr. Singleton will
continue research at Pennsylvania State University under the sponsorship of
Professor Stephen Benkovic. Dr. Singleton's postdoctoral training will provide
him with the techniques necessary for detailed examinations of the kinetics and
mechanistic functions of enzymatic systems. Longer term he plans to design and
synthesize proteins that will bind specific electron donor-acceptor pairs which
will mediate photoinduced electron transfer. %%% The Postdoctoral Research
Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as an important infrastructural
program designed to broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and
attract them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and
teaching.
