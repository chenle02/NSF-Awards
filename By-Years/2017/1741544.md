This award supports participation in the 2017 Midwestern Graph Theory Conference
held at Grand Valley State University in Allendale, Michigan, on October 6-7,
2017. The meeting is the 58th in a longstanding series of conferences dedicated
to the dissemination of new ideas and techniques in graph theory and its
applications. The conferences are held nearly every year at various institutions
located in the Midwest and the surrounding regions. Attendees, including
undergraduates as well as graduate students and post-doctoral scholars, are
drawn from across the country.

This conference features plenary research talks by two well-known graph
theorists, as well as contributed talks on a variety of topics such as graph
coloring, structural and extremal problems on graphs and hypergraphs, and
applications of graph theory (e.g., to computer science, biological and social
networks, etc.). The entirety of the funds from this award will be used to
support the travel of participants, including students and early-career
mathematicians. More information about the conference is available at the
