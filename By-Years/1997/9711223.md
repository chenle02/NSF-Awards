9711223 Bloxham This award provides one-half of the funding for the upgrading of
the computer network system used for geophysical research in the Department of
Earth and Planetary Sciences at Harvard University. Harvard University is
committed to providing the remaining half of the cost of acquisition. The
network is used to support research across a range of fundamental earth science
problems including the generation of the Earth's magnetic field in the core, the
fine structure of the Earth's rotation, and the dynamics of the Earth's mantle.
