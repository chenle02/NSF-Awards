This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY 2009
and is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public
Law 111-5).The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host
laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in
biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to John
M. Jones is "Characterizing chemokine receptors and their signaling complexes."
The host institution for this research is the University of California San Diego
under the sponsorship of Dr. Tracy Handel.

Chemokines are small proteins that direct the movement of cells within the
mammalian body by binding to chemokine receptors. Due to their biological
importance, chemokine receptors and other related receptors are highly valued
targets for biotechnology as well as in basic research. However, progress in
understanding how chemokines work has been limited by difficulties in producing
receptor in the laboratory. This project seek to overcome this difficulty by
producing chemokine receptors in bacteria, which are commonly used to produce
proteins. Being able to produce sufficient quantities of receptor will allow the
pursuit of a variety of scientific experiments that otherwise would not be
possible. This project is also studying how these receptors interact with other
proteins within the cell, called a signaling complex, by using very sensitive
techniques to determine what proteins are associating with the receptor in
response to chemokine binding.

Training objectives include mentoring and teaching the next generation of
scientists. The complexity of this biological system promises a fruitful
research area for years to come and provides for the involvement of
undergraduate and graduate students who are attracted to research with practical
and societal benefits.
