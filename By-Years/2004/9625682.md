9625682 RALEIGH The University of Hawaii will operate the R/V MOANA WAVE in 1996
as a general oceanographic vessel in support of NSF-funded research projects.
The MOANA WAVE is a 210' research vessel owned by the U.S. Navy and operated as
a UNOLS vessel in support of academic research. The ship is scheduled for 174
days of which 116 are in support of NSF-supported programs. One NSF cruise is in
the south Pacific near Samoa, the remaining are of short duration out of Hawaii
in support the Hawaii Time Series project. In addition the vessel will support
cruises for NOAA, Navy and the State of Hawaii. The MOANA WAVE is part of the
academic fleet used by NSF to support oceanographic research. Most oceanographic
research requires highly specialized equipment that must be permanently
installed on a ship for which the ship must be specifically designed. This
equipment also requires highly trained crew members for maintenance and
operation. These vessels do not operate in the same manner as general cargo or
fishing vessels, therefore, NSF supports the operation of a variety of vessels
specifically dedicated to oceanographic research that are operated by
universities and research institutions around the country. ***
