This Presidential Young Investigator Award will support Dr. Huttenlocher's
research in model-based object recognition. Robotic recognition in complex
scenes tends to be slow and of uncertain reliability. Dr. Huttenlocher has been
developing methods that are efficient and accurate, with predictable or
controllable error probabilities. He will extend his characterization of Hough-
based methods to interpretation-tree search and other object-recognition
approaches, and plans to develop new algorithms using techniques of
computational geometry. These perceptual capabilities will be used in a robotic
planning and assembly system being developed jointly with Dr. Bruce Donald.
