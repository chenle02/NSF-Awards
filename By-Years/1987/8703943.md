Dynamics and chaos are subjects of increasing interest and excitement in the
study of optical systems. An international workshop to address the current areas
of difficulty, to assess the recent progress, and to permit sharing of ideas and
results is planned for July 8-10, 1987 in Italy. Topics needing thoughtful
discussion include: Spatial Pattern Formation, Polarization Effects, Transverse
Effects, Multi-level System Dynamics, Four-wave Mixing and Dynamics, Dynamics in
Semiconductor Lasers, Three-Frequency (quasiperiodic) Behavior, Few-Mode
Interactions, Quantum Chaos, Chaos in Highly Excited Atoms and Molecules,
Coherence and Statistics of Chaotic Behavior, Advances in Nonlinear Dynamics,
Applications and Technological Uses of Nonlinear Dynamics, Dynamics in Optical
Bistability, and Dynamics of Free Electron Lasers. This grant will provide
partial support for travel of US participants in this workshop.
