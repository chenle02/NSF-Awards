The PI has developed an analytical technique for delta 18O of sulfate, based on
barite delta 18O analyses. The main focus of the study will be to use the delta
18O of barite as a recorder for the d18O of seawater sulfate through the last
100 m.y., with particular attention to anoxic events in the mid-Cretaceous, with
additional attention to the Permian-Triassic boundary. Effort will also be
devoted to two related projects: studies of the delta 18O of dissolved sulfate
in modern pore waters to better understand the factors that control the delta
18O of sulfate, and a comparison of the delta 18O values of barite and the trace
sulfate in biogenic carbonates. Together these objectives will provide an
improvement in our understanding of the global sulfur cycle and its interactions
with the Earth's carbon and oxygen cycles.&lt;br/&gt;This research has the
potential to broaden our understanding of carbon and sulfur cycles over Earth's
history. The research will result in training of a post-doctoral scientist and a
graduate student. The work will also serve as a basis for creating stronger
interactions between geochemists and microbiologists at Harvard.
