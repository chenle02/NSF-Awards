The objectives of the study are the evaluation of magnetic seafloor spreading
axis from near-bottom magnetic (NBM) data and various methods of reduction of
NBM data, including the 3-D magnetic upward continuation from uneven surface.
The study will optimize the high-resolution information obtained by NBM surveys.
Existing deeptow data from mid-Atlantic rift valley near 25 degrees N will be
utilized for the study.
