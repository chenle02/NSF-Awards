Mechanical disruption of cells is a process currently used industrially to
obtain recombinant DNA proteins from bacterial and yeast cells. This method
yields a viscous solution that contains the product, cell fragments, nucleic
acids, and cellular proteins. Numerous problems including the clarification of
the solution, removal of the nucleic acids, and elimination of the extraneous
proteins are incurred to obtain the desired product. This research intends to
study the use of a chemical means of removing proteins from bacterial and yeast
cells. Various mixtures of Triton X100 and Guanidine HC1 are to be sed to do
this. Such a method should provide for a more easily clarified solution, an
elimination of the nucleic acid removal step, and an enhanced product recovery
yield. However, different methods of incorporating this step into an overall
production process have not been carried out. The objective of this study is to
provide methods for doing this.
