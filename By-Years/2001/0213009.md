The foci of this research are twofold. First, a structurally new class of air
stable, recyclable, efficient and selective chiral Ru catalysts for asymmetric
olefin metathesis will be developed. The new chiral Ru complexes will allow for
specific steric and electronic modifications that can shed light on the general
mechanism of Ru-catalyzed olefin metathesis. Further, the corresponding glass-
supported chiral catalysts will be prepared and examined as easily used and
highly recyclable chiral catalysts that can directly afford libraries of a range
of functionalizable organic molecules of high chemical and optical purity.
Second, a wide range of Ru-catalyzed olefin metathesis reactions will be
developed to afford optically enriched organic molecules that are not accessible
via Mo-catalyzed reactions nor by other available enzymatic or non-enzymatic
catalytic methods. The methodology will be demonstrated by the total synthesis
of the natural product (+)-africanol.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this renewal
award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the
research of Dr. Amir H. Hoveyda of the Department of Chemistry at Boston
College. Professor Hoveyda will focus his work on the development of new Ru-
based chiral catalysts for various olefin metathesis processes and he will
develop a wide range of Ru-catalyzed olefin metathesis reactions that will
afford optically enriched or pure organic molecules. The work has broader
implications for the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries and the project
is an excellent venue for the training of graduate students and postdoctorals.
