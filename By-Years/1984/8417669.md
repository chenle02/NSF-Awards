Recent research in three-dimensional visualization techniques has resulted in
new display modes that significantly extend the advantages of projection
radiography and computer tomography. As a result, the visualization of three-
dimensional structures for purposes of study and analysis becomes an
experimental reality. This research effort is concerned with the application of
video display and holographic display techniques to the visualization and
analysis of structures in fluid flow fields. A cross disciplinary program that
brings together imaging researchers and fluid dynamics researchers in a
university/industry project is undertaken. The output of this program will
contribute to both disciplines and lay the groundwork for future activities of a
similar nature.
