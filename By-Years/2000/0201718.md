In this project funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Vilesov will investigate fundamental properties of hydrogen
molecules and clusters trapped in ultracold helium droplets. The work consists
of two parts. In the first, the focus is on H2, D2, and HD molecules clustered
to chromophores with different properties. The second part will be devoted to
the study of neat hydrogen clusters, special attention being given to those in
the size range below 30 molecules. Infrared and CARS spectroscopy will be
employed in these investigations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research on molecules and
clusters entrapped in ultracold droplets of liquid helium provides new
information on their behavior not available with conventional techniques. Not
only do the trapped species vibrate, but they also rotate in the droplets, which
indicates that the interaction between the trapped species and the embedding
bath is minimal. The slight changes in the rotational energies relative of those
that pertain to gaseous molecules allow a quantitative assessment of the forces
that bind the molecules into the droplets. &lt;br/&gt;
