9402334 Sanchis This project involves investigation into various problems having
to do with efficient construction and generation of structures. In part it will
include continued research in the area of generation of test cases for NP-hard
problems. As part of this effort, further investigation will be done on the
construction of test cases for certain NP-hard graph problems, including the
maximum clique problem and the dominating set problem. This work will include
both improvement of previous test case generating procedures, and consideration
of new approaches. In particular, the relationship between the hardness (both
theoretical and experimental) of constructed test cases, and various instance
parameters (such as the edge density of the graph) will be further investigated.
Some related extremal graph theory problems arising from the construction
procedures will also be studied. The project also involves more theoretical
aspects of the generation and construction problems. This area is concerned with
the feasibility and/or complexity of the construction and generation problem for
various types of languages and structures. Some unanswered questions in this
area will be further investigated. ***
