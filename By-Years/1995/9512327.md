9512327 Lush This is a project to establish a modern laboratory for the non-
destructive characterization of the optical and electrical properties of
materials and solid state devices. The tools to be acquired are (1) a CCD-
camera-based spectral imaging system to observe luminescence and reflected light
with spatial resolution; and (2) a Kelvin probe station that measures the
spatial dependence of surface potentials and of surface and bulk electronic
states in materials and devices. Establishment of this laboratory (1) fills a
void in the ability to properly characterize materials and devices fabricated in
laboratories under existing research projects; (2) allows research in novel
techniques for the characterization of CdTe/CdS polycrystalline, thin-film solar
cells (and other thin films); (3) supports development of advanced techniques
for the non-destructive testing of optical and electronic materials; (4)
provides research training for graduate and undergraduate students in solid
state physics, materials, image processing, and class selection; and to (5)
attract underrepresented minorities (Hispanics and women) to pursue both
undergraduate and graduate degrees in science and engineering.
