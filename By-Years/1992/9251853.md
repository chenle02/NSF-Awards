A digitized local database has been provided by the Tennessee Valley Authority
to support undergraduate training at University of Tennessee at Chattanooga in
ARC/INFO and related systems in order to develop a professionally trained
workforce to staff federal, state, local, and private resource management
agencies. This database together with the requested equipment will enable the
Biological and Environmental Sciences Department to improve its environmental
science curriculum and, at the same time, give its undergraduate students hands-
on experience with Geographic Information Systems and Remote Sensing technology
. The project should produce environmental science graduates better prepared to
enter a rapidly expanding job market or continue in graduate education.
