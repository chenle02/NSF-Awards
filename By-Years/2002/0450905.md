This is a proposal for the support of FOSBE 2005 (Foundations of Systems Biology
in Engineering) during August 7-10, 2005, at the University of California in
Santa Barbara. The objectives of FOSBE 2005 are: to provide an in depth review
and critical assessment of the current state of the art; discussing the current
and future needs of research, education and training; and identifying new
directions, opportunities, and challenges in system
biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award is being made to Cache Corporation, a
non-profit organization, for only the direct cost (partial support for 12
academic plenary speakers, subsidy for 20 graduate students and postdoctoral
associates, and costs of conference publication and
administration).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A conference website exists with detailed
information (http://www.fosbe.org). A brochure had been e-mailed using the
combined AIChE-SBE, AIChE-CAST, and CACHE lists to approximately 1000
individuals and departments worldwide. In addition, hardcopies of the brochure
had been widely distributed at national and international conferences and
meetings. A final program and brochure will be distributed using the
aforementioned lists in September. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
