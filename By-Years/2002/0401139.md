The PI proposes to participate in the SuperK Experiment, which uses a large
water-filled detector placed deep inside of a mountain in Japan. The PI's
scientific goal is to study baryon number violation, including neutron-anti-
neutron oscillations and nucleon decay. As a member of the SuperK collaboration
it is also the PI's responsibility to partake in the operation of the detector.
Funding as approved will enable him to carry out his commitments.
