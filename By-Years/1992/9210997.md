Despite the attractive generality of domain independent planning techniques,
their inefficiency has severely hampered the attempts to scale them to complex
real world planning domains. One very promising solution to this involves
enabling the planner to improve performance from experience by reusing
previously generated plans to solve new planning problems. Developing effective
plan reuse frameworks is thus currently a very active area of research in
automated planning, machine learning and case based reasoning communities.
Successful design of such planning systems requires a thorough understanding of
the fundamental tradeoffs between storage, retrieval and modification in plan
reuse. In the previous work, a domain independent planning framework called
PRAIR which facilitates flexible modification of existing plans to solve new
planning problems in the context of hierarchical least commitment planning has
been developed. Experiments with PRAIR have demonstrated its potential to bring
about order of magnitude improvements in planning performance by incrementally
modifying existing plans in a variety of domains. PRAIR framework thus promises
to be an ideal test bed for investigating the issues of utility of reuse. This
research, a unified reuse framework is proposed based on PRAIR modification
framework, an is used to study the utility tradeoffs involved in plan reuse This
framework will also be used to study ways of integrating reuse with other
speedup learning techniques such as abstraction and search control rules. The
effectiveness of the resulting reuse framework will be demonstrated by
experimenting with the classical planning domains and more complex real world
applications such as process planning. Results from this research will help to
design plan reuse frameworks with demonstrably favorable utility tradeoffs
thereby facilitating scaling up of domain independent planning techniques to
more complex domains. This research will thus have a significant impact on
automated planning, machine learning, and case based reasoning communities. //
