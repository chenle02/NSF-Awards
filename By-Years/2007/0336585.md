The goal of this project is to improve our ability to track how students learn
to solve mathematical problems and how better to instruct mathematics in the
context of intelligent tutoring systems. The underlying model of cognition
informing the research program is Anderson's ACT-R. The researchers will look
both at the potential of eye tracking and of brain imaging to improve the
tracking of learning. It will focus on a computer-based algebra tutor that is
currently in use in high school and is being adapted for use in middle schools.
Past research has shown that instructional interventions based on eye movements
can improve learning by detecting when students are having problems and by
disambiguating the nature of their confusions. The current research will focus
on developing interventions based on using a practical web-based camera that
might be deployed in the classroom. The goal is to devise a system that will
respond to the course of learning in the individual. They propose three project
lines: The first project, involving fMRI brain imaging, will identity brain
correlates of critical aspects of mathematics learning (e.g., whether there is a
different pattern of activiation when students have simply made a computational
error as opposed to when are they confused). The second project will conduct
brain imaging studies during tutorial interactions. The research team will
attempt to confirm that the Regions of Interest identified in the first line
will generalize to learning with the tutor. They will also attempt contingent
tutoring in which they branch instructional decisions depending on the brain
signal. The third project will focus on advancing eye tracking methodology to
the point where it can be used for instruction in the classroom by means of a
web-cam.
