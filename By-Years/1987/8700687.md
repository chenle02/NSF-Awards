The thrust of this research is to investigate how statements containing
imprecise quantifiers can be represented in a form suitable for computation. The
treatment of these quantifiers is done in the framework of support logic
programming which can be viewed as a generalization of both probability and
fuzzy set techniques. Also addressed in this research are the need to
incorporate (imprecise) quantifiers in the support logic programming, the
problems that arise when such an attempt is made, and the methods which could
lead to possible solutions. The goal of this project is twofold: on a
theoretical level the PIs seek to develop a systematic way of dealing with
(imprecise) quantifiers and possibly give an axiomatic treatment of this
subject. At the application level the PIs intend to actually develop the
software necessary to augment the existing support logic programming system by
incorporating a quantifier handling module.
