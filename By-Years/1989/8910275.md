The major objective of this research project is to determine how cell lineage,
developmental hormones, cell interactions and developmental genes influence the
fate of neurons within the developing nervous system of an insect. Within the
nervous system of the moth, >Manduca> >sexta>, adult specific neurons are
generated during the larval stage by arrays of neuroblasts. Each neuroblast
generates a nest of developmentally arrested progeny. With the onset of
metamorphosis the development of the adult specific neurons resumes.
Electrophysiological techniques will be employed to determine both the
physiological and morphological properties of the arrested cells during the
larval stage and as they develop into mature neurons. The influence of the
developmental hormones on the fate of the new neurons will be examined. Using
surgical manipulations, Dr. Booker will also determine if the size of the
periphery influences the fate of the adult specific neurons. The role of
segmental determination in the development of the insect nervous system will be
examined using two approaches. First, a screen for new homeotic mutations in the
moth will be conducted. The new mutants will be analyzed to determine if they
influence the fate of identifiable pattern elements within the segmental
ganglia. Second, DNA in >Manduca> which shares homology with the homeobox genes
of >Drosophila> >melanogaster> will be cloned. The cloned moth genes will be
characterized as to the temporal and spatial pattern of their expression within
the segmented ganglia of both wild.type and mutant animals. These complimentary
approaches will further the understanding of the role of the developmental genes
in segmental and neuronal determination.
