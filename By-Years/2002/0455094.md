Support is provided to the American Physical Society (APS) for organization and
student travel to participate in the joint Canadian, US, and Mexican physical
societies' graduate student conference (CAM 2005), to be held in August 2005 in
San Diego, CA. The meeting will generate scientific exchange among them student
participants, promote international collaborations among young scientists within
the North American continent, expose graduate students to sub-disciplines in
physics beyond their individual research areas, and promote interdisciplinary
research within the sub-disciplines. The meeting's organization is carried out
by the students. The conference theme is "Physics without borders" and it will
emphasize to the students the growing importance of viewing science in the
international perspective. Overall, it will provide excellent training for next
generation researchers in the U.S.
