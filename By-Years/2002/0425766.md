This workshop will explore initial experiences in e-democracy in the US and in
Europe. As well as experts in academic research aspects, attendees will include
representativess of government agencies who have experimented with e-democracy
on both sides of the Atlantic. Using a focus group methodology, the group will
explore such questions as: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;o What created the demand for
the e-democracy projects which were undertaken?&lt;br/&gt;o What were the
principal barriers and facilitators encountered?&lt;br/&gt;o What strategies
were employed to overcome barriers?&lt;br/&gt;o What changes in democratic
practices, processes or structures have occured as a result of the
projects?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A variety of new research questions will also be
identified, and the workshop results will be disseminated on the Web and through
scholarly journals.&lt;br/&gt;
