A Thermco low-pressure chemical-vapor-deposition (LPCVD) system capable of
depositing thin films of good-quality polysilicon and low-temperature silicon-
dioxide will be purchased. This system is desirable because of the rapidly
increasing number of applications of thin-film LPCVD polysilicon in silicon
integrated circuit technology, and because of the emphasis on LPCVD polysilicon
applications in current and anticipated research.
