The mental process of predicting the reasonable consequences of a change in the
design of an artifact is an important step in the design process. This research
addresses issues in developing a theory of design change. The premise is that
the incremental changing of the geometric design of an artifact may be formally
explained by logical and mathematical theories, similar to those in automated
planning and simulation systems which are used in many fields. Topics being
investigated are representation of designs, designer intentions, and
constraints. A computational model of the deductive process of changing a design
is being developed. The model uses frame laws and default constraints expressed
in the modal quantificational logic Z. Other work includes exploring problems of
automated deduction of facts in three dimensional geometry, consistency
analysis, and developing a taxonomy of appropriate engineering design actions
and intents.
