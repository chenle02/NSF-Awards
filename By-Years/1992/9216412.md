The PI proposes to generalize the three-dimensional model developed in his
previous work to include bottom topography. The proposed study consists of the
development of a hierarchy of ocean circulation models based upon the planetary
geostrophic equations, i.e., the equations of motion with relative acceleration
terms replaced by a simple Rayleigh friction. The PI's goal is to develop a
three-dimensional, finite element, moving-vertical-node, world-ocean planetary
geostrophic model within the proposed three- year cycle. Such a model offers an
attractive alternative to existing primitive-equation models and could be useful
in climate studies because it can be solved efficiently enough to be run for the
hundreds or thousands of model years required to reach equilibrium.
