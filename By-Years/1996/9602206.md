Studies of proton removal reactions from few nucleon targets using intermediate
energy electrons are proposed. These studies will provide new information on
both the reaction dynamics and on the nuclear structure of these fundamental
nuclear systems. The experiments will be carried out at the Mainz facility in
Germany and at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (TJNAF) in
Newport News, VA. Members of the group are active contributors to the
experimental program at TJNAF, and will participate in additional
electromagnetic interaction studies there. The CSULA program is noted for its
outreach efforts with the participation of a number of Hispanic minority
students, both undergraduate and high school, in these forefront research
activities.
