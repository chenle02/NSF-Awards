Concerns regarding election fraud and election manipulation associated with the
substantial expansion of voting by mail in the 2020 elections due to COVID-19
may threaten citizens’ trust in American election outcomes and the electoral
system. This study provides insights into public beliefs about voter fraud
related to mail-in voting and the effectiveness of new information provided
through social media and media outlets. The study also assesses how people’s
beliefs and experiences with COVID-19 are related to their perceptions of
electoral integrity.

The study collects behavioral and survey data from Americans in a multi-wave
nationally representative survey. The panel survey design compares the accuracy
of citizens’ factual beliefs about the prevalence of voter fraud between late
summer 2020 and two survey waves conducted immediately following the election in
November 2020 and just prior to the presidential inauguration in January 2021.
The second wave includes an experiment evaluating the effectiveness of
corrective information from the media. The study assesses the information people
encounter online about the election by analyzing behavioral data from
respondents using human-coded and machine learning approaches.
