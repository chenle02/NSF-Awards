The project establishes a computer graphics laboratory in the Chemistry
Department to enable students to gain hands-on experience in molecular
visualization, modeling, and computational techniques. The laboratory is used by
students in courses in organic chemistry, physical organic chemistry, and
molecular modeling. Chemical concepts are demonstrated in course lectures using
computer graphics and visualization, and students perform assigned exercises
themselves in the laboratory to reinforce and extend their learning of the
concepts. Two sessions of the organic chemistry experimental laboratory course
are being transformed into molecular modeling sessions, and the graphics
laboratory is being used extensively for the current elective course on
molecular modeling. Independent, student-initiated molecular modeling projects
are being encouraged, and the new equipment allows for sophisticated studies.
The effectiveness of incorporating computer methods into undergraduate chemistry
will be reported at national meetings and in research papers. This project is
advancing involvement with collaborators at the University of Massachusetts, the
University of California at Santa Cruz, and elsewhere in preparing a syllabus
for the use of molecular modeling in the undergraduate curriculum. *
