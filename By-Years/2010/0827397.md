This project explores connections between computational logic and polyhedral
combinatorics through the paradigm of Quantified Polyhedral programming.
Quantified Polyhedral programming encompasses Quantified Linear Programming
(QLP) and Quantified Integer Programming (QIP); both the programming paradigms
are extremely useful in modeling environment-dependent actions in real-time
scheduling problems. Quantified Integer Programs can also be used to formally
verify the correctness of programs through the mechanism of Abstract
Interpretation. This project aims to provide a framework in which traditional
notions of duality and convexity can be extended to the 2-person game setting.
For instance, a typical optimization problem is defined by an optimization
function and a convex set, called the domain of feasibility. In real-world
applications, such as robot navigation, the domain is not fixed but varies
continuously as a consequence of events initiated by the environment. Thus, the
concept of optimality needs to be defined in a 2-person
setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a broader front, the investigator plans to
significantly advance the state-of-the-art in Quantified Polyhedral Programming
through a combination of innovative research and the integration of research
themes into graduate and undergraduate education. This work will have the added
benefit of increasing the participation of women and under-represented
minorities in computer science research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is co-
funded by West Virginia EPSCoR.&lt;br/&gt;
