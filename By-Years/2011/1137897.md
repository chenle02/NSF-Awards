Intuitively it is reasonable to agree that even when all the reactants are the
same the biochemical reactions that take place in a laboratory test tube should
probably differ from those that take place in highly complex neurons. The
purpose of this project is to develop a theoretical framework to understand the
fundamental structural properties of neurons that can completely modify the
outcome of the biochemical reactions that are at the foundation of learning and
memory. This project will make use of computer simulations that to study how the
structure of the surface and interior of neurons affects molecular reactions
involved in memory formation. A branch of mathematics, called fractional
calculus, will be used to generalize the findings of the simulations. The same
formalism will be extended to study how neurons express proteins or how networks
of neurons interact with each other. The project will generate knowledge to
study the outcome of experiments aimed at understanding memory formation,
complex proteins networks, and information processing in the cerebellum; this
work will also provide a unified mathematical framework to understand the
exquisite interaction between biochemical signals and the complex structure of
neurons in which they take place. The knowledge generated will be disseminated
with a computational toolbox that can be used in any area of biology interested
in complex systems, from biochemistry to ecology. This proposal will provide
training opportunities to minority bilingual undergraduates not only in the
scientific aspects of the project but also to develop Wikipedia pages in Spanish
to help the American Hispanic population get better access to scientific
information in neuroscience and biophysics. The project will also allow the
training of a graduate student and post-doctoral fellows which will enrich the
academic environment of UTSA, a Hispanic serving institution.
