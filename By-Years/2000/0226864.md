Title: "Surface Blast Effects on Embankments and Dikes"

Abstract:

This research deals primarily with surface blast effects on embankments, dikes
and levees. These geotechnical engineered type structures are used for many
purposes, and an important use is for flood protection and control. Hundreds of
miles of embankments and levees exist for flood control in the country.

The research is specifically related to damage assessment of such structures
from surface blasts (the typical terrorist scenario), and the utilization and
improvement of such structures for security purposes.

The most critical time for embankments and levees is during flood conditions.
Unlike many other natural disasters, floods occur routinely, and in any given
year it is virtually certain flooding will occur in some parts of the country.
The breaching of a levee during a flood could cause large amounts of property
damage and even loss of lives; especially near large metropolitan areas, e.g.
New Orleans. Unfortunately, it is also easiest to breach an embankment or levee
with explosives during flood conditions.

Small scale physical models will be tested, utilizing RPI's 100 g-ton
geotechnical centrifuge. Centrifuge modeling is extremely attractive as an
experimental approach to the study of ground shock problems, and many such
studies have been conducted. Most of the previous research has been conducted on
level ground, dry soil conditions and/or with embedded explosives - that is, not
surface blasts.

Centrifuge experiments will be conducted using a range of 50-100 gravities. The
explosive charges will vary in weight from milligrams to one gram, and will be
detonated using exploding bridge wires. A one gram charge in a 100-gravity
centrifuge experiment is equivalent to several tons of actual explosives.
