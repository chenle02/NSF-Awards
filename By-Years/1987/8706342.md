The South Carolina Institute of Archaeology and Anthropology at the University
of South Carolina holds the only collection of human osteological remains in the
state. Unfortunately, these materials have never been adequately processed and
preserved so that they are unavailable for research. During this project, staff
will clean and repair materials, catalogue and document each skeletal remain,
and reshelve according to modern standards of collections management. Although
small, this collection has integrity due to its regional nature and temporal
span. The collection is also important because skeletal materials in the
southeast are generally in poor condition due to the extremely wet soil. With
upgrading, this collection will allow researchers to learn about the adaptations
of native american, anglo-american, and black groups in the region. These
materials will increase our understanding of the cultural history of the
southeast.
