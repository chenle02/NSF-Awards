During the period 1968-1974, certain American scientists challenged the existing
relationship between science and the state. In raising ethical questions
concerning the funding of research for military projects and those of
questionable social value, from the development of hi-tech weaponry to debates
over genetic engineering, these scientists viewed science as an inherently
political activity. This dissertation research examines the experiences and
motivations of the `radical` scientists who held this worldview as well as those
factors -- religious, intellectual, and political -- that contributed to the
emergence of a radical science movement. Using various nonviolent strategies to
affect change within the existing establishment of American science, these
scientists sought to reformulate the ideology and ethos of science and its
institutions. This research will explore the historical context of the movement
to probe important ethical issues involved in the radical scientists' critique
of the existing scientific establishment and its relations to government,
industry, and society, and in the radical scientists' perception of and
interaction with contemporary social movements. By investigating this heretofore
overlooked aspect of American radicalism, the study will contribute to a richer
understanding of how these scientists introduced a new vision of the ethical
relation of science to society that continues to shape debates concerning
science and values today.
