The University of Kentucky seeks support to develop a statewide network of
middle grades mathematics teachers, align mathematics content and teaching
practices in the state with the NCTM Standards, and provide opportunities for
collaboration among classroom teachers, instructional supervisors, teacher
educators, and university mathematicians. Eight teams of university faculty,
classroom teachers, and instructional supervisors will develop seminars designed
to enhance the teaching of algebra, geometry, probability and statistics.
Pedagogical emphases include problem solving, use of manipulatives and
technology, cooperative learning, and alternative forms of assessment. The teams
will conduct seminars for 300 middle grades teachers throughout Kentucky, who
will in turn conduct workshops and establish support groups for middle grades
teachers in their respective districts. All eight state universities and four
private colleges in Kentucky will participate in the project. Cost share
provided by the universities and the schools is 25% of the award.
