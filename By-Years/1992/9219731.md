In an interdisciplinary effort among geologists and statisticians, this project
seeks to improve methods of time correlation in stratigraphy. By combining the
best aspects of existing methods of graphical correlation with operations
research, PIs will develop a solution in the form of constrained optimization.
One part of the procedure seeks the best sequence of first and last appearance
events, allowing subjective judgments about quality of data; a second part
positions the events along a time scale by adding simplifying assumptions about
accumulation rates. Repeated, rapid trials expose the consequences of different
judgments and assumptions. Procedure will be applied to a mid- Ordovician
correlation problem in the Great Basin.
