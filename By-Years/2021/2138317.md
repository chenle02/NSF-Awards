Microplastics, defined as plastic pieces smaller than 5 millimeters, are a
massive litter problem in the worldâ€™s oceans. The Arctic Ocean, while remote, is
not immune; recent work has found microplastics in all components of the Arctic
system, including within the floating sea ice cover. While marine microplastics
are ubiquitous, the physical characteristics of the polar oceans, including sea
ice, lead to effects unique to the polar regions. For example, microplastics may
have an impact on climate by darkening the usually bright white sea ice and its
overlying snow cover, which would result in an increase in the absorption of
sunlight and thus in warming and melting. Furthermore, the presence of sea ice
affects where microplastics are found within the Arctic, as sea ice and the
underlying ocean transport microplastics differently. This project is addressing
both these processes. As microplastics are a global problem with potential
impact on the health of the marine ecosystem, understanding the way sea ice and
microplastics interact is crucial for informing strategies to deal with this
pollution in the future. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this interdisciplinary
research project, laboratory studies and numerical models are being used
together to make progress in understanding the interactions between Arctic sea
ice and microplastics. The researchers are developing new laboratory techniques
to understand the exchange of microplastics between sea ice and the ocean during
uptake and release, including the effect of marine gels on this process. They
are also measuring the effects of the optical properties of microplastics on the
mass balance of sea ice. Based on those laboratory insights, they are developing
and testing parameterizations for including microplastics in open-source,
community sea ice, ocean, and climate models. Both one-dimensional (i.e.,
vertical column) and three-dimensional (i.e., full sea ice/ocean-coupled) models
are being modified from existing code and run. Hindcast and future simulations
are being performed to assess the impact of including microplastic ice-ocean
exchange parameterizations on the large-scale distribution of microplastics in
the Arctic Seas and their impact on climate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
