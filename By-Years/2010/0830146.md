Funds are provided to establish a Liaison Activity for the US section of the
Ecosystem Studies of Sub-Arctic Seas (ESSAS) program. This will support the
administrative activities of the US Co-Chair of ESSAS and facilitate
communications between the US programs associated with ESSAS and the ESSAS
Project Office in Bergen, Norway. These programs include MENU, a joint
Norwegian-US comparative study (Marine Ecosystems of Norway and the US) and
BEST, the newly funded Bering Sea Ecosystem Study (BEST) Program. Additional
ESSAS programs involving US scientists are in the planning phase. ESSAS was
founded to facilitate the use of comparative studies of the sub-arctic seas as a
tool for predicting marine ecosystem response to climate change and its effects
on the sustainability of fisheries. ESSAS is motivated by the realization that
the sub-arctic seas are in the midst of significant, interrelated physical and
biological change that may impact the sustainability of their production of fish
and shellfish. These changes involve climate forcing of physical properties and
processes in the ocean and the subsequent responses of organisms, from the level
of individual physiology to the structure and function of ecosystems.
