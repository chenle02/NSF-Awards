Asymptotic and algorithmic properties of groups&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs
propose to study asymptotic and algorithmic properties of groups.&lt;br/&gt;The
topics include a torsion free non-amenable finitely presented
group&lt;br/&gt;without free non-abelian subgroups, a finitely presented
infinite torsion group, &lt;br/&gt;Dehn functions of groups including Dehn
functions of residually finite and &lt;br/&gt;Metabelian groups, isoperimetric
functions of aspherical manifolds, residually &lt;br/&gt;finite hyperbolic
groups, structure properties of hyperbolic groups (is every&lt;br/&gt;torsion-
free hyperbolic group free-by-finite exponent?), n-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;diagram
groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Algorithmic properties of groups have been a
subject of intensive study&lt;br/&gt;since the beginning of the 20th century
(Dehn and Tietze). Novikov, Boone&lt;br/&gt;and Higman showed deep connections
between logic (especially the theory of&lt;br/&gt;recursive functions) and group
theory. A more recent work by Gromov and&lt;br/&gt;others showed a connection
between algorithmic and asymptotic properties&lt;br/&gt;(especially
isoperimetric and growth functions) of groups and the
related&lt;br/&gt;topological objects. The PIs found even more intimate
connections between&lt;br/&gt;complexity of algorithms and asymptotic properties
of groups. In particular,&lt;br/&gt;they have characterized groups whose word
problem is in NP in terms of Dehn&lt;br/&gt;functions and Higman embeddings,
found an NP-complete group, etc.. The PIs&lt;br/&gt;propose to further study
these connections, and their applications to some&lt;br/&gt;outstanding
Burnside-type problems. In particular, they propose to use&lt;br/&gt;Higman
embeddings to construct finitely presented torsion groups and in
the&lt;br/&gt;study of Dehn functions of metabelian groups. Another direction of
their&lt;br/&gt;research deals with connections between geometry and structure
of groups. In&lt;br/&gt;particular, they propose to study the class of finite
dimensional diagram&lt;br/&gt;groups, for dimension greater than two which, they
believe, include a large &lt;br/&gt;class of groups acting ``nicely" on cubical
complexes. Structural properties of &lt;br/&gt;hyperbolic groups will also be
under investigation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
