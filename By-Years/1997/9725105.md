In the field of biological sciences, there is a sense of expectation and
conviction that it is timely to provide training to students, postdoctoral
fellows and investigators the most up-to-date developments in the theory and
application of sedimentation. Beckman Instruments takes the leadership role in

at the campus of the University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas from
