9420667 Rahman As a result of the changed priorities in the power industry in
the United States, it is believed that environment-sensitive planning with a
focus on transmission open-access needs significant attention in power
engineering research. A research effort is proposed which will deal with
environmental quality, impacts of environmental considerations on reliability,
and ways to incorporate transmission cost in pricing the cost of energy with
environmental externalities. The proposed research will integrate the
environmental considerations explicitly into the power system planning process
and incorporate load uncertainties arising from the possibility of the loss of
wholesale loads to external suppliers (due to transmission open-access). This
will be accomplished by applying the eigenvector (EVM) and the interdependent
data analysis (IDA) technique in extracting expert opinions on scenario
likelihoods for uncertainties related to transmission access. ***
