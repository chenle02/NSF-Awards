9310613 Lu In this proposal we present a research program that aims at answering
the challenge of ULSI metalizations by adopting a new approach to applying
metallization using a very practical technology. We propose to investigate the
epitaxial metal contacts to GaAs and InP, formed using partially ionized beam
deposition technique. This technique offers surface self-cleaning, low
temperature epitaxial deposition, excellent control on composition of the alloys
to be deposited, and all of this in a non UHV deposition chamber. The
metallizations to be investigated are epitaxial films of Al, CoSi2, Co2P, Ge2Co,
and A12Pt. These metal and alloy films are carefully selected to satisfy our
needs of stable metallization with the best chance to form them epitaxially on
GaAs and InP. The deposition, characterization including process stability, and
applicability will be determined. The most promising scheme will then be used to
fabricate a MESFET on GaAs and/or InP. ***
