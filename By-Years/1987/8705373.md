Scorpaenoid fishes (rockfish, scorpionfish, stonefishes, and their allies) form
a dominant element of the fauna of all tropical and warm seas. Although
commercially and medically important, their taxonomy, biology, and evolutionary
history are poorly understood. This study will complete taxonomic revision of
several included families, provide an estimate of the interrelationships of thse
scorpaenoid families with emphasis on stonefish relatives, provide detailed
morphological and morphometric analyses of several biologically important
features unique to the group, provide analyses of shape and other changes
important to comparisons with other fishes, and generate additional collections
of rare and poorly known species.
