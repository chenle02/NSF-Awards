This three-year REU site at the University of Arkansas will provide students
with opportunities to participate in innovative separations research. The cost
of chemical and pharmaceutical manufacturing is dominated by the cost of
separation processes to obtain a pure product. In fact, it is estimated that up
to 10-15% of the world energy budget and 90% of pharmaceutical manufacturing
costs are due to separation processes. Separations processes that recover and
purify compounds of interest from a mixture are essential for almost every
aspect of modern society including drinking water, therapeutics, food, and
beverages. Ten undergraduate students will be selected each year to spend ten
weeks performing research in the laboratory of a successful faculty member. In
addition, students will participate in a commercialization assessment training
series that will prepare them to think about the potential commercialization of
traditional hypothesis-driven research. Students will leave the REU program with
an understanding of how academic research and commercialization work together to
solve societyâ€™s grand challenges. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cost of chemical and

of Arkansas is to teach a diverse group of undergraduate students how to create
and execute research involving separations, while simultaneously becoming aware
of the skills needed to assess the commercial potential of their projects. They
will be led through a custom designed commercialization series based on the NSF
I-Corps Lean Canvas methodology. Students will work in successful laboratories
across multiple departments including chemical engineering, civil engineering,
biomedical engineering, and chemistry &amp; biochemistry, The MAST Center
provides the unique opportunity for the REU participants to interact with
industry leaders in the separation field through industrial mentorships, plant
tours, and live-streamed presentations at the close of the REU program. Students
will leave the REU program with an understanding of how academic research and
commercialization work in tandem to solve humanities grand
challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
