This is a collaborative research award involving the University of Texas at
Dallas and Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. The
investigators will use data from the SuperDARN radar network and the Defense
Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) to study convection in the high latitude
ionosphere. Both the SuperDARN radars and the DMSP spacecraft make routine
measurements of ionospheric plasma motion, but both suffer from temporal and
spatial limitations in their coverage. The study will begin with the calibration
and validation of the two data sets, leading to the development of techniques to
reconcile the observations. Once that is complete, combined data sets will be
used to study the ionospheric response to changes in the interplanetary magnetic
field (IMF). Specific questions to be addressed are the saturation of the cross
polar cap potential when the IMF is southward, the response time of the
convection to changes in the IMF, and convection patterns when the IMF is
strongly northward. This work will aid in the development of space weather
models which are used to predict conditions in the space environment that affect
technological systems, such as electric power, navigation, and communication.
