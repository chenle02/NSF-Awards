Quadriplegics, and speechless quadriplegics in particular, are particularly
helpless to aid themselves because of their limited ability to communicate with
their environment. This is a very innovative approach that proposes to use the
patients brain.waves as a signal for commanding computer control over the
patients environment. Thus, the patient would not have to have any overt
movement at all for these controls. This has obvious benefits when, for
instance, considering quadriplegics driving electric wheel chairs. This research
may also be the first attempt at speechless communication. For the severely
handicapped, speechless communication would be a great benefit.
