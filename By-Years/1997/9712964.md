HRD-9712964 The language of science is difficult to learn for many children -
but much more difficult for children who cannot hear. This project is designed
to bring new technology into the classroom that can help deaf children to
succeed in science by making both the language and the methods of science more
accessible and engaging to them. Project objectives are: o To develop and
implement strategies using video captioning technology to enhance student
achievement in science at three schools for the deaf in New England. o To
replicate the initial implementation in a school educating both deaf and hearing
students. o To disseminate the findings of the research as well as the enhanced
curriculum and strategies for its effective implementation. The project will
integrate three building blocks: A successful science curriculum that is already
sold nationally, a pedagogical collaboration with teachers of deaf students that
has already extended over three years, and a new enabling technology that has
been developed and evaluated specifically for children who are deaf. The project
will bring these three components together creating a science curriculum that
offers new opportunities to actively engage deaf children in doing and
understanding science by reducing the pervasive barriers of time, motivation,
and instructional methods that presently impede their progress. The curriculum
will be elaborated and evaluated in classroom tests, modified as necessary, and
then replicated and disseminated. The research design includes approximately 50
upper-school students in four schools for the deaf. Acknowledging the
impossibility of adequate matching of control and experimental subjects, a full
reversal (ABABAB) design will allow evaluation of whether the intervention
condition is associated with enhanced learning. Both quantitative and
qualitative methods will be used to maximize the generalizability of the results
and to capture valuable informati on obtainable only from individuals. The four
different pedagogical approaches of the participating schools in the study
ensures broad applicability to educational settings for children who are deaf.
The science curricula and methods developed in this study will have an immediate
impact in the four schools within the study and on all schools that already use
this science curriculum. Beyond these schools and this specific curriculum,
however, the tools and methods developed in this project should have wide
general applicability.
