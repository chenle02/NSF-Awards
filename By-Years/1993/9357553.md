Siu Artificial neural networks present a new model for massively parallel
computation and a promising paradigm for solving large scale optimization
problems. This research is exploring the advantages of neural network-based
models over conventional models for computation, and a novel design of
neuromorphic computing architectures for applications in signal and image
processing. A theoretical framework is being established to derive tight
tradeoffs between the number of elements and the number of layers in neural
networks. The results should answer some of the key open questions in the
analysis of neural networks using classical mathematical tools such as rational
approximation techniques and harmonic analysis.
