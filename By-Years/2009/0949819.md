The project will focus on a closely related group of plants in the carrot family
that are commonly found in South America. Despite centuries of research in this
group, relationships among its members have remained inscrutable. These problems
are reflected in wide-scale confusion among species and identification of larger
groups of species. Preliminary data suggests that these problems stem in part
from multiple, parallel evolution along the Andes mountain range, and from
exchanges between South America and Australia/New Zealand, probably through the
sub-Antarctic region. Solving these problems will provide insights into the
origin and evolution of the plants in the Andes and the environmental forces
that have shaped their diversification. The researchers propose a multi-
disciplinary study that involves intensive field studies, collection of data
from both genetic and morphological sources, monographic revisions, and analysis
of how the species are related to each other. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
collaborative, multi-disciplinary, and integrative design of the study provides
many opportunities for impacts of this research to the broader community. The
project involves students across several levels from high school to
undergraduate and graduate students that will work along with an international
team of researchers who have specialties in field biology, herbarium studies,
anatomy, morphology, and genetic data. Each training opportunity is also
designed to be an "exchange of expertise" among the project participants,
allowing participants at all levels to serve as both teachers and students of
different skill sets. Furthermore, this integrative, multi-disciplinary approach
will serve as a model for the study of other major groups of plants where many
evolutionary problems persist, as well as for other groups of organisms that
evolved in the Andes and the Southern Hemisphere.
