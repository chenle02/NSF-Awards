ABSTRACT

This proposal is concerned with estimates of wave equations on (both compact and
non-compact) Riemannian manifolds, possibly with boundary. We are interested in
how the geometry, the boundary and the regularity of the metric influence
certain basic estimates. Problems of this kind arise in the study of harmonic
analysis on manifolds, the study of local and global solutions of nonlinear wave
equations and in the study of eigenfunctions in quantum chaos. Although these
topics are widely separated in their physical and historical origins, the
relevant mathematics is closely related. Techniques and insights in the various
areas cross-fertilize each other in a fruitful way. In particular, a common
theme of much current research (and the problems in this proposal) is to try to
understand and exploit the mass concentration of eigenfunctions and solutions of
linear and nonlinear wave equations. The basic estimates that we have in mind
are Lebesgues-space estimates (both linear and bilinear) in space for
eigenfunctions and quasi-modes, and (local or global) Strichartz estimates in
space-time. The main questions center around how the geometry and especially the
presence of a boundary affects the estimates and the kinds of solutions that
saturate them. The latter issue is closely related to the much studied (but
still not well understood) questions of concentration, oscillation and size
properties of modes and quasi-modes in spectral asymptotics. In the non-compact
setting it is also closely related to the distribution of resonances and their
relations to trapped geodesics.

The above problems arise naturally from interactions between mathematics and
areas in physics that include general relativity, quantum mechanics, and quantum
chaos. The techniques employed include stationary phase and the study of
propagation of singularities. There is a very active group of researchers in
quantum physics groups at major universities studying high-energy eigenstates,
and I am especially interested in making further contributions to this area.
