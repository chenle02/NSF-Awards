Newts defend themselves from predators such as snakes by secreting a potent
nerve poison, tetrodotoxin (TTX), but some populations and species of garter
snakes have evolved resistance to TTX. The molecular mechanism for this
resistance is known, as is one of the genes involved, providing an excellent
opportunity to investigate the evolutionary genetics of a trait that has a clear
adaptive value. The studies will include a survey of the genetic differences
underlying the variation in resistance to TTX in different populations and
species of garter snakes and a molecular genetic evaluation of the role of
natural selection in the evolution of resistance. Several factors could underlie
the presence of resistance in multiple populations. These are multiple episodes
of independent evolution, spread across populations, or shared ancestry; these
alternatives will be tested with molecular genetic analyses. The research will
result in disentangling the role of novel mutations, recombination, and gene
flow in explaining the geographic patterns of phenotypic
diversity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will help to support graduate and
undergraduate education in behavioral and molecular genetics. The PIs will
promote the participation of minorities and women in science careers through the
Utash State University NSF ADVANCE program, the USU Multicultural Research
Fellowship Program, and the Mountain Lake Biological Station REU program. The
snake-newt system will continue to be developed as a model to illustrate the
evolutionary process to the general public through outreach education (similar
to the recent PBS-TV material and articles in popular media) and exhibits in
museums.&lt;br/&gt;
