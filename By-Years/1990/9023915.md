This research will investigate the micro-structure of various types of non-woven
geotextiles. Specifically 1) direct methods (water vapor impregnation and image
processing techniques) will be utilized to quantify the micro-structures of the
geotextiles of interest, in addition to the current practice of obtaining data
only from indirect methods (dry and hydrodynamic sieving methods); 2) a number
of performance tests will be conducted on various types of geotextiles and soils
to evaluate the performance to determine the suitability of the geotextiles to a
particular soil-type under simulated field conditions; 3) the micro-structure
and the performance data received from step one and two respectively will, in
turn, set the stage for the development of a mathematical model relating micro-
structures of geotextiles and its hydraulic properties in field conditions; and
4) an attempt will be made to develop an expert system for selection of
geotextiles for filter and drainage application.
