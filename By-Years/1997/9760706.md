*** 9760706 Oder This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
addresses the dry magnetic separation of magnetically similar particles with
otherwise dissimilar surface characteristics. Separation of unburned carbon from
pulverized-coal combustion fly ash will be used as an example. A novel
laboratory scale continuous separator will be built to establish the proof-of-
concept of using surface properties to enhance selectivity in the dry magnetic
separation of micron sized particles. Separation and concentration of
carbonaceous particles found in micron-sized pulverized-coal combustion fly ash
will be evaluated. The quantity and quality of low carbon fly ash which can be
prepared by the method will be determined. Phase I will include testing of fly
ash from power plants with and without low NO burners, and a conceptual
evaluation to assess the feasibility, costs and benefits for the novel method. A
nominal 200 to 1000 pounds per hour pilot unit is planned for Phase II. The
market for carbon removal is being driven by low NO burners which result in high
carbon levels in the fly ash. Use of the magnetic-based technology will minimize
fly ash disposal costs and maximize returns for sales of the by-product.. The
estimated total market for fly ash equipment sales is $155,000,000. ***
