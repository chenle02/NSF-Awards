The project concerns two topics: the geometry and dynamics of billiard-like
dynamical systems, and the topology and geometry of Legendrian knots and curves
in contact 3-dimensional manifolds. The former includes the study of the
classical Birkhoff billiards, dual (or outer) billiards, and projective
billiards. The techniques include symplectic topology, KAM theory, Aubry-Mather
theory, integral geometry, and symbolic dynamics. The latter includes
applications of "quantum" topology to Legendrian and transverse knots and links,
study of the recently introduced contact homology rings and their applications,
and applications of Sturm theory and the theory of generating functions to the
global geometry of Legendrian curves. The motivation for the study of billiards
is two-fold. First of all, mathematical billiards are intimately related to
geometrical optics, and progress in the study of billiards may have practical
applications in optics. Secondly, billiards provide a very good model in the
theory of dynamical systems, and many developments in various areas of dynamical
systems have been stimulated by problems from the theory of mathematical
billiards. The theory of Legendrian curves belongs to the intersection of two
very active research areas: symplectic topology and knot theory. Both have deep
connections with theoretical physics: the former, with classical mechanics; the
latter, with quantum physics. The Legendrian knot theory provides a good testing
ground for symplectic topology and knot theory, and progress in the former will
stimulate new developments in these fundamental theories.
