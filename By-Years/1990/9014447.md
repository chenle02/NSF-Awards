In response to a request from the Director of the Office of Science and
Technology Policy (OSTP), the National Research Council (NRC) will conduct a
review of the research plan for the U.S. Global Change Research Program
(USGCRP), including an assessment of a number of scientific issues relating to
the role of the NASA Earth Observing System (EOS) in the USGCRP. The review will
be conducted under the aegis of the NRC's Committee on Global Change (CGC), with
the assistance of several other NRC units concerned with earth, life, and space
sciences. The review will use two closely coordinated panels of the CGC. One
will review the USGCRP as a whole, and the second will address specific issues
singled out in the OSTP request relating to EOS in the context of the USGCRP.
Preliminary results of the review will be transmitted to OSTP by April 1, 1990,
and the final report will be transmitted by July 1, 1990.
