This workshop addresses the critical long-term issue of educational
competitiveness in engineering and science. It brings together nationally
recognized leaders from the educational community and industry to craft an on-
going regional program for solving critical issues of technological literacy.
The forum will also create a program to attract more students to careers in
engineering and manufacturing. The activity will be held in conjunction with the
national conference of the Institute of Industrial Engineers and includes
participation from the Society of Manufacturing Engineers as well as other
professional engineering organizations.
