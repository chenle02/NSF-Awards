This project will investigate the calibration and verification methods used for
flood forecasting models, with particular concern to the hydrologic models
currently in use for planning, design, and operation of engineering systems to
cope with extreme material events. Since the success of any calibration
procedures is dependent on the quantity and quality of available and used data,
the selection of the "most informative" data sets is of great importance,
especially because, to date, existing calibration and verification approaches do
not exploit the full potential of the information contained in the available
data. A method and guidelines for appropriately evaluating the type and quantity
of data used in flood forecasting models will be developed.
