The study will model the anomalously high fluid flow in the Cascadia
accretionary wedge. A coupled, time-dependent, non-linear and finite 2D model
will be enhanced by adding additional parameters, such as methane generation
from solid organic matter and mineral dissolution and precipitation. Ocean
Drilling hole planned in this area will provide empirical constraints for the
model.
