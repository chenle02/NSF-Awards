9412159 IVES Although diseases are common in many natural animal populations, it
is very difficult to document their effects on population abundances because
their effects are often subtle and they often act in concert with other
processes controlling population densities. This study will investigate the
sublethal effects of two types of disease on populations of mountain spiny
lizards (Sceloperus jarrovii). Animals in the natural populations will be
medically treated to cure them of intestinal worm parasites, malaria, or both
with an additional group of lizards left as controls. Subsequently, their growth
rate, survival, and fecundity will be measured. Additional studies will be
conducted on the physiological performances of infected versus uninfected
lizards. Studying the effects of disease in natural populations is important,
because disease could be a major impediment to the survival of numerous
endangered species.
