One of the most formidable problems in neural development is to understand how
the regulation of the fate of the small number of cells of a developing embryo
translates in the adult nervous system to a large number and the wide diversity
of cell types. The well documented genetics and molecular biology of the fruit
fly, Drosophila melanogaster, make the fruit fly an excellent model system for
the study of the role of specific genes and their regulation of expression in
the adult animal. The runt gene has been shown to have diverse roles in the
development of the fruit fly and recently has been shown to effect specific
identifiable neurons developing from specific subsets of neuroblasts. Hybrids of
the runt gene will be used determine the role of the native gene in determining
the fate of specific neuroblast cells in early development. The structure of
nuclear regulatory protein generated by the runt gene and its hybrids will be
used to determine the structurally significant part of the protein from a
functional perspective. Information from these studies will be used to evaluate
the extent of preservation of this function in higher species and the
generalization of gene regulatory processes through the animal kingdom.
