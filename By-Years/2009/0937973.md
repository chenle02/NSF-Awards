In today's high-end computing (HEC) systems, the parallel file system (PFS) is
at the core of the storage infrastructure. PFS deployments are shared by many
users and applications, but currently there are no provisions for
differentiation of service - data access is provided in a best-effort manner. As
systems scale, this limitation can prevent applications from efficiently
utilizing the HEC resources while achieving their desired performance and it
presents a hurdle to support a large number of data-intensive applications
concurrently. This NSF HECURA project tackles the challenges in quality of
service (QoS) driven HEC storage management, aiming to support I/O bandwidth
guarantees in PFSs by addressing the following four research aspects: 1. Per-
application I/O bandwidth allocation based on PFS virtualization, where each
application gets its specific I/O bandwidth share through its dynamically
created virtual PFS. 2. PFS management services that control the lifecycle and
configuration of per-application virtual PFSs as well as support application I/O
monitoring and storage resource reservation. 3. Efficient I/O bandwidth
allocation through autonomic, fine-grained resource scheduling across
applications that incorporate coordinated scheduling and optimizations based on
profiling and prediction. 4. Scalable application checkpointing based on
performance isolation and optimization on virtual PFSs customized for
checkpointing I/Os.
