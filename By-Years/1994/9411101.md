The rpo genes encode the subunits of an eubacterial- like RNA polymerase in
plant chloroplasts. Genes which play a central role in plastid function are
normally slow to evolve but in the family Geraniaceae, however, the rpo genes
appear to be evolving at a faster rate than are the other plastid genes. In the
species Pelargonium hortorum, the rate of evolution seems to be strikingly
higher. The goal of this research is to understand the extent of constraints on
and the mechanisms responsible for the strikingly accelerated evolution of these
genes. Specifically, (1) the rpo genes from Pelargonium will be sequenced (2)
the promotor regions of other plastid genes will be examined to determine if
they have changed at a similar rate and (3) the possibility of RNA editing will
be investigated by sequencing cDNAs of the rpo genes. %%% The results of this
work will contribute to our understanding at the level of the genome of the
constraints and enhancers affecting the rate of evolutionary change.
