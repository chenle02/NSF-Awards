This project focuses on an area of research called the Arveson-Douglas
Conjecture, which belongs to the general field of operator theory. It embodies
many challenges and new, exciting mathematics. The conjecture was originally
made around 2000, and a large body of literature has been accumulated on the
subject while many unsolved problems remain. It has connections with and
applications to many other parts of mathematics; for example, it is connected to
index theory, which attracts the attention of many researchers from various
fields. Another connection is to the holomorphic extension problem in several
complex variables, another important branch of mathematical analysis. The
extension problem itself goes back to the 1970s, and recent progress on the
Arveson-Douglas Conjecture sheds new light on this old problem. An important
part of any research in mathematics is the search for new tools and methods, and
the principal investigator will take concrete steps toward that goal. On the
technical side, the Arveson-Douglas Conjecture makes strong connections with
geometry and several complex variables. The concrete steps in this research
include: the study of a recently defined property - the asymptotic stable
division property - for submodules; a generalized version of the holomorphic
extension problem; identifying index elements and index formulas on modules;
extending known results to strongly pseudoconvex domains. The research is aimed
at building machinery that allows one to treat global properties of complex
analytic sets, especially algebraic sets, through local analysis. New techniques
involving tools from operator theory, harmonic analysis, several complex
variables and topology will be developed to treat these problems. The principal
investigator will also study Toeplitz operators and Toeplitz algebra on strongly
pseudoconvex domains.
