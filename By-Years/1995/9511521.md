9511521 Smeeding The Luxembourg Income Study (LIS) database consists of
comparable microdata on the composition of households and the structure of their
cash incomes for 23 industrialized economies as of December 1994. LIS
standardizes these data and makes them available through electronic mail. These
data are used by over 300 researchers worldwide to analyze economic and social
policy and its effect on such topics as income structure, poverty and income
inequality, and wage and earnings differentials by education level and by
gender. Regular activities such as biennial meetings and summer workshops, are
combined with intermittent conferences and meetings involving the database. Over
the past seven years, the LIS project has demonstrated its feasibility and
usefulness as an internationally sponsored and researcher-lead database project.
It is unique in its approach to funding in that the majority of its support, and
all of its "core' operations, are funded by a consortium of 18 nations. Because
electronic access to LIS is, by design and intent, free once a privacy pledge is
signed, many users treat it as a "public good" which provides benefits at little
or no direct cost to them. This grant provides renewed funding for the United
States core contribution to LIS.
