This is a cooperative research project whose goals are to understand fundamental
properties of liquid crystal phase transitions and to develop techniques for
measuring thermal properties, thermal conductivity, and polarization. A special
high resolution ac calorimeter, developed by this group, will be used to measure
heat capacity and thermal conductivity in the vicinity of various multicritical
points or phase transitions. Mixtures will be used to vary temperature ranges of
certain phases to work toward better understanding of the nature of the phase
transitions as well as of the microscopic structures and to test theories.
