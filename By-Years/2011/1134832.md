Planning Grant for an I/UCRC for Macromolecular Topology

1134832 University of Cincinnati; Gregory Beaucage 1134788 University of
Michigan; Ronald Larson

The University of Cincinnati and the University of Michigan are collaborating to
establish the proposed center, with the University of Cincinnati as the lead
institution.

This is a planning grant request from the University of Cincinnati and the
University of Michigan to explore a potential I/UCRC in macromolecular topology.
Funds are requested for a two-day planning meeting with potential industrial
sponsors in Cincinnati. The proposed Center for Macromolecular Topology (CMT)
will address a need in the polymer industry to synthetically control,
characterize, model and simulate complex macromolecular architectures to
manipulate mechanical and rheological properties.

The CMT will develop human capacity in the chemical industry. The center will
significantly enhance the nations research infrastructure base, and plans to
coordinate internet based video courses on rheology, scattering, synthesis and
modeling of complex macromolecular systems that will be available to industrial
as well as academic participants and the general public on arrangement with the
Universities. CMT will actively recruit women and minority graduate and
undergraduate students. The center has as a main goal enhancement of the
intellectual capacity of the engineering workforce and capabilities in
controlling molecular topology. Improvement in the control of molecular topology
will lead directly to improvements in a wide range of consumer and industrial
products from gels to tires; from plastic packaging to viscosity enhancement in
oils.
