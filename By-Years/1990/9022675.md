This renewal proposal addresses fundamental problems of dynamics and
intermolecular interactions in condensed matter systems. The proposed study
includes the following materials areas: Glasses; high-temperature
superconductors studied with transient grating generated ultrasonic waves;
liquid crystals and complex liquids; and polymer blends - chain structure and
microphase separation.
