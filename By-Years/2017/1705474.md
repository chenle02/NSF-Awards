This award will support participation of US scientists and engineers at the
Japan-US Seminar on Two-Phase Flow Dynamics, which will be held June 22-24, 2017
at Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan. This is the 11th seminar in a
series that started in 1979. The goal of the seminar is to enhance progress in
understanding two-phase flow dynamics and to accelerate the development of
improved measurement techniques and predictive computational models. Multiphase
flows are found in many industrial processes, including boiling heat transfer in
conventional boilers and nuclear reactors, atomization of liquid fuels, flow
through porous media, filtration and separations, and certain kinds of catalytic
reactors. Multiphase flows are found in naturally-occurring processes, including
heat and mass transfer at air-ocean interfaces, cloud formation and
precipitation, sandstorms, avalanches, and coastal sediment transport.

The goals of the symposium are to disseminate recent research findings,
establish new collaborations, and improve the training of students in multiphase
flow phenomena. The meeting will consist of a series of keynote lectures and
research presentations. Sessions topics will focus on evaporating flows,
microscale two-phase flows, bubble swarms, numerical challenges, gas-liquid
interfacial dynamics, bubbly shear flows, advances in measurement techniques,
flow visualization, high-speed interfacial flows. The seminar will also include
laboratory tours and reports on two-phase flow research activities in the US,
Japan and EU. Support will be provided to emerging scientists and junior faculty
members with the goal of engaging young researchers in the science of multiphase
flows.
