9554494 Douglass This CMU project endeavors to institute a mechanism to
encourage and support the participation of girls and women in science,
engineering, and mathematics (SEM) through: raising the awareness of teachers
and parents with regard to the factors affecting the success of girls in SEM;
forming cross-age research teams of women and girls; and developing a mentoring
system from elementary school through professional employment. Mentoring Through
Cross-Age Research Teams impacts the eight extremely rural, economically
disadvantaged counties in central Michigan. Five regional education service
districts totaling 33 school districts, with participation from about 240 girls
and teachers will be directly involved in the project. Research teams are to be
formed of elementary, middle, and high school girls, college undergraduate and
graduate women, parents, teachers, and professional scientists. The teams
provide mentoring, encouragement, and academic support while working together on
a common research project. This research endeavor is augmented by academic year
and summer enrichment programs to highlight the issues surrounding the success
of girls in SEM, introduce role models, and provide information on career
opportunities. A spring "project fair" is to showcase the efforts of the
research teams, as will presentations at state conferences. The development and
distribution of an administrator's guide will facilitate replication of the
project. Presentations are to be made at teacher in-service workshops and at the
state Math/Science Center Director's meeting to encourage sponsorship by other
centers and districts. This project expects to continue as a regular event
coordinated by the Central Michigan Science/ Mathematics/Technology Center and
the regional education service districts. ***
