This research involves queueing networks with emphasis on their traffic
processes. Three topics will be investigated: queues with retrials, queues with
feedback with multiple classes of customers, and queueing departure processes
with several queueing disciplines. The work focuses on the characteristics of
the flow between nodes in a queueing network in contrast to the more common
study of the performance characteristics at the service nodes. Queueing networks
with the features being studied are found in models of computer, communications,
and manufacturing systems.
