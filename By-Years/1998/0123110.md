Piedmont Technical College's project increases enrollment, retention and
graduation rates&lt;br/&gt;in associate degree programs in computer technology,
science, engineering, and mathematics (CSEM) for&lt;br/&gt;low-income,
academically talented students, particularly those from underrepresented
populations. This&lt;br/&gt;is accomplished through the provision of targeted,
comprehensive academic support services, coupled&lt;br/&gt;with up to 30
scholarship awards per year. PTC CSEM Scholars are recruited in partnership with
school districts and community agencies, with an emphasis on populations that
are typically underrepresented in&lt;br/&gt;CSEM fields. The project also
includes the creation of a "student ambassador corps" to assist in recruitment
of high school students, targeted supplementary peer tutoring for students in
barrier courses, and peer mentoring by senior CSEM students for students
enrolled in developmental courses.&lt;br/&gt;
