This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project, supported in the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, focusses on the development of highly
selective and sensitive fiber optic biosensors that employ genetically designed
bacteria as the sensing element. During the tenure of this three-year continuing
grant, Professor Daunert and her students at the University of Kentucky will
develop recombinant bacteria that luminesce in the presence of toxic heavy
metals such as chromium, arsenic, and nickel, incorporate these bacteria as the
active elements in fiber optic sensors, and optimize the resulting devices.
Specific targets include (a) coupling the mechanism of resistance of bacteria to
chromate, arsenic, or nickel with the luciferase bioluminescence system; (b)
preparing bacterial systems that will bioluminesce in the presence of the
targeted metal; and (c) developing biosensors using these engineered bacteria
and validating their performance with real samples. Also during this grant
period, Professor Daunert will pursue an educational development plan that
includes broad involvement of undergraduates in research, increased public
appreciation of chemistry, and the attraction, mentoring, and retention of
undergraduate students from underrepresented demographic groups. The development
of more rapid and accurate techniques for monitoring low-level concentrations of
toxic chemicals is important to progress in environmental protection. By
combining the tools of modern molecular biology with fiber optic sensor
technology, this CAREER research project should lead to new highly selective and
sensitive probes for low concentrations of toxic heavy metals. The educational
aspects of this CAREER project will expand the role of research in the training
of undergraduates at the University of Kentucky and should increase the
participation of women and underrepresented minorities in science at that
institution.
