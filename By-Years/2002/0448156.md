Yingkai Zhang of New York University is supported by the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry program within the Chemistry Division in a co-funding
arrangement with the Molecular Biophysics program within Molecular and Cellular
Biosciences for research involving the development and application of novel
theoretical and computational methods to understand the inner workings of
metalloenzymes. The investigation is focusing on mononuclear non-heme iron (II)
enzymes, including peptide deformylase and alpha-ketoglutarate dioxygenases. The
theoretical approaches combine density functional theory and QM/MM methods which
allow for accurate modeling of the metal active site while properly including
the effects of the protein environment. This work is having a broad impact in
the field of biomolecular modeling and is being carried out in conjunction with
the establishment of a new computational biology graduate program at NYU.
