0333031&lt;br/&gt;Garces&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The field of infrasound studies
the generation, propagation, and measurement of atmospheric sounds that are too
bass to be perceived by human ears. Infrasonic signals may propagate for
thousands of kilometers and can be used to study large-scale geophysical
processes. Some of the more tantalizing research subjects in the field involve
passive acoustic soundings of the atmosphere, investigations on the dynamics of
volcanic eruptions, studies of earthquake ruptures, interstellar flux rate
assessments from meteor detections, and tracking of hurricanes and tornadoes.
This award will support a two-day workshop to select projects and experiments
that will best highlight the field's contributions to geophysics. Participants
will be invited to provide expertise in the fields of the earth, atmospheric,
and ocean sciences and the various technologies that may be integrated with
infrasound to produce a greater scientific impact. The outcome of the workshop
will be a report with possible proof-of-concept experiments, their cost, and a
draft management structure.&lt;br/&gt;
