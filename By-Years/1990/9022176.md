Testing for structural change and parameter instability has a long history in
econometrics and statistics. Parameters are frequently reduced forms of
unobservables, such as taste, technology and institutions. Although it may be
reasonable to believe that these unobservables have been roughly constant over
the sample period, it is rarely a priori obvious and should therefore be subject
to a specification test. Despite the long history of study of this problem, most
researchers apply simple sample split tests or forecast error tests, neither of
which are optimal. The purpose of this project is to develop a powerful test for
parameter instability calculated under the null hypothesis of constant
parameters which is easy to calculate, even in non-linear contexts. The approach
taken is to use an approximate Lagrange Multiplier test against the alternative
that the parameter is martingale. This includes simple structural breaks as well
as random walks. The asymptotic distribution is non-standard, but invariant to
nuisance parameters if the regressors are non-trended. Appropriate asymptotic
theory is developed, which makes use of some recent developments in stochastic
process theory.
