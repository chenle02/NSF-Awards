The proposer's main objective is to resolve some theoretical and computational
issues in developing innovative and efficient numerical methods for solving
constrained minimization problems that can be reformulated as unconstrained
minimization of piecewise quadratic functions. More specifically, the proposer's
objectives are the following: (i) identifying constrained minimization problems
that can be converted to the unconstrained minimization of convex piecewise
quadratic functions; (ii) designing numerical algorithms for solving the
unconstrained reformulation problem that take advantage of the structure of the
original problem; (iii) developing matrix factorization and matrix updating
techniques for solving symmetric (but possibly singular) systems of linear
equations; and (iv) establishing error bounds that are useful for convergence
analysis of numerical algorithms for solving certain minimax problems for convex
quadratic functions. The potential impact of the project is an innovation on how
quadratic programming problems should be solved in sequential quadratic
programming methods as well as in trust region methods for solving constrained
minimization problems. The theory on new merit functions will provide a
completely new perspective on how constraints should be handled in solving
constrained minimization problems. The new penalty function theory also serves
as a theoretical basis for developing new methods for solving constrained
minimization problems. New techniques for finding a descent Newton direction
when the Hessian of an objective function is only positive semidefinite will
significantly advance the theory on Newton methods and allow people to use
Newton methods to find a minimizer of a convex piecewise quadratic function in
finitely many iterations, even though the set of all minimizers might be
unbounded. New error bounds will provide new ways to establish convergence
results for some numerical algorithms.

Quadratic programming is the key for solving constrained minimization problems
that have significant applications in many areas such as bio-engineering,
chemical engineering, aircraft design, etc. For example, a faster and more
accurate way of solving certain constrained minimization problems means a
shorter and more efficient design cycle in developing new aircraft for Boeing.
This project aims at using an innovative approach for solving large-scale
quadratic programming problems that can be used to obtain accurate solutions of
constrained minimization problems efficiently. This will lead to better software
tools for solving many engineering application problems.
