Professor Silva will study nonsingular joinings in ergodic theory. Nonsingular
joinings, a concept introduced by D. Rudolph and studied previously by Silva and
Rudolph, will play a pivotal role in Silva's study of nonsingular infinite
measure- preserving transformations. This project involves research in ergodic
theory. Ergodic theory in general concerns understanding the average behavior of
systems whose dynamics is too complicated or chaotic to be followed in
microscopic detail. Usually ergodic theory involves a dynamics which preserves a
natural probability measure. Professor Silva's research concerns systems where
this nice property fails to hold.
