The Department of Mathematics at the University of Michigan will receive half-
time support over a two-year period for a systems administrator for a network of
computer workstations (Sun's, SPARC's, Mac's, PC's tied (via ethernet) to
Servers) increasingly used by members of the department in their research
programs. Some of the research areas that will exploit the computational
environment are: Computational Vortex Dynamics Hyperbolic Conservation Laws and
Multigrid Methods Queuring Theory Non-Linear Schrodinger Equations Combinatorics
Modular Representation Theory ***//
