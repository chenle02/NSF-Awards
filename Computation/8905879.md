This research is concerned with conservation laws arising in continuum physics
and transport processes modelled by discrete velocity models of the Boltzmann
equation. The emphasis will be both on the analysis and on the development of
effective computational algorithms for the modelling of hypersonic heat transfer
with phase change problems.
