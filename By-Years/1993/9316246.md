9316246 James This research planning grant will support the collection of data
and the development of molecular techniques necessary to assess patterns of
genetic variation in howler monkeys. This will include studying variation in
mitochondrial DNA as well as single copy nuclear DNA and a variable number of
tandem repeat loci from a number of black howler monkeys from 16 troops in
Belize and 15 individuals from3 troops in Vera Cruz, Mexico. Comparisons of all
three molecular data sets will allow separate analyses of maternal and paternal
inter-troop gene flow as well as within troop familial relationships. With the
inclusion of sequences from wooly and spider monkeys, a comprehensive phylogeny
of the genus Alouatta and its relationship to other New World monkeys will be
achieved. ***
