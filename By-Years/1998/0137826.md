The Education Development Center is continuing the work of the K-12 Mathematics
Curriculum Center. The Center continues to offer seminars designed to build
capacity in the field. In particular, this work will assist mathematics
coordinators, lead teachers and staff developers design professional development
programs that support teachers using Standards-based materials; help districts
consider the alignment between their new curriculum, classroom assessment and
high-stakes tests; and help school districts develop plans for collecting and
analyzing data and reporting results in order to evaluate the impact of their
curriculum implementation. The Center will draw upon its experience with
delivering seminars to districts in the past to develop on-line courses as a way
of extending the services of the center to a wider audience. Another strong
focus of the Center is to support the work of other mathematics implementation
projects by developing materials and other products of use to these projects, by
studying successful approaches and barriers to implementation and by
facilitating communications among these projects
