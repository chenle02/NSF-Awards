9712851 Bardet This action is to provide support for participation by three
researchers from the United States in the Second US-Japan Workshop for
Collaborative Research on Mitigation of Urban Earthquake Disasters, Tokoyo,
Japan, February 27 thru March 1, 1997. The objective is for these three
researchers to present the fields of geotechnical earthquake engineering and
engineering seismology, and to present the conclusions and recommendations of
the North-America Workshop on the Geotechnical Aspects of the Kobe, Loma Prieta,
and Northridge Earthquakes, held in Osaka, Japan, January 22-24, 1996. These
three representatives, in collaboration with the US and Japanese participants,
are to identify the main research opportunities, and to help formulate plans for
US-Japan collaborative research on mitigation of urban earthquake disasters. ***
