9355643 Pirkle Consistent with the Louisiana Curriculum Frameworks the goal of
the project is to increase the teaching of activity-based, issues- oriented
technologically integrated physical science at the middle school level (grades
7-9). The project will extend over 4 years. Two cohorts of teachers from 30
schools will be paired in teams (60 teachers) which will be provided with a two
year sequence of summer courses (5 weeks study of chemistry and physical
science), academic year site visits and workshops (5 for each of two years). The
summer courses will be a sequence of two specially designed chemistry and
physical science courses with the content appropriate to the middle school
level. Alternative assessment strategies will be incorporated. Computers and
graphing calculators will be integrated into the analysis of experimental data.
Local environmental issues will be integrated into the curriculum. Funds of
$1,483,379 are requested with cost share $204,722 (14%).
