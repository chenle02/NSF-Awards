The data revolution is dramatically accelerating the acquisition rate of new
information, creating a vast amount of data. Artificial intelligence (AI) has
emerged as a solution for rapid processing of complex datasets. New hardware
such as graphics processing units (GPUs) and field-programmable gate arrays
(FPGAs) allow AI algorithms to be greatly accelerated. To take full advantage of
fast AI, the Institute of Accelerated AI Algorithms for Data-Driven Discovery
(A3D3) targets fundamental problems in three fields of science: high energy
physics, multi-messenger astrophysics, and systems neuroscience. A3D3 works
closely within these domains to develop customized AI solutions to process large
datasets in real-time, significantly enhancing their discovery potential. The
ultimate goal of A3D3 is to construct the institutional knowledge essential for
real-time applications of AI in any scientific field. Through dedicated outreach
efforts, A3D3 will empower scientists with new tools to deal with the data
deluge. Students mentored through A3D3 research will interact closely with
industry partners, creating new career opportunities and strengthening synergies
between academia and industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The approach of A3D3 is to
tightly couple AI algorithm innovations, heterogeneous computing platforms, and
science-driven application development informed through close collaboration with
domain scientists within physics, astronomy, and neuroscience. The common theme
across domains is the development of AI strategies accelerated by emerging
processor technology, employing hardware-AI co-design as a transformative
solution to a wide range of scientific challenges. Hardware architectures such
as GPUs and FPGAs have emerged as promising technologies to address many of the
challenges in data-intensive science because they provide highly-performant,
parallelizable, and configurable data processing pipeline capabilities. When
combined with AI algorithms, these architectures significantly accelerate
scientific workflows compared to CPU-only computing platforms. Building on the
existing Fast Machine Learning community, A3D3 cultivates an ecosystem where
scientists across domains collaborate to meet critical challenges, forming a
central hub of excellence for innovation in accelerated AI for science. The work
is extended to the public at large through a diverse set of educational training
programs and by mentoring next-generation scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project is part of the National Science Foundation's Big Idea activities in
Harnessing the Data Revolution (HDR) and Windows on the Universe - The Era of
Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (WoU-MMA). This award by the Office of Advanced
Cyberinfrastructure is jointly supported by the Divisions of Astronomical
Sciences and of Physics within the NSF Directorate for Mathematical and Physical
Sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
