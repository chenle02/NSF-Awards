Venerid bivalves are a family of clams found in the world's oceans and in the
fossil record. Their shells are generalized and uniform in morphology, making it
difficult to reconstruct the evolutionary relationships among subfamilies and
genera. Dr. Mary Ellen Harte proposes to learn a molecular technique called
radioimmunoassaying that measures the amount of protein divergence between
living species. Preliminary data will establish the appropriateness of this
approach for future study of bivalve molluscs at this level of the taxonomic
hierarchy. If successful, the classification based on molecular data will be
compared to that based on morphological characters. The results of this study
will have impact in three areas. Most immediately, Dr. Harte will add a new and
valuable research technique to the capabilities she already possesses. Second,
this exploratory project may illuminate the evolutionary relationships among a
diverse and long-lived group, thereby opening up interesting research projects
on their ecology, geographic distribution, and function. Finally, the genealogy
produced may reveal evolutionary affinities that do not correspond to
morphological characters, indicating that different branches of the group's
evolutionary tree have converged on similar morphologies, presumably for
functional reasons. Such a result would be of great interest to evolutionary
biologists and paleontologists.
