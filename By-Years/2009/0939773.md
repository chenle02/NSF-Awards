This collaboration between SDSM&T and the Oglala Lakota College (OLC) campuses
seeks to establish new opportunities for Native American students in South
Dakota to become involved with geoscience education through participation in the
High Plains Regional Science and Engineering Fair, which is affiliated with the
Intel International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF) and held at SDSM&T. This
planning grant project is working to achieve these objectives: 1) expose Native
American students and members of their extended families to geosciences through
preparation of science fair projects; 2) initiate mentoring experience for the
Native American students on the SDSM&T and OLC campuses in the preparation of
the science fair projects; 3) create a model for collaboration between Area
School Districts and higher education for South Dakota through the OLC/ SDSM&T
partnership that can be replicated throughout the Dakotas; 4) team faculty
members and researchers at SDSM&T with science faculty members and liaisons from
OLC to offer cross-institutional mentoring and guidance for middle/high school
students; 5) encourage faculty members and researchers to take Lakota culture
and language classes at the Rapid City Native culture classes to enhance their
understanding of cultural differences; and 6) raise awareness and improve access
for Native Americans to geoscience education. The planning grant proposal is
focused on establishing the collaborations between SDSM&T, OLC, and the Area
School Districts of Rapid City, Black Hills and Pine Ridge Reservation and
addressing the very small participation of Native American students in this
region in science fair opportunities.
