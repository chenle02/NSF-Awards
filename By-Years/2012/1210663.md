Flatfishes (Pleuronectiformes), the commercially important soles, flounders, and
halibuts, exhibit one of the most remarkable vertebrate metamorphoses, where one
eye of a bilaterally (left-right) symmetrical larva migrates to the opposite
side of the head, resulting in highly asymmetrical juvenile and adult forms.
Despite the complexity and uniqueness of this transformation, virtually nothing
is known about its evolutionary origin or the mechanism behind the change.
Flatfishes are the only vertebrates to deviate so dramatically from a
bilaterally symmetrical body plan, making them an ideal group to conduct the
first comparative studies of regulatory genes and anatomical structures
associated with this body asymmetry. Through analyses of DNA sequence data and
MRI images we aim to resolve the evolutionary relationships of flatfishes,
examine the evolution of developmental regulatory genes involved in left-right
axis formation and assess the origins of structures in the head hypothesized to
be unique to flatfishes and to have evolved as adaptations to a life on the sea
floor. Examination of anatomical structures associated with vertebrate asymmetry
and of the molecular mechanisms generating this bizarre anatomy will provide for
a novel interpretation of the evolution of bilateral asymmetry.
