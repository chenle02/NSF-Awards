PI: Bush Institution: Marshall University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Chemistry
Division award supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at
Marshall University for the summers of 2003-2005. Seth Bush is the site's
program director. Eleven faculty from the chemistry departments at Marshall
University and West Virginia State College will serve as student mentors to 8
students each summer for ten weeks. Students will be recruited from the
Appalachian geographic area and from a larger national pool in roughly equal
numbers. Research projects are offered in the area of chemistry having a
biochemical orientation. Participants will develop a broad range of practical
scientific laboratory skills such as synthesis, instrumental analysis and
computation. Students will prepare a proposal, an oral progress report and a
final poster session. The research experience will be evaluated by exit
interviews and long term tracking of participants. &lt;br/&gt;
