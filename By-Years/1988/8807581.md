This is a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Plant Biology to support Dr.
Conrad's research and training under the mentorship of Dr. D. Lansing Taylor.
Dr. Conrad will receive training at the cutting edge of modern cell biology
(including antibody technology, protein and fluorescent-probe chemistry,
microinjection, and state-of-the-art light microscopy). During this training
period, Dr. Conrad will study the dynamics of cytoskeletal elements during
fibroblast locomotion. The long-term goal is to apply these critical modern
techniques and experimental approaches to study the dynamics of cytoskeletal
elements during bud formation in the moss, Funaria. The training which Dr.
Conrad will acquire during this fellowship will allow her to localize and image
up to five different cytoskeletal protein types simultaneously, and map multiple
physiological parameters (such as proteins, pH, calcium concentration, membrane
concentration, and subcellular organelles) in the same living cell during bud
development. Although the work to be performed under Dr. Taylor's mentorship on
fibrast locomotion is, in itself, very important, the major significance of this
project lies in the long-term goals of Dr. Conrad. The transfer of these
cutting-edge technologies in cell biology to the study of plant cells is long
overdue.
