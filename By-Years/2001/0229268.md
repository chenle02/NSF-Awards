The New York Hall of Science will develop "Connections," a 3,500-sq. ft.
interactive exhibition and related learning resources that will introduce
visitors to the fundamental technology of networks. "Connections" will offer
diverse audiences opportunities to explore networks, both natural and human-
designed. The exhibition will highlight the fundamental characteristics of
networks such as their structure, function and adaptability. The project will
also produce supporting educational resources for families, after-school
programs, community groups, students and teachers. Audio-tours will be produced
for general visitors and for visitors with visual impairments. The Connections
Discovery Lab, a 750-sq. ft. enclosed space adjacent to the exhibition, will
offer scheduled workshops and drop-in programs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
