Informational suppression can be central to genetic analysis and gene
manipulation. Suppressor-tRNA mutations may be used to define selectable markers
for transformation experiments. Suppression of chloroplast gene was first
observed in Chlamydamons reinhardtii by this laboratory. The photosynthetic
mutants which were suppressed were found to be heteroplastic and it was proposed
that a balanced polymorphism of suppressor and wild type alleles of a tRNA gene
resulted in the heteroplasmicity. The hypothesized mechanism is unique and this
study continues the characterization of the system. The objectives are to
determine the nature of the tRNAs involved and determine the frequency and
diversity of heteroplastic suppression. %%% Much has been learned of the
physical structure of the chloroplast genome but little is know of the basic
genetic mechanisms utilized by this organelle. C. reinhardtii is still the only
green organisms in which routine genetic analysis of this chloroplast is
possible and the information resulting from this study could have important
economic ramifications.
