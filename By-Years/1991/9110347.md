The objective is to study how good or bad distributed simulation is for the
simulation of a few specific systems; these systems are queuing networks, timed
petri nets, and logic circuits. Regarding queuing networks and logic circuits,
the performance of three well known distributed simulation schemes will be
studied. Regarding timed petri nets, new distributed simulation algorithms will
be developed and their performance studied. This approach aims to answer several
questions that have remained unanswered previously - relationship between
overhead and performance, ideal speedups that one can expect, and relationship
between the simulator parameters (such as delays on communication lines) and
performance. The essential elements of the approach are (i) simulate the
distributed simulator instead of directly implementing it on a machine, which
makes it easy to vary parameters such as communication delays, computation times
etc. (ii) study the relationship between overhead and performance by varying
computation and communication times for overhead messages, and (iii) define and
measure certain notions of ideal speedup that are more realistic than simply the
number of processors. The immediate benefit of this research would be to provide
a better understanding of several performance issues, e.g., what is the cause of
low performance -- too many overhead messages or lack of potential parallelism
in the system? It is commonly believed that overhead is the main problem. This
is not true in many cases. In the long term this will lead to high performance
distributed simulators custom designed for specific classes of systems.
