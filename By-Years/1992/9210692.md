The goal of this research is to provide a methodology for the automatic
construction of instruction sets for specialized application domains.
Specialized, programmable computers are useful in situations where a general
purpose computer may be too slow or expensive for the application. This research
augments current high-level synthesis tools which derive a computer
implementation when given an algorithm or instruction set as input. The proposed
technique takes benchmarks and a description of the computer data path as input
and produces as output the instruction set that best uses the data path to run
the benchmarks. Topics of research include reducing the dependency of the
results on the compiler used, determining an adequate number of benchmarks
needed to produce an instruction set well-matched to the application domain, and
investigating alternative methods of instruction set derivation. The proposed
tool, when coupled with current high- level synthesis systems, can provide a
complete design system for quickly mapping a specialized problem domain into a
high performance processor. This allows the realization of computation
accelerators for a broad class of disciplines, including real time event
processing, digital signal processing, and computational chemistry, physics, and
biology.
