9530417 Kaufman This grant provides $65,000 as partial support of the costs of
acquiring equipment and salary support for developing an automated high
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) technique for measuring rates of amino
acid racemization in fossil organic matter in order to improve upon the existing
techniques of both ion-exchange liquid chromatography (LC) and gas
chromatography (GC). This method should provide a useful Quaternary
chronostratigraphic and paleothermometric tool, offering the ability to measure
several amino acid pairs which racemize at different rates thus allowing more
precise dating over wider range of ages than with existing LC and/or GC methods.
Once calibrated, the improved technique will lead to long-term benefit for
Quaternary scientists engaged in geological, climatological, archeological, and
geochronological research. ***
