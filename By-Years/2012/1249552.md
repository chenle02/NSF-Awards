Heatflow measurements using a 3.5 m probe will be added to a scheduled
experiment "Thermal structure of the cascadia subduction zone on the WA margin
(PIs Johnson &amp; Solomon, OCE-1144164). The probe temperature and thermal
conductivity measurements will enhance the ~1 m depth heatflow determinations
the main experiment will obtain. Improved assessment of possible bottom water
temperature variation will be documented by deviations from linearity in the
uppermost thermal gradient measured by the probe. One day of shiptime to conduct
heat probe work is confirmed, a second day is requested if ship schedule allows.
Postcruise numerical modeling of these data aims to constrain temperature
structure extending down to the subducting plate interface, which is related to
deep seismicity patterns.
