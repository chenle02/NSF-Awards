Planning Grant: I/UCRC for Excellence in Logistics and Distribution

1238341 Texas A&M; Brett Peters

Texas A&M University is proposing to join the existing I/UCRC for Excellence in
Logistics and Distribution (CELDi) as a new university research site.

Texas A&M University is a unique fit for helping CELDi achieve its strategic
goals in both logistics and distribution. Based upon its research strengths and
its geographic position, Texas A&M is well suited to lead efforts related to
energy and to international logistics. In energy, excellent possibilities exist
in both traditional oil-and-gas, where nearby Houston is the energy capital of
the world, and in alternative energy, where Texas presents significant
opportunities in bio-fuels, wind, and solar. In international logistics, the
proposed site's research background and geographic position allow it to exploit
the trend of companies reevaluating their global operations, particularly
considering moves to North, Central, and South America based on compelling
economic advantages including in terms of transportation savings. The faculty
researchers at Texas A&M have a long history of generating quality scholarship,
and they are committed to continue to make fundamental advances in knowledge as
well as solve important problems faced by industry.

By establishing focused efforts related to energy and international logistics,
the proposed site will establish unique niches for CELDi in areas of significant
future importance. The Center will also involve a large number of students, both
graduate and undergraduate, exposing them to both the critical challenges faced
by industry and the latest research methods and results. Texas A&M has a diverse
student body and a successful track record of involving a diverse set of
students in research. The PI intends to have its member companies implement
research results from Center activities to create new strategies and operational
procedures.
