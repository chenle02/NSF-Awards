This research project in Harmonic Analysis is concerned with boundedness
properties of oscillatory integral operators in Lebesgue spaces as well as
analogous problems in a discrete setting, i.e. exponential sum operators
corresponding to classical Gaussian sums over finite fields. Bounds on these
types of operators are fundamental in understanding summation of n-dimensional
Fourier series, Fourier multipliers, regularity properties of solutions of
partial differential equation and problems in integral geometry. Related to
these problems are questions concerning compression phenomena of families of
linear subspaces (Kakeya sets) and associated maximal function inequalities. The
discrete case serves here as a model to develop combinatorial tools to get a
better understanding in the Euclidean setting.

The proposed project focuses on questions arising from the problem of
approximating a given signal by a superposition of pure tones.Depending on the
approximation method employed one is lead to analyse various oscillatory
integral operators. These operators arise also as solutions of fundamental
equations in mathematical physics such as e.g. the wave equation and the KdV
equation. Regularity and existence problems of this equations are intimately
related to sharp bounds on the corresponding oscillatory integral operators.
