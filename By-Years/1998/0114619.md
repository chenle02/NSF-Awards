0114619&lt;br/&gt;Lo&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a preceding project supported by
NSF, mathematical justification and numerical feasibility of neural networks
(NNs) with long- and short-term memories (LASTMs) and risk-sensitive NNs have
been established for adaptive and robust identification of dynamic systems
respectively. Equally important, an adaptive method of training NNs that has the
ability to select a training criterion most suitable for the training data and
to avoid poor local minima of the selected training criterion has been
discovered. The objective of the new project is to further develop these ideas
and methodologies, conduct thorough benchmarking studies, and develop more
powerful algorithms in order to complete establishing this neurocomputing
approach to robust and/or adaptive identification of dynamic
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Among the key tasks are: (1) development of an
online recursive algorithm for adjusting linear weights of an NN with LASTMs in
the presence of multicollinearity, using possibly a combination of the Kalman
filter and ridge regression; (2) comparison of adaptive risk-seeking training
method against existing methods using robust estimation criteria from
statistics; (3) development of an algorithm using risk-seeking and risk-averting
criteria alternately in identifying a dynamic system with a fine feature or an
under-represented segment in the presence of outlying measurement noises; (4)
development of a theory of the convergence properties of the adaptive risk-
averting training method conceived in the preceding project; (5) combination of
the above adaptive and robust system identification ideas for identification of
a dynamic system in an uncertain environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
