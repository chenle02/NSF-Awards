This project exposes Civil Engineering students to a comprehensive geotechnic
engineering laboratory that integrates computers into laboratory experiments.
The computer integration involves real-time data acquisition from and control of
a collection of instruments. The lab equipment includes: pressure permeater,
temperature controlled freezing and thawing chamber, extensometer, cyclic
triaxial cell, interfaced microcomputer and various sensors and transducers.
This lab not only enhances existing experiments in geotechnic engineering but
also permits students to carry on studies in new areas such as: examining the
migration of pollutants through soils and performing 3-D testing of soils. This
award is being matched by an equal sum from the grantee.
