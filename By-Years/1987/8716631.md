Considerable research effort in the past few years has clarified substantially
the understanding of magnetospheric plasma physics. These advances to be made
through combined efforts of three research approaches: in situ observations,
theoretical/computational efforts, and laboratory simulations of relevant plasma
physics. The work at the University of California at Irvine centers on
laboratory simulations; the Irvine effort centers on their ability to study
plasmas and their ion distribution functions with excellent temporal and spatial
resolution, thereby allowing careful study of ion responses to static and radio
frequency wave fields which are under the experimenter's control. This grant
will continue a laboratory study of mechanisms which could contribute to the
formation of the magnetospheric plasma, radio frequency heating mechanisms which
could create ion conic distributions in the polar magnetosphere, combined radio
frequency and quasi-static field mechanisms, and charged particle beam formation
which could lead to ion conics. Overall, the aim is to study processes by which
the ionosphere can supply plasma to the magnetosphere. It is now believed that
the ionosphere is a major contributor to the magnetosphere.
