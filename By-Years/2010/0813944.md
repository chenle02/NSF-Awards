CBET-0813944&lt;br/&gt;Prakash&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This exploratory work seeks
to develop a new micro-nano hybrid tool for in-situ monitoring,
characterization, and control of nanofluidic transport phenomena for
applications in water purification, proteomics, molecular sensing, and on-chip
separations. This microfabricated multi-layer tool with integrated working,
counter, and reference electrodes will measure the impedance to transport of
various species across nanoscale fluidic components like nanopores,
nanochannels, and nanocapillaries. These measurements based on the principles of
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) will illuminate the physics of
transport within confined nanoscale geometries. Electrochemists and biologists
have used impedance methods to study reaction kinetics and cell transport.
However, this exploratory work is one of the first attempts to use these methods
for evaluating transport across nanofluidic components leading to inherent
complexity and risk in the research. If successful, it is expected that this
exploratory work will lead to the development of a new microscale system for
probing, characterizing, and eventually controlling nanoscale transport that
will significantly enhance fundamental understanding of nanofluidics by
describing in detail the role of surface charge, analyte type, electrolyte
properties, surface conduction, and wall-species interactions. Developing a tool
to probe nanoscale transport phenomena will open new avenues for answering
fundamental questions about nanoscale transport phenomena. Quantitative
information about the multitude of parameters like surface charge, surface
conduction, electrolyte properties, and analyte type will lay the foundation for
significant advances in the nascent field of nanofluidics. These applications
are expected to provide revolutionary advances in proteomics and genomics, water
purification, and chemical and biological sensors with important implications
towards public health and welfare. An essential component of this research
program will be to develop a new course in micro- and nanosystems with a focus
on micro- and nanofluidics. This cross-disciplinary course taught through
mechanical engineering will train future generation of scientists and engineers
for continued impact in the growing field of micro- and nanofluidics.
