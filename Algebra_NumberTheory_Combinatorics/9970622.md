The investigator works in three areas of Combinatorics: Probabilistic Methods,
Extremal Combinatorics, and Ramsey Theory. Using the methodology of the
probabilistic method, as started by Paul Erdos, the existence of a combinatorial
object is shown by exhibiting a suitable probabilistic space in which the
desired object has a positive probability. One of the goals is to find efficient
methods for studying probabilistic spaces arising from combinatorial problems.
The first part of this project concentrates on two lines of research: on a
detailed description of the threshold phenomena mainly in the framework of the
first order logics and on research in the area of 0-1 laws for logics with
richer signatures. Due to the methods used this area lies on the border between
probabilistic methods and finite model theory. The investigator's focus in
extremal combinatorics and ramsey theory is on studying set systems with
forbidden configurations. This is, very often, closely connected with the
research in probabilistic methods. An example of problems in this area, which
connect extremal combinatorics, ramsey theory, as well as information theory,
are problems on delta-systems and on Shannon capacities of graphs.

The investigator works in the area of Combinatorics. One part of this project
concentrates on studying random combinatorial structures. This is motivated by
problems coming from the area of random algorithms as well as from the area
studying random models in statistical mechanics. As an example, the investigator
studies emergence of certain properties in random structures, so called
threshold phenomena. The research involves developing efficient methods for
studying probabilistic spaces arising in these problems as well as studying
logics which describe the properties of interest. The investigator's focus in
extremal combinatorics and ramsey theory is on studying set systems with
forbidden configurations. Equivalently, the problems studied by the investigator
deal with appearance of certain patterns in set systems. An example of problems
in this area are problems on delta-systems and on Shannon capacities of graphs.
These problems are connected to problems in information theory and transmission
of information.
