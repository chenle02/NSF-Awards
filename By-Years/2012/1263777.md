The goal of this CNIC proposal is to catalyze an international collaboration
between the University of Southern California (USA) and KIST (Korea). The focus
of the research effort is to develop an integrated optical switch and a pulsed
laser based on a graphene coated silica micro-toroid resonant cavity. As a
result of the extremely high non-linear coefficient of graphene and the long
photon lifetime within the optical cavity, femtosecond laser pulses will be
generated. This behavior can be used as an ultra-fast optical switch, among
other applications. During the course of the program, graphene layers will be
conformally deposited on silica toroidal microcavities as well as optical
fibers. Subsequently, light will be coupled into the graphene-silica fiber and
cavity, and the high frequency pulse behavior will be studied and
characterized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultrafast optical switches have numerous
applications, most notably increasing the data transfer rate of optical
networks. As such, the development of an optical switch with improved
performance (speed, lifetime or power consumption) will greatly impact society.
The proposal will enable a graduate student to spend time abroad in the
collaborator's research group in Korea, immersed in their lab. The outreach
effort supported by this CNIC proposal includes recruiting undergraduate
students to participate in year-long research projects, and incorporating
research experience in an undergraduate course. This CNIC award is funded by the
International Science and Engineering section (OIIA/ISE) with co-funding from
the Electrical, Communications and Cyber Systems division of Engineering
(ENG/ECCS).
