This award provides one-half of the funds required for the purchase of an
automated single-crystal X-ray diffraction system that will be installed and
operated in the Department of Geological Sciences at the University of Michigan.
The University of Michigan is committed to providing the remaining funds needed
for this equipment. The new diffraction system will replace one whose main
components are over 20 years old and incapable of research applications. It will
be applied for crystal structure analysis in research programs of the geological
sciences and chemistry departments at Michigan.
