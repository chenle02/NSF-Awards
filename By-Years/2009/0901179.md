This award will provide support to defray expenses of researchers participating
at the Conference on Spectral Theory and Geometric Analysis that will take place
in August, 2009 at the Northeastern University, Boston, MA. Support will be
provided to participants who do not currently hold NSF awards, with exceptions
made for plenary speakers. It is understood that much of the funding will be
directed to graduate students, postdocs, and junior faculty but that certain
senior participants will be funded as well.

The program will feature about thirty invited speakers, who will deliver one-
hour lectures, and a number of contributed talks. The principal objective of
this conference is to provide a forum for the dissemination of recent results
and for discussing outstanding problems in spectral theory and geometric
analysis, so as to maintain the vitality of the field. Another, equally
important, objective towards this end is to involve young mathematicians, female
mathematicians, and mathematicians from other under-represented groups. Several
graduate students will participate at the meeting.
