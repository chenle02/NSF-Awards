We develop and evaluate five innovative, engaging, technology-enhanced, inquiry-
based activity modules that serve as teaching resources for undergraduate and
graduate courses in elementary education. The modules use computer-based
technologies to present relevant science content in an engaging manner and to
provide digital video clips on activity presentation from a "virtual mentor."
The modules also take the unpredictability out of inquiry teaching by enabling
teachers to observe the activity in action with elementary students and prepare
teachers for common student responses and questions. These modules integrate
into existing undergraduate and graduate courses and are evaluated by pre-
service and in-service teachers and elementary education specialists.
