This grant provides fund for the U.S. portion of a collaboration between Johns
Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL), British Antarctic
Survey (BAS) and the South African National Antarctic Programme to build and
operate an over-the- horizon high frequency (HF) auroral radar at the new South
African station, Sanae. The project is known as the Southern Hemisphere Auroral
Radar Experiment (SHARE). SHARE is essentially identical with the existing Polar
Anglo-American Conjugate Experiment (PACE) radar at the BAS station at Halley
Bay, Antarctica. When operated together, SHARE and PACE will provide 2-D mapping
of plasma flow within their very large overlapping fields of view. Fortunately,
they overlap above the U.S. South Pole station as well as much of the area to be
instrumented with the new Automatic Geophysical Observatories (AGO's) and,
therefore, can provide valuable additional information on the large-scale plasma
flows above the observatories. These radars will also complement similar
facilities in the Northern Hemisphere and will help to show how the aurora are
sometimes the same and sometimes different in these magnetically connected
regions. JHU/APL is the world leader in over-the-horizon HF auroral radar.
