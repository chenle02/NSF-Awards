This Small Business Innovation Research SBIR) Phase II project will develop a
novel spray coating methodology for low-cost coating of solution-derived
ceramic, lithium-ion conductive (IC) thin films for application in architectural
electrochromic (EC) windows. Spray coating is potentially a low-cost, high-
volume, in-line route for difficult-to-process, multi-component oxide IC layers.
Phase II research will address scale-up issues for design of a full scale
prototype in-line coating system. An objective is to demonstrate a functional,
aesthetically uniform 25 cm x 30 cm EC device incorporating an IC layer coated
in a manner approximating conditions of a large-area system. Electrochromic
glazings are expected to impact the architectural glass industry since building
occupants owners will be able to control the shading of their window glass
electonically. EC glazings will find application where solar control is needed
for substantial energy savings and enhanced comfort. In addition to
architectural windows, EC glazing will be suited for transportation vehicles,
large-area displays, recreational products, and consumer appliances. Beyond
application in electrochromics, this spray technology may find use in a variety
of other product technologies requiring multi-component thin films such as
rechargeable lithium batteries, electro-optical thin films, and specialty
optical coatings
