Multirate digital systems have important applications in communication and
signal processing including resampling, interpolation, narrow band filtering,
fax systems, subband coding, transmultiplexing, multiresolution analysis, and
waveletts. This research is developing algorithms for the systematic design of
multirate signal processing systems based on a model-matching approach where an
ideal system (model) is approximated by a practical multirate system consisting
of components such as digital filters, modulators, and upsamplers/downsamplers.
The problem is to choose the parameters of the practical system so that the
performance of the system is as close as possible to the ideal system. The
measurement of the difference between systems used in this research is based on
the difference in outputs of the two systems for all possible inputs. System
parameters are chosen to minimize the maximum energy of the difference between
output signals for all bounded energy input signals. This error measure gives
systems where the quality of the approximation is insensitive to the particular
type of input to the system. The most significant improvements over conventional
designs are expected in complicated systems where intuitive design methods are
limited, such as in the design of cascaded multirate systems.
