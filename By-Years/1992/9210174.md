This is an award to support planning for research on factors controlling
surfactant enhanced extraction of halogenated organic substances from
groundwater aquifers. The work consists of selection of organic liquids and
surfactants to be evaluated, determination of solubilities and interfacial
tensions of the liquids in aqueous solutions and preliminary determination of
the effectiveness of the sufactants for removal of the organic contaminants from
simulated aquifers. The proposal leading to this review was submitted in
response to NSF 90-121, Research Planning Grants and Career Advancement Awards
for Women Scientists and Engineers. It addresses the conduct of a research
planning grant in response to the effort NSF is making to assist in increasing
the number of new women investigators participating in NSF's supported research
programs and to facilitate conduct of preliminary studies and other activities
that are likely to result in the development of competitive research projects by
women who have not previously had independent Federal research funding.
