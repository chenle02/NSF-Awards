This proposal requests funds to permit Dr. Patrick S. Mariano, Department of
Chemistry, University of Maryland, to pursue with Dr. Ung Chan Yoon, Department
of Chemistry, Pusan National University, for a period of 24 months, a program of
cooperative research on electron transfer-induced photochemical reactions of
organic systems. Specifically, sequential electron transfer-electrofugal group
elimination sequences, promoted by excitation of reacting substrates or electron
transfer photosensitizers, will be employed as general methods for generation of
heteroatom substituted carbon radicals. The mechanistic details and synthetic
applications of these processes will be probed. This project is a continuation
of the cooperative research of the two investigators supported under NSF Grant
No. INT-8717920, and adds an international cooperative dimension to Dr.
Mariano's current research under NSF Grant No. CHE-8917725. Their previous
collaborative research has been highly successful and has resulted in several
joint publications in refereed journals. This successful collaboration has
generated ideas which serve as the basis for continuing joint research. The
studies planned for the period of continued collaboration should provide
knowledge about various aspects of the new area of electron transfer
photochemistry (photoelectrochemistry) and about new and potentially efficient
methods for construction of complex molecular structures. This project is
relevant to the objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program which
seeks to increase the level of cooperation between U.S. and Korean scientists
and engineers through the exchange of scientific information, ideas, skills, and
techniques and through collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.
