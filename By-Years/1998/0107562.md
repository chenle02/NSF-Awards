This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
Informatics for FY2001. The fellowship supports research and training at the
postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational,
computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the
fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a
career in biological informatics in which research and education will be
integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics
at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through
these fellowships will play important roles in training of the future workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Development of
alternative clustering methods for genomic expression analysis and
characterization of coregulated genes in yeast." This project is developing
fuzzy k-means clustering for analysis of genomic expression data, with the goal
of identifying coregulated yeast genes that are not identified by traditional
methods. After identifying sets of coregulated genes, multiple algorithms will
be applied to identify sequence motifs that contribute to the regulation of
expression.
