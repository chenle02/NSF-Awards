9550068 Wagreich This is a proposal for a 4-year old project at $3,074,754 to:
1) establish university-school partnerships for improvement of mathematics
instruction using standards-based curricula and 2) create a set of resource
materials for others to use in similar efforts. The K-5 focused partnerships
will involve 385 teachers, each in 115 hours of staff development, over three
years. One-third of these will participate in 76 additional hours to prepare
teacher-leaders in each participating school. This project is coordinated with
Chicago USI. The project will also draft, field-test, revise, and publish a set
of resource materials for use by curriculum coordinators, teacher-leaders, and
university faculty for comprehensive teacher enhancement in elementary school
mathematics. TIMS Elementary Mathematics Curriculum, published by Kendall-Hunt,
will serve as one exemplar of a standards-based curriculum. Cost-Sharing is
reported at $1,612,066 or 52% with funds coming from pilot schools, the
publisher, and the Chicago Urban Systemic Initiative.
