9321426 Hu This project is on research to examine embryogenic development in
carrot cell suspensions. The hypothesis to be tested is that the transition from
a spherical embryoid to a polar structure is triggered by nutrient and/or
hormone gradients caused by resistance to mass transfer. The techniques used for
this investigation include algorithms for imaging, computational models, and
experimental protocols developed with a previous NSF grant. The effects of
potassium, nitrate, oxygen, glucose, and auxin on embryogenesis will be
examined. This research could have an impact on the controlled growth of somatic
embryos for large scale propagation. ***
