The research addresses a recent debate about the precise timing of the debut of
maize cultivation in the tropical lowlands of Veracruz, Mexico. The conventional
history, which asserts a date of approximately 3500 BP, is based on radiocarbon
ages of macrofossils and bulk materials. This history has been questioned
recently because of methodological uncertainties and because of contradictory
dates on domesticated squash that indicate ages of up to 9500 BP. Accelerator-
mass-spectrometer dating of pollen versus non-pollen organics contained in
sediment layers corresponding to the deepest location of maize pollen will allow
testing of two hypotheses pertaining to earliest age of maize domestication in
this region and to the viability of the proposed methodology. The broader
context for this research lies in the question of whether sedentism preceded
plant domestication in the New World (as in the Fertile Crescent) and the
implications for theories of social and ecological change. Contributions to our
understanding of the genetic origins of maize and the inter-relationships of the
surviving germ plasm are also likely.
