The research proposed is concerned with the study of the properties of materials
in the millikelvin to microkelvin regimes. They propose to continue the study of
how excitations in 3He interact with surfaces, and in particular will study the
interaction of the 3He-Silicon interface. They also plan to extend their
measurements on the suppression of the superfluid transiton of 3He to smaller
pore sizes and with a different cell design which will permit them to assay both
the suppression of the transition temperature as well as the suppression of the
superfluid fraction in the pores. Finally, experiments associated with the new
microkelvin and top loading facilities are proposed which include the study of
proximity effect induced superfluidity in a saturated mixture as well as size
and surface scattering effects on internal friction in materials.
