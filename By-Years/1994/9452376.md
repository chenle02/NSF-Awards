9452376 Ahern-Rindell Newly acquired equipment enables introduction of an
extensive laboratory component into a recently initiated upper division course
in molecular genetics. The course fits into an already established commitment to
a molecular biology program of study across the campus. The course is designed
around a critical thinking approach that utilizes cooperative group learning
techniques. The extensive laboratory component stresses student cooperation in
solving problems through creative, group designed experiments. The course
impacts zoology majors as well as students in the criminal justice,
biotechnician, and wildlife conservation programs. It provides the basis for
developing individualized undergraduate research projects, most significantly
through the thesis program in the Department of Zoology.
