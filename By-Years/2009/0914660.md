The Winston-Salem State University Geoscience Initiative (WGI) is engaging WSSU
faculty and K-12 educators in learning geospatial technology and incorporating
it into their teaching and research. The project goal is to increase the
participation of African Americans and other underrepresented students in
careers in the geosciences. The activities that will be expanded or leveraged in
this project include an Undergraduate Research Experience, a professional
development program, and an outreach program that includes formal and informal
geoscience programs at schools and public housing computer centers. The project
will integrate GIS technology into math, geosciences, physical sciences, and
general education classes at WSSU. The STEM Scholars program for high school
students at WSSU will also incorporate these topics to encourage interest in the
geosciences.
