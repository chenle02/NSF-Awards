This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).

Funds provided by this award will permit the Organization for Tropical Studies
(OTS), a 501(c) (3) consortium of universities and research institutions based
in the United States to renovate and upgrade its La Selva Biological research
facilities and laboratory infrastructure. La Selva handles approximately 33,000
to 35,000 person-days of use a year. Annually, between 270 and 300 scientists
base their research at the station, more than 100 courses structure their
offerings around stays to the station, which results in more than a 1,000
students visiting the station from the U.S. The La Selva Biological Station has
been an active, vibrant intellectual center for tropical scientists for more
than 40 years, with an impressive record of over 3,400 peer-reviewed scientific
papers. Just as new technologies in embedded sensors, hyperspectral satellite
imagining, and microbiology are coming on-line at La Selva, OTS finds itself
constrained in both the quantity and quality of laboratory space it can offer to
established senior scientists and young start-of-career researchers. The
proposed renovations of laboratory space would a) increase the number of
individual lab spaces, enabling La Selva to accommodate more researchers during
the high seasons, b) create a general use microbiology laboratory, c) reinforce
walls and provide new air conditioning units for the analytic lab and the first
floor of the laboratory building to create work spaces compatible with delicate
instrumentation, d) install fume hoods capable of safely handling innovative
microbiology experiments, e) create a generally more conducive environment for
intellectual exchange and collaboration, and f) provide a solid infrastructure
to permit the next phases of expansion and laboratory instrumentation. These
renovations would make the La Selva facilities a truly state-of-the-art tropical
research institute.
