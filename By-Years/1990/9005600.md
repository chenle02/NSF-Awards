The problem of stirring of chemical tracers in the mantle will be addressed by
developing three-dimensional computer models of flow and tracer advection. Some
comparable and complementary laboratory studies of stirring will be undertaken
in Australia. Since parallel computers hold the greatest promise of providing
the large improvements in computer performance that will be required for
detailed three-dimensional modelling, the models will developed for a parallel
computer. The Connection Machine is the favored computer.
