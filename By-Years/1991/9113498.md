This award, which is jointly sponsored by the National Science Foundation and
the Chinese Academy of Sciences, will support a cooperative research project
between Dr. Tseng-Yin Tien, Department of Materials Science and Engineering of
the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor and Dr. Yan Dongsheng, Division of
Chemistry at the Shanghai Institute of Ceramics. Silicon nitride ceramics is one
of the most promising materials for structural applications. However, it can not
be densified without the use of sintering additives. The research will include
phase equilibrium studies in silicon nitride-metal oxide systems and mechanical
property measurements of selected specimens. Samples will be prepared and then
analyzed using X-ray diffraction and an electron microscope. Results of the
research will lead to a greater understanding between composition,
microstructure and mechanical properties of silicon nitride ceramics. This
research will further result in the development of silicon nitride ceramics with
optimum mechanical properties. The Shanghai Institute of Ceramics and Professor
Yan are world famous experts on phase diagrams. Professor Tien and his Michigan
group are the pre-eminent researchers in this area in the United States. This
collaboration should produce important scientific as well as technical results.
It is likely that these researchers will continue their research exchanges even
after this award has terminated.
