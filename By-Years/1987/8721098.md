Matching funds are provided to upgrade an Alliant FX/1 computer to an FX/8 4
element parallel processing computer that will serve as a general purpose
computing facility in the Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary
Sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The computer will reside
as a computational node on a newly installed MIT campus wide Ethernet which
links all departmental computing systems and will also be connected to Harvard
University and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution via high speed data
channels. The upgraded computer will provide essential computing resources for
computer bound projects in many areas of earth sciences research, including
seismology, convection modeling of the Earth's interior, planetary science,
marine geology, and space based geodesy.
