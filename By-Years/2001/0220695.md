The faculty at Auburn has requested funds to support 30 scholarships for four
years, focusing on African Americans and women in eight engineering, departments
(including computer science), and mathematics. Eighty percent of the awards will
be for their undergraduates, the balance for graduate students. Undergraduates
and PhD-level students will receive four-year commitments; master's degree
students will receive a two-year commitment of support.
