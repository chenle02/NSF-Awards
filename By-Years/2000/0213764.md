FPC (FingerPrinted Contigs) is a software package to aid scientists in building
a physical map of a region, chromosome or whole genome. Along with many smaller
projects, it has been used for building sequence-ready maps for human, plants,
and fruit flies. A recent function has been added to evaluate and add electronic
markers to the map. A second function is the ability to do a simulated digestion
of a sequenced clone so that the theoretic fingerprint can be incorporated for
completeness. Trait data for microarray experiments is also being added. In the
current activity, a new interface will be designed to enable users to mine and
control the data. The implementation of a new algorithm for finding the minimal
tiling path for make a sequence-ready map is also planned. Since many plant
genomes will have only draft sequence, it is important to have tools that can
use this data to develop a minimal tiling path. This and the ability to assign
clones and genetic markers to a map will help to anchor contigs based on any
give framework map. The tools are available online. Students and research
professionals are responsible for the development.
