The goal of this research is to provide new knowledge on the adaptive system
control of biped locomotion by integrating innovative sensor and actuator
designs into a conceptual control system model. Preliminary research has led to
the creation of a distributed adaptive control system model in general form,
innovative initial designs for attitude and ground sensors, and a novel servo
value for hydraulic actuators. Research will focus on refinement of the control
system model, including establishment of performance characteristics for the
sensors that are usable in the control model, and refinement of the adaptive
parameter algorithms. Efforts will also be applied to improvements in the
sensors and actuators.
