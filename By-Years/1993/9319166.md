9319166 Dean This award will provide partial support for the Third Circumpolar
Symposium on Remote Sensing of Arctic Environments, to be convened in Fairbanks,
Alaska, in May 1994. The symposium will provide a forum for the presentation and
discussion of current results of original research in the remote sensing of
physical and biological phenomena and processes in the terrestrial and marine
polar regions. The first two symposia, held in 1990 and 1992, pointed out that
satellite and airborne remote sensing systems are one of the most valuable
sources of environmental data for the study of the polar regions. Since then the
successful launching of the ERS-1 and JERS-1 satellites is beginning to provide
a massive amount of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data of the polar regions
through the Alaska SAR Facility, located on the campus of the University of
Alaska, and has greatly expanded the scope of processes that can be studied
remotely. ***
