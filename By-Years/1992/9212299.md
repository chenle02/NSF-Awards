This Engineering Research Equipment Grant will provide partial funding for a
Nd:YAG laser system, the remainder being provided by the University of Alaska.
This purchase is part of a series of measures the University has undertaken
which will establish a research program in the field of lasers and nonlinear
optics at the Fairbanks campus. The University has demonstrated a strong
financial commitment to the new program through the hiring of new research
faculty, the construction of a new science facility, and the purchase of
laboratory equipment. This laser system is the last major purchase necessary for
the new nonlinear optics facility at UAF. The facility will be housed in the new
Natural Sciences building upon its completion in spring 1993. Optical tables,
electronic instrumentation and a host of optics hardware are already in place.
Present inventory includes two Argon-ion lasers, a flashlamp-pumped dye laser, a
nitrogen laser, and a nitrogen-pumped dye laser. The Nd:YAG laser will provide a
much- needed source in the multi-megawatt range that is absolutely essential if
we are to implement a research and instruction program in nonlinear optics. The
Nd:YAG laser system will be used as a coherent light source for a number of
different projects. These include development of new materials and techniques
for tunable optical parametric oscillators and harmonic generation, and optical
combustion diagnostics. In addition, the system will contribute to ongoing
projects in thin film physics and the study of airborne pollutants in the
Arctic.
