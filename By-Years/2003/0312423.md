0312423&lt;br/&gt;McDuff&lt;br/&gt;This 3-year award to University of Washington
provides support for technical services during NSF-funded programs on R/V Thomas
Thompson, a 274' general purpose research vessel, and R/V Clifford Barnes, a
66-foot coastal research vessel, both operated as part of the University-
National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. UW will provide two
shipboard technicians on each cruise of R/V Thompson to support seagoing
research projects and to maintain, calibrate and provide for qualified users
items from their pool of shared-use research instrumentation. As part of the
basic services, they will maintain and operate the multibeam sonar systems on
R/V Thompson. For R/V Barnes, a technician is available to sail if desired by
the chief scientist, though (s)he will often not sail due to space limitations;
the technician will prepare and provide the appropriate shared-use
instrumentation for use by the scientists, and provide remote support as needed
if a technician does not sail. &lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
