HRD 03-28248&lt;br/&gt;The American Physiological Society (APS) has several
initiatives that work to increase diversity among physiologists by (1)
monitoring the progress of minorities in the field of physiology, (2) developing
long-term targeted programs for minority students and teachers, and (3)
developing policies and procedures that assure that non-targeted APS programs
involve diverse participants. The resulting set of programs and activities
contribute to our overall understanding of effective program models.&lt;br/&gt;
