The goal of this scholarship project is to help produce additional computer
science graduates to meet industry demands. Computer science graduates from the
college have been successful in both industry and graduate school, and the
college has a very strong relationship with the local technology-related
industry. The curriculum in computer science has been evaluated and refined
recently by both internal and external reviewers and shown to produce high
quality graduates. Students also have the opportunity to participate in a
variety of service activities, including community service. The program is
producing graduates who are making a contribution to the computing profession by
maintaining high standards and a rigorous curriculum that has evolved with the
changes in the discipline. Programs like this project are enabling the college
to further leverage the almost 20 year investment in computer science by
increasing retention and enrollment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
