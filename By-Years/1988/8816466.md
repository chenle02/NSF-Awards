As a continuing effort to develop an International Global Atmospheric Chemistry
Program, the International Association of Meteorology and Atmospheric Physics
(IAMAP) Commission on Atmospheric Chemistry and Global Pollution (CACGP) has
agreed to act as an international group of scientists to provide a forum for
discussion of the goals of an international research program and to aid in the
overall coordination for the program. The CACGP has 31 members who are actively
involved in atmospheric chemistry research. CCGP members are from Australia,
Belgium, Canada, China, DDR, France, FRG, Hungary, India, Japan, Norway, Sweden,
Switzerland, United Kingdom, USA, and USSR. The CACGP agreed to convene a second
international workshop in Melbourne, Australia in November, 1988. The objectives
of this workshop are: 1. To review research programs presently being planned by
national and multi-national groups, with the view of identifying scientific
questions where cooperative international research would be most beneficial; 2.
To discuss goals of long-term international tropospheric chemistry research,
with the identification of an international coordinating mechanism; 3. To
prepare a scientific and organizational plan for international research in
tropospheric chemistry.
