This Research Improvement in Minority Institutions (RIMI) project will focus on
the development of theory and design methodology of robust controllers for
linear systems with uncertain parameters. This is one of the crucial problems in
control theory today. Studies for this work will take mathematical models into
consideration as well as reasonable and expected perturbations. Some of the
parameters that will be examined in this study include time constants, time
delays, interconnection gains, loads, friction coefficients, and chemical
reaction rates. This complex investigation of robust stability and stabilization
for linear systems will measurably increase the research capability of an
institution that has a significantly large minority student population. The
principal investigators are noted experimentalists who have published widely in
refereed journals. Faculty and students working on this project will strengthen
their knowledge of time - delay systems.
