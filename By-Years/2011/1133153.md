1133153&lt;br/&gt;Buma&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) is a
promising technique that relies on pulsed optical excitation and ultrasonic
detection. Exquisite in vivo images of tissue microvasculature, including
individual capillaries, have been obtained with excellent contrast based on
optical absorption rather than reflectance. Physiological changes can alter the
wavelength dependence of optical absorption, making functional PAM (fPAM)
possible with optical excitation at multiple wavelengths. fPAM has received
considerable interest for oxygenation studies of tumor microvasculature and
monitoring brain activity in small animal models. &lt;br/&gt;A major limitation
of fPAM is imaging speed. Although single-wavelength images can be acquired
quickly, multi-wavelength images require excessively long acquisition times.
Therefore, conventional fPAM cannot produce functional images of fast dynamical
events (e.g. blood oxygenation in a developing embryonic heart). The slow
wavelength tuning of conventional pulsed lasers makes it impossible to obtain
video-rate fPAM images. Promising preliminary studies suggest that high speed
fPAM is possible with a multicolor optical source based on stimulated Raman
scattering. The fundamental hypothesis of this proposal is that wavelength
agility can revolutionize the capabilities of fPAM. The PIs propose to develop
this compact source to switch wavelengths in less than 1 millisecond,
representing a 1000-fold improvement in switching speed over conventional
lasers. This wavelength agile source provides the breakthrough necessary to
realize video-rate fPAM. They further propose to combine our high speed fPAM
system with their existing optical coherence tomography (OCT) system. This
combined system will provide high resolution structural and functional images of
both microvasculature and surrounding tissue at video frame rates.
