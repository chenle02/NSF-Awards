This project addresses three important aspects of the neotectonics of the
Himalayan foothills and adjacent plains of India-the long-term slip rate on the
plate boundary fault, the recurrence interval for great Himalayan-front
earthquakes and the amount of strain released within the Himalaya rather than
the Himalayan front. The work involves construction of balanced sections using
surface outcrops, drilling and seismic reflection profiles, mapping of
Quaternary deposits, trenching and geomorphic analysis of river profiles. This
research is in collaboration with the Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology and
the Oil and Natural Gas Commission of India. Results are a fundamental interest
and of considerable utility in assessment of potential earthquake hazards in the
Himalayan Foothills of northwest India.
