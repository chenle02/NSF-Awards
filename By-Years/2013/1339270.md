Cleveland State University (CSU) in collaboration with the University of
California San Diego (UCSD), proposes CISS -- Computing in Secondary Schools --
a CS10K project designed to provide computer science education professional
development to high school teachers throughout the state of Ohio. Through
participation in CISS, high school teachers will become fluent in computational
thinking and will develop the skills needed to teach the new AP CS Principles
course. The teachers will be supported through access to course materials,
pedagogy, mentoring, weekly telephone meetings, mid-year workshops and technical
coaches. Teachers will also have access to an online knowledge repository, CS
Learning Commons, which will be used to address challenges that arise and share
best practices. Specifically the project will (1) recruit, train, and assist 30
high school teachers in teaching CS in their classroom; (2) prepare and teach an
open online course focused on CS education, which will include both content
knowledge required to teach CS at the high school level as well as the pertinent
pedagogical techniques; (3) widen the CS teacher pipeline by offering a teacher
licensure pathway; (4) create a replicable network design model for CS teacher
training and mentoring by engaging with an online school network; and (5)
establish CS mentoring programs for high school teachers with a focus on gender
diversification and participation by minority teachers. Additional partners
include the Ohio STEM Learning Network (OSLN) and school districts
geographically dispersed throughout the state of Ohio. This project will
leverage the work already done on ComPASS CS10K award and will increase our
understanding of its scaling to a wider audience.
