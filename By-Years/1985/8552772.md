Research is conducted on the mathematical modeling of environmental quality. The
particular focus will be the application of probabilistic methods to evaluate
random processes in the environment, incorporating natural variability and
scientific uncertainty in the model analysis. Appliction of these techniques
will be made to evaluate important environmental and regulatory problems. In
each case, fundamental research will be carried out to characterize and model
the critical random processes affecting environmental systems.
