9422065 Board This award is to purchase a large, shared memory, multiprocessing
workstation with accelerated 3-D graphics which will be dedicated to support
research in computer and information science and engineering. The equipment will
be used for several research projects, all of which require expensive
computations to be performed on large data sets. The jump from two dimensional
to three dimensional modeling in many of the application areas listed below
requires a major increase in system memory and CPU power, and the 1 gigabyte
memory shared between several processors will make many 3-D simulations
possible. Visualizing the results of 3-D simulations in many scientific
disciplines, and other image processing applications, is also a major challenge,
requiring both significant CPU power and large memory; the equipment is suited
to this task as well. Five specific projects are: 1) parallel molecular dynamics
computations, with particular attention to load balancing; 2) image compression
using random neural networks; 3) parallel ocean acoustic signal processing; 4)
extension of bi-domain methods for simulation of excitations in cardiac tissue
to 3-D; and 5) visualization and analysis of large data sets from a 3-D
ultrasound machine. ***
