This project supports travel to the Shadow Program Committee (PC) meeting held
in Atlanta, for the 23rd ACM International Conference on Architectural Support
for Programming Languages and Operating Systems. ASPLOS will be held on March
24-28, 2018. ASPLOS is a premier forum for multidisciplinary systems research
spanning computer architecture and hardware, programming languages and
compilers, and operating systems. Papers in ASPLOS may target diverse goals such
as performance, energy and thermal efficiency, resiliency, security, and
sustainability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
