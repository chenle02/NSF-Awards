Kleiman Kovacs 9600089 This awards supports the research of Dr. S. Kovacs as a
post-doctoral associate of Professor S. Kleiman to work on problems in complex
algebraic geometry. He hopes to find a construction for the relative De Rham
complex for non-smooth morphisms. He also hopes to study log flips of complex
varieties and to try to confirm Kollar's conjecture that certain Abelian
surfaces blown-up at a single point give cones which decompose into non-trivial
finitely generated part and a non-trivial nowhere locally finitely generated
part. This research is in the field of algebraic geometry, one of the oldest
parts of modern mathematics, but one which blossomed to the point where it has,
in the past 10 years, solved problems that have stood for centuries. Originally,
it treated figures defined in the plane by the simplest of equations, namely
polynomials. Today, the field uses methods not only from algebra, but also from
analysis and topology, and conversely it is extensively used in those fields.
Moreover it has proved itself useful in fields as diverse as physics,
theoretical computer science, cryptography, coding theory and robotics.
