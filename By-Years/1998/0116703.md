This is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research to support participation in the
DYCOMS-II project scheduled for July 2001. DYCOMS (Dynamics and Chemistry of
Marine Stratocumulus) is a study of mixing processes in stratocumulus clouds in
the marine boundary layer off the coast of California. The main objective is to
obtain high-resolution aircraft data (using the NCAR C-130) on temperature,
humidity, vertical air velocity, and cloud properties, that can be used for
validating large-eddy simulations of the boundary layer. The ultimate goal is to
improve the parameterization of cloud-top mixing processes in large-scale models
of atmospheric circulation and climate. Dr. Lilly will participate in the
planning and field work of DYCOMS and use the experiments as an opportunity to
evaluate a theoretical model for entrainment mixing that he has recently
developed. This study will complement the main DYCOMS plan, which is to
reconcile the observations of turbulent mixing with large-eddy simulations.
