This project supports students at U.S. institutions to attend the 5th Networking
Networking Women (N^2Women) Workshop. This workshop will be co-located with the
ACM MobiCom 2016 conference, to be held in New York City, NY, October 2016. The
workshop will be a full-day event.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit
of this proposal resides in the contributions that the student participants will
make to (1) the N^2Women Workshop, (2) the MobiCom 2016 event (the premier
conference in the mobile networking communications field) and (3) the future
scientific progress of the student's research. Participant support funds will
allow these graduate students to attend high-caliber technical presentations, be
exposed to state-of-the-art research, and interact with leading researchers and
fellow graduate students.
