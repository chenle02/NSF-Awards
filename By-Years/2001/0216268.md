With support from theMajor Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at Simmons College will acquire a Matrix-assisted Laser
Desorption Ionization - Time of Flight (MALDI-TOF) Mass Spectrometer. This
instrument will be used in a wide variety of studies, including a) the
development and testing of organic light emitting diodes; and b) the
investigation of cell signaling proteins associated with the activation of B
lymphocytes in the humoral immune system. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Matrix-assisted
laser desorption ionization (MALDI) time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry is
the technique of choice for obtaining accurate molecular weights on molecules up
to and over 300,000 daltons, with extremely high sensitivity. Use of a MALDI-TOF
mass spectrometer has therefore become a standard technique in most DNA/protein
core facilities. The ability to obtain very accurate molecular weights of
biological molecules is fundamental to all biological and biomedical research
and essential in a modern research and training environment. Simmons College is
a member of the Colleges of the Fenway consortium of six neighboring colleges.
One of these colleges, Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences,
will also benefit from the use of the proposed instrument.
