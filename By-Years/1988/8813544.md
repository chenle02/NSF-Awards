This grant is in support of a workshop to develop a global plan for U.S. ice
core research with special emphasis on the need to retrieve glacial/interglacial
records from Antarctica and Greenland as well as more recent paleoclimatic
records from a global array of shallow and intermediate depth cores. This effort
is in response to recommendations by the National Academy of Sciences-Polar
Research Board ("Recommendations for a U.S. Ice Core Program," 1986). The
workshop is planned for June of 1988 at the University of New Hampshire and will
bring together experts in all phases of ice core research. The meeting is an
important aspect of the polar glaciological research program and will point to
new directions for future research in paleoclimatology.
