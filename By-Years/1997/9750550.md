Following a year-long, comprehensive review of the curriculum in 1993, the
Chemistry Department faculty assembled a 5-year development plan. The most
significant proposed curricular change derives from the perceived need to
develop a new approach to laboratory work for third-year chemistry majors. This
laboratory replaces traditional laboratories for our Physical, Advanced
Inorganic, and Advanced Analytical Chemistry courses and uses an
interdisciplinary, integrative approach to scientific problem-solving. The
Unified Laboratory, to be titled Advanced Techniques in Experimental Chemistry
(ATEC) course contains truly integrated laboratories, not just a collection of
experiments from didferent subdisciplines. As the final major instrumental
acquisition for ATEC, the Department of Chemistry is purchasing a tunable laser
system and associated components for spectroscopic and kinetic measurements.
Acquisition of this highly flexible system allows faculty to give students solid
experience in the extremely important area of laser spectroscopy. *
