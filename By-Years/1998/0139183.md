This award provides funding to SUNY Binghamton for the support of a three-year,
REU Site in Electronics Packaging, under the direction of Dr. Bahgat G.
Sammakia. This ten-week summer program will involve eight students annually in
the multidisciplinary field of electronics packaging research through the
Integrated Electronics Engineering Center (IEEC). Students will have the
opportunity to interact with scientists and engineers from industry. The
research teams will include undergraduate students, faculty, graduate students,
and industrial mentors. A broad mix of students, including women and under-
represented minorities, not only from Binghamton but from other institutions as
well, will be recruited for the program. While independent research will be
stressed, students will have the opportunity to experience working in a team
environment. Oral and written communication of research results will be
required.
