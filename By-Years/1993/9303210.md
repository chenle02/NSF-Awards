Electronic upgrades will be made to a suite of shared-use ocean bottom
seismometers (OBS) that are used in long-term deployments on the sea floor.
Scripps Institution of Oceanography maintains a number of OBS instruments to
record seafloor seismic activity for periods of up to a month at high data
rates. The upgrade will allow the instruments to record data continuously for a
six-month period. This new capability will be accomplished through the addition
of a second digital audio tape recorder, rearrangement of analog circuitry, and
the addition of new batteries. Once upgraded, the instruments will be capable of
long-term deployments required for experiments such as those proposed in the
RIDGE Global Change research program.
