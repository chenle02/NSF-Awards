Washington State University continues to be a research site for the multi-
university Power Systems Engineering Research Center (PSERC) headquartered at
Cornell University. PSERC is now a consortium of 13 universities and about 40
companies and is a unique and premier resource for the country in electric power
engineering research. The intellectual merit of the activity is the development
of novel technologies to increase the reliability and efficiency of the electric
power grid of the country. The broader impact of this research is on the economy
of the nation for which a reliable, economic and secure electric power supply is
an absolute necessity.
