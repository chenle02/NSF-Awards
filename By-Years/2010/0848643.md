In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Professor Jingsong Zhang of the University of California at
Riverside will investigate the photochemistry of prototypical polyatomic free
radicals in molecular beams. High resolution high-n Rydberg atom time-of-flight
spectrometry (HRTOF) will be utilized to study spectroscopy and state-resolved
photodissociation dynamics of reactive intermediates important in combustion and
atmospheric chemistry. The systems to be studied include vinyl radical and
vinylidene, formyl radical, and HOCO radical.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
scientific issues to be examined include: (a) open-shell electronic states and
potential energy surfaces, and their nonadiabatic interactions and influences on
photodissociation dynamics; (b) detailed mechanisms involving complex nuclear
rearrangements and competitive dissociation pathways of free radicals; and (c)
free radical electronic structures, thermodynamics, and energetics. The research
will also provide high-quality benchmarks for the theoretical chemistry and
physics communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A diversified group of graduate and
undergraduate students at the University of California at Riverside will
participate in this research. They will acquire knowledge and skills through the
multi-disciplinary research activities. Faculty members and undergraduate
students from California State University and local community colleges will
participate in the research during the summer.&lt;br/&gt;
