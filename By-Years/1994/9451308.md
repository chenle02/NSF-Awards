9451308 Irvin A dedicated computer laboratory is being developed to introduce
real-world collaborative problem-solving laboratories in precalculus, calculus,
linear algebra, and differential equations courses.C The goal of the project is
to integrate five major curricular improvements throughout the college-level
math classes: To prepare students to work with the kinds of sophisticated
mathematical software they will encounter in upper-division math courses or on
the job; To incorporate real-world computer-based simulations, applications,
visualizations, and problem-solving exercises that will translate the often-
theoretical world of mathematics to practical applications that students can
identify and handle; To utilize computer-based calculation software to foster
student experimentation, manipulation, and problem-solving with mathematical
concepts and relationships; To diversify the presentation of mathematical skills
and concepts to accommodate the range in learning styles among Howard Community
College students; To assist students in developing team skills and collaborative
problem-solving techniques.
