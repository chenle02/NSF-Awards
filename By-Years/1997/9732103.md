This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in the Chemistry
Department, Kansas State University, is supported by the NSF Chemistry Division.
Dr. Pedro L. Muino is the site coordinator. In each of the next three summers,
eight students will pursue research in physical, organic, inorganic, and
analytical chemistry. Participants will be from universities other than Kansas
State, and emphasis will be placed on involving students from groups
traditionally under-represented in science. The research experience will include
participating in a seminar series that includes four lectures on the ethics of
conducting scientific research. Procedures for tracking the participants using
the Internet will be developed.
