In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry
Division, Prof. Delroy Baugh of the Chemistry Department of the University of
California at Los Angeles will conduct experiments on the state-to-state
chemical reaction dynamics of ammonia and phosphine. An electrostatic-hexapole
field will be used to prepare molecular beams of these species in single,
rotation-vibrational states that are completely specified within the limits
allowed by quantum mechanics. The state selected molecules are excited to an
unstable potential energy surface causing decay into fragments which are
subsequently analyzed to yield detailed differential cross sections for the
reaction. This resesrach is directed toward the determination of the potential
energy surface which controls an elementary chemical reaction. Molecules are
initially prepared in well defined quantum states which allow detailed tracking
of the reaction process. The experiments to be performed are the first in which
molecules other than hydrogen will be subject of investigation of complete
state-to-state reaction dynamics. The results of this work will play a
significant role in validating existing theories of chemical reactions on the
molecular level.
