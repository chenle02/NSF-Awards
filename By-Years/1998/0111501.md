The Chemistry Division will support Virginia Polytechnic Institute's proposed
expansion of the use of their Mobile Chemistry Laboratory (MCL) that had
received initial startup support from NSF and various other private, public, and
corporate funding sources. Specifically, their planned program will expand the
use of their MCL into more rural regions of southwestern Virginia and will
establish two additional weeks of teacher workshops. In addition, a kit-based
program will be developed for those schools that have adequate lab space but
limited budgets and equipment. They plan to continue to develop the curriculum
they initiated this past year. There will be increased efforts in the recruiting
of teachers from underrepresented areas.
