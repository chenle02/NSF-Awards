The interaction of single vortices and vortex arrays with leading-
edges/corners/surfaces occurs in a variety of practical applications and is
central to determining the localized structural loading and possible vibration
of the edge, noise radiation, initial conditions for transitional/turbulent
boundary layer development downstream of the edge, and drag on the surface of
the edge. The first phase of this investigation considers a row of single
vortices interacting with the leading-edge, with emphasis on the wavelength and
scale of the incident vorticity field, as an extension of preliminary studies in
the ongoing investigation. The second phase addresses vortex array-edge
interaction. These vortex arrays will be linked to generation of super- and
subharmonic frequency components of nonlinear interaction phenomena in the
upstream shear layer, both of which are central features in development of
unstable laminar and "turbulent" free shear flows of finite streamwise extent.
