Studies of aerosol scavenging and precipitation rates and efficiencies in
snowing clouds at a mountaintop site in northwestern Colorado will continue. In-
cloud measurements of aerosol particles, cloud droplets and ice particles as a
function of size, and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) spectra previously made
will be analyzed to determine the distribution of chemical species among the
three water components of a precipitating cloud: ice, water and vapor. From
these measurements, the effect of varying populations of natural and
anthropogenic aerosol particles on aerosol particle scavenging and precipitation
processes will be assessed. Variations in the cloud droplet size distribution as
a result of changes in the dominant atmospheric aerosol CCN particle source
(natural versus anthropogenic)will be related to the two primary ice particle
growth processes: accretion of droplets versus diffusion of water vapor. These
variations in the in-cloud aerosol and water mass removal mechanisms and rates
will be used to determine how changes in atmospheric aerosol concentrations
effect cloud microstructure, pollutant scavenging and snowfall rates.
