This project is mathematical research on a class of objects, known as Banach
Jordan triple systems or JB*-triples, that are Banach spaces equipped with a
compatible ternary product satisfying certain algebraic conditions. Their study
thus incorporates geometry in infinitely many dimensions, and a species of
nonassociative algebra. As the use of Jordan's name suggests, these structures
have applications in mathematical physics and the foundations of quantum
mechanics. Strictly within mathematics, many useful consequences can be
extracted once one knows that a given convex set is in fact the unit ball of a
JB*-triple. One specific objective of the research is to characterize
geometrically the Banach spaces that are duals of JB*-triples. Derivations,
bounded and unbounded, of JB*-triples will also be studied. Finally, the
manifold consequences of changing the underlying field of scalars from the
complex numbers to the real numbers will be explored.
