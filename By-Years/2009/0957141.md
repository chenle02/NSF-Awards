This award in the Chemistry of Life Processes (CLP) program, co-funded with the
Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences (MCB), supports work by Professor
Ann Valentine at Yale University to carry out fundamental studies on transferrin
proteins from the ascidian Ciona intestinalis. Transferrin proteins manage iron,
which is vital for most life forms, yet is toxic under many conditions. Iron is
particularly difficult for organisms to control in environments that contain
oxygen because it tends to form insoluble iron oxides (e.g., rust). Ascidians
sequester remarkable concentrations of metal ions from seawater, and thus may
offer valuable lessons in metal ion management. They fall on the evolutionary
boundary between invertebrates and vertebrates. Ascidians have two different
transferrin proteins, related to (but very different from) the ones found in
vertebrates, which may work together to manage iron and other metal ions. This
work will probe the structure and function of these two ascidian transferrin
proteins, as well as the interactions between them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taken
together, these studies will offer lessons about how the capacity evolved to
manage very insoluble metal ions in an aerobic environment, and will provide
clues to the trafficking of iron and other metals. This inquiry sits at the
intersection of inorganic and bioinorganic chemistry, biogeochemistry (including
trace element cycling in the environment), developmental biology, and organism
and protein evolution. Research activities will be integrated with chemistry
outreach and with the continued development of an introductory chemistry course
for freshman with less-than-average preparation who may nonetheless be
interested in university majors in the sciences and engineering.
