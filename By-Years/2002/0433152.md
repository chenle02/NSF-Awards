The need for behaviorally realistic risk analysis arises in many domains. The
project will pursue it in the context of three relatively unrelated risks: (a)
radiological emergencies, (b) adolescents' safety and violence, and (c) animal
vectors spreading disease to humans. These domains include commonly experienced
risks (e.g., waste disposal, bullying), as well as the more novel ones of
terrorism. In addition to their timeliness and public interest, these domains
have features that will force the development of a robust methodology: They can
evoke powerful emotions. They require contributions from multiple disciplines.
They raise difficult value tradeoffs. Their complexity and unfamiliarity defy
simplistic communication strategies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will
develop and apply the emerging methodology of integrated assessment to include
the social, behavioral, and economic sciences, in addressing these complex
social problems. Combining these diverse approaches, across these three
critically important risk domains, the research team will document the enhanced
version of integrated assessment, in such a way as to facilitate other
researchers applying it to other domains. The substantive findings will be
disseminated through the usual route of peer-reviewed publication and scientific
presentations, and completion of a book. However, the methodological results
must be given extra attention to ensure that they emerge in a generally
applicable format. To this end, a workshop will be held in year three, inviting
interested faculty, researchers, and advanced graduate students from fields
ranging from engineering to natural and social sciences. It will use worked
examples from the three risk domains, with the goal of enabling attendees to
start new interdisciplinary collaborations.
