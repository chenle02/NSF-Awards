0966582&lt;br/&gt;Scholl&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This NSF award by the Chemical and
Biological Separations Program supports work to advance the use of metal-organic
framework materials as the active components in membranes for large-scale
chemical separations. Membranes can play an enormous role in energy-efficient
chemical separations, but traditional polymeric membranes suffer from a trade-
off between selectivity and throughput. The premise of this proposal is that
metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have enormous promise as membranes for large-
scale separations because of their potential for rational design of micropore
size, shape, and functionality. Almost nothing is currently known about the
performance of MOFs as membranes. Equally importantly, almost nothing is known
regarding which of the thousands of MOF materials would be productive to pursue
for membrane fabrication. Preliminary modeling work by us and experiments by
others have demonstrated, however, that MOFs can be fabricated into membranes
and that the performance of these membranes can be predicted under practical
operating conditions. This field is poised for rapid growth, and our
collaborative team is well positioned to lead this area. The proposed work will
use a combination of computational modeling and experimental studies to develop
new membranes based on MOFs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will create many
noteworthy opportunities for education and training. The research efforts will
be linked with an innovative high school curriculum being developed in Gwinnett
County, GA. The highly interdisciplinary approach will create learning
opportunities for a variety of students: K-12, undergraduate, and PhD-level at
Georgia Tech, including external undergraduates from underrepresented groups
recruited through the SURE program.
