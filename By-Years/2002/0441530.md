ABSTRACT 0441530 Harrold, Mary GA Tech Res Corp

The Taulbee Survey reports disappointing statistics on the number of women and
minority com- puter science Ph.D. recipients during the 1990s. Only 15% of all
Ph.D. recipients were women, only 2% were black, and only 2% were Hispanic. In
an effort to improve the representation of women and minorities in computer
science, as the organizing committee of the 2004 ACM SIGSOFT Con- ference on the
Foundations of Software Engineering (FSE-12), we are developing a plan to help
increase the participation of faculty from institutions with a large minority
and/or female student enrollment. We will target institutions that have large
populations of women, African Americans or Hispanics. Since the conference will
take place in California, we expect to be able to attract faculty that teach
Hispanic students. Our plan is to invite faculty actively involved with the
education of women and minorities to attend FSE-12 tutorials and conference. As
part of our tutorial series, we will provide tutorials for the selected faculty
to help them in their teaching. They also will be invited to the conference to
stimlate their interests in software engineering and thus their students'
interests. To help support our effort, we request NSF funding to provide travel
and registration grants for these participants, who may not otherwise have
sufficient institutional funding to attend.
