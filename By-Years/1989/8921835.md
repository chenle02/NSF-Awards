This research is to develop and analyze efficient algorithms for a variety of
standard network flow problems. The algorithms are to be analyzed from both
empirical and theoretical points of view. Comparison measures used to evaluate
the algorithms are worst case performance, average case performance and
empirical performance based on computational experiments. Both sequential and
parallel algorithm implementation is to be investigated. One of the major tools
to be used is scaling, solving a sequence of problems that are closer and closer
to the original problem and reoptimization of the solution of the previous
problem is used to solve the next problem. Important new results to impact the
current state-of-the-art knowledge and improve the technology base in network
flow theory should prove successful in this research.
