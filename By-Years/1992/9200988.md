This program involves the design and synthesis of mixed ionic and electronic
conducting membranes that promote decomposition of nitrogen oxides in automobile
exhaust. The strategy depends on a perovskite catalyst to decompose the nitrogen
oxide and an oxide-ion "pump" to remove oxygen from the active site. The
conducting membrane and catalytic membrane may be the same or different
materials. Research objectives include optimization of the catalysts in solid-
state electrolytic cells and optimization of the components of the mixed
conducting membranes. The research clarifies the mechanism of decomposition of
nitrogen oxides at catalytic sites and the conditions required to maintain long-
term activity. Characteristics of the solid-state membrane necessary for
achieving rapid oxide-ion mediation away from the reaction site are identified;
these are optimized for operation at representative automobile exhaust
temperatures. This is an SBIR Phase II effort. It leads to a long-life, low-
cost, membrane converter for removing nitrogen oxides from automobile exhausts.
This technology is especially applicable to lean-burn engines, which are
expected to become dominant in the future because of their high fuel
efficiency.//
