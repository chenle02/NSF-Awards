This award supports graduate and undergraduate student and young faculty
participation in the International Conference "Life in the Cold 2004". The
Conference will take place 25-31 July, 2004 on a ship traveling through the
Inside Passage from Vancouver, BC to Seward, Alaska. This will be the 12th
meeting in the series of Life in the Cold conferences begun in 1959. This
international gathering of scientists will share their research and ideas on
topics related to hibernation and torpor cryobiology, thermoregulation, polar
biology, migration and other aspects of over-wintering in animals. The
conference will discuss approaches including molecular, cellular, organ, and
organismal physiology and biochemistry, functional morphology, biomechanics and
biophysics, ecology and evolutionary biology to understand physiological
processes and traits of organisms that are adapted to survive in cold
environments. The committee selecting recipients of conference support will
emphasize the participation of underrepresented minorities and women in the
workshop. Students and young faculty will have the opportunity to present their
research results to a broad audience of arctic and Antarctic scientists.
