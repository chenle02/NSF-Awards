9405072 Bungay This project is on research to develop an economic process for
the bioconversion of waste paper into acetate. This includes using a continuous
cultivation technique in which the feeding rate of the solid substrate is
regulated to match the consumption rate of a mixed anaerobic culture of
microorganisms. The objective is a high rate continuous process which does not
require a sterile environment. ***
