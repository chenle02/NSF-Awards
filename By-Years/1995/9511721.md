9511721 DeWeerth Humans and animals move around in their environments with
seeming ease. To design better robotic devices, engineers would like to capture
the design principles that animals use. This in an interdisciplinary project
between engineers, computer scientists and biologist directed at gaining a
better understanding of the ways animals control movement, by studying the
neural systems that generate swimming motion in fish and other simple animals.
This research will consist both of studying the nervous system of the particular
animals and of modeling the behaviors generated by these systems. The circuits
in the nervous systems that create the observed patterns of movement, even in
these relatively simple animals are very complex. Therefore, the research of
these investigators will focus on the design of very large-scale integrated
(VLSI) circuits that emulate the function of the biology. These complex
artificial circuits make it much easier to create neuron firing patterns in real
time that are very similar to those found in their biological counterparts. The
end goal of this research is to develop a better understanding of the biology
while learning how to better engineer systems that perform complex tasks that
can currently only be performed by humans and other animals.
