The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program is continuing support of Professor
Wittig in pioneering investigations of photoinitiated reactions within weakly-
bonded gas-phase complexes. A hydrogen atom, departing a photodissociated
molecule, reacts with the neighboring weakly-bonded molecule under initial
conditions much more precisely defined than is the case in typical
investigations of kinetic processes. Significant insight is potentially
available concerning the detailed dynamics of the reaction process. For the
light hydrogen atom momentarily trapped between the other photodissociation
fragment and an initially van der Waals-bonded partner, Wittig is searching for
possible dynamical resonances as a function of the initial photodissociation
conditions. Other work uses the velocity aligned Doppler spectroscopy technique
to characterize completely the product excitations, including correlations
between product internal states, for hydrogen atom reactions with nitrous oxide.
Extensions will also be made to allow the investigation of complexes involving
radicals weakly bonded to molecules. Structures of the various complexes are
being determined with supplementary high-resolution tunable diode laser
spectroscopy measurements.
