This award supports travel of U.S. participants in the workshop "Poly and
Polymer Electrolytes for Energy Conversion: Ab Initio, Molecular, and Continuum
Models," held at the Lorenz Center within the University of Leiden, The
Netherlands, 23-27 August 2010.

The goal of the workshop is to facilitate communication among the disparate
groups of researchers applying ab initio, molecular, and continuum approaches to
the modeling of nanostructured polymer electrolyte materials used in energy
conversion and storage devices. The meeting features invited talks by leading
researchers, as well as formal directed discussion sessions and a session of
presentations contributed by junior participants.

The workshop brings together mathematicians, computational chemists,
computational materials scientists, and experimentalists to facilitate research
progress in areas that address the pressing need for a more efficient energy
infrastructure to reduce reliance on fossil fuels. Funding is directed to ensure
broad participation by students, postdocs, junior faculty, and members of groups
underrepresented in mathematics.
