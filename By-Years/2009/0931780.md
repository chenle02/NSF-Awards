This research will examine the roles of forest structure and climate change on
snow accumulation and runoff. The research will combine field measurements with
modeling efforts to quantify the relative importance of forest structure and
climate change. Three major questions will be addressed: (1) What is the
variability of snow interception and melt in different forest structures and
classes? (2) Over multiple decades, which forest changes are of comparable
magnitude to climate change in their effects on snow water storage? Which forest
changes exacerbate earlier runoff, and which retain snow longer on the
landscape? (3) How can silvicultural practices be used in watershed management
to help offset the effects of projected climate change? The fine-scale spatial
analysis of forest-snow interactions proposed for this study are anticipated to
lead to improved hydrologic modeling of watersheds that include the intermittent
snow zone of maritime mountain basins, among others. The model developed will be
used in classroom education and management scenarios. Educational presentations
and field trips will involve the local community and students from the
Muckleshoot Indian Tribal Community College.
