An award is made to the University of Louisville to develop an isomotive
dielectrophoresis (isoDEP) microfluidic device that will extract dielectric
properties of individual cells. IsoDEP can be used in applications where cell
identification and analysis is critical such as studying phytoplankton
populations for environmental monitoring, bacteria identification for monitoring
food safety, or identifying cancerous cells. Details of the isoDEP device will
be disseminated to the local biological community and the general public through
technical presentations and social media. Educational outreach will include the
exposure of isoDEP physics and instrument development to undergraduate students
from rural impoverished regions of Appalachia and to high school students from
Central High School, one of the oldest urban secondary schools in Kentucky.

The analysis of individual cells within a population can monitor environmental
conditions or assess human health. In particular, dielectric properties provide
insight into cell conditions and can be used to identify and characterize cell
sub-populations. For example, cell properties such as membrane capacitance,
membrane resistance, and cytoplasmic conductivity directly reflect the cell's
biological structure. This project will extract dielectric measurements through
particle tracking under an electrokinetic environment at a rate of at least one
order of magnitude greater than current methods. Through collaboration with
Murray State University, freshwater phytoplankton analysis will be conducted for
environmental monitoring. In collaboration with a local small business (Ikotech,
LLC), an additional objective of this research is to develop an isoDEP
microfluidic instrument to be used by scientists worldwide.
