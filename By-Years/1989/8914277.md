The objective of this research effort is to develop modeling and control
methodologies that provide a broad science base for planning and scheduling
advanced manufacturing systems. Relevant achievements in operations research,
control and simulation theory as well as artificial intelligence and flexible
computer aided environments will be extended. Recognizing the complexity of
advanced manufacturing systems which renders the integration of manufacturing
elements into a manufacturing system analytically intractable, a systematic
hierarchical decomposition methodology that addresses the needs of today's
manufacturing environment will be developed. This methodology will provide the
capability to decompose the large, complex and generally intractable problem of
planning and scheduling a manufacturing facility to many smaller and tractable
generic tasks. Development of control policies, simulation and artificial
intelligence based design tools to address these generic tasks is also proposed.
The long term objective (in the next five years) is to create an integrated
collection of complementary tools that will be capable to make use of
information in real-time to adjust production planning and scheduling so that
disruptions and uncertainties are treated as a normal part of the production
routine.
