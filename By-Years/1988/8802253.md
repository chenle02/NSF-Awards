This grant, funded jointly by Special Projects in Chemistry and the Division of
Materials Research provides support for the research of Profs. Caulton and
Chisholm at the University of Indiana. The objective of the research is to apply
the principles of molecular inorganic and organometallic chemistry to the
synthesis of useful solid-state materials such as metal carbides, nitrides and
high temperature superconducting oxides. The carbide and nitrides can be made by
conversion of molecular carbides and nitrides or by converting hydrocarbyl or
amido ligands to these atomic groups by thermal or photochemical methods.
Surface coating with tungsten carbide is proposed via condensation of tungsten
alkoxide bonds with surface hydroxyl groups. Molecular precursors to oxide
superconductors will be made by condensing copper, barium and yttrium alkoxides,
in certain cases augmented by oxo and peroxo-ligands. The final conversion of
alkoxo to oxo ligands will be effected thermally, hydrolytically,
photochemically and by using ultrasound or electron-transfer oxidation. The
organic ligands will be optimized in the molecular precursors for the final
conversion to the solid materials.
