9424124 Hyde A program of summer graduate research will be carried out by the
Physics Department at Baylor University. This will supplement a very successful,
but modest, program in place at Baylor during the past summer. Seven students
will be identified for the program by applications targeted at smaller
undergraduate institutions which have little, if any, undergraduate research
opportunities available on their campuses. Historically predominantly Black and
Hispanic campuses will also be particularly targeted as will predominantly
minority junior colleges. The other campuses will be both nationally and
regionally selected, including all such Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, New Mexico
and Arkansas schools. These include many institutions with large Hispanic
enrollments. The students will participate with Baylor Students and students
from several foreign countries in cross cultural experiences in addition to
weekly seminars, an end of summer Undergraduate Research Symposium, as well as
specially designed classes in various physics research fields of interest. Trips
to nearby industries and research institutions will be organized. This research
is expected to lead to journal publications. ***
