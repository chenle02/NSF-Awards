The first main objective of this project is to develop further our understanding
of the way in which integers and especially consecutive integers factorize. This
is a fundamental mathematical problem which finds wide ranging application in
fields as distant as cryptography (e.g RSA) and mathematical physics (e.g the
study of gaps between energy levels of particles on generic tori). The second
main objective of this project is to apply the progress on this question to
further develop certain areas of pure mathematics, in particular the analytic
theory of L-functions. The project includes training of graduate students and
postdocs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Towards the first goal the PI aims to make
progress on Chowla's conjecture and in particular on the ``local Fourier
uniformity conjecture for multiplicative functions''. A full resolution of the
latter will imply Chowla's conjecture in logarithmic form for an arbitrary
number of shifts and in particular Sarnak's conjecture in logarithmic form.
Towards the second goal the PI aims to build on analogies between the analytic
theory of L-functions and multiplicative number theory to make progress on
questions related to the non-vanishing, value distribution and moments of
L-functions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
