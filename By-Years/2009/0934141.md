Cornell Univeristy is awarded a grant to improve the Shoals Marine Laboratory
(www.sml.cornell.edu), a seasonal field research station on Appledore Island,
Maine. Wastewater treatment will be upgraded to increase capacity for research
and training in a unique intellectual community focused on undergraduates.
Installation of commercial composting toilets, together with a septic field
built in 2009, will: 1) eliminate ocean discharge of wastes as mandated by Maine
DEP; 2) reduce freshwater use; 3) reduce energy use; and 4) reduce operating
costs. Funds recovered from reduced costs will be reinvested to support academic
programs.

The mission of Shoals Marine Laboratory is education, research, and conservation
training for undergraduates. Appledore Island, a 95 acre island six miles
southeast of Portsmouth, NH in the Gulf of Maine, is an extraordinary physical
location that offers easy access to intertidal, subtidal, oceanic, and
terrestrial habitats and opportunities to study sustainable engineering and
integration of power, water, and wastewater systems. Operated by Cornell and the
University of New Hampshire since 1966, the station has an alumni base of 6,200.
Each summer, ~170 undergraduates from all over the world enroll in ~20 credit
courses. The internship programs target undergraduate researchers, engineering
students, and conservation biologists with a successful proactive approach to
diversity and inclusiveness. The facility serves long-term ongoing major
research and survey programs, conserves Appledore's rich environments, and
provides an oceanic platform for AIRMAP's atmospheric observatory
(http://airmap.unh.edu/). Low environmental impact technologies are used not
only to protect Appledore Island and surrounding waters but also to demonstrate
them to all island visitors.
