The Principal Investigator's (PI's) team will assess the relationship between
solar subsurface mass flows and the production of flares and coronal mass
ejections (CMEs) from solar active regions. To accomplish this, the team will
utilize local helioseismology techniques to probe the mass flows beneath
magnetic fields observed at the surface of the Sun which may be associated with
eruptive events. The PI's team will determine differences in the subsurface
flows between active regions associated with eruptive flares and quiescent
active regions, validate the reliability of the subsurface flows that they
detect, link subsurface flows and flare productivity through comparisons of
observed flows with those predicted by models, and independently assess and
potentially improve subsurface kinetic-helicity-based flare forecasting indices
recently proposed by other researchers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This team's
theoretical predictions will lead to improved physical understanding of the
relationship between subsurface flows, as well as and the magnetic properties of
CME-eruptive and flare-eruptive solar active regions. The broader impacts of
this work will come from making solar flare and CME forecasting more accurate,
thereby directly benefitting society. This study could lead to the ability to
accurately predict the occurrence of flares and CMEs with up to several days
warning.
