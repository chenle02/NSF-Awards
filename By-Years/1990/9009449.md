The mantissae of floating-point numbers are often assumed to be logarithmically
distributed; that is they are assumed to have a reciprocal probability density
function. Mantissae of products of floating-point numbers are logarithmically
distributed when at least one of the factors has a mantissa that is so
distributed. However, the logarithmic distribution of mantissae is not preserved
under floating-point addition. The aim of this project is to derive a density
function for the sum of two or more floating-point numbers that have
logarithmically distributed mantissae and exponents that are not uniformly
distributed. The deviation between the density function for this sum and the
reciprocal density will be measured using a relative supremum norm. Error bounds
will be derived for this deviation. The resulting density functions can then be
used to compute probabilistic error bounds for floating-point sums.
