This award will support collaborative research between Professors Alex Marin and
Steven Ahlen of Boston University and Professor Giulio Auriemma of the
Universita di Roma, Italy. The researchers intend to continue research in
particle physics and astrophysics using the world's largest and one of the most
sensitive and highest resolution underground cosmic ray detectors, MACRO. The
study of the universe has in some sense evolved into a branch of particle
physics. New discoveries are possible that could provide experimental evidence
or constraints for the theoretical predictions of the Grand Unified and
Supersymmetry Theories. Furthermore, questions pertaining to the nature of high
energy cosmic rays, their origin, acceleration and propagation mechanisms may be
addressed throughout the observation of high energy multiple muon bundles that
penetrate to the detector depth underground. By virtue of MACRO's depth
underground, fine grain tracking capability, and large acceptance, it is ideally
suited for a comprehensive study of multiple muon bundles that reflect the
nature of the high energy primary cosmic rays interacting at the top of the
atmosphere.
