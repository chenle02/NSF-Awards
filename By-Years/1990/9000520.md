This project supports a conference entitled Probability Models in Mathematical
Physics. The conference will be held May 24-26, 1990 in Colorado Springs, CO.
The purpose of the conference is to bring together a group of mathematicians
with strong affinities to both probability and mathematical theories related to
physics. The topics of the conference are rigorous renormalization ideas,
including self avoiding random walk and percolation, as well as ideas in
functional integration, random fields, and stochastic geometry.
