EIA-0130352-Robert Kozma-University of Memphis-Percolation Model of Phase
Transitions in the Central Nervous Systems during Perceptual Information
Processing &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will explore the close
link between pattern-based information processing using dynamical memories and
percolation phenomena. Percolation models have been used to analyze a wide range
of processes in physics and electronics, and in biological and ecological
systems. In the last decade and a half, many variants of the standard
percolation models have been studied. In particular, there has been much work on
the family or processes known as bootstrap percolation. Computer experiments
performed by physicists have suggested interesting non-trivial models. The solid
mathematical theory of percolation in lattices to lay down the foundations of
dynamical memories and the related phase transitions will be
applied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
