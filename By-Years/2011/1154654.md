The UCLA Mentoring Underrepresented Scholars in Engineering (MUSE) project
addresses a National Science Board critical need of increasing engineering and
computing degrees for the technical workforce and strengthening America's global
competiveness. The project design derives from seminal research in active
learning communities and its application to low-income engineering students from
underrepresented groups. The project provides the resources to recruit, retain,
mentor and graduate low-income underrepresented freshmen, community college
transfers, and continuing students in the Henry Samueli School of Engineering
and Applied Science. For each year of the grant, MUSE scholarships are awarded
to 5 incoming freshmen, 5 new community college transfer students, and 10
continuing students. Key project objectives are for the MUSE Scholars to succeed
in gatekeeper courses and to exceed the School's overall retention to graduation
percentage. To achieve these outcomes, MUSE provides support structures to
increase Scholar's persistence and performance in gatekeeper engineering and
computing courses. Additionally, the project provides closely monitored faculty
and industry mentoring programs and professional development for Scholars to
enter the workforce or advanced study. The MUSE project is adding to the
understanding of retention in engineering by both broadening the participation
and increasing graduation percentage of-low income engineering students from
underrepresented groups.
