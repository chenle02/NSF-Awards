Funds are provided to purchase a ruby laser system to be used in pulsed laser
interferometry research applications. Several interdisciplinary projects will
make use of this equipment. Plans also exist to interface existing image
processing research facilities to the pulsed ruby laser in order to automate the
data acquisition and analysis process.
