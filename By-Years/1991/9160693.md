The research will develop a new analytical tool and technique permitting in-situ
analysis of dissolved metals in ground water. The project consists of realizing
the analysis of dissolved metals by applying the well known principles of
polarography in a novel manner. The details of this new analytical technology
are presented and described in the proprietary section. Ä±PS-1!. The program will
perform better than standard available electrochemical techniques for the in-
situ analysis of dissolved metals for the following reasons: (1) problems
associated with electrode poisoning are prevented by first exhausting the
electrodes poisons from the water to be analyzed; (2) most between species
interactions and interferences at the surface of the working electrodes are
suppressed; (3) many of the constraints encountered using classical
polarographic techniques are suppressed; (4) low detection levels are achieved;
(5) better separation of electroplatable species. The small size will permit
deployment of the devices directly as in-situ sensors supported by most
available commercial probes capable of housing a device a few centimeters in
size. The use of microfabrication for the production of the sensors will provide
new sophisticated analytical devices at low cost per unit.
