Project Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Systems are only as secure as their
weakest point of attack. Indeed,&lt;br/&gt;the only way to increase the security
of a system as a whole is to&lt;br/&gt;improve the resilience of its most
vulnerable component. Much&lt;br/&gt;successful research has focused on
developing cryptographic protocols&lt;br/&gt;which are secure as long as some
information (i.e., a key) is kept&lt;br/&gt;secret from the adversary. However,
as such algorithms are&lt;br/&gt;increasingly deployed on inexpensive, mobile,
and unprotected devices&lt;br/&gt;(e.g., laptops, mobile phones, and PDAs), the
risk of key exposure is&lt;br/&gt;becoming a serious threat to the security of
many real-world&lt;br/&gt;systems. This project aims to develop new paradigms
and to design&lt;br/&gt;efficient algorithms for maintaining security even in
the event of a&lt;br/&gt;key exposure attack. Among other topics, the project
will focus on (1)&lt;br/&gt;forward-secure public-key encryption; (2) forward
secrecy in&lt;br/&gt;key-exchange protocols; and (3) protecting signcryption
schemes&lt;br/&gt;against key exposure attacks. The techniques developed as part
of this&lt;br/&gt;research are expected to help improve the security of a number
of&lt;br/&gt;different systems, from handheld devices to ad-hoc
networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Graduate students will be involved in all aspects
of this project, and&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate involvement will be encouraged as
well. The techniques&lt;br/&gt;stemming from this research will be incorporated
into undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;and graduate courses in cryptography and computer
security. In these&lt;br/&gt;ways, the project will help train future scientists
in the important&lt;br/&gt;area of information security.&lt;br/&gt;
