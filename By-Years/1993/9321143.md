This project deals with the design and implementation of VLSI algorithms and
circuits for arithmetic operations on complex numbers. The research is motivated
by the need for these circuits in high-speed digital signal processing
applications. The goals of the research are to: 1. Develop VLSI design
algorithms for the arithmetic data path of complex number digital signal
processors. 2. Design and implement VLSI circuits and components for the
developed algorithms, with emphasis on both architecture and circuit design. 3.
Study the trade-off between chip area and VLSI circuit latency/throughput and to
develop a design curve exhibiting their trade-offs for benchmark complex number
applications. 4. Specify other data path components for the complex number
digital signal processor to support high-throughput input/output operations and
ease of programming.
