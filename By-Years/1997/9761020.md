*** 9761020 Allaei This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
attempt to demonstrate the feasibility of developing computer software that can
be used by design engineers and vibration analysts to incorporate the occurrence
and effects of the phenomenon of vibration confinement in their design and
product development processes. Analytical tools are needed to model, study, and
incorporate the potential impacts of vibration confinement in the design stage
of systems, structures, and products. The engineering tools must be user
friendly, provide rapid response and analysis, and be compatible with other
commonly used modeling software/hardware. A user-friendly Vibration Energy
Confinement Analysis Software (VECAS) will be developed as a stand-alone program
or as part of a post processing toolbox when used with large commercial modeling
programs (i.e., finite element programs such as ANSYS, NASTRAN, ABACUS, etc.).
The software will also be available in two different compilation platforms, such
as C++ and FORTRAN. The VECAS program will provide rapid awareness of the
occurrence of the energy confinement and its significance in structures under
development, and therefore, reduce the potential for catastrophic failures due
to confinement of energy. VECAS can also be used to optimize the performance of
the structure based on beneficial effects (i.e., improved buckling capacity,
vibration isolation, reduction, and sensor/actuator optimization) of the
phenomenon. Finally, VECAS can be used to construct more effective passive or
active vibration/noise control systems. The VECAS program to be developed will
provide the tools to incorporate the mode localization phenomenon in the design
stage of new developments. Due to the broad applications, such as buckling and
vibration analysis, and passive active vibration control, of the such software,
the commercial market is diverse and huge. It is anticipated that researchers,
engineers, and educators in government laboratories, indus try, and academic
institutions, respectively, will be interested in using VECAS. ***
