The U.S.-Mexico border provides a living laboratory in which to study the
potentially detrimental effects of industrial pollution. This dissertation
research in cultural anthropology will study the landscape of El Paso, Texas, as
an arena in which the human and economic costs of increased ambient pollution
and the unequal burdens of environmental risk can be evaluated. The project
investigates the conditions under which the Hispanic-majority population in this
expanding urban region along the U.S.-Mexico border perceives and responds to
ambient pollution and the resultant respiratory disease in the context of their
marginalized economic status. A comparative study between two ethnically and
economically similar communities (but which experience different levels of
environmental exposure) may reveal a difference in the incidence of respiratory
disease as well as clarify some of the treatment seeking behaviors demonstrated
under specific urban, industrial, and economic conditions. This research also
explores the cultural significance of the relationship between the environment
and health morbidity in children living in communities within, and more distant
from, a contaminated atmosphere.&lt;br/&gt;This ethnographic research will
contribute at several levels to the understanding of the relationships between
pollution, poverty, and health. The empirical results from this two-community
case study will be valuable to environmental scientists, health-care planners,
and policy makers concerned with similar settings throughout the United States.
This project also will provide important data for local-level governmental
officials in the El Paso region and the broader border region by informing them
of potential environmental risk situations. Finally, the research will offer
culturally appropriate information that might help at-risk families in the
communities to reduce their environmental risks and their rates of respiratory
diseases&lt;br/&gt;
