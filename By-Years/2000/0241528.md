ABSTRACT PI/Institution: Ferrari / MIT Proposal No: OCE-0241528

Distributions of active and passive tracers in the ocean surface mixed layer are
of central importance in oceanography, and in studies of the atmosphere-ocean
climate system. First, the water masses in the upper ocean are eventually
subducted in the ocean interior and strongly affect the overall ocean
circulation. Second, the mixed layer is in direct contact with the atmospheric
forcing and controls the exchange of properties between the ocean and the
atmosphere. Recent observations in the Northern Pacific and in the Southern
Ocean suggest that tracer transport by baroclinic eddies play a fundamental role
in the physics of the upper ocean. However, parameterizations of unresolved eddy
motions in the upper layers of coarse resolution models are extremely crude, if
not absent. The primary objectives of this proposal are to improve our
understanding of the physics of eddy transport in the upper ocean, and to
develop and test parameterizations for the mixed layer eddy transport
appropriate for coarse resolution models. This research will benefit from and
contribute to the Climate Modeling Initiative, a collaboration between
scientists at MIT aimed at developing a state of the art model of the atmosphere
and ocean for study of the climate of the Earth. The close interaction with
people involved in the development of the MIT ocean model will help to
disseminate the results in the modeling community as progress is made. In order
to get students at MIT interested in this research, the principal investigator
will present the basic concepts underlying eddy parameterization in large scale
ocean-atmosphere models during a graduate course on geophysical turbulence, to
be offered at MIT in the spring of 2003. Finally, a student of the MIT/WHOI
Joint Program in Physical Oceanography, will actively participate in the
research.
