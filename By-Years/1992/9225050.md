This is a request for funds to help support a conference (titled above) to be
held June 20-25, 1993 at Vermont Academy, Saxtons River, VT. It is a biennial
conference, initiated in 1989, which is sponsored and partially supported by the
Federation of the American Societies of Experimental Biology. The focus of the
conference is on the mechanisms of intracellular protein degradation with an
emphasis on the ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic pathway. Ubiquitin is a small,
highly conserved eukaryotic protein. It functions in protein breakdown by
becoming covalently linked to other proteins and serves as a reusable
recognition signal for proteolysis. Specific sessions will include the
biochemistry, molecular biology and genetics of the ubiquitin system, targets
and functions of the ubiquitin pathway, non- ubiquitin proteolytic systems in
eucaryotic and in procaryotic cells, recognition signals for protein breakdown,
the proteasome, proteolysis and antigen presentation enzymology and regulation
of protein breakdown in prokaryotes, and protein degradation in organelles.
