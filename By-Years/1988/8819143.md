The objective of this research program is to investigate the performance of a
free-electron laser for which a gaseous medium has been introduced into the
region of the wiggler, or undulating magnetic field. Placing a gas in an FEL
wiggler alters the phase matching condition. This is a consequence of the fact
that the gas introduces an index of refraction which retards the phase velocity
of the electromagnetic wave. By changing the pressure of the gas, and so
changing the index of refraction, the oscillation wavelength can be tuned,
potentially from the infrared to the ultraviolet, without altering either the
energy of the electron beam or the wiggler parameters. In addition to the
tunability, the gas allows for a significant reduction in beam energy, resulting
in a lower cost and size for the accelerator, and a higher gain per unit length
for the FEL. As part of the program on FEL performance with a gas, there will be
an investigation of the effects of operating near an electronic resonance in the
gas. In this case a high refractive index can be obtained at relatively low gas
densities. There will also be a study of the possibility of using interferometer
mirrors with on-axis holes to facilitate development of a compact in-line, high-
gain system. In addition, the experiments will provide information concerning
the propagation of picosecond electron beams through gases at up to one
atmosphere pressure; investigate methods for increasing FEL gain with high
emittance beams; and study the optical properties of interferometers with on-
axis holes.
