The conference Quantum Topology and Hyperbolic Geometry will be held in Nha
Trang, Vietnam, May 13-May 17, 2013. The aim of the conference is to understand
how Quantum Field Theory in dimension three detects the topology and geometry of
the underlying space. As an example, we will study the connection of the index
of a hyperbolic 3-manifold (a remarkable q-series of Dimofte-Gaiotto-Gukov, also
studied by Garoufalidis and Garoufalidis-Hodgson-Rubinstein-Segerman) with the
asymptotics of the colored Jones polynomial, and with categorification of its
integer coefficients. We will also study the recursions of the above q-series
and their relation to the AJ and Slope Conjectures, and the relation of the
above q-series of Nahm type with thestability of the colored Jones polynomial of
alternating links, proven by Garoufalidis-Le.

The conference will focus on this new and exciting developments of mathematical
physics and their implications to geometry and topology in dimension 3. This is
a fertile land of concrete, testable conjectures, symbolic computer
experimentation, physics, algebra and low dimensional topology. The
opportunities for young researchers are many, and the conference would come in a
fortunate timing where the old ideas in quantum topology meet the new ones. The
