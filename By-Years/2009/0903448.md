The objective of this research is to create a reliable hybrid photonic-
electronic network-on-chip for high performance multicore chips. This is
achieved through backend integration of a silicon-compatible nanophotonic
optical network configured and monitored using an electronic packet-switched
network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Metal interconnects have
emerged as the critical bottleneck in meeting reliability, performance and
energy constraints in chip multiprocessors. Silicon nanophotonics offers a
compelling alternative, because of its inherently large bandwidth, low loss, low
energy consumption and CMOS compatibility. This research addresses barriers
challenging the efficient and cost-effective integration of on-chip photonic
networks by (1) investigating CMOS compatible fabrication of amorphous silicon
nanophotonic components for maximum backend flexibility; (2) examining scalable
architectures, topologies and routing mechanisms for these photonic-electronic
on-chip networks; (3) exploring error control methods for reliable energy-
efficient multicore communication; (4) developing robust low-jitter mode-locked
quantum-dot lasers that supply light to the photonic
network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: Successful demonstration of the
hybrid photonic-electronic network-on-chip will accelerate realization of
reliable energy efficient data-centers and high performance computational
systems for a multitude of societal applications. Integration of research and
education builds on the PIs' own community involvement and excellent campus-wide
resources offered by the participating universities to (1) train the next
generation of scholars through a joint course to be developed by the PIs and
planned workshops that enable student participants to interact with experts; (2)
actively recruit and mentor qualified underrepresented students; (3) inspire
participation of K-12 groups through hands-on laboratory activities; (4) extend
outreach through international collaborations.
