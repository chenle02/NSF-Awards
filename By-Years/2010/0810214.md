An open question in volcano science is whether and how earthquakes trigger
volcanic eruptions. It is well known that there is a short-term interaction
related to the passage of the seismic waves (minutes to days after the
earthquake) but it is not understood whether there is an intermediate-term or a
long-term interaction (weeks to month or month to decades after the earthquake).
This project uses satellite interferometry to survey the volcanic activity in
Sumatra before and after the 2004 and 2005 earthquakes to answer this question.
The earthquakes were among the largest-ever instrumental earthquakes and provide
a unique opportunity to investigate eruption triggering because they were
associated with significant decompression of the volcanic arc. The InSAR survey
tests the hypothesis that earthquake-induced decompression triggers eruptions.
The rationale of this project is that new volcanic activity is associated with
the ascent of magma from deep sources towards the surface and thus detectable by
precise space geodetic measurements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;In the
first phase of the project 2005-2010 imagery of the Canadian Radarsat-1 and the
Japanese ALOS satellite will be analyzed to detect any anomalous surface
deformation that occurred after the earthquakes. In the second phase 1993-1998
imagery from the JERS-1 satellites will be analyzed to map surface deformation
prior to the earthquakes. Comparison of pre-earthquake with post-earthquake data
will identify triggered volcano deformation. This project is a partnership
between the University of Miami and the Institute of Technology in Bandung
(ITB), Indonesia. ITB will lead ground-based investigations of satellite-
detected active centres in collaboration with Indonesian government and research
institutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
