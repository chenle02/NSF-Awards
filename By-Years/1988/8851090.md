The Cupertino (CA) Union School District, in partnership with the Cupertino
Chamber of Commerce and volunteer accountants, stockbrokers, and bankers, will
develop a mathematics program -- "Mathematics in Everyday Life" -- for 4-6th
grade students. The program will utilize the expertise of the volunteer
accountants, bankers, and stockbrokers in the local community to work with
teachers to develop lessons for the classroom which provide practical math
applications and real life skills to students. Two new units -- "Project
Bookkeeping" and "Project Stockmarket" -- will be developed to complement
"Project Banking", a previously developed unit which will also be revised as
dictated by classroom experience. Completed materials will be made available for
use throughout the Cupertino district and information about the program will be
disseminated through county education offices and the State Chamber of Commerce.
Cost sharing by the school district and private sector people and organizations
will equal 70% of the NSF funding.
