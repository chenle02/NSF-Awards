9604605 Paterson The sixth bi-annual Gordon Research Conference on Mammalian DNA
Repair will be held in Ventura, CA, Feb. 2 - Feb. 7, 1997. The invited speakers
are experts in the fields of DNA repair and related cellular processes (e.g. DNA
replication, transcription, cell cycle control and apoptosis). Besides providing
a forum for these experts to present their most recent results and ideas, the
Conference will facilitate wide-ranging interactions among all attendees through
plenary discussion sessions and poster presentations. The attendees will be
chosen globally from universities, research institutes, and government and
industrial research labs. Every effort will be made to select a well-balanced
mix of individuals ranging from leaders in mammalian DNA repair to students and
younger scientists new to the field. %%% This Conference will examine mammalian
DNA repair as a key component of the genomic surveillance machinery crucial to
the overall integrity and function of higher organisms. Recent discoveries have
catapulted DNA repair into a pivotal position in fundamental biological studies.
