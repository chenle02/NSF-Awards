In many species, females mate with more than one male. This leads to sperm
competition, where the sperm of several males compete to fertilize a female's
eggs. All else equal, males that provide more sperm are expected to gain more
fertilizations. However, the number of times a female mates and the extent to
which she uses each male's sperm equally to fertilize her eggs also affect the
number of fertilizations a given male is likely to achieve. Because sperm
production entails a physiological cost, males are therefore expected to
allocate different numbers of sperm to different females. In order to make
predictions about these patterns in any species, investigators need information
about how frequently females mate and how they use sperm. This research will
provide that information for a species of Hawaiian cricket and will use it to
predict patterns of male sperm allocation in this species. To determine female
mating rate, individually marked females will be observed daily under semi-
natural field conditions for ten weeks. To determine patterns of sperm use, the
investigators will collect eggs daily and use genetic tools to identify the
sires. These data will be corroborated in wild females by estimating, again
using genetic tools, the number of mates and sires contributing to their sperm
stores and offspring. This work will provide information on the sexual selection
parameters operating in the field, crucial data that are rarely collected. The
researchers will conduct outreach in Hawaii, in upstate New York by
participating in a day of science education at a correctional facility for
girls, and at Cornell by hiring an undergraduate research assistant from an
underrepresented group.
