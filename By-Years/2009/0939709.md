This 1-year Opportunities for Enhancing Diversity in the Geosciences planning
grant is bringing together faculty at Fayetteville State University and the
University of North Carolina Pembroke and 20 in-service Earth/Environmental
Science teachers from the surrounding school districts in a workshop that will
focus on developing high quality teacher professional development activities.
The basic strategy that is being developed during the planning phase is to
establish a mechanism for providing research experiences for teachers in the
laboratories of participating university faculty. It is expected that this will
be a win-win approach that improves the geoscience content knowledge of the
teachers and increases their confidence in the scientific process, while also
strengthening the pedagogical capabilities of the host researchers.
