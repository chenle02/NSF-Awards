9422323 Sillman In recent years, results from two-dimensional global simulations
have demonstrated that gas-phase hydrocarbon chemistry and aqueous chemistry
both have significant impacts in the troposphere, particularly with regard to
the important tropospheric species ozone, NOx, and hydroxyl radical. A complete
analysis of these photochemical impacts requires a three-dimensional simulation.
Recently three-dimensional chemical tracer models (CTMs) have been applied to
photochemically active tropospheric species, however, the application of CTMs
has been limited by computational constraints associated with the calculation of
photochemical production and loss. The PI has developed an innovative numerical
approach to solving the equations of tropospheric chemistry. This method uses
special properties of tropospheric odd hydroeen to obtain a convergent implicit
solution to the equations of photochemical production and loss. By utilizing
specific photochemical properties of the troposphere as part of the solution,
the method is computationally very fast. In this project, the existing
capabilities will be extended in two directions. First, techniques will be
developed to include aqueous photochemistry as part of the numerical code.
Second, an analysis of the cycle of tropospheric reactive nitrogen in three-
dimensional global models with gas-and aqueous-phase chemistry will be
completed. This analysis will lead to direct comparisons between simulated
reactive nitrogen species and recent measurements associated with the North
Atlantic Regional Experiment.
