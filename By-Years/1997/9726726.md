This two-year award provides support for US-France cooperative research on the
application of multiple resonance spectroscopic techniques to colliding
ultracold atoms. The collaboration involves research groups led by William
Stwalley at the University of Connecticut and Claude Amiot at the Laboratoire
Cotton Aime, University of Paris at Orsay. The investigators will focus their
effort on translationally ultracold molecules from ultracold atoms. The US group
brings to this collaboration expertise in spectroscopy and laser cooling and
trapping. This is complemented by French theoretical expertise in non-radiative
decay. The project takes advantage of facilities for all-optical multiple
resonance spectroscopy (visible and near visible) at the University of
Connecticut and Fourier Transform Spectroscopy (infrared) at Orsay. The project
will advance understanding of molecular structure and interatomic forces.
