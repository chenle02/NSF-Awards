This award provides funding for a conference titled "Arithmetic and Algebraic
Geometry" to be held at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, in the period
August 5-9, 2019. It will feature talks by international experts known for their
expository skills, encourage new collaborations, and serve as an excellent
opportunity where junior participants can learn and meet experts in the
field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The areas of arithmetic and algebraic geometry have
traditionally attracted the interest of many young mathematicians because of the
depth and beauty of the ideas they offer. The purpose of this conference is to
bring together leaders of various subfields within this very broad subject to
explain some of the latest developments. The topics represented at the
conference will include complex geometry, algebraic cycles, motives, birational
geometry, derived and higher categorical techniques, rational points, and
arithmetic and geometry of K3 surfaces. This conference will provide
opportunities for fruitful discussions and exchange of ideas across different
areas of arithmetic and algebraic geometry. More information can be found at
