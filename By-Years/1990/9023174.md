This project concerns the application of the Utah Retrieval System Architecture
to very large databases of full-text documents. This effort involves the
development of a mediumscale (4 to 10 GBytes) parallel backend search server
using augmented RISC processors as the searching engines. Data is being gathered
and analyzed to determine if the existence of a high-speed search server changes
the complexity and arrival rate of queries by real users (law students). In
addition, a suitable partitioning of functionality such that remote users can be
supported by such a searching engine over medium-speed networks (such as ISDN)
is being studied. The researchers are also examining how the system can be
reconfigured to deal with disk and searcher failures.
