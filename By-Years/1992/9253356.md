The Boulder Valley Project will expand the uses and support of the Internet
throughout the Boulder Valley School District, Boulder, Colorado, over a three
year period. Through concentrating on horizontal infusion into three middle
schools and vertical infusion onto one elementary, one middle and one senior
high school in a feeder pattern, the training and development will be maximized.
The teachers directly trained will become peer instructors. Ultimately, over
two-hundred and fifty-eight teacher and administrators will be trained and have
access to the Internet including all building principals. The project has three
distinct stages. In the first, a core group of teachers who will later become
peer instructors is trained on the Internet including e-mail and access to
files. In the second stage, the network is used as a practical way to induce
students to internalize a foreign language. In the third stage, connectivity and
training are spread throughout the district. Curriculum development of lessons
which employ the network is done and disseminated. The university and partners
cost share 40% of this project.
