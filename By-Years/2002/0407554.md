This award, under the auspices of the Small Grants for Exploratory Research
(SGER) program, will improve and extend the radiocarbon calibration program
(i.e., CALIBRATION) used in the field of paleoclimatology to provide a temporal
control for climatic events. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dating geo-biologic samples
to establish age control is critical to paleoclimatic investigations. The
CALIBRATION program (i.e., CALIB) is fundamental to this enterprise. The CALIB
program needs to be periodically updated to take advantage of the latest
developments in geochemical measurements and understanding of carbon reservoir
effects on radiocarbon dating. This award will help researchers improve the
calibration across several critical time periods in the Holocene and Pleistocene
time periods that are at the forefront of paleoclimate research intensely
supported by the NSF through many Programs and across Directorates. In addition
to updating the program, the researcher team will also modify the CALIB software
so that it is compatible with Microsoft Windows and Macintosh operating systems.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;U.S. and non-U.S. researchers, on collaborative
international projects supported in part by the National Science Foundation, use
the CALIB program extensively. As such, CALIB has great utility and great impact
by helping the research community integrate its research efforts.
