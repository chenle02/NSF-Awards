Scientists have long been interested in the uneven patterns of agricultural land
tenure and how those patterns affect both the rural landscape and its
inhabitants. Land tenure has also been shown to be influenced by discrimination
which affects access to and control over land. This project examines the ways
that recent changes in U.S. agriculture challenge and/or reproduce the racially-
uneven nature of the nation's rural landscape. Through interviews with farmers
who have experienced discrimination, this project will examine how these changes
have affected under-represented groups. The changes in U.S. agriculture,
specifically the increasingly precarious position of commodity producers, and
the growth of local food systems, are reshaping the nation's agricultural
landscape. However, they are not occurring in a smooth or predictable manner,
and they have uneven social and ecological consequences.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;While these processes of agrarian change vary across time and space,
this project works to uncover the underlying forces that drive the many
contingent manifestations of contemporary land politics. To do so, this project
draws historical studies of racial discrimination together with theoretical
scholarship on the politics of land. The central research question of this
project is: To what extent and in what ways does the current restructuring of
U.S. agriculture challenge and/or reproduce the legacies of racial
discrimination? To answer this question, this project analyzes the ways that
shifting forms of state power and dynamic racial ideologies shape the contested
agrarian landscape of the South Carolina Lowcountry -- the coastal region
surrounding the port city of Charleston. It is through this focus on the
articulation of regional landscapes and broader political trends that this
project will explain the uneven dimensions of recent changes in U.S.
agriculture.
