The PI will study combinatorial, algebraic and computational questions about the
geometry of Schubert varieties in Grassmannians and flag manifolds. The two main
projects explore central problems in the subject. The first project seeks
uniformly stated combinatorial rules in Schubert calculus, via an expanded
theory of Young tableaux. The famous Littlewood-Richardson coefficients arise in
this context, but also in the theory of representations of general linear groups
and of symmetric groups, eigenvalues of sums of Hermitian matrices and short
exact sequences of finite abelian p-groups. The PI will find combinatorial rules
for these coefficients and their Schubert calculus extensions, building on joint
work with H. Thomas. The second project aims to further develop a combinatorial
and computational framework, introduced jointly with A. Woo, to understand the
singularities of Schubert varieties.

The main tools applied and further developed in this project come from
combinatorics, including algebraic and geometric combinatorics, and
combinatorial commutative algebra. Combinatorics concerns discrete objects such
as permutations, partial orders and graphs, as well as techniques of
enumeration. In many instances, such as with Schubert varieties, continuous
objects can be parameterized by discrete data, opening the door for
combinatorial analysis. Moreover, one often witnesses that the same
combinatorial objects govern a priori different mathematical settings. The
Littlewood-Richardson coefficients are a prime example of this. The project
seeks to similarly find further cross-flow of ideas between areas of
mathematics, as well as with other scientific disciplines.
