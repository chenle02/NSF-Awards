Understanding causal systems is a significant aspect of learning in almost all
disciplines of science, engineering and technology. However, understanding
causal systems is difficult, and often leads to misconceptions because many
aspects of such systems are dynamic, invisible, and interdependent. Complex
causal domains can be characterized in a domain-independent and general manner
in terms of structure and causal propagation of component behaviors in spatial
and temporal dimensions. The need to comprehend and integrate structure and
causal propagation in multiple dimensions may be the source of many of the
difficulties that learners face in understanding, explaining, making predictions
about, operating or troubleshooting systems in causal domains. Clearly, research
under the rubric "Science of Learning" ought to address the topic of complex
causal learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At present, research on fundamental
aspects of causal systems, mechanisms of causal understanding, ways to improve
the learning and application of causal models, etc. remains fragmented,
discipline-specific, and published in disparate forums. As a result, a global
view of the state-of-research and research avenues to advance our understanding
of learning about complex causal systems is simply not available. Therefore, we
propose to undertake a research synthesis effort. Its goals are twofold:
developing a prospective synthesis of the state-of-research on complex causal
learning across disciplines, and identifying gaps in the knowledge base that
past research has built up. This will be an effort that draws from multiple
disciplines, including but not limited to cognitive science, computer science,
engineering education, machine learning, psychology, and science education. The
outcomes of this catalyst project will be a workshop on complex causal learning
and a comprehensive research report on the topic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
intellectual merit of this project lies in its development and dissemination of
a comprehensive research report on the current knowledge base on complex causal
learning, a topic of interest and importance to K-16 education and learning
research in several scientific and technical disciplines. Such a reference
resource is at present not available to researchers and educators. The broad
impacts of this project will be in raising awareness and focusing the attention
of the learning research community on the topic of complex causal learning, and
in cross-disciplinary learning research that the dissemination of our research
report can potentially encourage. The results of this project, especially the
research challenges it identifies, are expected to form the basis of a future
proposal for a Science of Learning Center on complex causal learning.&lt;br/&gt;
