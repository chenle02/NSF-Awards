This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project proposes to
develop a broad-based technology platform for RNA interference (RNAi) gene
silencing in mammalian cells. Sequence-specific RNAi is achieved by introducing
homologous, short interfering RNA duplexes (siRNAs) into cells. siRNAs are
generated by several methods of which the most popular are (1) chemically
synthesized siRNA duplexes, and (2) short hairpin RNAs (shRNA) expressed from
vectors. This project will attempt to bridge these silencing platforms. The
follow on Phase II project will build on the integrated technologies to develop
a genome-wide platform of siRNAs, shRNA vectors and stable cell lines. The
combination of these powerful tools will have broad impacts for general biology,
medical and pharmaceutical research and development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
commercial application of this project will be to meet the needs of researchers
involved in biological and medical research. &lt;br/&gt;
