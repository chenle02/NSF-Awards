This award will provide partial support for the Seventh International Conference
on Noncontact Atomic Force Microscopy (ncAFM04) to be held in Seattle,
Washington, on 12 -16 September 2004. This conference series is the primary
international venue for sharing advances in this rapidly developing technique
that enables atomic resolution investigation of both insulating and conducting
surfaces in vacuum, as well as topographical measurements with minimal forces in
air and fluids. The funds will permit a lower registration fee for students and
attendees at an optional tutorial, as well as provide travel assistance to
selected graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and young faculty from the US.
A broader impact of this proposal will be to encourage participation in this
exciting area of research by graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and young
faculty in the US. This is the first time that the conference will be held in
the United States.
