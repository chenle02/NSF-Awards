David Stanbury of Auburn University is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic,
and Organometallic Chemistry program for research on kinetics and mechanisms of
reactions in solutions (mainly aqueous) that involve redox changes of elements
of the main group of the periodic table. One main aim of the research is to
clarify the mechanisms of aqueous solution reactions that involve oxidation of
thiols by direct ('outer sphere') electron transfer from oxidants. A second main
area will involve outer sphere oxidation of iodide ion in aprotic non-aqueous
solvents. A third problem area involves investigations of aqueous outer-sphere
oxidation of hydroxlyamine and thiocyanate ion. Spectroscopic (including stopped
flow) and electrochemical techniques will be employed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
proposed research deals with the fundamental processes that determine whether
the reactions of rather simple main-group element compounds that occur in
aqueous media are fast or slow. Although such reactions have been studied for
more than a century, many fundamental aspects of their reaction dynamics have
only recently become accessible, through the use of recently developed
techniques and instruments. Reactions of such species as iodide ion are involved
in vast numbers of processes of the highest industrial and biological
importance, but the subtle factors that determine the kinetics of these
reactions are for the most part quite obscure. Research carried out under this
program has high intrinsic interest, and will also lead to understanding that
will be applicable in many related research areas.&lt;br/&gt;
