The New Jersey Institute of Technology will initiate a three-week, commuter
Young Scholars project in Engineering for 30 students entering grades 8,9. The
thirty, high-potential/high-ability (predominately minority) students will work
with faculty of NJIT and will be instructed in the scientific method and
research projects in engineering science associated with environmental waste
management. The program will include classroom and laboratory activities,
seminars, and field trips. A major goal of the program will be to increase the
interest and motivation of students to pursue careers in science and
engineering.
