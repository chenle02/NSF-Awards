The project builds upon the researchers' previous research piecing together a
640,000-year long, high-resolution record of the oxygen isotopic composition of
cave calcite from the region of China currently affected by Asian monsoon
rainfall. The researchers aim to examine how the oxygen isotopic composition of
cave calcite relates to climate using a series of tests. These analytical tests
involve (1) obtaining records from different regions of Asia, (2) obtaining
extremely high resolution seasonal records of oxygen isotopic composition over
specific transitions in climate, and (3) measuring the Oxygen-17 anomalies in
selected cave deposits. The proposed tests of the mechanisms whereby the oxygen
isotopic composition of cave calcite responds to climate aim to help illuminate
the fundamental processes that cause changes in the Asian Monsoon. This research
is important because the Asian Monsoon affects millions of people and responds
to regional insolation changes at orbital timescales and North Atlantic climate
at millennial timescales. The project will allow the researchers to use the
monsoon records as a window into high latitude climate. The broader impacts
involve supporting an early career scientist, a postdoctoral scholar, a graduate
student, and fostering mutually beneficial international collaborations.
