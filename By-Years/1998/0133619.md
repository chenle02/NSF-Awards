This project seeks to understand how students build mathematical reasoning
skills through working with teachers on geometric proofs. Although the NCTM
Standards put an emphasis on students' development of these skills, teachers
often do not know how to effectively use proofs to assist students. This project
will focus on understanding the dynamics of working with proofs that occur
between teachers, students, and the subject matter. The proposer will conduct
classroom observations, interviews, and focus groups with teachers. Replacement
units will be used by the teachers during some observations that will allow for
both descriptive observation as well as flexibility in the treatment conditions.
The researcher will use this research in his teaching in several ways.
Preservice teachers will be invited to spend part of their practicum in the
observation classes. Several courses will be created including a master's-level
course on teaching and learning of geometry. The research will also infuse an
existing course on conceptualization in mathematics.
