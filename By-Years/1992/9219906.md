9219906 AHRENS, Thomas J. New shock wave temperature measurements are proposed
for olivine compositions in the shock-induced high pressure phase regime. The PI
will measure the melting point of this important mantle constituent. New
techniques are to be developed to conduct shock temperature measurements of
sample films of FeO when shocked into the high-pressure metallic phase in order
to gain knowledge of its thermodynamic properties. This component has been
proposed to be a major constituent of the Earth's liquid core.
