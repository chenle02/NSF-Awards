African precipitation and Atlantic upwelling are linked at annual and orbital
time scales through insolation forcing of West African monsoon. ODP site 662,
off west Africa, will be studied for winter dust input within equatorial
Atlantic upwelling system. Freshwater diatoms and nannofossils will be used to
monitor variations in African precipitation and tropical upwelling. The study
will help answer the question about circulation changes in the mild Pliocene.
