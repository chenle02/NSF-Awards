This grant provides funding to support an effort to achieve ground truth
validation of Michelson Interferometer for Global High-resolution Thermospheric
Imaging (MIGHTI) Ionospheric Connection Explorer (ICON) mesopause measurements
near 95km to resolve an issue suggesting the existence of a bias in the
comparisons of MIGHTI measurements with Utah State Sodium (Na) lidar daytime
climatological measurements. The ICON satellite view of the northern hemisphere
may be reversed toward the southern hemisphere. This would mean that the
possibility of overflight measurements by MIGHTI that are simultaneous with the
Utah State University (USU) daytime lidar measurements would not be
feasible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
