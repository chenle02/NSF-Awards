Chemical and mechanical engineering students at Cooper Union are involved in an
interdisciplinary laser laboratory where they learn fundamental and practical
aspects of laser interaction with materials involving basic phenomena in
chemical and mechanical engineering. The laboratory experiments involve a
medical laser to investigate aspects of laser use such as operating room fire
safety. The laser laboratory experiments expose engineering undergraduates to
seemingly unrelated fields, such as laser surgery, combustion science,
anesthetic practice, and materials engineering. In addition to biomedical
applications, the laboratory experiments demonstrate basic principles of fluid
mechanics, thermodynamics, heat and mass transfer, chemical kinetics, physical
chemistry, and combustion. In addition to the medical laser, other equipment
used in the experiments include a flow control center, a video system, and a
computer system for data acquisition and control.
