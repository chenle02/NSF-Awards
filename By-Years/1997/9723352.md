Kim, Sung-Hou 9723352 The goal of this research is to develop a computational
method for predicting the folding class for any protein sequence without a
clearly identified function or significant homology to known sequences. This
approach would provide an alternative and complementary scheme to sequence
homology based methods for a solution to the inverse protein folding problem.
This computational method will be used on a large scale as automatic software of
high accuracy for the prediction of the folding class for new genomic sequences,
generated by human and microbial genome projects.
