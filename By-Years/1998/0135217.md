This project will investigate genome structure and its evolution in rotifers of
the Class Bdelloidea, an extraordinary group of invertebrate animals that
appears to have evolved for tens of millions of years without sexual
reproduction. In particular, the project will: (i) initiate the basic
characterization of bdelloid genomes; (ii) examine specific genes for the
occurrence of genetic recombination within a bdelloid genome; (iii) determine
the genomic consequences of long-term ameiotic evolution; and (iv) possibly
discover novel features of bdelloid genomes that might provide insight into what
has allowed bdelloid rotifers to evolve successfully without genetic exchange,
and, correspondingly, what causes most other populations of animals and plants
that become asexual to suffer early extinction - a long-standing fundamental
problem in biology.
