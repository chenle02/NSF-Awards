University of California, Davis The objective of this study is to identify the
factors which assist in the development of entrepreneurship in rural areas of
Hungary and those which act as constraints. Gender differences, in particular,
will be assessed. Gender differences in types of small businesses and in
enterprise survival rates will also be examined as will the impact of
entrepreneurial activity on gender roles and relations. A range of field methods
will be used. Questionnaire surveys of individual male and female entrepreneurs
in 19 western Hungarian border villages and 11 border villages in southeast
Hungary will be undertaken. This information will be supplemented by life
histories of women entrepreneurs in each study area, focus groups with sections
of the rural population, and workshops in the villages for feedback of results
and discussion. The research addresses the important issue of mechanisms for
development in transitional economies as well as the role of women in
development.
