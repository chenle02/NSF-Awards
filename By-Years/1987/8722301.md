The Hawaii Institute of Geophysics at the University of Hawaii will acquire
several items of oceanographic instrumentation to be placed in a pool of shared
use equipment. This equipment is maintained for use on or in association with
the research vessels the institution operates. A substantial part of the ships'
operating schedule during 1988 is in support of NSF-sponsored research projects.
The instrumentation will also increase the capabilities of the ships and of the
institution to support research and engineering activities. The instrumentation
includes: -A data logging and analysis computer system for increasing multi-
user sea-going computing capabilities, -Rosette plates for upgrading the frame
to which water sampling bottles are attached and thus increasing flexibility for
collecting discrete seawater samples at specific ocean depths, -a
transmissometer for measuring light attenuation in the water column, from which
information may be derived about quantity and types of suspended particles in
the water, -rock thin-section equipment for preparing samples of rocks collected
from the sea floor for petrological investigations, and -a flatbed plotter for
making bathymetric and other maps of the seafloor. The University of Hawaii is
providing considerable cost sharing for acquiring this equipment. The
instrumentation described above will increase the capability of the Institution
to support NSF-sponsored research and engineering projects.
