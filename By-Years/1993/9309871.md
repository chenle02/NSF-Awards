9309871 ARLEN This project will conduct the first economic analysis of the
impact of criminal sanctions on corporations' expenditures on crime prevention
and detection ("enforcement"). Corporate enforcement costs warrant consideration
because a central goal of corporate criminal sanctions is to deter criminal
activity by inducing corporations to spend resources on preventing employee
crime. The first section of the project will consider the current trend in
sentencing reform towards increased criminal fines for corporate offenders, and
the validity of the conventional wisdom that higher criminal fines increase
corporations' willingness to spend resources to prevent their employees from
committing crimes. The project then will determine what magnitude of corporate
criminal fine induces corporations to spend the efficient amount of resources on
crime prevention and detection under the current regime of strict vicarious
corporate liability. This project can be expected to yield important insights
because its focus on corporate enforcement expenditures forces recognition, for
the first time, of corporations' conflicting incentives. On the one hand,
criminal liability increases a corporation's incentives to spend resources on
crime detection because these expenditures deter employees from committing
crimes; on the other hand, corporations recognize that their enforcement efforts
may increase the probability that their agents' crimes will be detected, thereby
increasing the probability that the corporation itself will be subject to
criminal liability. The Principal Investigator will employ mathematical
modelling techniques. ***
