Professor Baumgartner will work in combinatorial set theory, on problems of
particular relevance to the theory of forcing and generic sets. Areas of
research include combinatorial partition theorems, new notions of "freeness" of
set-mappings associated with cardinality computations for closed unbounded
subsets (involving also new varieties of box-principles), the structure theory
of proper, omega-one-semi-proper and Axiom A partial orderings, generalizations
of Martin's Axiom, and the cardinal sequences of superatomic Boolean algebras.
These topics are in the foundations of set theory and their study will shed
light on the most fundamental building blocks in mathematics.
