9320387 Prober This funding supports a program to investigate a new type of
detector for the frequency range from 600 GHz to 3000 GHz. The device utilizes a
small superconducting microbridge biased at its transition temperature as a
thermal heterodyne mixer. Analysis of the concept predicts that the device
should have an intermediate frequency bandwidth of 1 to 4 GHz. Response at large
intermediate frequencies is expected by the rapid diffusion of hot electrons
from the microbridge. ***
