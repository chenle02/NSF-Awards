Today, a significant fraction of computer time and power is spent moving data
through the memory sub-system of the computer rather than performing the actual
computation. This is especially true in scientific, large-scale, and data-
intensive computations. Large-scale computing systems are continuing to grow in
size and understanding the cost of this data movement will be of fundamental
importance on future Extreme scale system, in which energy and power will be
primary concerns, and where the complexity and depth of the memory sub-system
will heavily penalize inefficient data movement. But capturing and understanding
the details of data movement in a large-scale scientific application can be a
challenging problem. Therefore to improve data movement and hence improve
applications efficiency (both performance and power), new methodologies are
needed to capture, analyze, and optimize data-movement across all the layers of
the computer?s hardware/software stack.&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses this
need by researching and developing software tools to capture data movement from
large-scale applications, and then to present this information in a manner that
is easy to analyze and understand by connecting the information to the program
via a characterization of data objects. The tools use binary analysis and
instrumentation, a technique that can automate the identification of data
objects within an application. By observing data objects, their access patterns,
and data movement information, scientists and application developers can analyze
and optimize their applications to increase performance and energy efficiency of
large-scale applications and systems.&lt;br/&gt;The data-centric view promoted
by this project enables models and methodologies for characterizing and
predicting performance on future architectures, as those sought for extreme
scale systems. The data-centric view of performance and energy efficiency is
orthogonal to the traditional instructions-centric view. This new data-centric
view will inspire new algorithms and systems, co-designed in a way that is
particularly relevant to the scientific computing community.
