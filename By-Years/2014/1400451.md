To address the need for more high-skilled Information Technology (IT)
technicians in a six-county area district, Spokane Falls Community College
(SFCC) is partnering with local school districts, community organizations,
industry partners, the Spokane Workforce Consortium, and the Washington Center
of Excellence for Information and Computing Technology. The project adjusts
incoming students', enrolled students', and local employers' perceptions of IT
technicians' ideal genders, skill sets, and degrees. The major activities are:
(1) Offering IT summer camps for middle school girls, and professional
development workshops for middle school teachers and counselors; (2) Teaching
sections of science classes from the perspective of IT, and starting a chapter
of American Women in Computing (AWS) on campus; and (3) Partnering with local
employers to develop streamlined education-to-employment programs. The project
increases the knowledge base of how to recruit and retain female students, and
how to quickly make them post K-12 ready. It creates a curriculum that
demonstrates interdependency between technology and science, and it develops
procedures for establishing robust job shadowing and internship programs. The
best practices established through this project can be extended to other STEM
disciplines and technician training programs. Through a partnership with the
Washington Center of Excellence for Information and Computing Technology; the
project results will be available to instructors at all of the 34 community and
technical colleges in that state. Through the ATE Mentor Connect program and the
SC ATE Center, the results will be globally available on the SCATE.org and
TeachingTechnician.org websites.
