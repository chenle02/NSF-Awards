Inverse Problems For Electrical Networks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An electrical
network consisting only of resistors has a definite response to voltages applied
at designated terminals. This response can be computed if the configuration
(topology) of the network and resistances of the resistors are known. The
inverse problems that will be studied are those in which the response is given
and the resistances and/or topology are not known but desired. Planar and non-
planar networks will be studied. In addition, similar problems involving
scattering theory and the Schrodinger equation will be studied. Relations to
continuous inverse problems will be investigated. Eight undergraduates per
summer will work on these problems.
