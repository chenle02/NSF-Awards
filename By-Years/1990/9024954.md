The design, analysis, and implementation of algorithms for the solution of
sparse matrix problems on distributed memory multiprocessors will be
investigated. The development of these parallel sparse matrix algorithms should
have an impact of challenging large-scale computational problems in several
scientific, econometric, and engineering disciplines. The following are among
the problems that will be investigated: o A spectral nested dissection algorithm
for computing good orderings for factoring sparse matrices efficiently in
parallel, o Algorithms for mapping computational subtasks and the given matrix
to the processors in a distributed memory multiprocessor, o The role played by
the clique tree, a data structure for the compact representation of filled
matrices, in several sparse matrix algorithms, and o The design of sparse
orthogonal factorization algorithms for the solution of least-squares problems
on distributed memory multiprocessors.
