This U.S.-Brazil Cooperative Science award will support the collaboration of
John Eyler of the University of Florida and Jose Riveros of the University of
Sao Paulo in Brazil. The project will focus on determining the infrared spectra
and binding energies of negative ions with one or two solvent molecules attached
to them. Both laboratories involved are equipped with mass spectrometric
(Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance) and laser instrumentation. The U.S.
group, which includes two students, has an electrospray ionization source that
will provide an alternative method of forming singly solvated anions, and
probably the only means of forming doubly solvated anions. The US group is also
equipped for two-laser infrared multiple photon dissociation experiments, which
permit infrared spectra of ions to be obtained in previously inaccessible
wavelength regions. The Brazilian side will contribute expertise in forming the
anion solvates by ion/molecule reactions. The collaboration will likely increase
understanding of the effects that the first and second solvent molecule have on
isolated ions, and thus of the transition from "naked" ions in the gas phase to
fully solvated ions in solution.
