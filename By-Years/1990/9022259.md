This Research Opportunity Award funds a project, "Nonlinear Modeling of Power
GaAs MESFET for Distributed Amplifiers" at Morgan State University in support of
the University of California at San Diego's Industry/University Cooperative
Research Center for High Speed Integrated Circuits and Systems. This two-year
project is reporting to the Center's Industry Advisory Board. The research is
studying the design, fabrication and testing of a microwave Power Distributed
Amplifier. The study will involve the development of new models and CAD
programs, as well as the actual amplifier design and test. The approach is new
and unique and should result in a significant advance in the "state of the art."
Morgan State has the facilities and equipment to carry out the research. The
Program Manager recommends that Morgan State University be awarded $100,000 for
two (2) years for this Research Opportunity Award.
