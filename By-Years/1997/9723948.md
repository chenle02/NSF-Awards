Grossniklaus 9723948 The mechanisms controlling the development of the female
gametophyte in plants are largely unknown. Approximately 60 mutants in which the
gametophytic phase of the life cycle has been affected as judged by reduced
fertility and non-mendelian segregation have been identified from over 5,000
lines of insertional mutants of the model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana. Initial
studies indicate that different stages of megagametogenesis are affected in
these lines and it is proposed to dissect the genetic hierarchy controlling
female gametogenesis by analyzing these mutants further at the genetic level
including reversion and transmission analysis, the determination of map position
and the characterization of regulatory interactions with other genes expressed
in the female gametophyte. One mutant will be chosen for an in-depth molecular
and genetic analysis. The structure and sequence of the gene will be determined
as well as its expression at the RNA and protein level. Plants have evolved a
characteristic life strategy with alternating generations and the absence of a
distinct germ line. The plant life cycle alternates between a diploid and a
haploid generation, the sporophyte and the gametophyte. In the sexual organs of
the flower, haploid products of meiosis are produced which mark the beginning of
the gametophytic phase, which eventually results in the development of the
gametophytes. The mechanisms controlling the development of the female
gametophyte are largely unknown and this study will use a combination of
genetic, molecular and cell biological techniques to dissect that pathway. A
detailed knowledge of the genes and molecules controlling female gametogenesis
will provide insights into fundamental morphogenetic mechanisms and cell
differentiation pathways, and open up new possibilities for the manipulation of
the reproductive system harboring great potential for plant breeding and crop
improvement.
