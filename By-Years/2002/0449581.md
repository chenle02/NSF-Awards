The PI and co-PI propose to study how mutations that are beneficial to a species
appear in and spread through experimental and natural populations. First, they
will consider large populations of microbes in which several beneficial
mutations compete with each other to increase in frequency (a process known as
"clonal interference"). Mathematical theory will be developed to analyze how
this clonal interference affects the speed and pattern of adaptation. Second,
the PI and co-PI will study how the past spread of beneficial mutations can be
inferred from present-day samples of DNA sequences from plants and animals.
Mathematical models will be developed to estimate the frequency and strength of
past beneficial mutations from DNA sequence data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
study will significantly improve our understanding of adaptation, one of the
most important- but least understood genetically- of biological processes. In
particular, the population genetic models developed in this work will facilitate
rigorous experimental studies of the genetic basis of adaptation in microbes as
well as in plants and animals. This work will have particular relevance to
attempts to understand adaptation in large microbial species, e.g., the
evolution of antibiotic resistance&lt;br/&gt;
