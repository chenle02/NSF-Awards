The purpose of the proposed grant is to design and lay the necessary groundwork
for major education research projects related to K-12 science and mathematics in
the Delta resgion of Mississippi, Louisiana, and Arkansas. This project provides
the advantage of working within the framework of an established major systemic
reform initiative, The Delta Rural Systemic Inititiative. We will bring together
an interdisciplinary cadre of national and regional researchers, resouce
personnel and practitioners, all working in close collaborat8ion, to develop
partnerships and research designs which will lead to major research initiatives
focused on the underpinnings of systemic changes in regions serving
impoverished, rural populations.
