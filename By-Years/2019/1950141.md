This award supports the renewal of the Research Experiences for Undergraduates
(REU) site hosted by Old Dominion University in partnership with Jefferson
Laboratory. The site provides opportunities to ten undergraduate students each
summer for ten weeks of research on topics in accelerator and nuclear physics.
Students are housed at Jefferson Lab and their research projects are located
there. They are part of a vibrant national laboratory community, which includes
faculty and graduate students from around the world, as well as undergraduates
from other summer programs. Mentors are chosen carefully for each student, based
on their interests, and care is taken to ensure that each project progresses
well over the course of the program. Both accelerator and nuclear physics are
research areas with applications of important societal impact, including in the
areas of medicine, homeland security, and energy production. By exposing
undergraduates to these exciting fields, the program will increase the flow of
talented students into these areas, whether that be a graduate program in
accelerator science, nuclear science, or jobs in industry.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students can choose from experimental and theoretical
projects. They develop their communication skills by presenting a talk in the
eighth week and writing a final paper on their work and presenting a poster on
the last day. There are two scientific/technical/professional development talks
scheduled each week for the undergraduates, in addition to the many other
regular activities at the lab. The students also receive training on technical
writing, and each student will be mentored to present his/her results at a
conference during the academic year following their summer
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
