The Foundation for Glacier and Environmental Research will initiate an eight-
week, residential Young Scholars project in Environmental Earth Science for 10
students entering grade 12. Working on Alaska's Juneau Icefield, North America's
fifth largest icefield, students will be in the field for the entire period in a
seven-day-a-week immersion in on-going and new research projects. Involvement
will continue throughout the academic year via preparation of research papers,
completion of an open book essay exam, presentations at home schools, and
through newsletters and scheduled reunions with participants and staff.
