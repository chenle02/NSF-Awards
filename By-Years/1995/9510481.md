Dr. Lori A. Vermeulen, Chemistry Department, Southern Illinois University, is
supported under a Research Planning Grant for Women Scientists and Engineers by
the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division for the study of supramolecular materials. A new
electrochemical reduction of silicon and germanium chlorides will be developed
as a route to the preparation of silicon and germanium based polymers. This
technique will permit the preparation of polymers with well defined cross
linking and with controlled structural and photophysical properties.
Additionally, layered metal phosphonate thin films with organized donor/acceptor
multilayers will be prepared and studied as potential solar energy conversion
and storage devices. The development of new materials for energy storage and
conversion systems, non-linear optical devices, and molecular electronic devices
demands substances in which the constituent atoms are well defined and ordered
in specific ways. In this project new techniques will be devised for
synthesizing polymers in which chains of silicon and/or germanium atoms form
specific three dimensional networks. Further, techniques of preparing thin films
composed of layers of metal and non-metal atoms will be developed. Both of these
new materials will have important energy conversion or optical properties.
