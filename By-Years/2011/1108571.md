This project examines education and community viability in Western Alaska by
identifying a cross-section of youth and young adults across the Bering Sea
region who have pursued post-secondary educational opportunities facilitated by
the Community Development Quota (CDQ) program. The overarching research question
is: Do opportunities in post-secondary education for youth contribute to the
viability of Bering Sea communities and way of life? ?Viability? is defined by
the degree to which a community can balance in- and out-migration, sustain a
context of livelihood diversification, and create bridges to resources external
to the community. In this project, the investigators propose to administer a
survey to a random sample of scholarship and training grant recipients who
received their awards between 2000 and 2005, conduct focused group interviews
with current students, and develop regional profiles to understand if and how
post-secondary educational opportunities affect Alaska?s rural youth and their
communities.

The investigators anticipate the project as designed will help identify the most
effective strategies and pathways to success youth in Western Alaska coastal
communities have employed and the ways in which this success may benefit their
home communities. Specifically, the research is aimed to uncover the contexts in
which Alaska youth can assume leadership, citizenship, and stewardship community
roles in the future. By examining the context of how educational opportunities
bridge Bering Sea youth and young adults with external resources or those
beneficial to community viability, this research will help elucidate the ways in
which the kinds of educational experiences the CDQ program provides is important
not only for rural Alaska, but how the CDQ model might potentially have wider
arctic or global applicability in other regions where there is large scale
resource development juxtaposed to rural communities struggling with economic
development.
