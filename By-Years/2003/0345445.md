0345445&lt;br/&gt;Tsoflias&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports acquisition
of a ground penetrating radar (GPR) system equipped with multiple surface and
borehole antennas operating in the 12.5 to 200 MHz frequency range. The PI,
Georgios Tsoflias, is an early career investigator (Ph.D. '99) who was recently
hired by the University of Kansas. Tsoflias will use the GPR system for
subsurface characterization of the anisotropy of fluid flow in fractured
carbonate and clastic aquifers and in planned collaborations with colleague Don
Steeples for coincident full wavefield GPR and seismic imaging of near-surface
dielectric and acoustic interfaces. The GPR system will also support
collaborations with other departmental and regional colleagues for structural
and paleoseismological investigations of the subsurface and will be used to
train undergraduate and graduate students in electromagnetic field techniques
and theory.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
