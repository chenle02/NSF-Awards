9315177 Osburn This award of $180,000 is for curriculum development in
microsensor and biosensor engineering. The goal is to bring together teams of
researchers from two existing engineering research centers to develop academic
courses in microsensor and biosensor engineering. Two semester-length courses
will be developed by a curriculum committee of academic researchers, assisted by
an advisory committee with broad interdisciplinary scientific specialties. In
order to broaden their impact, disseminated of the courses to universities in
North Carolina will be effected using the state- wide video network. The courses
will be accompanied by a new textbook and a series of laboratory experiments.
