This award provides three years of funding to help defray the expenses of
participants in the "New Mexico Analysis Seminar 2014-2016," the next meeting of
which will take place April 5-6, 2014, on the campus of the University of New
Mexico.

The New Mexico Analysis Seminar is an annual regional conference serving the US
Southwest that alternates venues between the University of New Mexico and New
Mexico State University. The themes of the meetings scheduled for the period
covered by this award are the following: harmonic analysis and spectral theory,
with principal lecturer Sasha Volberg and with a special afternoon session
honoring the contributions of Cora Sadosky to the discipline and featuring talks
by Jill Pipher, Sergei Treil, and Svitlana Mayboroda (2014, Albuquerque);
dispersive partial differential equations, with principal lecturer Monica Visan
(2015, Las Cruces); partial differential equations and harmonic analysis, with
principal lecturer Chris Sogge (2016, Albuquerque). The conference format
provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young
scientists to present their work.
