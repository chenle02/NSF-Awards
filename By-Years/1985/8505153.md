The fundamental problem known as clutter exists in nearly all ultrasound imaging
and detection applications and cannot be eliminated by conventional noise
reduction techniques such as time averaging or filtering. However, a non-linear
minimization algorithm utilizing a frequency decorrelation technique, which
achieves significant clutter suppression in one-dimensional ultrasonic
applications, was recently developed. The objectives of this research effort are
to develop a two-dimensional ultrasonic imaging system utilizing non-linear
clutter rejection concepts; to develop and refine the theory for the two-
dimensional minimization algorithm and split-spectrum processing; and to
experimentally verify the theory and evaluate the imaging system in both
clinical and materials applications. Since improved imaging in clutter has
significant ramifications in both materials and medical imaging, the successful
completion of this research can have significant impact on the solution of a
fundamental problem in ultrasonic imaging.
