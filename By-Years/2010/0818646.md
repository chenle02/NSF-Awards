&lt;br/&gt;Legumes (family Fabaceae) are a major source of protein and vegetable
oil for animal and human nutrition. Recent years have seen an explosion of
genomic and genetic resources for a variety of legume plants including but not
limited to Medicago truncatula, Glycine max, Lotus japonicus, and Phaseolus
vulgaris. These advancements set the stage for efforts to coordinate legume
genetics and genomics to insure future progress and, more importantly, to
transition basic discoveries into practical applications. The International
Conferences on Legume Genomics and Genetics (ICLGG) were established in 2002 to
reflect the growing development of legume genomics and genetics. This effort was
driven in part by the adoption of the model legumes, Medicago truncatula and
Lotus japonicus. A major impetus was the desire on the part of model legume
researchers to see their discoveries translated into practical advances in crop
legumes. A key element of these meetings from the beginning was the inclusion of
plant breeders and agronomists, alongside researchers focused more on basic
research. To encourage the participation of junior scientists, the Conference
defrays the cost of attendance for a number of graduate students and
postdoctoral associates to present their work and to otherwise participate in
the 4th ICLGG. The funding provided by NSF will be used to support the
participation of junior scientists from the US scientific community.
