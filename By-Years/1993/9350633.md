A new experiment illustrating synthesis, bonding, and structure is proposed for
the general chemistry laboratory. This experiment will take advantage of modern
instrumental methods of structural determination to present these concepts at a
level appropriate for freshmen. Students will run a series of microscale
reactions on vanillin, involving oxidation and reduction of the aldehyde,
bromination of the aromatic ring, and esterification of the phenol. Both
reactants and products will be analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry
and infrared spectrophotometry. This experiment would serve every student in the
freshman class by affording a more balanced view of chemistry and providing an
alternative entry point into the chemistry major.
