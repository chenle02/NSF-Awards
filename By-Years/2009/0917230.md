A Resource-Scalable Unifying Framework for Aural Signal Coding

The objective of this project is to achieve a comprehensive, unifying framework
and corresponding universal methodologies for the coding of aural signals. The
challenges are due to the combination of elusive perceptual criteria, complex
signal structures, and great diversity in signal type, operational setting,
complexity and delay requirements. Historical efforts were tailored to narrowly
defined signal types and scenarios, such as linear prediction for low rate
speech communication versus transform-based music coding for storage and
streaming. However, there is a growing realization of their insufficiency to
handle the heterogeneous aural signals and network settings encountered in many
real-world applications, as evidenced in particular by recent major initiatives
of the multimedia and networking industries demanding joint speech-audio coding
standardization.

The research formalizes the tradeoffs that underly universal aural signal
coding, and develops a unifying framework and methodologies to enable efficient
optimization of resource-scalable coding under heterogeneous signal and network
setting scenarios. The main thrusts of the project are: i) Development of a
unifying resource-scalable framework coupled with effective perceptual
distortion criteria, which covers the continuous gamut of aural signal types and
networking scenarios, and is scalable in bit rate, encoding/decoding complexity
and delay, etc.; ii) Theoretical analysis of rate-(perceptual) distortion
performance limits within such unified compression paradigms; iii) A new class
of universal methodologies and effective optimization algorithms for efficient
coder design and various resource allocation within this unifying framework.
