The primary objective of this U.S.-Hungary cooperative research project between
Dr. Howard Bryant of the University of New Mexico and Dr. Janos Bergou of the
Central Research Institute for Physics, Budapest, is to apply novel experimental
methods to explore the details of photoionization processes in the simple atom
H-. Work will concentrate on four specific-topics of interest in photo-atom
interactions and collision physics: (1) photodetachment of H- near threshold in
an energy field; (2) two electron photoionization (3) production of highly
excited Ryberg states; and (4) multiphoton ionization of H-. Results of these
collaborative efforts would extend fundamental knowledge of three-body (atom)
dynamics in the presence of external fields, thereby contributing to our
understanding of the principles that govern atomic structure. This project in
theoretical physics fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific
knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to
combine complementary talents and pool research resources in areas of strong
mutual interest and competence.
