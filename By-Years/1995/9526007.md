9526007 Phillips The goal of this research is to develop cost models that can be
used in both commercial and defense manufacturing activities to assess and
evaluate the cost impact of technological innovation and/or design changes on
the product life cycle. The cost of design, process modification, quality,
maintainability, and disposal are included in this concept. A standard set of
topological cost models for cost-driver activities will be derived accessing a
set of relational data base files containing time, cost, and resource
requirements. Utilizing the principles of activity based costing and a knowledge
base including all cross-impact and linking cost relationships, a life cycle
cost for technological innovation and design changes for both "as-is" and "to-
be" scenarios will be calculated. Risk analysis, sensitivity analysis of key
cost drivers, and the cost of quality will be included. Three industrial
partners will collaborate in this research. This research may effect a uniform
life cycle cost model using a realistic and acceptable allocation of both direct
and indirect costs and component models with standardized topology. The results
would provoke a dramatic improvement in the ability of manufacturing firms to
estimate the cost of design changes and technological innovation.
