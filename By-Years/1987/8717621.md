Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is a technique that uses
absorption of infrared energy to probe molecular structure. The acquisition of
an FTIR spectrophotometer is crucial for enhancing the research environment of
the modern chemistry department. In the Department of Chemistry at the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the FTIR instrument will be part of
a facility containing FTIR and Raman instrumentation and will enhance front-line
chemical research in the following areas: 1) Low temperature Infrared
Spectroscopy of gas phase, diffusion trapped molecules. 2) Vibrational studies
of ligand coupling reactions. 3) Peptide and protein synthesis. 4) In situ
vibrational spectroelectrochemistry of electroactive films and of functioning
solid state electrochemical cells.
