Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will focus on connecting
superstring theory with the observable structure of low energy physics,
including the quark and lepton masses, rare decays, and supersymmetry.
Cosmological constraints on superstring theories will also be considered.
Superstring theory is a very exciting candidate for the theory that describes
all of the fundamental forces, including gravity. Thus, studies which connect
this theory to experimentally observed structure are very important.
