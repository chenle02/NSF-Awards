This project establishes a physiology and neuroscience center for use in a
variety of classes. Class designs stress an investigative approach: experimental
design and data generation in small groups followed by class comparison,
discussion, and compilation of data. Equipment includes: the MacLab Virtual
Instrument System interfaced between Thornton Physiological Systems, and
Macintosh Classic II computers. Elementary and sophisticated neurophysiological,
neurochemical, and neuroanatomical computer simulations are used as
introductions to actual experiments in laboratory classes and offer students in
non-major classes, and in beginning and advanced level neuroscience-related
classes, opportunities to explore simulated interactive experiments.
