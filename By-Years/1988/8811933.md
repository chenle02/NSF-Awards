Flat-plate is one of the most widely used forms of construction among the low-
to-medium-rise residential or office buildings. Recent earthquakes such as the
Armenian (1988) and Mexican (1985) earthquakes have proven the susceptibility of
such buildings to severe damage. In situations where an independent lateral load
resisting system is not present or is rendered ineffective, the survival of such
buildings in the event of an earthquake depends entirely on the performance of
slab-to- column connections. The use of high strength concrete and fiber
reinforced concrete in the connection region or the addition of shear caps can
possibly improve the shear strength of slab-column connections without resorting
to other relatively more expensive alternatives. Eight one-half scale two-bay
flat- plate subassemblies will be tested under simulated earthquake- type
loading to investigate the promise of such alternatives in improving the seismic
resistance of flat-plate buildings. This study should provide the basis for
improved safety of flat-plate buildings to include the use of high strength and
fiber reinforced concrete and for further improvements in analytical modelling
of the unbalanced moment transfer mechanism at the slab-column connections.
