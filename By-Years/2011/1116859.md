This project explores the design of green cellular network architectures and
algorithms to reduce energy consumption. A major consumer of energy in cellular
networks is the operation of the base stations. Most base stations are deployed
and operated continuously based on peak traffic estimates. Intuitively, it saves
energy to judiciously "scale back" un-utilized and under-utilized base stations
during off-peak times. The remaining base stations must adapt accordingly so
that the required coverage is maintained.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs propose a
dynamically adaptive cellular network where the cell size and capacity of the
base stations are dynamically reconfigured based on the current user locations
and Quality of Service (QoS) demands of the applications. Modeling of the
network power consumption based on the network topography, followed by
optimization of the topography is the key to this problem. The project will
involve student participation at all stages through suitably designed projects.
The results of the research will be disseminated through professional journals
and conference proceedings and also through industry forums and workshops.
Furthermore, the project addresses one of the most pressing issues of today,
namely, reducing the carbon footprint of the cellular network. Radical new
designs for the network have the potential to spur economic development, create
jobs and forge stronger communities.
