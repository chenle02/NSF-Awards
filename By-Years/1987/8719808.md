This proposal requests funds to obtain a 500 MHz NMR. The projects proposed
cover both biological and chemical disciplines. Those of relevance to biology
include studies of the structure and function of several metallothioneins,
bleomycin and its derivatives and biologically relevant gold complexes. The
chemical research projects deal with pillared layer oxides, hydrogen bronzes,
zeolites and the synthesis and characterization of several classes of akaloids.
