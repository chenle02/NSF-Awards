ARI-MA: Improved Radiochemical Separations for Actinide Forensic Signatures

The objective of this research is to improve methods used for actinide forensic
signatures. Advances are needed, as the current approaches are laborious and
slow. In addition, educational opportunities are needed to develop a pipeline of
prospective radioanalytical chemists. Capillary electrophoresis (CE) offers the
opportunity to develop rapid, improved actinide separations. The approach is to
apply CE to rapidly: separate the trivalent lanthanides from the trivalent
actinides, separate actinides by oxidation state, and pre-concentrate
lanthanides and actinides. Microchip methods will also be explored, and
educational activities in radioanalytical chemistry and nuclear forensics will
be integrated into the research project. The intellectual merit of the proposed
research is that the project will provide a foundation for our understanding of
actinide solution chemistry and its potential role in microscale actinide
separations. Soft-donor ligands and mixed water polar organic solvents will be
explored. A broader knowledge of actinide solution chemistry is essential for
translation from laboratorybased CE methods to separations that can be conducted
on a microchip. The broader impacts of this project will address two critical
issues. First, law enforcement, federal, and international agencies who are
responsible for oversight in nuclear proliferation need improved methods for
attribution that can be deployed in both the laboratory and field settings. In
addition, the dearth of personnel educated in radioanalytical chemistry and
actinide chemistry, is well documented. Successful completion of this project
will address both of these needs
