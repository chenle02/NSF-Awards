This grant supports the determination of optimum parameters for a digital
stellar spectral atlas extending in wavelength to 1 micron, similar in its goals
to the highly used Morgan-Keenan atlas. The spectra are to be planned for
observation at the investigators' observatory using an 0.9 meter telescope.
Stars have traditionally been observed in the optical range of wavelengths. One
highly used astronomical tool is an atlas of stellar spectra named "MK" after
its creators, Morgan and Keenan. The "MK spectral type" is part of the routine
designation of most stars. However, for many stars, most radiation occurs in the
infrared range. The capability to investigate stars in the infrared is
relatively new. The investigators aim to produce a catalogue equivalent to the
MK catalogue, but extending into the infrared. The work under this Research
Opportunities for Women Planning Grant is to determine the observational
requirements that will make such a catalogue the most useful.
