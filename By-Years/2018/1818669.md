The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP)
through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and
study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the
preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue
science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or
careers. The project at Bowie State University seeks to to integrate the
advancement of big data technologies and analytics into the areas of Computer
Science and Information Systems as well as apply big data and analytics to the
disciplines of Economics, Biology, Chemistry and others. The activities and
strategies are evidence-based and a strong plan for formative and summative
evaluation is part of the project. Undergraduate students are included in the
project and will be provided with summer research opportunities.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has the objectives to: develop data science
and analytics (DSA) course modules and deliver them in the disciplines of
Chemistry, Biology, Computer Science, Information Systems, and Economics; create
new courses and integrate the DSA modules into existing courses that will lead
to an undergraduate certificate in DSA; offer undergraduate research
opportunities; and establish a faculty training and learning community. This
project will impact over 700 students per semester and several faculty.
Opportunity are provided for minorities in STEM fields to address social and
scientific issues impacting minority communities locally, nationally, and
globally using big data and analytics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
