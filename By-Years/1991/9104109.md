We shall investigate the effects of surface vibrations and hydrogen-metal
coupling on the quantum tunneling diffusion of atomic hydrogen and deuterium on
nickel and platinum in the temp- erature range 30K to 200K. We shall also
explore the coherence of the tunneling motion through its dependence on
adsorbate coverages and surface-impurity concentrations. A newly developed
linear optical diffraction technique of very large dynamic range will be
employed. %%% The research is intended to advance our understanding of the
physics of surfaces and of quantum-mechanical effects in condensed matter.
