Equipment is being purchased for use in constructing a versatile flow apparatus
which allows the measurement of densities, heat capacities and total enthalpies
of pure compounds and densities and heats of mixing of multicomponent mixtures
over a temperature range from 200 K to 750 K and up to pressures of 700 bar. The
fluids studied include carbon dioxide with carbon monoxide, methane, nitrogen,
hydrogen sulphide and ethane in the temperature range 200 to 350 K and pressure
range 20 to 300 bar. Densities, heat capacities and enthalpies of a variety of
complex organic compounds such as quinoline, tetralin, o-cresol and pyridine
over a temperature range 350 to 650 K and up to 700 bar are measured. The
densities and heats of mixing of selected multicomponent mixtures are also
determined. Measurements are also made on fluid mixtures in the region where
supercritical extraction is of importance.
