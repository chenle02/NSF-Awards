9423578 Cronin This is a proposal by an Professor James Cronin of the physics
department of the University of Chicago for partial support of a workshop at
Fermilab to design a Giant Airshower Array to look for the very highest energy
cosmic rays. The workshop will take place from Jan 30 to July 31, 1995. The
objective of the design group is to determine the technology to be used in the
detector and to prepare a sufficiently mature design so that a proposal can be
prepared for funding the construction of the detector. ***
