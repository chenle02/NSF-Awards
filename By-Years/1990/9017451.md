This grant is for continuation of ongoing laboratory experimental measurements
of a variety of double layer properties. The emphasis of these investigations
will continue to be to better understand unmagnetized "stairstep" double layers,
double layers with axial magnetic fields, oblique double layers, and wall double
layer-sheaths. These studies are important because satellite and earth based
data provide an incomplete picture of the structures which accelerate auroral
electrons.
