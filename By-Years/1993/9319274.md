9319274 Gajewski Thermally induced reactions involving 1, 1-, 1, 3-, and 3,
3-sigmatropic shifts, polar solvent effects, and additions to aldehydes will be
studied. Stereochemistry, deuterium kinetic isotope effects, and temperature
dependence will be used to probe the course of these reactions. The 1, 3-shift
study will focus on the vinylcyclopropane rearrangement, isomerizations of
alpha-pinene, alkoxy-substituted vinycyclopropane and vinylcyclobutanes, and the
methylenecyclopropane degenerate rearrangement. The 3, 3- shift studies will
focus on heteroatom substituted 1,5- dienes and the 1, 1-shift studies will
pursue the extent of double bond rotation in the geometric isomerization of
trans-1,2-dideuteriospiropentane. Further development of a multi-parameter
equation to correlate solvolysis rates, Claisen rearrangements, and Diels-Alder
reactions will be pursued. Nucleophilic additions to aldehydes will be studied
by means of deuterium isotope effects in order to determine the amount of bond
formation in the transition state. %%% This grant from the Organic Dynamics
Program supports the continuing work of Professor Joseph J. Gajewski at Indiana
University. The results of this research will provide fundamental understanding
about the reaction paths that are selected in the thermal rearrangement of
organic molecules. This is an important topic, since such thermal rearrangements
find applications in various areas from processing of petroleum to synthesis of
organic molecules. The intricacies of these reactions will be probed by using
deuterium labeled compounds and the unique three-dimensional structure of
selected molecules. The effect of solvent on rates of reactions and additions to
carbon-oxygen double bonds will be explored as well. ***
