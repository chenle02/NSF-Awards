This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project will develop a
vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL) that operates at 1.3 micron
wavelength based on incorporating a quantum dot active region of GaAs-based InAs
and GaAsSb. It is based on recent research developments within the university
laboratory in developing novel 1.3 micron laser and VCSEL sources, and the
commercial epitaxial growth capability of the company. In the project the tasks
involved include growing GaAsSb quantum dots and quantum well structures,
fabricating VCSELs using the InGaAs and GaAsSb based quantum dot and GaAsSb
quantum well active regions, and development, demonstration and evaluation of
manufacturable, high Q cavity suitable for commercial 1.3 micron
VCSELs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commercially the project will lead to important new
products for an emerging fiber optic market. The low cost 1.3 micron wavelength
VCSEL is viewed by industry analysts as a key enabling device for high volume
production of fiber optic transceivers for the metro and metro access markets.
