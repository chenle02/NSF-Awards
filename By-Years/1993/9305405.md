9305405 Clarke Precise three-dimensional structures allow proteins to carry out
their architectural, catalytic, and signalling roles. However, a number of
spontaneous processes occur under physiological conditions, including oxidation,
glycation, isomerization, racemization, deamidation, and cleavage reactions,
that lead to changes in structure that can alter protein function. Asparaginyl
and aspartyl residues represent two of the major sites for such reactions, where
intramolecular reactions can result in the generation of L- and D-isoaspartyl
and D-aspartyl derivatives, as well as peptide bond cleavage. These studies are
aimed at furthering our understanding of the factors that determine the
susceptibility of specific aspartyl and asparaginyl residues in specific
proteins to these non-enzymatic reactions. %%% Spontaneous reactions which occur
after formation of proteins can have significant effects on function and
biological half-life. The studies proposed here investigate the mechanism of
several spontaneous processes which alter the half-life of hemoglobin. ***
