This project is focused on the interface of probability theory and statistical
mechanics. The activity aims at investigating the evolution of systems with
complex interactions, such as particles moving in a disordered environment, cars
navigating their way through traffic, the surface of a growing crystal, or the
boundary of an infected tissue. Complexity is captured by the randomness in the
model, both in the environment in which the particles interact or the crystal
grows, and in the interaction or growth process itself. The aim of the project
is to develop the mathematical laws that govern such systems. To have a simple
example in mind, one can think of how the fraction of heads in a large number of
tosses of a coin will converge to the probability of getting heads in one toss.
Besides its impact on probability theory and mathematics in general, the project
will have a direct impact on the understanding of many physical systems
involving motion in random or disordered media. Understanding complex
interactions has wide implications for science and engineering and thereby for
society. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate
students and postdoctoral associates.

This research is on the subject of random motion in random media. In his recent
work, the PI has focused on the study of random polymer models, both in positive
and zero temperature. The overarching theme was establishing energy-entropy
duality, producing solutions to these variational formulas in terms of Busemann
functions, then using these solutions to describe the large-volume systems. The
PI already constructed the Busemann functions in a variety of models and used
them to analyze infinite geodesics (or Gibbs measures, in the positive
temperature case), establish one-force one-solution principles, and study the
stability and instability of the related dynamical systems. In this project, the
PI will work on extending these results to a quite general setting that will
cover zero and positive temperature, directed and undirected, discrete and
continuous, as well as higher-dimensional models. The PI will also develop
methods to use Busemann functions to study the regularity of the limiting shape
function, prove localization, study the size of the polymer and shape
fluctuations, and, for random walk in random environment, describe the structure
of the Martin boundary.
