A request is made to fund Oceanographic Instrumentation for the Research Vessel
Savannah, a 92-foot coastal research vessel, owned and operated by Skidaway
Institute of Oceanography as part of the University-National Oceanographic
Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet. With this proposal, Skidaway provides
technical descriptions and rationale for the acquisition of the following
Oceanographic Instrumentation: Vertical Profiling CTD/Fluorometer Upgrades
$24,347 Network and DAS Upgrades $6,813 TSG Upgrade $12,812 Deck Incubators
$5,513 $49,485

Broader Impacts The principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit
Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides
infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use
instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects
(which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of
NSF). The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation
allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working,
calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research,
and expanding the base of potential researchers.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
