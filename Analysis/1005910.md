Nipissing University will offer a Workshop on Recent Advances in Topological and
Measure-Theoretic Methods in Dynamical Systems in order to bring researchers and
students in these areas together for a five-day series of talks and seminars.
The workshop will be jointly supported by the US National Science Foundation and
the Fields Institute of Canada, and will be held at Nipissing?s campus in North
Bay, Ontario, Canada, May 17-22, 2010. The scientific focus of the workshop will
be on recent developments in topological and measure-theoretic methods in
dynamical systems. Senior researchers will share fundamental research
techniques, and recent results, in the areas of focus with attendees, including
graduate students, post-doctoral students, and researchers that have recently
received the PhD. James Yorke (U. of Maryland), Mariusz Urbanski (North Texas
State U.), Michael Yampolsky (U. of Toronto), and Vladimir Pestov (U. of Ottawa)
art among the principal speakers. Topics include topological and measure-
theoretic properties of attractors, basin boundaries, and Julia sets of rational
and entire maps, minimal maps on manifolds, and dynamics of infinite-dimensional
groups.

The mathematics research fields of dynamical systems, topology, and measure
theory have long had significant areas of overlap, and a continuing tradition of
researchers working across these fields, and borrowing tools from each other.
Over the last 25 years, there have been many developments that have increased
the interaction among topology, dynamical systems, and measure theory. NSF
support will be used to enable at least 10 US-based students and recent PhDs to
attend the workshop. The workshop will provide the opportunity for recently
trained professional mathematicians and students to prepare for research in
areas in which current developments are moving rapidly at the intersection point
of topology, measure theory, and dynamical systems. Major speakers with
international reputations have been selected who are active in these research
areas.

This project is jointly funded by the Topology Program and the Analysis Program.
