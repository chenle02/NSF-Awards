Artificial neural networks (ANN's) are a rich and interesting class of
nonlinear models developed recently by cognitive scientists. Although inspired
by certain features of the neural architecture of the brain, these models have
considerable potential for use in econometrics and economics because of their
simplicity and great flexibility. Specifically, ANN models show promise as the
basis for nonparmetric estimation and for specification testing because of their
ability to approximate arbitrary elements of general function spaces to
arbitrary accuracy. Under previous NSF grants, this project focused on
establishing the mathematical and statistical foundations necessary for using
ANN models in nonparametric estimation and specification testing. The research
proposed in this accomplishment based renewal is to continue development of
these foundations, to establish properties of ANN- based nonparametric
estimators, and to apply the resulting theory to construct model specification
tests. The areas in which mathematical and statistical theory will be pursued
are two. The first area is the establishment of degree of approximation results
for ANN models in Sobolev spaces. The second area is to obtain central limit
theorems and invariance principles for random elements constructed as partial
sums of a dependent process (specifically, a mixingale process) in a Hilbert
space. The application areas make direct use of the proposed theoretical results
to model learning by economic agents.
