9309754 Shield As laminated fiber composite structural elements become more
popular, their mechanical properties need to be efficiently modeled; in
particular, that there be a complete understanding of their buckling and
postbuckling behavior. The work will plan for a study focused on the development
of methods for analyzing the local, Euler, and flexural-torsional modes of
buckling in laminated composite beams of open and closed cross section. The
effects of shear deformation will be accounted for. The methods will be
developed for beams whose cross-sectional elements consist of rectangular
laminated plates with varying degrees of anisotropy.
