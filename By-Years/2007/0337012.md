In the proposed research, the nature and rates of diffusion of water dissolved
within several mantle minerals (olivine, orthopyroxene, and magnesiowustite)
will be investigated as well as the effects of dissolved water on chemical
kinetics. In particular, it is planned to: 1) extend previous work correlating
O-H bands in the infrared spectra of olivine and forsterite with hydrogen-
intrinsic defect associates and investigate the rates of diffusion of these
associates to gain insight into diffusion rates for silicon and magnesium defect
species; 2) characterize the nature of hydrous defects in orthopyroxene and
investigate rates of incorporation of hydrogen-intrinsic defect associates; 3)
investigate the effects of hydrous defects in magnesiowustite on the
interdiffusion of iron and magnesium. This research extends on past
contributions by the PI in understanding the relations between microscale
defects in minerals and their bulk behavior. It is particularly timely given the
strong current emphasis in this area of study. The results of this work will
improve our knowledge of defects in minerals and the role of dissolved water in
defining internal defect structure in the major mantle minerals. These
investigations will also extend our understanding of the nature and dynamics of
the Earth's interior and the role of water in facilitating chemical and
mechanical processes, notably intracrystalline diffusion and rheology. This
research program will form the focus of the PhD research of a graduate student,
who will take the major role in the experimental and analytical work, will
present the research at scientific conferences, and will take in the lead in
writing research papers on the individual research topics for scientific
journals.
