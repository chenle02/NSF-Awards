Contact structures occupy a central role in modern geometry and topology and
have close connections with physics. They appear naturally as the boundary of
space-time in mathematical physics and play an essential role in the
mathematical study of three- and four-dimensional spaces and the knotting of
DNA. In dimension three, contact structures are comparatively well-understood
due to dramatic advances in the previous decades. The goal of this research
project is to further develop higher-dimensional contact geometry, which is
still quite mysterious and in its infancy despite significant advances in recent
years. As part of this project, the Principal Investigator will also promote the
training of future mathematicians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project on
higher-dimensional contact geometry and its Floer-theoretic invariants has two
parts: The first is to continue the systematic study of convex hypersurface
theory - a technique to decompose a contact manifold into easier-to-analyze
pieces - in arbitrary dimensions initiated by the Principal Investigator and his
collaborator Dr. Huang and further develop the techniques that were used. The
second is to develop a higher-dimensional generalization of Heegaard Floer
homology. The goal is to obtain invariants that are effective at distinguishing
contact and symplectic manifolds and their diffeomorphisms, as well as three-
and four-manifold invariants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
