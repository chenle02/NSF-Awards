This project marks the beginning of a long time series hydrographic station
north of Hawaii, which will constitute a contribution to both the World Ocean
Circulation Experiment (WOCE), and the Global Ocean Flux Study (GOFS).
Hydrographic observations, and current meter and tracer data will be collected,
analysed, and disseminated to the community. The data collected will provide
information for the Pacific similar to those now collected near Bermuda at what
has come to be called the Panulirus Station.
