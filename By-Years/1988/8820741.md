This award is made in the Organic Dynamics Program to Dr. Matthew Zimmt at Brown
University. The goal of Dr. Zimmt's work is to advance the fundamental
understanding of how electrons are transferred across space. This process is of
great significance to a number of chemical and biochemical reactions as well as
organic microelectronics. The role of symmetry, orientation and bond
connectivity in modulating rates of intramolecular transfer will be addressed.
The primary systems to be studied comprise a novel set of donor-spacer-acceptor
molecules which enforce an unambiguous geometric relationship between donor and
acceptor. The results of these studies are relevant for the design of molecular
scale electronic components. The dynamic consequence of conformational mobility
in systems where transfer parameters are strongly modulated will be
investigated. The systems to be investigated will include all three types of
electron transfers: charge separation, charge recombination and charge shift.
The effect of the structure of the surrounding medium on the rate and range of
electron transfer reactions will also be investigated.
