This CAREER project focuses on studying the local mechanisms that govern the
behavior of several nanoscale systems under intensive scientific investigation.
The project will provide training in the novel scanned probe methods, low
temperature instrumentation and nanofabrication methods to the graduate,
undergraduate and high school students involved. In particular, scanned probe
techniques will be actively implemented, including the novel "scanning gate"
microscopy and the scanning capacitance microscopy that are especially suited to
study nanostructures. The main directions include: imaging the electron wave
functions in quantum dots and a two- dimensional insulator, and studies of
electron distribution in&lt;br/&gt; carbon nanotubes. The project will enhance
understanding of electron-electron interaction phenomena in the nanostructures
of active current interest and will significantly develop the novel scanning
gate and scanning capacitive microscopy.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This

carbon nanotubes. 1) The electron distribution in a lateral quantum dot will be
probed by measuring the electric conductivity through the dot as a biased tip is
scanned above the sample surface (scanning gate microscopy). 2) A vertical
quantum dot will be induced by the biased tip and scanned&lt;br/&gt; inside the
heterostucture. 3) Localized electrons in the insulating two-dimensional
electron gas will be imaged by the scanning capacitance microscopy. 4) Electron
distribution in a carbon nanotube will be locally probed. This project will
provide training in the novel scanned probe methods, low temperature
instrumentation and microfabrication methods to the graduate, undergraduate and
high school students involved.
