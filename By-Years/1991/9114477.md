The purpose of this project is to evaluate the utility of the Bureau of Labor
Statistics' universe file as a sampling frame for National Science Foundation's
surveys concerned with R&D expenditures, primarily in the industrial sector. The
Bureau of Labor Statistics will develop several reports that analyze R&d
information in the universe file and the Occupational Employment Statistics
master file. Information will be provided at both the two and four digit
Standard Industrial Classification levels, with stratification by size of firm
and other variables.
