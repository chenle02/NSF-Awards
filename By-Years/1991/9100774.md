This award proves funds to establish a biotechnology-oriented Research
Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of Nevada, Reno to
serve 10 students, 5 from UNR and 5 from other institutions. The program will
help the students realize their own potential as research scientists by
introducing them to laboratory research and giving them insight into the
training needed for such a career. Target groups include women and minority
students and non-UNR students who have had little exposure to laboratory
research. Funds are included to hire a Minority Affairs Consultant in order to
increase success in identifying, recruiting and retaining these students. The
program is modeled after a 10 year old High School Science Scholars in Research
Summer Program (sponsored by the university, private groups, USDA, and NIH). The
REU students (college juniors or seniors) will work for 10 weeks at the
University of Nevada, Reno on molecular biotechnology research projects chosen
by them, but designed by biochemistry and molecular biology faculty members.
Biweekly discussion groups will be held to cover: selection of and application
to graduate programs, financial incentives for graduate studies, opportunities
available in biochemical and molecular biology research and what it's like to be
a scientist. Speakers will include scientists from under-represented groups.
Students will be selected on a regional basis with room and board provided for
non-local students. The program culminates with a one-day retreat at which oral
and written reports on the summer's activities will be given. Students, faculty
and staff will also discuss the educational and career opportunities. Follow-up
of the REU students will be done by phone calls and, where practical, by visits
to the students' campuses.
