This research will deal with the nonlinear thermocapillary instabilities. In
particular, the time-dependent problem of the obliquely-travelling finite
amplitude plane-wave disturbances will be formulated. This analysis will provide
information on the evolution of the motion in a shear layer due to
thermocapillary effects. The knowledge derived here should be of significant
importance to float-zone processing of single crystals in the micro-gravity
environment of space. Here, the instability of thermocapillary convection in the
melt zone will be one of the principal processing restrictions.
