Many industrial firms in the United States rely heavily on finite element
structural analysis, particularly true of the aerospace and automotive
industries. This proposal is based on an approach called the "Integrated Force
Method" (IFM). The dual formulation preserves most of the benefits of the IFM
within the context of a displacement-based finite element computer program.
