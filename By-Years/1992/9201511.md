During the summer of 1991 southern Minnesota experienced a sustained period of
unusually heavy precipitation and high relative humidity. These conditions have
seriously affected several ethnographic collections housed in the Science Museum
of Minnesota and permitted the development of mold. If untreated this
infestation may permanently damage irreplaceable specimens. These materials
include several hundred Chiapas Maya and Guatemalan Maya textiles and other
artifacts; hundreds of Blackfeet and other Northern Plains Native American
objects such as beaded leather shirts, leggings, dresses and containers; and 200
baskets from the upper Great Lakes region and central Minnesota dating from the
19th and early 20th centuries. These collections have been recognized as among
the finest and best documented North American ethnographic collections in the
world today. With NSF support, appropriate conservation measures will be
conducted and the materials restored until steps can be taken to permanently
remedy the situation. Such collections are of prime importance to
anthropologists who study material culture and society- environmental
interactions. This grant will help to prevent damage to irreplaceable materials.
