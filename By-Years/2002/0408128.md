0408128&lt;br/&gt;Knox&lt;br/&gt;This award to University of California at San
Diego will provide instrumentation for oceanographic research for use by the
Oceanographic Data Facility of Scripps Institution of Oceanography, as well as
specific instruments for use on the four research vessels operated by the
institution, R/Vs Revelle, Melville, New Horizon and Sproul. The university, as
part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research
fleet, operates all four of these research vessels. Specific instrumentation to
be acquired includes electronics test equipment for shipboard use, upgrades and
new sensors for the underway meteorological/surface water system, an acoustic
current profiler, a liquid scintillation counter, new altimeters for the CTD
systems, network backup devices, and a shore-based pressure calibration system.
The shared-use instrumentation supported here will assist marine scientists
conduct studies worldwide on SIO and other research vessels during 2004 and
future years.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
