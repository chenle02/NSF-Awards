Non-Technical Abstract A magnetic skyrmion is an interesting structure of the
spin texture in which its topology is unchanged against any smooth deformation
of the spins. Because of this stable topological structure, skyrmions exhibit
many exotic and unique properties that could be used in future spintronic
technology. However, skyrmions exist only in special types of materials and
usually at low temperature and high magnetic field so that it is difficult to
explore their physical properties. In this proposal, the PI proposes a new
method to synthesize and study artificial magnetic skyrmions so that skyrmion
research can be performed at room temperature and in a much wider range of
materials. This method also permits the search of other topological subjects
such as the so-called merons. Results of this research are expected to not only
advance our knowledge on topological properties of magnetic systems but also to
create application potentials in spintronics technology. In addition, this
research activity integrates research with basic education at both graduate and
undergraduate levels.

Technical Abstract Artificial magnetic skyrmions will be synthesized by
Molecular Beam Epitaxy and investigated using Photoemission Electron Microscopy.
Single crystalline magnetic thin films with perpendicular magnetization will be
grown epitxially on top of which magnetic disks will be grown using a contact
shadow mask. Magnetic vortices will then be formed inside the disks by choosing
appropriate disk radius and thickness. The interfacial magnetic coupling
imprints the vortex state from the disk into the underlayer. Therefore an
artificial skyrmion will be formed with the vortex surrounded by perpendicular
magnetization. The skyrmion topological magnetic number will be controlled and
switched by switching the surrounding magnetization up and down. Topological
properties of the skyrmions will then be explored by imaging the skyrmion vortex
as a function of magnetic field. Other topological objects such as merons will
also be searched and investigated in coupled disks in which the interlayer
coupling and disk thickness ratio will be systematic varied using double wedge
growth. In particular, correlation between polarity and divergence of the meron
will be explored.
