The Population Ecology of State Interest Communities study explores both why
interest communities are structured the way they are and how that structure
affects the political behavior of interest organizations. The study disentangles
how interest groups arise, how they are maintained and how they fail. Using the
population ecology framework, which includes models of niches, foraging and
evolutionary survival, this project generates a four year census of interest
groups in a sample of states, surveys a subsample of those interest group
leaders and builds a life table of interest groups in different policy domains.
Multivariate statistical techniques are used to analyze the extensive data
collection. This project sheds light on why some interest groups succeed and why
others fail, offering an explanation very different from that which is common to
the political science discipline.
