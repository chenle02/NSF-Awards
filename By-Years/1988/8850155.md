This Arizona State Young Scholars project is designed to give approximately
thirty selected high ability and high potential secondary school students an
unusual learning experience in engineering. An annual summer residential course
will focus on participant skill development in logic, creativity, analysis, and
communication. A series of state-of-the-art drawing laboratories will offer
students experience in creative expression through freehand, and computer-aided
drawing. Participants will also practive artifact design and analysis in
computer analysis laboratories using electronic spreadsheets. Interesting design
problems will be assigned, both for seminar discussion and investigation.
Lectures, workshops and seminars will examine pertinent topics such as the role
of mathematics and science in engineering, the philosophy, professional
responsibilities and ethics of engineering, modern challenges facing engineers,
and the connection between engineering and the "liberal arts". Field trips will
show students selected engineering research and manufacturing establishments,
including the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. Staffing levels
for the course will allow substantive one-on-one interaction between staff and
students. Project staff will represent a cross-section of the engineering
community, will be required to have a record of skillful teaching, successful
interaction with young persons, and provide potential mentors for the student
participants. Follow-up activities will maintain contact with the scholars, and
the impact of the program on their career choice will be determined.
