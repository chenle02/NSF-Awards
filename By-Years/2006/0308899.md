Abstract CTS-0308899 James Jenkins, Cornell University

The workshop is on recent developments and future research needs in the areas of
granular and particle-laden flows. It will take place at the Newtons Institute
of Cambridge University between Sept. 1st and Dec. 19th, 2003. The program will
involve participation of 12 to 15 researchers at any one time. Associated with
the workshop will be two-week long workshops with 60 researchers with focus on
transitions in granular media and geophysical flows.
