This project under the Small Grants for Exploratory Research Program examines
multicomponent extractive crystallization for systems with simple eutectic.
General separation schemes involving crystallizer and filters are developed
based on detailed knowledge of phase diagrams at various temperatures. The goal
is to avoid eutectic and produce pure products. The separation schemes are
tested experimentally with solutions of m-, o-, and p-xylenes, or adipic,
glutaric, and succinic acids. The results are applicable to separating and
purifying products of several chemical and pharmaceutical industries.
