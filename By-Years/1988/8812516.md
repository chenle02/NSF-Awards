This research will explore a new etching technique called aerosol jet etching
for use in integrated circuit manufacture. In this technique, submicron droplets
of etchant freshly formed from the vapor state are deposited on the substrate to
be etched. The etching of silicon with hydrofluoric - nitric acid droplets and
the etching of gallium arsenide with bromine - ethanol droplets will be studied
experimentally. Attention will be directed to the anisotropy of etching and the
level of resolution achievable. Parts of the process will be modelled
mathematically. The research will also explore the use of electrically charged
clusters consisting of several thousand etchant molecules as a hybrid of aerosol
jet etching and focussed ion beam etching in order to achieve very high
resolution. Aerosol jet etching combines several advantages of wet and dry
etching while avoiding some of their respective disadvantages. In particular,
very small contamination, good anisotropy of etching, and adequate line width
resolution are achievable. Use of charged clusters promises to achieve even
finer line width resolution.
