This is a request to support participation of U.S.-based graduate students who
are presenting papers at the 20th International Union of Soil Sciences World
Congress in Jeju, South Korea, during June 8-13, 2014.

Those supported by the fellowships will benefit by interacting with leading
persons in their field of research and discussing their work with them. Their
involvement in the congress will expose them to new areas of research and keep
them engaged in the field, helping to build the future academic infrastructure.
The fellowship program will enable those who might not otherwise be able to
attend the congress to do so, encouraging the participation of the strongest
U.S. soil science research talent at this meeting.
