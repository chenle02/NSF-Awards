This award is made as part of the FY 2021 Mathematical and Physical Sciences
Ascending Postdoctoral Research Fellowships (MPS-Ascend). Each fellowship
supports a research and training project at a host institution in the
mathematical and physical sciences, including applications to other disciplines,
under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. This fellowship to Dr. Joshua
Sanchez supports his research project entitled "Probing electronic symmetry
breaking in strain-tuned quantum matter." The host institution for the
fellowship is the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the sponsoring
scientist is Dr. Riccardo Comin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Sanchez's research
focuses on mechanical strain tuning in quantum materials to investigate
electronic symmetry breaking in quantum matter characterized by strong coupling
of charge and lattice degrees of freedom. The fellow plans to broaden
participation at local majority-minority community colleges through hosting lab
tours at MIT and leading graduate-school application-writing workshops. In
mentoring undergraduates, Dr. Sanchez will create travel opportunities for the
students to large-scale x-ray facilities where they will perform first-hand
x-ray measurements. With regards to outreach to the broader community Dr.
Sanchez will work with the American Physical Society to make important cultural
changes to create a more fostering environment for diverse students
nationally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
