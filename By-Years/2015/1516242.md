MINERVA is a robotic observatory at Mt. Hopkins, Arizona dedicated to searching
for and characterizing Earth-like planets around the closest, brightest, and
most interesting stars. Via this award, the PI aims to use MINERVA to discover a
number of low-mass planets around bright stars. These newly discovered planets
will be among the best targets for detailed studies that will help us understand
our place in our own Milky Way Galaxy. MINERVA's use of four small telescopes is
more cost effective than a single telescope with the same effective size. It is
also creates the flexibility to use part of the array to achieve an ambitious
education and public outreach program, largely aimed at minority undergraduate
students, to which 10% of the observatory's time is dedicated.

It is becoming clear that the number of planets increases rapidly with
decreasing planet mass and radius. Project MINERVA will discover new planets
around bright stars by intensely observing a handful of carefully-selected
targets with purpose-built instrumentation at a dedicated telescope. It will use
four 0.7 meter roboticized commercial telescopes at Mt. Hopkins, Arizona to
simultaneously feed a high precision radial velocity spectrograph. The design
goal is state-of-the-art (1 m/s) Doppler precision necessary to find low-mass
planets, which will be achieved by combining an iodine wavelength reference with
a fiber-fed, intrinsically stable spectrograph. With all of the observing time
dedicated to this goal, significant time can be dedicated to each star in order
to mitigate the deleterious effects of stellar jitter. Based on simulations of
detection limits and planet populations, the team expects to find ~14 new low-
mass planets around 80 stars in the eta Earth sample of bright (3.5 < V < 8.5),
chromospherically inactive GKM stars. These new planets will be ideal targets
for detailed characterization by future ground-based instrumentation and space
missions.
