In this research supported in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic
Chemistry Program, Theodore L. Brown of the University of Illinois at Urbana-
Champaign, will investigate the kinetics and mechanisms of organometallic
reactions. The focus will be mainly on transition-metal carbonyl complexes and
specifically on the properties of reaction intermediates formed in the course of
organometallic reactions. These studies are important for the fundamental
understanding of organo- metallic chemistry and catalytic processes involving
organo- metallic compounds. One class of reaction intermediate to be studied is
the metal carbonyl radicals, which possess an odd number of electrons (often
seventeen or nineteen) in the metal valence orbitals. A second class of
intermediate is formed by loss of a ligand, usually carbon monoxide, bound to
the metal. The technique of flash photolysis using a dinitrogen laser will be
employed to study these intermediates. Another aspect of the research will
involve a comprehensive study of the steric and electronic properties of
ligands, primarily phosphorus ligands. The approach will involve experimental
studies of appropriate series of reactions; compilation of these results and
results from a large body of existing literature; and analysis of these data
with new statistically valid methods. The end result may be a useful system for
effective design of catalysts by using ligands which impart predictable and
desirable properties to the catalysts.
