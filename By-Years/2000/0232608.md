This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a process
for producing high-aspect ratio boehmite nanoscopic platelets. Boehmite is an
inexpensive mineral produced in large volumes as a precursor to alumina catalyst
supports. In the project simple and inexpensive methods for modifying the
surface of boehmite to render it dispersible in and reactive with a wide variety
of polymeric matrices will be developed. &lt;br/&gt;Subtly changing the boehmite
synthesis conditions and adding morphology-directing compounds to the reaction
mixture will achieve the formation of high &lt;br/&gt;aspect-ratio boehmite
platelets. Particle size and shape will routinely be measured by a
&lt;br/&gt;combination of x-ray diffraction and light scattering techniques
which will, in turn, be verified by atomic force microscopy and transmission
electron microscopy. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The high aspect ratio boehmite
developed in this research project will result in dramatic improvements to the
barrier properties of its composites, leading to inexpensive nanocomposite
barrier films for packaging, paints and coatings. Mechanical properties of
composites with high-aspect ratio boehmite platelets are also expected to
improve. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
