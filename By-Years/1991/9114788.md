Current composite forming techniques suffer greatly from a lack of
understanding of the forming principles at a fundamental physical level. The
purpose of the project is to develop this fundamental understanding, emphasizing
particularly the effects of geometry on formability. The research will
concentrate on developing mathematical models and computational schemes that
relate the material deformation modes necessary to form complex shapes to
geometric features. The forming characteristics of other advanced composite
materials, including woven materials, where weave pattern and fiber architecture
will be critical, and long, discontinuous fiber composites, where material
thinning is a particular problem will also be addressed. This work will be based
primarily on experiments, and models of composites deformation and failure
modes. To handle the vast array of part shapes and possible fiber paths,
computer aided design techniques will be used, modified with appropriate
calculation procedures. The final result of this study will be "Design for
Manufacture" guidelines for forming composites. Such guidelines will be very
useful for industry, and for the aerospace industry in particular.
