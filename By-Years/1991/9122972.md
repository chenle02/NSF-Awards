Doctoral Student, Lynne Snyder; Topic: "The Federal Government Discovers Air
Pollution, 1948-63." The signing into law this year of a new Clean Air Act ends
nearly a decade of Congressional and Administration debate over new steps to be
taken to limit air pollution in the US. Ms. Snyder, in her doctoral research
under the direction of Professor Rosemary Stevens, is examining the origins of
national government involvement in the effort to control air-borne pollutants.
This project comprises the review of papers in Cincinnati, Ohio and University
Park, Pennsylvania, of records of the State of Pennsylvania in Harrisburg, and
the recording of oral histories with retired steelworkers and their spouses in
Fort Myers, Florida. This research promises to contribute to a social historical
dissertation on the emergence of a federal approach to air pollution after World
War II, a policy crafted by research physicians and industrial hygienists
informally, by means of expertise. Ms. Snyder's dissertation focuses on
responses to a premier environmental disaster of the pre-regulatory era, the
deadly smog over the southwestern Pennsylvania steel towns of Donora and Webster
in 1948. Oral histories with surviving community members and leaders supply
critical perspectives on local attitudes towards and experiences with outside
investigators. Review of the papers of Cincinnati's Dr. Robert Kehoe, who led
the steel industry's investigation of the smog, provide an unprecedented view of
the evolution of privately- sponsored environmental health expertise. Review of
United Steelworkers Secretary David J. McDonald's papers, and those of the
Pennsylvania State Departments of Health and Labor and Industry, contribute key
information about the tensions between industrial union, state, and federal
government and administrative responsibilities for public health were
renegotiated in the postwar era.
