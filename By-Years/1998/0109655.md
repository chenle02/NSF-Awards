Joseph Templeton, Department of Chemistry, University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic
Chemistry Program to continue his studies of fundamental reactions of ligands
coordinated to transition metals. One focus of this grant involves tungsten
complexes with coordinated carbynes or carbenes. Complexes such
asTp'I(O)W=C(CH3)(OSiR3), where Tp' represents a tris-pyrazoyl borate, are
unusual examples of "Fischer-type" carbenes bound to a high oxidation state
metal. Studies will probe the bonding and reactivity of these species. Another
focus of the grant is the synthesis of organometallic complexes of Pt(IV)
relevant to carbon-hydrogen bond activation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fundamental
studies of the electronic structure and bonding of these ligands provide insight
into important heterogeneous catalytic processes. In addition, graduate students
and postdoctoral associates will learn valuable skills in synthesis,
characterization and reactivity studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
