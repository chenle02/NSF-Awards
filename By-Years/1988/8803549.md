Professor Souvaine will examine results in both rectilinear geometry and general
geometry to determine which of the former can be efficiently generalized and
which of the latter benefit from a restriction to k orientations. Many robot
hands consist of two parallel edges that can move closer together or further
apart. Professor Souvaine conjectures that all polygons admit a stable grip in
this model. She proved the conjecture and provided linear time algorithms for
special classes of polygons. The goal of this research is to prove the
conjecture in full generality and then to study the corresponding problems for
polyhedra and curved objects. In 2 dimensions, the least median of squares
regression line (LMS) can be computed efficiently. Replacing the standard
vertical line sweep with a topological line sweep results in a faster algorithm.
The goals are to discover techniques for computing multidimensional LMS and
dynamic LMS and to determine which problems benefit from topological sweep.
