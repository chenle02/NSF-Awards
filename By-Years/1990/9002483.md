This proposal is to conduct a hydrographic cruise in the Pacific along
longitudes 88 and 150 degrees west. As a central element of the World Ocean
Circulation Experiment (WOCE), the crusie will provide measurements of
temperature, salinity, nutrients, and many additional chemical tracers useful to
describe the ocean ciruclation. This propsoal is to provide the technical
sampling and analysis for the entire program.
