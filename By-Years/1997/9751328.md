The lower-division calculus-based Physics course sequence is nearing its
completion of a major upgrade and modernization. Following recommendations of
the Introductory University Project report, the third semester Physics course is
becoming a Capstone in Optics and Atomic Physics. The required associated
laboratory includes a few traditional Optics and Spectroscopy experiments and
several newly developed experimental projects in Optics, Holography, Atomic
Physics and computational Molecular Physics. The experiments are designed to
carry the student through a gradual transition from Optics to Quantum Physics
and, above all, make it a very interesting experience.
