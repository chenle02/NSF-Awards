This research addresses the representation of point patterns using nonmetric
information. Point patterns are especially useful as feature point models of
more complex images. Image representation is essential to both human and machine
vision. Nonmetric information is of particular importance since there is
considerable evidence that human vision utilizes it extensively, as opposed to
precise, metric measurement. For many visual cognition tasks, it seems important
for humans to be able to look for visual patterns, which must be very general
and flexible thus not metric. This research will contribute to both the
understanding of human visionand the development of machine vision based on
relative imprecise, inexpensive sensors
