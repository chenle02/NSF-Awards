This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program
supports an annual workshop in `InOrganometallic` Chemistry. The participants
will be from academia, industry, and private and governmental research
organizations. The goals of the workshop are to facilitate communication among
researchers in these three sectors and to foster exchange of new ideas earlier
than is possible through formal publication. The format of the workship is
designed to encourage maximum participation by all attendees, and the plan for
selecting attendees will ensure broad-based particpation, particularly by new
investigators. The topics discusssed will be at the interfaces between inorganic
chemistry and organic chemistry, biological chemistry, and materials chemistry
