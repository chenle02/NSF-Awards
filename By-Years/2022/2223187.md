The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II
project is to enable the reduction of greenhouse gases by the aviation industry
by advancing the development of a lightweight conformable tank capable of
storing hydrogen at a gravimetric efficiency of over 10% hydrogen by mass. The
development of a conformable tank with a &gt; 10% storage efficiency, which
exceeds the potential of existing technology, would have an immediate impact on
the potential for hydrogen to replace existing transportation fuels. While the
aviation application introduces unique challenges for hydrogen storage, the
results of this project will benefit a wider variety of transportation fuel
markets, where demand for lightweight, safe, and economically viable storage
solutions is increasing. The storage of high-pressure gaseous hydrogen is a
significant obstacle for zero emissions fuels, and meeting the standards for
minimum burst pressure, cyclic operation, extreme temperature operation, and
hydrogen permeation with a conformable tank will open the door to a wide variety
of near-term applications, enabling the reduction of transportation-related
emissions and reducing the burden of sending carbon fiber tanks to landfills at
the end of their lives. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project will address the challenges related to the
commercialization of a lightweight hydrogen tank for aviation fuel. The
decarbonization of the aviation industry requires zero-emissions powertrain
technologies. However, current battery technologies lack the storage efficiency
to support long-range flights, and existing hydrogen storage tanks are too heavy
and cumbersome to be practical. The research objectives of this project are to
increase the gravimetric efficiency of conformable tanks, close the gaps in the
remaining barriers to component certification compliance, and produce prototype
tanks suitable for bench testing and evaluation for flight testing. The research
will involve the optimization of the pressure vessel reinforcement structure,
the production of conformable tank samples, the testing of samples for the
existing hydrogen tank regulations, and the collaboration with airplane
manufacturers and regulators to identify and address additional performance
requirements. Once completed, the project will result in full-scale (2.5 kg and
above), standards-compliant, production scalable tanks for continued component
and flight-worthiness evaluations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
