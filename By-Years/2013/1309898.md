Objective: &lt;br/&gt;The objective of this program is to demonstrate
multifunctional single molecule devices, whose transfer characteristics are
tailorable, dynamic, and complex, beyond the scope of conventional solid state
devices. The transformative aspect of the program is to realize the motivation
of the field of molecular electronic devices - the ability to tune device
function by chemical design and synthesis, which will elucidate long-standing
issues in molecular electronic device operation and design.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit:&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of
the program is to proposal lay a solid foundation to the fundamental
understanding of molecular device function by chemical design and synthesis.
This will lead to the design molecular devices by rational design, and the
development of multifunctional single molecule devices. This transformative
approach offers vast possibilities for technological development based on the
diverse electronic functions of the component molecules, tailored by chemical
design and synthesis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts:&lt;br/&gt;The
broader impacts of the program are to advance discovery of the molecular
electronics field while training graduate students and involving undergraduates
in a multidisciplinary project at the intersection of engineering, physics, and
chemistry. The program will implement an integrative research and education
environment through a Summer Outreach Program designed to involve undergraduates
and graduates from other institutions, through a well-established Yale-New Haven
partnership in education program called the Yale-New Haven Teachers institute
(YNHTI), that educates high school teachers through monthly seminars during the
summer, and to institute a new program that will actively recruits K-12 students
for summer research experiences.
