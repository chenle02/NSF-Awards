Slices of oceanic crust (ophiolite) are emplaced into many orogenic belts and
most have unusually steep, inverted metamorphic gradients at their base. These
inverted gradients are thought to be the product of synchronous faulting and
metamorphism but the details of the mechanisms involved are still unknown. This
study will examine the rocks at the base of the Oman ophiolite, one of the best
exposed and best known in the world, to determine the microstructural,
thermobarometric and thermochronologic history of an archetypical inverted
metamorphic gradient. The results will have important implications for the
tectonic evolution of all mountain belts that contain ophiolitic rocks.
