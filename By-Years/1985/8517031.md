Masonry construction comprises a large portion of building construction in the
U.S. and the world. Reinforced masonry construction use is increasing in
moderate to higher seismic zones because of its apparent features of economy,
fire safety, architectural flexibility, and ease of construction. The present
state of masonry structural analysis and design and materials and construction
technologies does not enable an accurate prediction of building behavior under
lateral loads such as seismic loads. This research project will provide the
preliminary design of the full-scale masonry research structure for the
U.S.-Japan Coordinated Program for Masonry Research. This is necessary to allow
integration and coordination of the experimental and the analytical tasks with
the design tasks for ultimate use in establishing a rational limit state design
methodology for masonry building construction. This research project includes
development of the preliminary design for the research buildings, estimation of
story shear capacity, estimation of interstory force-displacement
characteristics in both the elastic and inelastic range, and integration of
these data with the experimental and analytical research projects.
