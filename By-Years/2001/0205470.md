University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ITR: Constructing Protein Ontologies Using Text
Mining&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given the vast amounts of genomic and molecular data
being generated by scientific research, there is a pressing need to develop
advanced bioinformatics infrastructures for biological knowledge management. An
ontology is a semantic model that contains a shared vocabulary and
classification of concepts in a domain. Ontologies for biology are crucial in
data integration from multiple databases and in literature mining for knowledge
extraction and evidence attribution. This project focuses on the development of
an ontology of protein names, consisting of a data dictionary and links to more
specific, more general and synonymous protein names. Ontology development,
however, currently requires substantial human effort. This project will exploit
statistical and computational linguistics methods to induce an ontology of
protein names using text corpora from MEDLINE and a knowledge base developed at
the Protein Information Resource (PIR); terms in the induced ontology will also
be linked to the functional hierarchy of the Gene Ontology. The induced ontology
can then be further edited by a human. This project aims at demonstrating that
this domain-independent method of ontology induction is more cost-effective than
having humans develop an ontology from scratch. The approach could therefore be
of practical value in other domains where there is a need to develop ontologies
linking text corpora and nomenclature in databases. Both the ontology and
software system developed in this project will be freely distributed to the
scientific community via the PIR web site in standard XML-based ontology
interchange formats and for intelligent literature mining and PubMed searching.
