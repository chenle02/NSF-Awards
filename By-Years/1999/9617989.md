9617989 Winship The racial composition of U.S. prisons has gone from being less
than 25% black sixty-five years ago to being approximately 50% black today. This
has occurred along with the substantial improvements in the social and economic
status of blacks over this same period. Little research has been done to explain
why this change has occurred. This research will examine this change in the
racial composition of U.S. prisons through studying factors which might have
impacted it. The investigator proposes to more thoroughly and rigorously test
the importance of factors examined in prior studies of increases in crime among
blacks (i.e., regional migration, differential population growth, urbanization,
"the war on drugs," increases in female-headed households, black youth
unemployment and the decline in manufacturing). The investigator will create an
integrated data base using information from the 1940-1990 U.S. Census PUMS data
sets and the U.S. Department of Justice, Uniform Crime Reports Arrest Data from
1960-1990. A process model for imprisonment will be developed and components of
this model will be estimated using Poisson regression methods. ***
