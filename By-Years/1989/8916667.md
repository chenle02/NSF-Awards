This award provides funding support for the operation and equipment upgrade
costs of setting up a research center for accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS)
based on an existing FN tandem accelerator at Purdue University. Establishment
and operation of the facility will be a joint venture involving faculty and
technical personnel from a combination of the departments of physics, earth and
atmospheric sciences, and chemistry at Purdue. The AMS facility is intended to
service the analytical needs of the U.S. geosciences research community
nationwide. Accelerator mass spectrometry provides unique sensitivity
capabilities for the detection and quantitative measure of very small
concentrations of isotopes in very small samples of matter. To date AMS has
proven particularly useful for tracking the mass transfer of subducted sediments
and groundwater and for dating geological and archeological samples. The most
useful isotopes in such applications so far have been carbon-14, chlorine-36,
beryllium-10, and aluminum-26. The Purdue facility will concentrate on
measurements of these isotopes in a variety of geological samples and in
technique development efforts aimed at improving detection limits and precision
for these and additional isotopes of potential interest in the geosciences.
