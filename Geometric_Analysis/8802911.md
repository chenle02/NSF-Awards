Alberto Baider and Richard Churchill will continue their research related to
the dynamics of Hamiltonian systems. These are systems of differential equations
of physical significance. This will involve the translation of much analysis
into geometry and promises to have significant consequences in algebraic
geometry. They intend to put Ziglin's non-integrability theorem in a geometric
setting. In particular this project will relate the monodromy of the variational
equations to the monodromy on the natural bundle of the varieties arising from
the existence of certain integrals.
