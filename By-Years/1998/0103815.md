This collaborative research project with William Simpson, University of Alaska,
Fairbanks, will develop and test a radiation-transfer model for snow
photochemistry. The model will help quantify the extent of photochemical
processing of trace compounds within snow and will help in interpreting ice core
climate records and understanding atmospheric chemistry in snow-covered regions.
The project includes a laboratory-based program of experiments to quantify
absorption spectra and quantum yields. Experimental measurements of photolysis
rates for bromoform, a possible precursor of "active bromine" in a proposed
mechanism of Arctic boundary-layer ozone depletion, and other trace compounds in
snow interstitial spaces will be made in a novel snow photolysis
chamber.&lt;br/&gt;
