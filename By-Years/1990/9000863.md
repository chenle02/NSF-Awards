Ten undergraduate students will participate in research during the 1990 summer.
The research projects include: (1) Microwave Acoustic Materials and Devices; (2)
Robotics and Computer Vision; (3) Semiconductor Material and Device Property
Measurements; (4) Motion Control; (5) Application Specific Computer
Architectures; (6) Environmental Radio Noise Measurements; and (7) VLSI-Based
Neuron Models. At least six students will come from institutions where research
opportunities are limited and at least three students will be women, handicapped
or minorities. Students chosen for the program will have displayed a high degree
of initiative and independence of thought in both laboratories and coursework.
Student research projects are chosen to match the student's interest and
educational level. In addition to extensive facilities, students will also have
access to facilities at various nearby industries such as Bangor Hydroelectric
and Central Maine Power Companies, James River, Champion and Scott Paper
Companies, Digital Equipment Corporation and National Semiconductor. At the
Program culmination a written report and an oral seminar are expected from the
student. Three academic credits are awarded to the student upon satisfactory
completion of the program.
