The proposed research entails a study of manifolds with affine connections of
restricted holonomy and the geometry of submanifolds of certain classes of
Riemanian symmetric spaces. Particular attention in the latter case will be paid
to surfaces in quaternionic-Kaehler manifolds where such surfaces can be studied
by complex-analytic means relative to an associated complex manifold. This
research also entails a study of deformations of Einstein metrics on
4-manifolds.
