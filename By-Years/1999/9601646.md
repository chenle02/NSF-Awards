This application requests funds for the purchase of a Bio-Rad confocal system
integrated with a Nikon microscope. The seven major users of this facility are
junior and senior faculty in the Department of Biology at the University of
Rochester, and all are funded from national granting agencies (NSF, NIH, USDA).
The current programs of the users involve carrying out studies on fate
specification, cell-cell interactions and morphogenesis in developing organisms
(Drosophila, sea urchins, Arabidopsis); the role of cytoskeletal elements in
cellular and organismal functions; the mechanisms of nuclear transport; and
regulation of genome packaging. These projects are unified in using molecular,
genetic and/or biochemical techniques to ask how specific gene products
influence cellular and developmental processes. In order to carry out
quantitation, dynamic analysis and co-localization studies, all of these
projects now require a confocal microscope system which is: 1) reliable and
easily used by a number of individuals; 2) has multiple types of optics; 3) has
flexibility in the excitation and emission wavelengths; and 4) has excellent
resolution in the Z and X/Y axes. Image analysis software that allows further
quantification and manipulation of the confocal data is also requested. As
members of the Department of Biology, all of the users are also involved in
education of undergraduate and graduate students in both formal and informal
settings. In the context of each of the research projects described, the
requested instrumentation will be used by graduate students and postdoctorals in
training. The instrumentation will also be employed for demonstrations in
undergraduate courses and outreach programs, and for hands-on experiences- in
advanced laboratory courses and independent undergraduate research projects.
