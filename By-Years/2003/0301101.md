Professor Michael E. Fisher, of the University of Maryland, is supported by the
Theoretical and Computational Chemistry and Materials Theory Programs to perform
research on statistical mechanics and phase transitions. The project deals with
developing and applying basic statistical mechanical techniques to problems
relevant to biochemistry and biophysics. Specific biophysical behaviors are
identified and general principles governing these behaviors are conjectured and
tested. The specific problem being investigated includes the theory of motor
proteins such as myosin V and kinesin. Although myosin V and kinesin are both
processive motors, they exhibit qualitatively different load-versus-velocity
characteristics and different stall forces. A chemo-mechanical explanation of
the differences observed in these two motor proteins is being sought in this
work. In addition, refinement of the understanding of critical properties of
ionic fluids is in progress. Graduate and postdoctoral students will receive
traditional training in the field of statistical mechanics and learn how to
apply these techniques to the nascent field of molecular
motors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A chemo-mechanical understanding of motion of
biologically important macromolecules is currently lacking and the field is
nearly devoid of experimental data. The preliminary models studied here will
yield precise predictions, which will stimulate new experimental measurement and
further enable refinement and redefinition of the models. Such studies may form
a framework for the understanding of muscle action, which could lead to
successful strategies for modification of muscular processes in vivo. These
studies will also impact the design and application of nanomechanical devices.
The second area of interest is in the understanding of ionic fluids. Elucidation
of the properties of ionic fluids will speed their adoption as a medium for
chemical processing applications such as chemical reactions and chemical
separations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
