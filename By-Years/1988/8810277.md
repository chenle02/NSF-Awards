Factors which regulate and control development of the CNS are not fully
understood although it is likely they are a result of programmed gene expression
as well as specific cell to cell interaction. It is known that a variety of
biological agents can affect neuronal cell development. This research will
investigate these possibilities in the developing chick retina and optic tectum
both in vitro and in vivo. Transferrin's effects on ion movement in developing
neurons will first be examined followed by the examinations of transferrin's
effects on ion movement in developing neurons. Finally transferrins binding and
factors which influence the kinetics of transferrin binding will be
characterized. These studies will provide direct insight into transferrin's role
in CNS development.
