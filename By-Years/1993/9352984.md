four-week summer residential Young Scholars program in mathematics for 40
students entering grades 10-12. The students will be enrolled in various schools
throughout the state of New Jersey. The students will be introduced to problems
and applications in discrete mathematics during summer sessions with follow-up
activities during the academic year. The program provides for a research
experience with instructional sessions, conducted by university faculty, on
applications of graphs, algorithms in graph theory, theory of numbers, and
