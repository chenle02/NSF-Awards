EAR-0309414 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks to test if the proposed
radiogenic Os isotopic compositions&lt;br/&gt;(186 Os/ 188 Os and 187 Os/ 188
Os) measured in the Hawaiian oceanic island basalts (OIB) and in the Siberian
Flood Basalts at Norilsk are manifestations of interaction between the outer
core and the lower mantle. We propose to test this hypothesis by measuring
platinum-group element (PGE) abundances and Os isotopic compositions (186 Os/
188 Os and 187 Os/ 188 Os) in a variety of mantle lithologies, including
pyroxenites of several generations, in the ~470 My old Trinity Peridotite of
northern California. In order to understand the frequency and geographical
extent with which radiogenic 186 Os/ 188 Os signatures occur in mantle derived
materials, we will measure the Os isotopic composition of placer-derived Os-rich
PGE alloys from ultramafic rocks in different localities world wide and in
samples of pyroxenite from a transect of the Semail Ophiolite, Oman available to
us. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this work lies in
potentially providing a new tool for quantifying the contribution from pyroxene-
rich lithologies to the production of oceanic basalts. The generated data set
will increase our understanding of the characteristic length scales for isotopic
and siderophile trace element heterogeneity in the upper mantle, elucidate the
role of metasomatic processes in fractionation of PGEs, improve our
understanding of melt migration and melt/wall-rock reactions, and help refine
the PGE budget of the upper mantle benefiting cosmochemical models for Earth's
formation. The broader impacts of the proposed research will be to provide an
opportunity for the development of a scientist in the early stages of his
career. This project also contains a strong component of collaboration between
Danish and American scientists, which will serve to bolster international
scientific collaboration, and support for academic infrastructure in both
countries.&lt;br/&gt;
