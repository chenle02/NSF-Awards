Across societal infrastructure systems, the inherited institutional mechanisms
for stakeholder alignment are incomplete or inadequate for the twin challenges
for creating value and mitigating harm. New proprietary technologies developed
by the project team enable speedy representation of stakeholder interests at the
system level. These technologies, combined with a service delivery model and a
neutral stance, represents a powerful platform for advancing "the science of
science" and increasing societal capabilities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Preliminary
applications of the technology have focused on community green energy,
biomedicine, regional innovation, the geosciences, and other domains where a mix
of public and private stakeholders are engaged in large-scale initiatives. The
impacts of the proprietary technology are threefold: 1. The implementation of
large-scale scientific and technological initiatives is accelerated; 2. Clear
"go/ no-go" decisions, and strategic pivots, can be made more quickly; 3. New
institutional arrangements, anchored in real-time data, are more effective,
robust, and sustainable. Commercially, an entrepreneurial business with defined
practice areas is contemplated, with a mix of public and private sector clients.
The neutral "honest broker" stance is distinct from the work of single-client
consulting firms. The entrepreneurial business will have a "double bottom-line"
that emphasizes financial success and societal contributions. Of particular
importance will be the multiplier effects through job creation, which will be
documented on each project. For example, in a potential future project on the
siting of a new power plant on a former Air Force base, there is the potential
to generate over 500-800 jobs through the construction process and an additional
50-80 jobs associated in ongoing operations.
