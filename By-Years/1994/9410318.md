9410318 Nemhauser To use MINTO in its current form, a user would need to
customize it through application routines. Such user is expected to be an expert
in mixed integer programming. The task in the deployment activity is to develop
a methodology that would allow the customization of the package by a user
without expecting such a user to be vastly knowledgeable on mixed integer
programming. In addition to the development of the user interface module to
MINTO, the deployment activity includes the intensive use of MINTO in two
graduate level courses and holding of workshops for industrial practitioners and
academics. Student groups will be defined and problems of different types and
structures will be identified for solution through MINTO. The objective of this
project is to develop a deployment route for teaching MINTO to students and
transferring it to industry. MINTO is a general purpose, mixed integer
optimization program that the principal investigator developed as a result of a
prior NSF sponsored research project.
