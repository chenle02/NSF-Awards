The ear is a complex of sensory organs for equilibrium (vestibular sense) and
hearing, sending signals to the brain by branches of the eighth (octaval)
cranial nerve. In fishes and aquatic vertebrates, a system called the lateral
line detects water-borne mechanical signals, and in many species also has
electrosensory organs. The ear and lateral line system were traditionally
considered closely related, forming a single octavolateralis system, largely for
hearing. In this view, evolutionarily early centers in the brain for analyzing
lateral line information later became auditory centers in land vertebrates which
lack lateral lines. Recent studies of comparative brain anatomy and physiology
have demonstrated the four subsystems do not in fact overlap much in the lower
parts of their central neural pathways, nor in their physiological sensitivity.
This study will use anatomical techniques to trace those pathways in less and
more specialized fish, to higher levels including the important forebrain, which
evolves into the cerebral cortex of mammals. Central organization of the
auditory pathways in fishes will be compared to the lateral line pathways.
Defining these pathways is necessary as a baseline to understand how auditory
pathways have been modified during the striking evolution of the ear for hearing
in land vertebrates. In addition, these studies will clarify the evolution of
the remarkably diverse mechanisms for hearing found among the many species of
bony fishes, which represent a complicated history of loss, invention, and re-
invention of various receptor classes. Results will be important to sensory
science, ichthyology, and evolutionary biology.
