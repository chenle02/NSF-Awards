Dr. Peter Felker is supported by a grant from The Experimental Physical
Chemistry Program to perform structural studies on large van der Waals complexes
using newly developed picosecond laser spectroscopic techniques. These new
techniques which are referred to as rotational coherence spectroscopy (RCS) and
Fourier transform stimulated emission pumping spectroscopy (FT-SEPS) provide
important information about the structure and ground state potential energy
surfaces for this very interesting class of molecules. RCS is a picosecond time-
domain method based on the rotational quantum beat phenomenon, and it will be
used to measure excited state rotational constants of large van der Waals
complexes, hydrogen-bonded complexes, and species with torsional degrees of
freedom. The goal of these experiments is to obtain information pertaining to
the geometries of important species that are difficult to study with other high
resolution techniques. FT-SEPS, an interferometric version of stimulated
emission pumping spectroscopy, will be applied to high resolution studies of the
ground-state rovibrational level structures of similar species. Here, again, the
elucidation of geometries via the determination of (ground-state) rotational
constants is the primary goal of the experiment. A secondary goal is to obtain
information about inter- and intra-molecular potential energy srufaces via high
resolution vibrational spectroscopy.
