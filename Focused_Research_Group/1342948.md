Over the last generation the four-dimensional classical self-dual Yang-Mills
equations and their dimensional reductions have had profound consequences for
algebraic geometry, differential geometry, low-dimensional topology, integrable
systems, and nonlinear PDE. Now a family of six-dimensional quantum field
theories is emerging as an object of acute mathematical interest. This Focused
Research Group brings together researchers working in diverse parts of
mathematics and physics to study these theories. They originally arose as limits
of string theories and are usually called 'superconformal (2,0)-theories' to
call attention to their symmetries. The simpler appellation 'Theory X'
emphasizes how little is known. The projects undertaken here have two overall
goals. First, we will make inroads on the structure of Theory X by applying the
detailed and profound mathematical understanding of topological and conformal
quantum field theories obtained over the past 25 years. Second, we will use
expected properties of Theory X and its compactifications to lower dimensions to
deduce new conjectures and new organizing principles in geometric representation
theory. The rapidly developing web of interactions between the six-dimensional
quantum Theory X and a host of central topics in twenty-first century geometry,
topology, and geometric representation theory indicates that we are seeing the
beginnings of a new revolution, one in which Theory X plays the dominant
physical role. Progress towards unraveling its structure and its consequences
will have broad ramifications.

Physics has long fueled developments in mathematics, and the past 30 years have
been a particularly fruitful period. The depth of mathematics which enters
fundamental physical theories has steadily intensified, and at the same time the
structure and predictions of these theories have had increasingly profound
impacts on mathematics. This project is one of many efforts to mine this
intellectually fertile mix of ideas. Our pursuit of Theory X will inevitably
illuminate a much broader circle of ideas and contribute to the mathematical
understanding of contemporary physics. The work of past generations at the
mathematics-physics interface fuels the modern world: our computers, GPS
systems, transportation, sophisticated medical tools, and much more owe their
existence to basic research in this area which stretches back well over a
century. While we cannot predict how current basic research will impact the
future, we can say with certainty that the effect will be far-reaching.
