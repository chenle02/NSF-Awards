The principal investigator (PI) will explore buffer management policies for ATM
(Asynchronous Transfer Mode) networks. Traffic concentrators and switch buffers
will be modeled as queues with impatient customers, possibly belonging to
different priority classes. The impatient customers correspond to cells or
packets from time-constrained traffic such as voice or video. The focus here is
the development of optimal scheduling policies which, for example, maximize the
number of customers served before their respective deadlines. The techniques
used will be based on sample path comparisons, stochastic dominance, and
stochastic dynamic programming.
