9350999 Natayan An Emerging Scholars Program based on the success of the
Professional Development Program pioneered by Professor Uri Treisman at the
University of California at Berkeley is being developed as a new joint
initiative of the mathematics department and the Mathematics Learning Center to
increase the number of minority students pursuing degrees in areas that require
strong mathematics and science preparation. Because the existing computers in
the Mathematics Department will be heavily used in support of general
mathematics courses, a laboratory which can be dedicated specifically to
students from underrepresented groups is being developed. The laboratory will
serve two primary purposes: It will provide a center where students learn to
explore and solve mathematical problems with the aid of the computer, faculty
and tutors; It will provide a facility where students can work individually or
in groups in an environment dedicated to cooperative learning. ***
