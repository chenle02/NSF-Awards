This grant provides the U.S. membership contribution toward core support for the
International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) for calendar years
2022-2024. IIASA is an independent, non-governmental, international research
institution devoted to interdisciplinary, policy-oriented research. It is
located in Laxenburg, Austria. Its research agenda focuses on systems approaches
to the analysis of the interconnected and interdependent challenges raised by
global transformations in the environmental, economic, technological and
societal spheres. IIASA offers a neutral venue for conceiving and analyzing
strategies for cooperative action on common problems in a globalized, rapidly
transforming world. IIASA is supported by a network of nongovernmental National
Member Organizations (NMOs) in 24 countries. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Building on
priorities laid out in its 2021-2030 vision, IIASA plans to focus its work on
six research themes during the 2022-2024 time period: 1) Biodiversity and
Natural Resources (BNR); 2) Energy, Climate and Environment (ECE); 3) Population
and Just Societies (POPJUS); 4) Strategic Initiatives (SI); 5) Economic
Frontiers; and 6) Advancing Systems Analysis (ASA). IIASA also plans to continue
to invest in international network building, capacity building, and science
diplomacy during the period of the award.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
