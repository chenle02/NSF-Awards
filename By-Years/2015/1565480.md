Many phenomena in physics and biology involve nonlocal effects, where distant
parts are allowed to influence each other. These phenomena are usually modeled
by partial differential equations (PDE) that incorporate nonlocal and nonlinear
terms. The purpose of this project is to study qualitative properties of
solutions to a variety of nonlocal equations, such as the Keller-Segel equation
that models the collective motion of cells which are attracted by a self-emitted
chemical substance; the surface quasi-geostrophic equation arising in the study
of atmospheric turbulence and oceanic flows; and the aggregation equation, which
describes the movement of large swarms of insects. The goal is to develop new
mathematical tools to analyze basic properties of solutions in order to gain a
better understanding of the physical and biological models.

Mathematically, the following questions will be investigated in this project:
For fluid models such as a 1D analog of Boussinesq equation, does the solutions
to the PDE have global well-posedness, or can the solution form a singularity in
finite time? For the aggregation equation with attractive kernels, where
formation of singularities always happens in finite time, the goal is to find
some notion of solutions that can be extended past the blow-up time. We will
also study a nonlocal system motivated by coral broadcast spawning, where two
densities evolve under diffusion, reaction and chemotaxis, and rigorously
analyze the effect of chemotaxis on the reaction rate. The nonlocal and
nonlinear nature of these equations poses many challenges in the analysis. To
overcome these difficulties, we will apply and develop a variety of analysis
tools including energy methods, comparison principle, optimal transport theory
and probabilistic methods.
