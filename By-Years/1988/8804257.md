The objective of the research is to establish basic design principles to
achieve robust communication over channels corrupted by thermal noise and by
unknown interfering signals of bounded power, using pseudo-random communication
systems. This work will complement and extend current research on communication
using error-control coding, interleaving and spread-spectrum modulation. Such
systems are special cases of those considered in this research project. Two
general issues are addressed. The first aims at establishing the potential
coding gain offered by pseudo-random communication systems. This question will
be addressed in the context of code-division multiple-access and interference
suppression (anti-jamming) applications. A key aspect of this problem is to
quantify the role of interleaving in robust systems. In the second part of this
research, the principal investigator will introduce and examine the structure
and performance of a new class of robust coding systems, called pseudo-random
codes, which generalize coding systems with interleaving and spread-spectrum
modulation. As in spread- spectrum these codes are driven by pseudo-random
parameters; however, coding, interleaving and spectral spreading are performed
simultaneously. Theoretical results show that within this family of codes are
some that, in some situations, achieve coding gains much greater than those that
can be achieved with spread-spectrum techniques for the same expended power,
bandwidth and complexity.//
