0440024&lt;br/&gt;Schaap&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this proposal is
to conduct an integrated study where different data sources and levels of data
quality, as well as different model complexities can be accommodated. This
project builds on extensive Maricopa Agricultural Center (AZ) site data
available. The objectives of proposed research are to 1) use a number of
different methods to measure soil hydraulic and other soil characteristics of an
existing monitoring site, 2) develop and evaluate pedotransfer functions (PTFs)
to estimate soil hydraulic properties for this site using a range of techniques
that require varying amounts of site-specific data, 3) compare hydraulic
properties determined using a variety of methods to asses the variability among
these methods, 4) conduct a hierarchical modeling study in which accurate 1D, 2D
and 3D site model for water and solute transport are established.
