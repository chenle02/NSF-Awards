9314910 Thompson The University of Texas will operate the Research Vessel
LONGHORN during 1993 as a general oceanographic vessel in support of NSF funded
research projects. The R/V LONGHORN is a 103' research vessel constructed in
1971 and stretched to its present length in 1986. The vessel is owned by the
University of Texas and operates primarily in the Gulf of Mexico. This vessel is
part of a fleet used by the National Science Foundation to support oceanographic
research. Most oceanographic research requires highly specialized equipment and
extensive support from a ship's crew. An increasing number of research projects
require equipment that must be permanently installed on a ship and for which the
ship must be specifically designed. Such equipment also requires highly trained
crew members for maintenance and operation. These vessels do not operate in the
same manner as general cargo or fishing vessels, therefore, NSF supports the
operation of a variety of ships specifically dedicated to oceanographic
research. These vessels are operated by universities and institutions around the
country.
