This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Teachers for Tomorrow Noyce
Scholarship program provides, over 5 years, a total of forty-nine $15,000
stipends to post-baccalaureate candidates with science and math degrees who
commit to teaching in high-need school districts. Recipients are enrolled in the
University of Connecticut's Neag School of Education Teacher Certification
Program for College Graduates (TCPCG). TCPCG is a highly competitive one-year
teacher preparation program that integrates coursework with school-based clinic
experiences. Completion of TCPCG leads to certification for grades 7-12 and a
Masters degree in Mathematics or Science Education. Recruiting for Noyce awards
includes a strong emphasis on diversity. The selection of Noyce scholarship
applicants follows existing TCPCG guidelines, which include consideration of
both academic and interpersonal skills. Partner schools, many in high need
districts (Hartford, Windham, Waterbury), provide fieldwork placements for all
teacher candidates. A robust data collection and evaluation plan measures
progress toward project goals. The Teachers for Tomorrow project increases the
depth of the mathematics and science taught in the schools. The gathered data
are analyzed to better understand the factors that call students into teaching
as well as factors that characterize effective teachers. Research papers are
submitted for publication and posted online. The 49 new Noyce Scholarship
teachers impact the learning of thousands of science and mathematics students
and help address a critical need of STEM education.
