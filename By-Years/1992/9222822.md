In this study in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program in the
Division of Chemistry ab initio electronic structure methods are being used to
study the ground and excited states of molecular systems. The focus is on the
comparison of various multi-reference correlation methods and on the testing of
combined perturbative-variational approaches. Applications include studies of
excited states of diatomic molecules near avoided crossings, low-lying excited
states of polyenes and other conjugated species, and the ground-state properties
of both symmetrical and asymmetrical alkali halide dimers. %%% Modern computer-
based computational methods are being used in this study to characterize the
energies and shapes of a number of different types of molecules both in their
ground and excited states. These molecular types include diatomics such as
oxygen, carbon monoxide, and aluminum hydride, various hydrocarbons, and such
high-temperature species as that formed by two sodium chloride molecules bound
together.
