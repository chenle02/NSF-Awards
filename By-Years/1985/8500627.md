Research involving the nonlinear analysis and optimal design of both two- and
three-dimensional dynamic mechanical systems is in progress. The nonlinear
analysis procedure uses a finite element technique incorporating material and
geometric nonlinearities, handles vibrational effects, and includes coupling of
deformations. Since the nonlinear analysis procedure is very complex, the
research also involves developing an efficient optimal design approach using an
optimality criterion technique to reduce computation time. Nevertheless, the
combined analysis-design procedure still requires an enormous amount of computer
time on the IBM 4341 currently available. Although a separate computer will soon
be available for this research to develop and run small- to medium-size
programs, access to a supercomputer will be provided so that the large programs
that will eventually result from this research can be run.
