This project is incorporating hands-on NMR spectroscopy at every level of
undergraduate coursework. The objectives of the project are to excite students
about chemistry by exposing them early to this powerful structural method; to
train them thoroughly in the methods and applications of modern NMR spectroscopy
in preparation for undergraduate research; and to prepare them to successfully
pursue graduate degrees. Students are introduced to simple applications of 13C
and 1H NMR as early as the fourth week of the first year. Working in groups,
they are instructed in NMR operation and perform NMR structural analyses of
unknowns. In several second-year courses, students use NMR to analyze product
mixtures, reveal stereochemical aspects of reactions, probe the conformations of
biomolecules, and determine solution magnetic susceptibilities. They also have
the opportunity to take an NMR projects course that provides instruction in
additional aspects of NMR. In the third year, students learn advanced
multidimensional techniques in a course that provides extensive hands-on
training to prepare students to use NMR in their Major Qualifying Project
research. The state-of-the-art NMR instrumentation provides students with an
exciting, high level, hands-on, and modern laboratory experience across the
entire 4-year program.
