Dr. de la Iglesia is one of four investigators who have organized a
Chronobiology Workshop that will take place on October 29, 2013 in Mendoza,
Argentina, one day before the XII Latin American Symposium of Chronobiology (XII
LASC). This Workshop will bring together Latin American (Argentina, Brazil,
Chile, Mexico and Uruguay) and US Chronobiology researchers to discuss and
challenge the latest ideas in the field and to promote future international
collaborations. Chronobiology has grown tremendously in the last decade in Latin
American countries, particularly Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Mexico. In most
cases, research teams are headed by Principal Investigators who were trained in
the US or Europe and who have returned to their home countries to establish
independent research laboratories. Exposure of US and European research teams to
projects taking place in Latin America offers a unique opportunity to foster
intellectual and ethnic diversity, to achieve access to new biological models,
and to develop strong academic links. Latin American upper-undergraduate,
graduate and postodoctoral students will participate in the Workshop and in a
specially designed Chronobiology course that will be held the day before the
Workshop.
