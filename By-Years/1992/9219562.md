The Gordon Research Conference on Mammalian DNA repair will be held February
1-5, 1993 in Ventura, California. There will be a general focus on molecular
biological approaches to the field with emphasis on understanding of basic
mechanisms. The program is broad enough that scientists who do not normally
interact will have the opportunity to do so, especially younger investigators
who have been especially encouraged to attend.
