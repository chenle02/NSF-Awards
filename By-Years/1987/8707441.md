The pyroclastic deposits erupted by Mt. St. Helens on May 18, 1980 have been the
subject0of intensive study by C. W. Criswell, a PhD student, for the last
several years. With the cooperation of the USGS and other academic researchers,
he and the PI have mapped a three-dimensional stratigraphic and facies network
and correlated it with six eruptive phases, defined by time interval. Chemical
and seismic data suggest that two magma types (white and gray) erupted from a
zoned magma chamber seven km. deep, and that these changes in the eruptive
materials relate to changes in the mechanism of eruption, as well as spatial
differences in the magma composition within the chamber prior to eruption." This
award will enable Criswell to continue these studies which could have important
imlications for predicting future eruptions at Mt. St. Helens and similar
volcanoes.
