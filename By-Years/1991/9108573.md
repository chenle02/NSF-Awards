This SGER award will provide immediate travel funds for a graduate student of
the PI to go study the ongoing eruption of Hecla volcano. Hecla started erupting
on January 17, 1991 and the PI and his student are particularly interested in
making real-time observations and collecting samples because of their particular
interest in the chemistry and dynamics of flood basalt eruptions.
