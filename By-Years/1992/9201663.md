This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of separations science. During the tenure of this three-year
continuing grant, Professor Guiochon and his students will investigate the
influence of the thermodynamics and kinetics of phase equilibria on
chromatographic separations performed at high concentrations. This research,
which builds upon results obtained under NSF grant CHE-8901382, addresses the
theoretical basis for liquid chromatography at high concentrations and the
experimental verification of that theoretical basis. This work includes studies
of nonlinear, nonideal systems that are common to both preparative scale and
analytical chromatography. %%% This research is of both theoretical and
practical significance and has as a goal the development of preparative scale
separations that are of critical importance in biotechnology.
