Conservation is only a nascent concern in regions with small populations and
minimal economic development. Studies of emerging conservation movements in
these regions have not determined whether these movements have indigenous roots
or whether they are responses to outside stimulation. Little also is known about
the ways traditional values and attitudes contribute to their establishment,
growth, and form. This doctoral dissertation project will study a fledgling
conservation movement in Quintana Roo, Mexico, which until about thirty years
ago was a virtually undeveloped territory of low population density and rich
natural diversity. Participant observation, interviews, and histories of
conservation groups will be used to illuminate the nature of local conservation
activities that have been carried out in the wake of rapidly increasing tourism,
agricultural activity, and immigration in the state. This project will provide
valuable information about the origins, progress, and factors that shape
conservation movements, and it could shed light on the changing roles of humans
as protectors and manipulators of their environments. This project also will
provide an excellent opportunity for a promising young scholar to continue to
develop independent research skills.
