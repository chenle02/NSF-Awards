Mario Micallef will continue his work in the following three areas: Riemannian
manifolds with non-negative curvature on isotropic two-planes; minimal surfaces
in flat tori; harmonic maps between complete, negatively curved manifolds. The
notion of curvature on isotropic two-planes was introduced recently in joint
work of Micallef and Moore. Positivity of this curvature seems to be the correct
generalization of such classical notions as pinching of the sectional curvature
and positive curvature operator. Micallef will proceed furhter towards a
classification of compact manifolds which admit metrics of positive curvature on
isotropic two-planes. The study of minimal surfaces in flat tori will hopefully
yield the first examples of stable minimal surfaces in manifolds of non-negative
sectional curvature which are not holomorphic with respect to any Kahler
structure on the ambient manifold.
