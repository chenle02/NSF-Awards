A Physics Laboratory Course improvement program has been developed by Physics
faculty at Southwestern Oregon Community College to more closely align
laboratory exercises and General Physics and Engineering Physics lecture topics
for science and non science majors who transfer to university level programs.
The principal goal is to increase opportunities for students to perform a wider
variety of experiments using appropriate laboratory equipment and to enhance
learning through physics simulations using microcomputers. The focus will be on
single topic labs keyed to Physics lecture material. A commitment to new
equipment, including computers, will update and enhance existing laboratory
equipment. Computer simulations of various physics experiments enhance
understanding of more complex general physics concepts which are not possible to
investigate in the laboratory - such as the motion of many bodies under gravity,
or electric fields in complicated geometrics - while introducing students to
computer use in a scientific setting. The college with match the award with an
equal amount of funds.
