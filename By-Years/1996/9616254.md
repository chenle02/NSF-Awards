The research has as its goal the development of efficient, scalable and portable
algorithms that allow learning and limited reasoning over very large
repositories of data. The goal is to combine these algorithms into an
environment that supports summarization of very large streams of data (data
mining) and the drawing of reasonably accurate conclusions from these summaries,
using probabilistic reasoning where appropriate. The following areas are being
investigated: (1) Efficient algorithms for reasoning in probabilistic networks;
(2) Efficient induction of provably accurate generalized decision trees; and (3)
Incorporating knowledge in memory-based reasoning methods. Of particular
interest are reasoning algorithms that perform queries and updates to data
extremely efficiently, perhaps in time which is sublinear to the size of the
original database, and learning algorithms that provide performance guarantees
on the accuracy of the answers by giving a confidence rating with the answer to
a query. The availability of high-speed, reliable, intelligent algorithms for
learning and reasoning from data will have important applications in digital
libraries, medical care, process control, and resource allocation, among other
areas.
