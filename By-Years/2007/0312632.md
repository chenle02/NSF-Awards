Sensor networks, with their massive information acquisition
potential,&lt;br/&gt;represent a mechanism by which Information Technology can
be used to&lt;br/&gt;mitigate the vulnerabilities of society with regard to
natural and&lt;br/&gt;manmade catastrophic events. Two critical components of
information&lt;br/&gt;management in sensor networks are: (a) secure data
distribution i.e.,&lt;br/&gt;identifying secure in-network sensor data storage
sites and determining&lt;br/&gt;their specific data contents in order to
maximize overall data security&lt;br/&gt;and minimize routing overhead to these
sites, and (b) data access via&lt;br/&gt;maximally secure energy-constrained
query reporting between data&lt;br/&gt;nodes. These problems cannot be solved in
a stand-alone manner, since&lt;br/&gt;optimal solutions in one area may lead to
sub-optimal solutions in&lt;br/&gt;others. This work proposes the development of
a unified analytical&lt;br/&gt;framework using game-theoretic techniques. The
proposed holistic&lt;br/&gt;information management framework will enable the
successful acquisition&lt;br/&gt;and efficient utilization of sensornet data by
identifying storage&lt;br/&gt;repositories, data contents, and secure query
reporting schemes that&lt;br/&gt;are optimally suited to each other. Efficient
algorithms for the above&lt;br/&gt;problems will be derived using a new Data
Security Index metric which&lt;br/&gt;explicitly accounts for the actions of
intelligent opponents and models&lt;br/&gt;sensors as intelligent agents
cooperating to achieve network objectives,&lt;br/&gt;such as maximal data
security and data access.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
