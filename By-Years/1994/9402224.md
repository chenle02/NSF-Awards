9402224 Foutch, Douglas A. The main objective of this research is to provide
experimental data and analytical results that will significantly improve current
practice of evaluation, rehabilitation and design of railway bridges. The
program will involve a cooperative effort among researchers from the Association
of American Railroads and the University of Illinois. Field tests will be
conducted to determine the loading spectra that railway bridges under current
operating conditions. Analytical studies will compare measured and calculated
member strains. New models for evaluating the remaining life of existing riveted
steel bridges will be developed. These are essential for the sound management of
the existing bridge stock and will assist the railroads in making important
decisions regarding the investment of capital funds. The research results will
help to improve the competitiveness of American railroads. ***
