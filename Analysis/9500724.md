9500724 Haskell This project involves the study of the index theory of Dirac-
Schrodinger operators on noncompact manifolds. In this area of index theory both
incomplete and complete noncompact manifolds can be considered from a single
perspective. The perspective combines techniques of regular singular theory and
operator algebras. It encompasses self-adjoint Dirac-Schrodinger operators as
well as those with nonzero Fredholm indices. It addresses problems in the index
theory of invariant operators elliptic in directions transverse to actions of
compact Lie groups as well as problems involving singular Riemannian foliations
and related questions on manifolds with conical singularities. These problems
all involve Hilbert space operators and their relation to the geometric
properties of manifolds, the higher dimensional analogues of surfaces. Partial
differential operators play a large role in this work. These operators occur
naturally in the study of applied mathematics and mathematical physics. The
overall goal is to compute invariants associated with these operators which
simultaneously yield geometric information and information about the nature of
solutions to important partial differential equations. ***
