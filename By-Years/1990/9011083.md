The principal investigators, David Hoffman and Joel Spruck, will conduct
research in differential geometry, calculus of variations and applied
Mathematics. This research has a strong computational component, while still
addressing problems of current theoretical interest. The computational side two
aspects: Implementation of algorithms to solve problems in partial differential
equations (arising from physical problems) and scientific graphics. This
research involves collaboration with many technical people and scientists from
other disciplines, as well as a large number of students and visitors and an
active research and training seminar. Critical to these projects has been the
creation of a computational laboratory, which has become the core of the
Geometry Analysis Numerics and Graphics Center (GANG). Under the technical
direction of David Oliver with collaboration of James T. Hoffman, senior
graphics programmer, the laboratory is not only supporting high level scientific
research, but also producing graphics tools for other sites and providing vital
technical assistance to mathematicians and scientists with the need for aid
scientific visualization. Among the active research projects are: construction
of periodic minimal surfaces; investigation of block copolymer interfaces
influenced by boundary constraints; computational fluid dynamics; computational
algorithms for plasma confinement; and theoretical and numerical investigation
of motion by mean curvature.
