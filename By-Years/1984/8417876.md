The formation reaction and properties of lignin graft copolymers are studied.
The objectives of the research are: to understand the initiator and the
initiation process of grafting of 2-propenamide to kraft pine lignin; to
identify the grafting site and measure grafting frequency; to determine how
physical, chemical and solution properties of the product vary as a function of
the reaction variable; to produce lignin graft copolymers with other monomers;
and to correlate the gathered data with pattern recognition processing. The
lignin graft copolymers will be used in water purification, soil stabilization,
well drilling, and cement grouting.
