Funds are being provided for joint sponsorship of a Gordon Research Conference
on Coastal Ocean Circulation that will occur on June 14-18, 1993 at Plymouth
State College, NH. The program will be a balanced mixture of observations,
theory and modeling. The focus is strongly on physical oceanographic processes.
Conference participants will include scientists, senior research students,
industrial representatives, and governmental program managers working on the
oceanography of continental shelves. The purpose of Gordon Research Conferences
is to provide a setting for stimulating and provocative discussions on topical
and promising future research areas. Coastal research is a high priority for NSF
and other agencies. The Coastal Ocean Program (CoOP) is a developing global
change research program, and a large interagency initiative is in the planning
stages.
