This project is adapting "Revitalizing Classroom Teaching and Learning: A
Beginning for Two-Year College Mathematics" from Greenville Technical College in
South Carolina. It partners with local industry to incorporate problem-solving
and real industry-based application into mathematics curriculum at three levels
of education: high school, two-year college, and four- year college/university.

Using the pedagogical approach developed in the Greenville project, this project
is accomplishing four objectives: 1. Revitalizing the mathematics curriculum
with work-based experiences, incorporating technology as both a teaching and a
learning tool, and fostering an interactive learning environment. 2. Building a
strong connection among high school, community college, four-year
college/university and industry by integrating mathematics content and industry-
based applications by spiraling through the three levels of education;
understanding the similarities and differences in mathematics vocabulary from
the academic to the work setting; and improving communication and articulation
among the three academic levels and industry. 3. Providing faculty professional
development opportunities to support collaborative learning methodology, student
engagement in learning and use of appropriate technology. 4. Developing "The
Process Guidelines" to revitalize curriculum, using from faculty journals.

The project accomplishes these objectives by: 1. Developing a replicable and
self-sustaining infrastructure that builds collaboration between education and
industry; highlighted by interaction through shadowing, site visits, classroom
visits, and externships; 2. Offering professional development activities to
increase teamwork use of technology in the classroom, and knowledge of
alternative teaching techniques that target different student learning styles;
3. Class piloting, refining and implementing of new teaching methods, work-based
problems, and student interaction within the classroom; and 4. Synthesizing and
generalizing faculty journals into a clear manual, "The Process Guidelines".
