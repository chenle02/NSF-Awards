Bayesian theory specifies how sets of probabilities should merge to a common
opinion under the effects of Bayes' rules applied to shared evidence. This
pooling provides a robustness in that after the data are obtained, decisions can
be taken without knowing which prior opinion was used. Also, it suggests
asymptotic theories which use sets of probabilities rather than a single
probability to represent a belief can share some of the properties of a strict
Bayesian theory. Less familiar, and the focus of this project, is the phenomenon
called 'dilation' for sets of probabilities. Dilation occurs when, regardless of
the evidence, the set of posterior probabilities for a given even properly
contains the set of prior probabilities for that event, as in, for example,
sequential decision making. Thus, dilation is the opposite phenomenon to the
merging of sets of probabilities. This project raises sever questions about the
importance of dilation for sequential decisions, and in particular, for the
Harsanyi-Selten theory of sequential games. The project delineates how
sequential decisions differ from normal decisions when dilation is present. Also
to be examined are issues concerning independence and contaminated models.
