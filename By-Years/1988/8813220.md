Paleoanthropology has generated a great deal of debate on the functional and
structural significance of the circumorbital region, especially the browridge,
in the evolution of primate and hominid skulls. Noone, however, has adequately
tested models of browridge development. The researcher will test hypotheses
relating to the adaptation of the circumorbital region to chewing stress and
differential growth patterns in several primate species from both the Old and
New World. He will generate much needed empirical data on interspecific
variation using biomechanical and nonmechanical models. This research will help
physical anthropologists develop a more comprehensive perspective on the
evolutionary morphology of the primate skull. The data can then be used to
generate more sophisticated models to explain hominid evolution.
