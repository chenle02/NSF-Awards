This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
will assist the Department of Chemistry at the Wayne State University in the
purchase of a Convex SPX writer, and a cluster of three HP 735 processors. This
equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including the following:
(1) perform numerically intensive calculations in the research areas of
electronic structure theory and chemical kinetics and dynamics; (2) further
develop general computer programs such as VENUS and Gaussian; and (3) educate
students in the field of computational chemistry. A workstation network of fast,
modern computer workstations is a new way to satisfy the computing needs of
chemistry departments. Such a "computer network" also serves as a development
environment for new theoretical codes and algorithms, and provides state-of-the-
art graphics and visualization facilities.
