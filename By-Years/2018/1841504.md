A Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop (PLMW) is being organized as part of
the 23rd ACM International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP) 2018, the
premier conference on the design, implementations, principles, and uses of
functional programming. The conference will be held in St. Louis, Missouri. This
award specifically supports students from underrepresented groups and gives
priority to US citizens and permanent residents to attend the mentoring workshop
in addition to the ICFP conference. The impact of the award relates to
broadening participation in computing, providing opportunities for students to
receive mentoring from leading researchers, and building the next generation of
researchers and knowledgeable practitioners in programming languages and related
topics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
