This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
magnetic microarray reader that, as part of a magnetics-based bioassay
technology, addresses mass consumer applications for microarrays. Magnetic
labels as reporters in DNA and immunoassays have already shown excellent
sensitivity. Previous versions of magnetic DNA arrays perform DNA and
immunoassays directly on the magnetic detector chip surface. A major hurdle for
this approach is the intertwining of bioassay surface chemistry and details of
magnetic sensor array fabrication. This personal assay reader would permit more
rapid breakthroughs in bioassay development by removing this hurdle. This will
be accomplished by physically separating the assay chip and the magnetic
microarray reader chip. The microarray biochemistry will be performed on a glass
slide or whatever surface is best for a given assay. The magnetic microarray
reader will be a separate chip with an array of magnetic sensors that physically
interlocks with the microarray slide during the assay
readout.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial application of this project is in
the area of microarrays for use in a wide variety of biological and biomedical
assays.
