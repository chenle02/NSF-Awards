Memory management consumes a great deal of time on today's computer systems, and
will take even longer in the future. Software techniques have successfully
hidden most of this overhead on personal workstations by shifting the work to
times when the system is waiting for user&lt;br/&gt;interaction. Such techniques
are less effective on SMP servers, where the overall computational overhead is
what matters. The Dynamic Memory Management Unit (DMMU), a special-purpose
hardware mechanism based on bitmaps and combinational logic can greatly diminish
this overhead. Preliminary results for three languages show that this approach
is much&lt;br/&gt;faster than software memory allocation, and consumes only
slightly more memory than software-allocation techniques. This proposal calls
for the integration of this hardware unit into SMP systems, which would allow
concurrent garbage collection in multithreaded-
multiprocessors&lt;br/&gt;environments. This can speed up the performance of
server applications written in Object-Oriented languages such as C++ and
Java.&lt;br/&gt;
