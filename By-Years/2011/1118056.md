The June 2010 Medano fire in Great Sand Dunes National Park, Colorado burned
6000 acres of the upland portion of a large watershed and was still smoldering
as winter set in. Several small rainstorms in the following months had
significant erosion impacts in these upper watersheds, and it is expected that
spring snowmelt runoff and larger summer thunderstorms in 2011 will have more
dramatic and widespread effects that may affect the visitor?s area. The early
months of 2011 offer a unique opportunity to track the debris flow and sediment-
laden flood responses in a wilderness area that has not been burned in more than
a century. The project will measure the coupling between runoff and erosive
response prior to and during vegetation re-establishment, create a predictive
hazards map for the watershed, and characterize surficial materials and relate
them to types of mass movement. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work will
advance understanding of post wildfire erosion processes and the role of
wildfire in landscape evolution, provide decision tools such as hazard maps for
the National Park Service to address safety and other concerns, and provide an
educational component for the general public through materials provided in the
Park.
