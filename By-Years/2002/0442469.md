This planning grant seeks funding for demonstrating proof of concept for the
proposed traveling exhibition "Inside Phoebe's Field." It is an outgrowth of the
prior NSF project (9979287) that resulted in an interactive book for middle-
school age girls. This project extends the book through exploring the
feasibility of using mixed reality in an exhibit format as well as virtual
environments using the Internet. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The
project will further the technology-enhanced three-dimensional storytelling
approach by development of selected science exhibit prototypes. The project team
combines academic, museum and professional expertise, as well as a partnership
with the Girl Scouts of the USA. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This
project will provide the ISE field valuable feedback about the use of metaphor
in storytelling in a science-based exhibition, as well as about the application
of new technologies (virtual reality, augmented reality technologies and
interactive electromechanical events) for creating exhibit experiences. At the
same time it will further the development of a national traveling science
exhibition whose primary target audience will be girls from ages 10 to 13.
