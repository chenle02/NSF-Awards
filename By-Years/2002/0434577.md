This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
Informatics for FY 2005. The fellowship supports research and training at the
postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational,
computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the
fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a
career in biological informatics in which research and education will be
integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics
at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through
these fellowships will play important roles in training the future workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled "A universal
approach for identifying previous hybridization events." Methods for
reconstructing the history of life assume that evolution occurs through
divergence. However, it's known that evolutionary branches sometimes converge as
a consequence of interspecies hybridization, but there are no reliable methods
for detecting earlier hybridization events. This research is developing and
testing a reliable approach for the identification of hybridization using
linkage disequilibrium and phylogenetic incongruence using North American
sunflowers as an experimental system. Also, simulation studies are being
performed to evaluate the conditions under which the method will be successful
and the sampling strategies that offer the most power for detecting hybrid
lineages.

In addition to solving a fundamental biological problem, this fellowship
enhances training in phylogenetic theory, statistical methodology and simulation
techniques. The skills learned and collaborations cultivated over the tenure of
this fellowship will be utilized in building a diverse research program in the
biological sciences.
