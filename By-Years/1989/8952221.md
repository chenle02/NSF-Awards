The final course in the biochemistry curriculum, which focuses on preparative
and analytical biochemistry, will be upgraded by introducing modern techniques
in nucleic acid analysis during six of the fourteen laboratory periods. The new
work includes identification of bacterial colonies harboring recombinant
plasmids using phenotypic and hybridization methods, isolation and analysis of
recombinant plasmid DNA, and isolation and sequencing of single stranded DNA
molecules. Major equipment includes facilities for preparing and culturing
bacteria, a vacuum oven and uv crosslinker for binding DNA molecules for
hybridization, centrifuge rotors and column chromatography for plasmic DNA
isolation, electrophoresis equipment for restriction endonuclease analysis and
sequencing the isolated plasmids, and uv transillumination and autoradiography
for visualization of nucleic acids. The college will provide 50% matching funds.
