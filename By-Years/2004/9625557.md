9625557 Kuh This project will study learning models in noisy and changing
environments. The environments are generally unknown and are learned through
observation examples presented at discrete times. Previous research has modeled
and analyzed how supervised learning algorithms (algorithms where inputs receive
labels) behave when confronted with slowly changing environments. This research
will continue to analyze the behavior of supervised learning algorithms, but
will focus on more complex reinforcement learning algorithms. The primary
objectives are to obtain a better understanding of reinforcement learning
methods to problems in signal processing and communications. Two applications
areas that are well suited to reinforcement learning approaches are sequential
detection problems and networking problems. ***
