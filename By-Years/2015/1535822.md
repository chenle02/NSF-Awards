This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of U.S. participants in
the "International Conference on Partial Differential Equations (COPDE-2015)"
that will take place March 25-29, 2015, at the Technical University of Munich,
in Munich, Germany.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the second in a series of
conferences that each year will bring together a host of international
authorities to explore a range of topics in the theory and applications of
partial differential equations. Among the topics for discussion at COPDE-2015
are the following: stochastic partial differential equations; the Navier-Stokes
equations; nonlinear Schrodinger equations and parabolic equations of paraxial
optics; and mathematical methods and computer simulation of tumor growth and
therapy. The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate
students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.
