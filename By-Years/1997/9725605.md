National Science Foundation Informal Science Education Program Abstract 9725605
Sciencenter Tech City Exhibition The Sciencenter will develop Tech City
Exhibition, a 2500 sq. ft. traveling exhibit that will promote awareness of
engineering as a process and a career. The exhibit will consist of a set of
twelve interactive exhibit stations presenting design tasks from various fields
of engineering related to the human needs of a hypothetical community called
"Tech City." The tasks will use engineering as an iterative process to meet
design goals (e.g. building a structure strong enough to withstand an
earthquake) while faced with constraints (e.g. a limited budget.) The primary
audience will be youth in their late elementary and middle school years with a
specific emphasis on women and other groups traditionally underrepresented in
engineering. A broad menu of complementary activities will be developed that
includes a hands-on program for visiting school groups, a teacher training
technology unit, career speakers' bureau, "Engineering Day at the Mall" program,
and activities especially created for families. The Association of Science and
Technology Centers will manage the national tour of the exhibit. It is schedule
to circulate for three years and reach an estimated one million individuals.
