Moore 0808853&lt;br/&gt;EOL/UCAR&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds are provided for the
proper handling of BEST (Bering Sea Ecosystem Study) data from initial field
collection, through quality control, and into an archive. This is essential for
the success of such a multidisciplinary effort. Data management support for the
full lifecycle of this project will enhance the ability of the investigators to
analyze and integrate their data and serve to preserve this unique information
in the long-term. The Bering Sea Integrated Ecosystem Research Program (BSIERP)
is a collaborating project sponsored by the North Pacific Research Board. It is
critical for data from both projects to be integrated to meet common key
scientific goals. Each of the two programs will have a separate data management
support component, but it will be important for the two groups to work together
to provide full and easy access to all project datasets. This award is intended
to provide primary data management support for the BEST project. The work,
though, will be coordinated with BSIERP data managers to help assure broad
access to the complete dataset. The PIs propose to provide continuing data
management services for the next 4 years of the BEST project. These services
will include field catalog support aboard each cruise and data archiving of all
project data. This proposal, together with work that was begun in support of the
first year of BEST, will help unify all data management tools and services
throughout the BEST campaign. The PIs will work toward an integrated archive
that provides full access to the wealth of data collected from BEST and
BSIERP.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs will support the needs of BEST through the
following tasks:&lt;br/&gt;1) They will provide an on-line field catalog onboard
the USCGC Healy during each BEST cruise to allow scientists accessibility to,
perusal of, and contribution of preliminary data and analyses, as well as
documentation of project activities. After each cruise is completed, the field
catalog will be re-installed at the PIs' BEST website for accessibility by the
scientific community.&lt;br/&gt;2) They will continue support for the BEST
archive by expanding it beyond the 2007 datasets to include new datasets from
the recently funded NSF PIs. This will result in a total of 4 years of field
data collection that will be supported. They will stage all final datasets and
accompanying metadata to the appropriate long-term archive. &lt;br/&gt;3) They
will work with BSIERP data managers to develop linkages between the BEST and
BSIERP archives. &lt;br/&gt;
