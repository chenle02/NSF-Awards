This project supports a Postdoctoral Research Fellow to study the formation and
growth of small particles in an environmental chamber. There is significant
interest in the formation of small particles in the atmosphere from volatile
plant emissions such as isoprene. Measurements in the laboratory will help to
quantify the probability of such gas phase species forming aerosol mass in the
atmosphere.

A key approach for understanding the formation of secondary organic aerosols
(SOAs) from isoprene is to study the uptake kinetics of epoxide species such as
dihydroxyl epoxides (IEPOX) and methacrylic acid epoxide (MAE) on aerosol
particles. Chamber studies will be performed at varying relative humidity (RH)
values to explore the effects of viscosity on reactive uptake. This research
will also examine the evolution of particle chemical composition as a function
of viscosity both qualitatively and quantitatively through mass spectroscopic
techniques. Results obtained from this research will improve models used in
climate studies, air quality assessment, epidemiology, and other areas of
environmental health that can affect public policy related to climate change and
public health.
