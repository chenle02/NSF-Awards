As the Internet evolves, so must the monitoring capabilities. This is especially
important for evolving applications which require dynamic resource allocation
such as collaborative applications, GRID technologies and distributed computing.
In addition, because of the complexity of the network and the rapidly changing
requirements of the applications, it is very difficult to predict performance or
capability. This proposal plans to develop a scalable performance monitoring and
dynamic prediction infrastructure based on The Network Weather Service (NWS).
The NWS operates a distributed set of performance sensors, applies a set of fast
statistical forecasting techniques in near real-time, and generates forecast
reports for the resources being monitored. The implementation is portable among
all the Grid middleware infrastructures. The proposal has two research foci; 1.
research and development to extend NWS Scalability 2. deployment as research
infrastructure

The goal will be to develop and deploy The Network Performance Oracle which will
provide a persistent, internet-accessible service for forecasting end-to-end
network performance.
