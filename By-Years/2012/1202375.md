The objective of this research is to develop algorithms and software for control
of complex robotic devices. The approach is to combine online re-planning and
offline learning within a novel mathematical framework, yielding richer and more
adaptive behavior than what is currently possible.

Intellectual Merit

Online trajectory optimization is the method of choice for controlling slow and
smooth dynamics such as chemical processes. However robot dynamics are much
faster and non-smooth, presenting formidable challenges to existing methods. The
proposed work will overcome these challenges, by leveraging a new mathematical
framework for stochastic optimal control where the problem is reduced to a
linear equation even though the underlying dynamics are nonlinear. These
algorithms will use a new physics engine that relies on parallel computing to
simulate robot dynamics orders-of-magnitude faster than real-time. Broader
Impact

The proposed work will change how robots and animated characters move. Currently
many robotic systems are controlled in open loop, or are designed to execute one
specific task well but cannot be versatile. Animation is mostly hand-drawn or
based on playback of motion capture data. This work will enable both robots and
animated figures to express more natural and versatile movements. Another
important contribution is to neuroscience and biomechanics, where many
researchers believe that the brain controls the body optimally, yet it is
difficult to predict what the optimal movements are in complex tasks. The
algorithms developed here will generate such predictions, and enable
quantitative model-data comparisons advancing our understanding of sensorimotor
brain function.
