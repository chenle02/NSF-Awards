The Grand Challenge Application Groups competition provides one mechanism for
the support of multidisciplinary teams of scientists and engineers to meet the
goals of the High Performance Computing and Communications (HPCC) Initiative in
Fiscal Year 1992. The ideal proposal provided not only excellence in science:
focussed problem with potential for substantial impact in a critical area of
science and engineering but also significant interactions between scientific and
computational scientist, that would have impact in high-performance
computational activity beyond the specific scientific or engineering problem
area(s) or discipline being studied. The methodology of quantum chemistry,
molecular dynamics, and solid state theory should, in principle, allow
predictions of the physical, chemical and electronic properties of materials.
This project will focus on bridging the gap between current methodologies for
atomic-level simulations of simulations and the level required for accurately
describing the important properties of real materials. Methodologies that will
be explored for the high capacity atomic level simulations, with implementations
on parallel computers, include: the Cell Multipol (CMM); Hessian-Based Singular
Valued Decomposition (HB/SVD); and the Pseudospectral Generalized valence
Bond(PS-GVB) method.
