9707770 Wolf The Department of Mathematics at Rice University will purchase 2
compute servers, 6 workstations, a laser printer, a 9.1 Gbyte hard disk, and
backup software. This equipment will be dedicated to the support of research in
the mathematical sciences. The equipment will be used in several research
projects, including Knot Theory and 3 Manifold Topology by Tim Cochran,
Differential Geometry by Robert Hardt and Michael Wolf, 3-manifold topology by
John Hempel, and Wavelet Analysis by R.O. Wells. The projects require both
numerical and symbolic computing, and depend heavily on the graphical display of
data.
