Digital Government: Proposal to investigate e-business transformation at the
National Science Foundation

This workshop will examine today's information technology resarch status and
products, and the variety of ways research granting institutions currently
accomplish their missions. That examination will support an extrapolation of
technology and organizational practices 5-7 years into the future, to consider
how those coming technologies and practices might be employed in a granting
institution's mission. Of interest also will be how the organization of such an
institution might be constructed to best take advantage of those technologies
and to ensure the appropriate injection of new technologies in achieving high
effectiveness in the furtherance of its mission.
