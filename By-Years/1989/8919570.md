Professor Stuart A. Rice is supported by a grant from The Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to perform both theoretical and experimental
studies on the interfaces between liquids and surfaces of various kinds. This
research is of fundamental importance in understanding the way in which liquid
molecules orient themselves when in contact with a surface. Rice plans to
continue his work on studying liquid surface interfaces along the following
directions: 1) to study the influence of valence and size differences between
alloy components on the longitudinal and transverse correlation functions in
liuqid-vapor interfaces; 2) to determine the influence of the contact medium on
the structure of the metal side of a liquid metal-X interface; 3) to perform a
theoretical study of the anisotropic transport of matter and momentum across an
inhomogeneous liquid metal-X interface; 4) to perform a theoretical analysis of
the metal-to-nonmetal transition in an inhomogeneous system; 5) to perform both
experimental and theoretical studies of supported monolayers of long chain
amphiphile molecules; 6) to perform experimental and theoretical studies of the
kinetics of phase changes in liquid supported monolayers of amphiphile
molecules; and 7) to determine the dimensions of adsorbed polymer molecules
using light scattering with incident evanescent radiation.
