Lesser Blum is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program to continue his statistical mechanical research in the area of
aqueous solutions using one center model potentials of water which can be solved
explicitly. The model consists of a spherical shell, a permanent electric dipole
and a short range directional potential for the hydrogen bond which includes up
to octupolar terms. Monte Carlo computer simulations have shown that atom-atom
correlation functions are in good agreement with experiment. Computer
simulations and formal analytical theory will be used to study ionic solutions
with this model, and the scaling behavior for both non-associating, pairwise and
multi- associating ions. Simple, analytical, yet accurate theories for ionic
solutions in water-like model solvents, both in homogeneous media and near
interfaces, are of interest in a large number of applications including:
chemical engineering equation of state applications, colloid chemistry, solution
kinetics, stability and folding of proteins, dynamics of biomembranes,
corrosion, and catalysis in electrochemical cells.
