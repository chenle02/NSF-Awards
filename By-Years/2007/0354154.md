This award provides support for 15 undergraduate students to engage in a summer
research experience at the University of California, Los Angeles Center for
Embedded Networked Sensing (CENS), an NSF-funded Science and Technology Center.
The students will have a unique opportunity at the Center to experience a
systems approach to undergraduate research training. Students will spend ten
weeks on site and will have the opportunity to have access to various activities
and events through the academic year through participation in the CENS Alumni
Network program. This program will serve to encourage undergraduates to pursue
advanced degrees in engineering and thus impact the nations need to increase the
number of U.S. citizens and permanent residents engaged in research-related
careers. It is also anticipated that this program will have a Broader Impact on
the nations need to have broader participation in the research enterprise of
citizens and permanent residents from demographic groups traditionally
underrepresented in science and engineering.
