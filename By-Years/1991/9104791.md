This project is to carry out geochemical, physical, and experimental analyses of
the pumice falls that resulted from plinian eruptions of Mount St. Helens. The
objectives will be to examine the relationship between changes in eruption
dynamics and differences in magmatic composition, rheology, and volatile
content. Changes in the storage of magma (e.g., pressure, temperature, degree of
volatile saturation) during the last 4,000 years at Mount St. Helens will also
be investigated and examined for correlations to variations in eruption
dynamics. This integrated physical-volcanologic, petrologic, and experimental
study of actual eruptions will complement theoretical work to better understand
the factors which control the style of explosive volcanism and the composition
of its products.
