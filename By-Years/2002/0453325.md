The Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Notre Dame is
sponsoring a NSF-REU Site for undergraduate research during the summers of 2005
- 2009. The focus of the proposed REU program is "Integrative Cell and Molecular
Biology." The primary goals of the program are to 1) expose students to the
excitement of scientific discovery, 2) help students develop the skills needed
to generate, analyze and report scientific data, 3) educate students on the
professionalism needed to succeed in graduate school and beyond, 4) give
students opportunities for leadership roles, and 5) encourage students to be
responsible scientists and citizens by providing service opportunities. To reach
these goals, participants will carry out research projects for 10 weeks. During
these 10 weeks, they will formulate their own research project, speak on their
proposed work twice, attend and coordinate a weekly seminar program to develop
professional and leadership skills, attend weekly journal clubs where students
present current published research, and participate in an optional service
component mentoring high school students. The underlying aim of the program is
to give students strong incentives for pursuing careers in research. Information
