The electrical grid is experiencing challenges with the expanding introduction
of distributed photovoltaic (PV) panels over neighborhood rooftops. Such PV
installations generate variable, uncertain and intermittent electricity supply
due to microscale weather patterns and diurnal variation. Understanding the
impacts of such an uncertain renewable energy resource requires high resolution
space-time irradiance data; however, fine scale irradiance data are rare, and
impacts assessments must therefore rely on simulated scenarios. In a parallel
vein, cryptocurrencies are increasingly common investment areas for businesses
and individual investors. However, the nascent state of the technology and price
record leave a dearth of historical data. Thus, financial modeling and
investment studies require simulated scenarios that consider the joint behavior
of multiple cryptocurrencies simultaneously. This project will develop new
methodology to produce realistic, synthetic data sets that can be used in risk
and impacts studies. Moreover, this project will support education and training
of students who will gain interdisciplinary research experience at the
intersection of statistics, renewable energy science and finance.

This research will develop new modeling frameworks for multivariate non-Gaussian
processes that exhibit intermittent jump-like behavior. Such approaches will
afford better understanding of the variability and intermittency of solar
irradiances and the joint behavior in major cryptocurrency portfolios. Space-
time in situ pyranometer-based measurements of irradiances and a suite of
popular modern cryptocurrency historical prices will be used to illustrate the
new approaches. The methods developed will directly benefit the fields of energy
science, meteorology, finance and economics with applicability in many further
disciplines including geography, ecology, environmental science and physics,
among others.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
