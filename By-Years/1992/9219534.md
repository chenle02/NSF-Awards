Ophiolite sequences are of considerable interest as exposed examples of ancient
seafloor or oceanic rocks. The Jurassic Apennine-Alpine ophiolites are unusual
in that they have no sheeted dike component with mafic lavas and chert directly
overlying serpentinite and gabbro. This project will examine the possibility
that the top of the serpentinite/gabbro basement may be the footwall of a large
low-angle detachment fault exposed on the seafloor prior to eruption of the
mafic lavas. Results should help develop models for ophiolite generation and the
role of extensional faulting in the subsequent evolution of the system.
