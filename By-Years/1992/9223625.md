This grant covers experimental Elementary Particle Physics Research on the
constituent structure of matter by a group at Johns Hopkins University in
collaboration with other NSF and DOE supported scientists. The group will
continue studying proton-antiproton annihilation as a member of the CDF
collaboration at Fermilab. The group will continue these studies to the highest
possible energies at the Superconducting Super Collider. They will also continue
research and development of silicon microstrip particle detectors at Johns
Hopkins University.
