9710306 Jain The scientific basis for the development of advanced materials and
their record performance is founded on our fundamental understanding of the
correlation between their properties and various aspects of the structure.
Unfortunately, there are few examples of such quantitative correlations for the
case of glasses and amorphous materials. Therefore, to strengthen the link
between the structure and propertieslperformance a first meeting of glass
researchers from universities, industry and govemment laboratories is proposed
with the purpose of establishing the practical implications of glass structure.
This Conference will be organized under the auspices of the University
Conference on Glass Science series to take advantage of its well established
structure and low costs. It is endorsed by the American Ceramic Society and
partially supported by industry. Students and young researchers will be
particularly encouraged to participate in this interdisciplinary activity by
offering them scholarships. The new information presented and generated at the
Conference will be published in the most widely read archival Joumal on the
subject. %%% This conference will attempt to to draw closer linkage between
research on the structure of glasses and the properties that result from that
structure. It will be held at Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA on June 17-20,
1997. ***
