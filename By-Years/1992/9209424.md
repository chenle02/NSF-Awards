This project will explore the application of heterogeneous intelligent software
composed of expert systems and artificial neural networks to manufacturing
process planning. Process planning is an important component of the
manufacturing life cycle where product designs are translated to steps and
processes for manufacturing. Process planning is critical to the subsequent
quality of the product, and the unit cost during manufacturing. Therefore, it is
an important contributor to an organization's ability to compete through the
cost to manufacture, utility and performance of its products. The project will
focus on developing a complete understanding of process planning and its
opportunities for intelligent computing. This includes the many manufacturing
operations, how each applies to each product design feature and the correct
sequence of operations. An appreciation for the best process/sequence
combinations leading to efficiency during the manufacturing phase and cost
effectiveness on the line is fundamental for a final project which applies
intelligent computing in an effective manner.
