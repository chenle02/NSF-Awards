This research uses a new approach, termed "activation-elicitation theory," to
study how the information present in an event is combined with the emotional
processes it evokes to shape the organism's response. The research focuses on
two simple learning paradigms, classical conditioning and habituation, that are
common to many species and situations. An essential idea of the analysis is that
we can make significant progress toward understanding the nature of human
reactions to complex situations by elucidating how prior learning and current
emotional state influence behavior in simplified paradigms like these. The
immediate goal of the research is to measure the relative contributions of prior
learning and emotional responsiveness to performance, using one of the "model
systems" of modern psychobiology, the eyeblink reflex system of rabbits.
Activation-elicitation theory prescribes methods for making such measurements,
which should lead to revised estimates of emotive processes in these examples of
simple learning. For example, certain procedures thought to promote new learning
may actually be effective because they produce emotional changes as well.
Clarifying this issue has both theoretical and practical significance.
Researchers often use classical conditioning to study the formation of simple
associations, assuming that higher levels of conditioned responding corresponds
to stronger associations or more information. A practical example of such
reasoning is to consider a drug or surgical treatment that increases conditioned
responding to be a potential aid to learning and memory. The present approach
sharply questions the validity of such an interpretation; increased responding
may only indicate an effect of the treatment on emotional responsiveness. The
long-range goal of this research is to improve our knowledge of simple adaptive
processes. Such knowledge is essential for progress in understanding the
biological basis of learning and memory.
