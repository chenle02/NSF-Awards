This project will add automatic computer control to a laboratory distillation
column with on-line sampling and analysis. A continuous refractometer and
gas/liquid chromatograph equipped for direct process analysis, sample-
conditioning, and meter/injection systems will complete the feedback loop
through an IBM PC to an existing computer. The resulting equipment will provide
up-to-date instruction in the operation and control of batch and continuous
distillation processes.
