This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project will develop a
hybrid, co-flow laser material deposition system in order to enhance the ability
to fabricate materials with nanocrystalline microstructures and to produce
miniature, three dimensional structural components such as dental implants and
stents directly from a CAD (Computer Aided Design) solid model. This work will
leverage two technologies previously developed by the researchers : (a) Laser
Engineered Net Shaping (LENS), and (b) Direct Write Electronics (DWE). The LENS
process provides the ability to fabricate large structures directly from a CAD
solid model, whereas the DWE process provides the ability to fabricate
microelectronic components directly from a CAD
representation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal commercial application of
this project will be in the field of miniature biomedical components. Additional
applications are expected in the field of electronics and defense.
