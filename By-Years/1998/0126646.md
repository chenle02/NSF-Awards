Biological Sciences (61)&lt;br/&gt;In this project we are taking advantage of
recent advances in video and computer technology to improve student experiences
in our undergraduate Biology curriculum. We are introducing four digital
microscopy workstations into our cell biology, microbiology, and plant
physiology courses. These workstations permit us to offer laboratory exercises
that expose students to techniques and phenomena normally confined to the
research laboratory. We are adapting research techniques from the contemporary
science literature and building upon the efforts of several other project
supported by NSF that incorporate digital microscopy workstations into the
undergraduate curriculum (e.g., DUE-0088185, 9952672 and 0088412). For example,
phase and fluorescence microscopy is being used in experiments to examine the
various cell compartments and dynamic processes such as organelle transport and
cell migration. Students have the capability to make digital records, including
time-lapse movies, of their phase and fluorescence observations. It is our
experience that experiments that include fluorescence and video microscopy
generate the greatest excitement among our students.&lt;br/&gt;
