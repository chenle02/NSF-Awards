Electron spin resonance is a very powerful technique for studying materials
properties. Usually the technique is applied to homogeneous materials. Recently,
imaging methods derived from nuclear magnetic resonance have been used to obtain
ESR images of heterogeneous materials. The development of a commercial
instrument is now viable with existing magnet and electronics technologies. This
work will lead to the development of equipment for ESR imaging to make it
available to the appropriate researchers in material technology. It is only
through the commercial availability of such equipment that the true applications
of this powerful technology will be realized.
