This is a group effort involving researchers at the University of Colorado,
Boulder (Gary Hachtel and M. Lightner), at the University of California,
Berkeley (R. K. Brayton, A. R. Newton and A. Sangiovanni-Vincentelli), and at
Stanford University (G. De Micheli). The long-range goal is understanding the
theoretical structure needed for optimization of VLSI (very large scale
integrated) design parameters in novel (application- specific) applications. The
approach is to explore unified and systematic methods for both combination and
sequential logic synthesis and minimization, which includes research on
behavioral and structural synthesis tasks at higher levels of abstraction.
Specific objectives are: (1) performance oriented synthesis (e.g. optimizing the
delay/area tradeoff); (2) maximization of testability; and (3) extension of size
capability to VLSI-sized problems. A comprehensive set of theorems, algorithms,
mathematical models and their corresponding intermediate forms, and software
tools will be developed. Central to the effort is utilization of their research
paradigm involving a consistent mathematical treatment, optimization-based graph
algorithms, and optimized mapping from one level of abstraction to the next.
