For ages older than mid-Mesozoic, apparent polar wander (APW) paths of the
major continents become the most important single source of information about
lithospheric plate motions. The validity of these APW paths and the degree to
which they can be interpreted in terms of path geotectonic motions is ultimately
dependent upon the quality of he paleomagnetic poles on which they are based.
Recent studies have indicated that the Mesozoic North American APW path can be
well modeled by paleomagnetic Euler pole (PEP) analysis in which the APW path is
viewed as sequence of small circle tracks separated by corners or "cusps" in the
path. The "J1 cusp" occurs in the Late Triassic to Early Jurassic and is related
to changing North American plate motion associated with the breakup of Pangea.
However, because of inadequacies in the paleomagnetic pole data base, the J1
cusp is certainly not as clearly defined as it could be with acquisition of
high-quality paleomagnetic data. Recent results from the Moenave Formation
clearly demonstrate that careful paleomagnetic studies can produce very well
defined poles from the Late Triassic-Early Jurassic strata of northeastern
Arizona. Further paleomagnetic studies of the Chinle, Kayenta, and to her
formations will be performed in this project in order to more clearly define the
pattern of North American APW during this critical time interval. Results will
(1) greatly improve knowledge of Late Triassic and Early Jurassic APW for North
American and (2) provide a major test for applicability of PEP models, with
attendant global geodynamic implications.
