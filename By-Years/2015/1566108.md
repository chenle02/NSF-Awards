In this project, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms A of
the Chemistry Division, Professor Edwin Sibert is extending current theoretical
models of stretching and bending vibrations of molecules. In general, the
frequencies of vibrations provide insights into the arrangements of the atoms
that make up a molecule. The model being developed by Sibert allows
experimentalists to gain additional information so that they can use the
frequencies of the vibrations observed in the laboratory to obtain an atomistic
picture that includes the molecule's local structure and environment.

High resolution infrared spectra of the CH and OH stretch regions are complex;
there are many spectral features, and no simple theory enables one to extract
insights from the relative positions and intensities of these features. The aim
of this project is to provide experimentalists the theoretical tools required
for extracting structural and environmental information from high resolution
spectra. Designing drugs and predicting outcomes of combustion reactions depend
on chemists' ability to determine the relative stabilities of various chemical
species and understand how environment affects those stabilities. The broader
impact of this project includes generating open source computer software to
enable scientists to measure and understand these stabilities as well as to
provide a training ground for students in this research area.
