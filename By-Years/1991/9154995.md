The University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff will initiate a six-week, commuter
Young Scholars project in Physics and Computer Science for 16 students entering
grades 10 and 11. Morning sessions will focus on classroom instruction and
hands-on activities in physics and computer usage. Afternoons will be devoted
completely to research activities. Participants will write a paper and make a
presentation about their research projects at the end of the summer activities;
parents and teachers will be invited to attend the paper presentations.
