The Earth was likely built as a result of a series of a series of collisions of
increasingly larger planetesimals, during the first 50 million years of Solar
System history. Growth of the planet largely terminated after a final, giant
impact that led to melting of much of the Earth and the creation of the Moon.
Surprisingly, there is strong evidence present in the isotopic compositions of
some elements in both ancient and young rocks that domains were created within
the Earth?s mantle during the primary construction period of the Earth before
the giant impact, and these domains have been somehow preserved to the present.
This study will examine the tungsten and ruthenium isotopic compositions of
rocks derived from these domains to provide new insights to processes occurring
within the Earth as it grew, as well as help to constrain the genetic origins of
the building blocks of our planet. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Small variations in the
abundance of 182-tungsten in terrestrial rocks likely reflects the decay of
182-hafnium, coupled with very early chemical fractionations of the two elements
within the silicate portion of the Earth. Prior studies have suggested that
modest variations in 182-tungsten among some primitive rocks may reflect
processes occurring in early-formed magma oceans. This study will seek to more
fully establish the causes of the isotopic heterogeneities, and assess why
convective stirring of the mantle has not mixed away the heterogeneities in more
than 4.5 billion years. The isotopic composition of Ru varies among planetary
bodies in our Solar System as a result of the incorporation of diverse mixtures
of nucleosynthetic components. Hence, if the Earth was built from genetically
diverse materials, early-formed mantle domains identified by tungsten isotopic
variations, may contain ruthenium that is isotopically distinguishable from the
dominant composition of the mantle today. If so, the particular building block
identified may be tied to a specific type of cosmochemical precursor.
