The introspective facilities of a programming language are those facilities that
support explicit access, modification, or control of internal state components
of the language processor (or runtime environment). Examples of such internal
state components are the control stack, the environment, the current expression
or instruction, the heap, the I/O system, the interrupt systems, and the garbage
collector. The development of languages based on reflective tower architectures
has demonstrated that machine-independent access and modification of a language
processor's current expression, environment, and control stack can be provided
in a unified, coherent, and semantically principled manner. This research is
concerned with extending the range of machine- independent introspective
facilities available to programming languages. There are two facets of this
extension. One is to extend introspective capabilities to additional language
processor state components, such as the store, I/O system, interrupt system, and
garbage collector. The second facet is to investigate introspective capabilities
in the context of common programming language and programming environment
features, such as concurrent processing, encapsulation and privacy mechanisms,
and compilation.
