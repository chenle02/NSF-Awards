The objective of this project is to improve the lateral resolution of ultrasonic
echo scanners for use in mammography. Presently, the resolution is limited to a
few mm due to diffraction-induced wavefront distortions. To improve the
resolution of very large transducers it should be possible to compensate for the
distortions by using adaptive weight control techniques. With these techniques a
ten-fold improvement in the present resolution of commercial systems should be
able to be achieved. This project will first investigate the 1 D transmission
problem followed by 2D transmission and 2D reflection studies. Ultrasound is a
relatively low-cost imaging modality, however, improvements in the lateral
resolution are needed before this modality can be used more widely in the
medical field.
