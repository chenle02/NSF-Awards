The long-term goal of this research is to understand how salt marsh primary
production and soil chemistry will change in response to increasing
anthropogenic and natural environmental modifications. Results from this ongoing
study show that there are large differences between years in salt marsh
production that appear to be caused by salt concentration of marsh soils, and
that complex interactions among sea level, flooding frequency, soil chemistry
and chemical cycles affect not only salt marshes, but their entire associated
estuaries. The established relationship between increasing marsh productivity,
high soil salinity and increasing sea level rise suggests that productivity will
decline under two conditions: 1) the relative elevation of the salt marsh rises
and becomes unfavorable for growth or 2) the current rapid rate of sea level
rise decreases. Research is proposed over the next five years that will test the
following hypotheses: first, the long-term observed increase in marsh primary
production will reverse when the rate of sea level rise slows or reverses; and
second, long-term changes in nutrient concentrations in marsh soils will
parallel changes in marsh production. This study will provide a scientific basis
for predicting how coastal wetlands will respond to changing sea level - a
problem of particular importance in coastal areas like Louisiana. It also
provides results that will help environmental managers to understand trends in
water quality. The study also contributes to several broader initiatives focused
on understanding salt marsh ecology, and funded by several federal agencies.
