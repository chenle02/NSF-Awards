This fellowship will support research at the interface of biology, sociology,
mathematics, and statistics. The Fellow has developed very general preference-
based mating systems in both stochastic and deterministic frameworks. These
systems have application in host-vector interactions, the propagation of
cultural traits, disease transmission dynamics, and food web dynamics. The
Fellow is developing courses that will train students in modeling, mathematical
population studies, and state-of-the-art computer technology.
