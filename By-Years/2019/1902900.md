This grant provides funds to support 15 graduate students, including those from
under-represented groups, to participate in PHONONICS 2019, which is the 5th
International Conference on Phononic Crystals/Metamaterials, Phonon
Transport/Coupling and Topological Phononics. Activities will include attendance
in the conference sessions, presentation of a poster, and participation in (1)
evening technical mini-lectures and (2) mini-workshop on career planning and
development for young researchers. The mini-lectures will focus on emerging
topics in the areas of phononics such as additive manufacturing, computational
methods, and topological acoustics and its potential applications. The mini-
workshop on career planning and development will help the graduate students to
begin to shape their careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will facilitate
the formation of a cohort of graduate students in the multidisciplinary field of
acoustic metamaterials and phononic crystals. Furthermore, this project will
prepare these students for the leadership in this emerging scientific and
technological field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
