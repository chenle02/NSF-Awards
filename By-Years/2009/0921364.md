This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through this award from the Major
Research Instrumentation (MRI) program, Professor Fadi Bou-Abdallah at SUNY
Potsdam will acquire an isothermal titration calorimeter. It will support the
research of colleagues at Potsdam, and nearby St Lawrence and Clarkson
Universities. The primary research studies will include, 1) elucidation of how
transferrin interacts with its specific receptor to bring about the efficient
delivery of iron to cells, 2) thermodynamic characterization of enzyme behavior
in room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs), 3) characterization of the
thermodynamic interactions between neuron specific enolase (NSE) and anti-NSE
antibody, 4) studies of heavy metal ion chelates with glutathione active
complexing groups, 5) determination of the binding stoichiometry of two isoforms
of the regulatory enzyme Rubisco Activase (RA) with Rubisco and thermodynamic
characterization of these binding events, and 6) determination of the
thermodynamics of nogalamycin binding to DNA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Isothermal
titration calorimetry (ITC) is a very sensitive thermodynamic technique that is
used to characterize binding interactions between species such as a small
molecule to an enzyme. ITC measures directly the heat absorbed or released
during a binding reaction. This provides insight on the strength of chemical and
biochemical binding interactions. This instrument will be used in research by
undergraduates at the three collaborating institutions and made available to
other institutions in the region. It will be incorporated into several upper
division level laboratory classes.
