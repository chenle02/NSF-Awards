The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to generate an integrated model analyzing
biogeophysical and socioeconomic processes and responses to environmental
transformation. Natural disasters have incurred direct damages costing an
estimated $18 B a year, and the average net benefit of investing in more
resilient infrastructure is $4.2 T. Proactive adaptation can significantly
reduce both the direct and indirect costs associated with climate hazards and
natural disasters, protecting people, homes, lifestyles and businesses.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project addresses risk management associated with environmental transformation,
bridging the biophysical and social sciences and informed by real-time
observations. The project aims to provide a first proof-of-concept of an
advanced model representing a range of integrated environmental risks, such as
erosion, flooding, food security, etc. The research and development effort will
focus on: 1) Integrating biophysical sensitivities to to produce risk factors
for hazards of concern; 2) Including community engagement to identify which
biophysical sensitivities translate to socioecological vulnerabilities or
opportunities; and 3) Identifying outcomes of the socioeconomic vulnerability
assessments and scenarios. The envisioned proof-of-concept is a cost-effective,
data-driven solution for proactive management of environmental
transformations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
