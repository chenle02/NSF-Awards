This award supports Professor Richard Perez of the State University of New York
at Albany to continue a very productive research collaboration in atmospheric
physics with Professor Pierre Ineichen of the Applied Physics Group of the
University of Geneva, Switzer- land. This international collaboration builds
upon and enhances his ongoing and planned domestic research. Specific objectives
for their joint research are the further improvement of solar radiation
conversion models and the modelling of sky luminance angular distribution. They
are also committed to the collaborative acquisi- tion, quality control and
analysis of radiation data as a contribu- tion to the International Daylighting
Measurement Program of the World Meteorological Organization. This research
links and enhances U.S. and Swiss research dealing with the measurement and
modelling of sky and ground reflected solar radiation. It has produced valid
models to convert routine solar radiation measurements into quantities suited to
various daylighting and solar energy applications. A better understanding of the
nature and impact of ground reflected radiation will aid in the structural
design of energy efficient buildings.
