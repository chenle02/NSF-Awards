AST-0312498&lt;br/&gt;Connolly&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will create
analysis tools for multi-dimensional data sets, in order to address the problem
of the expected flood of information from current and planned surveys of the
sky, and to start making sense of the resultant panchromatic view of the local
and distant Universe. Utilizing recent advances in statistics and new
computational techniques will overcome the limitations of earlier approaches and
lead to rapid and efficient tools for extracting correlations. Astrophysical
data, not simulations, will be used to test these new algorithms, which will
involve dependency trees, non-linear dimensionality reduction schemes, and
Bayesian networks. The methods to be developed will have a broader impact in all
areas where massive data sets need analysis. The training of graduate students
to be as comfortable with the latest statistical or computer science techniques
as they are with astrophysical problems will have an educational
impact.&lt;br/&gt;
