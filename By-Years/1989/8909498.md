The objectives of this research are a) to develop Coordinate Rotation Algorithms
(CORDIC) using complex arithmetic; b) to develop a fault tolerant Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) array architecture; and c) to develop the VLSI
implementation of a fixed-point CORDIC SVD processor-array element. The
principal investigator has previously shown the applicability of high-speed
computer arithmetic algorithms, which includes the mapping of CORDIC to the SVD
of real matrix. Based on the CORDIC data path chips designed, fully custom CMOS
chips are being fabricated through the MOSIS service. The data path designs are
then combined to yield a complete array-element chip and configured into a
prototype array. Improvements to numerical algorithms will lead to a CORDIC SVD
processor using complex arithmetic. Recent advances in VLSI have encouraged the
development of special- purpose processor arrays to solve computation-intensive
numerical algorithms. SVD is an important matrix computational method for real-
time signal processing and image processing. The results developed here will
result in a custom, low-cost, reconfigurable, high-speed VLSI SVD array, which
will allow many applications to be solvable in real time.
