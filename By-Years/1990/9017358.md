This research is to study the historic earthquakes (1906-1960) that have
occurred along the South American subduction zone; eleven earthquakes have
occurred between 1906 and 1960 with magnitudes greater than 7.8. The results
will be compared with recent, post-1963, earthquakes that have occurred along
the South American subduction zone. The goal is to obtain a more complete
picture of subduction zone earthquakes, fault segmentation and rupture mode
along this active plate boundary. By this means, better constraints on the
seismic hazards and seismic potential along this and other subduction zones can
be estimated. This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard
Reduction Program.
