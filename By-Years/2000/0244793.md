The proposal is to investigate beam dynamics problems &lt;br/&gt;on space charge
dominated beams, beam cooling, and &lt;br/&gt;beam manipulation techniques in
storage rings. &lt;br/&gt;Topics of our research include nonlinear beam
dynamics, beam cooling, &lt;br/&gt;advanced beam manipulation techniques, design
of compact medical &lt;br/&gt;synchrotrons, and high gain free electron lasers.
&lt;br/&gt;Our results have been employed to control and alleviate
&lt;br/&gt;collective beam instabilities in high intensity storage rings,
&lt;br/&gt;to provide design criterion for power &lt;br/&gt;supply ripple in
high energy colliders, and to develop new methods &lt;br/&gt;for emittance
preservation in high brightness storage rings. &lt;br/&gt;Some applications of
high brightness beams are radioactive ion-beam &lt;br/&gt;accelerators,
spallation neutron source, heavy ion fusion, &lt;br/&gt;biochemistry and bio-
medical, material science, and defense research. &lt;br/&gt;The proposed
research is also important in training accelerator physics &lt;br/&gt;graduate
and undergraduate students. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
