This action funds Nicholas Day of Portland State University to conduct a
research project, entitled "A light-absorbing catalyst to stimulate the
conversion of carbon dioxide to methanol," during the summer of 2012 at Osaka
University in Suita, Osaka. The host scientist is Dr. Shunichi Fukuzumi.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is advancing the knowledge of
potential renewable energy sources. The direct focus of this research is to
investigate a novel material with the potential ability to use renewable
resources to produce liquid fuel which can be utilized with current
infrastructure. In particular a cobalt metallated poly-
tetrakis-5,10,15,20-(4-aminophenyl)porphyrin is being used to reduce carbon
dioxide to methanol using only sunlight. Methanol is seen as a viable source of
energy for the near future.

The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-
hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science,
science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce. Also planned is a solar cell demonstration to students at
Takarazuka-Kita high school. Providing education of renewable energy sources to
students in Japan is highly relevant considering the high demand for new energy
sources in Japan and the U.S.
