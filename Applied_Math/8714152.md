Viscoelastic flows exhibit behavior intermediate to that of an elastic solid
and a viscous fluid. Although several models of viscoelastic flows are currently
available, these models do not accurately describe the flows in all situations
of interest. The proposed research will involve a comprehensive analysis of the
mathematical behavior of the equations which govern both steady and transient
viscoelastic flows. Classical numerical methods for the solutions of
differential equations are difficult to employ in this problem because of the
character of the governing equations and the nature of the singularities.
Reliable numerical methods for viscoelastic flow simulation will be developed.
Results may shed light on the validity and plausability of the constitutive
models used. The future of materials processing will be strongly influenced by
the ability to simulate viscoelastic flows. This work is concerned with the
underpinnings of simulation.
