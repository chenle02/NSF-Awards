This award funds the research activities of Professor David Tucker-Smith at
Williams College.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has
already made enormous progress pushing forward the high energy frontier. During
the coming years, the LHC will continue to probe some of the deepest mysteries
in particle physics, including the origin of elementary particle masses and the
nature of dark matter. In his research, Professor Tucker-Smith studies
extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics, with an emphasis on
understanding how these theories can be tested at the LHC. As part of this
project, Professor Tucker-Smith will study models that address a surprising
experimental development from the Tevatron at Fermilab --- measurements of an
anomalously large forward-backward asymmetry in top-antitop production. He will
also study the LHC phenomenology of theories with a particular type of new force
carrier, theories incorporating new ideas for dark matter, and theories in which
the Higgs sector, the part of the model responsible for generating the masses of
the elementary particles, differs from that of the Standard
Model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will also have signficant broader
impacts. Undergraduate involvement is a central part of the Professor Tucker-
Smith's research program. Students will have the opportunity to engage in
particle physics research, and through their work they will learn important
ideas, methods, and results relating to particle phenomenology and to
theoretical physics in general.
