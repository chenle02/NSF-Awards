The proposed research is concerned with language modeling and handwriting. The
goal of the language modeling research is to represent the computations
performed in the comprehension, production, and acquisition of human languages.
Computations may be described at various levels of abstraction: as a sequence of
state transitions (least abstract), as an algorithm (more abstract), and as a
computational problem (most abstract). The first step in the proposed research
is to characterize the three central computations of human language
(comprehension, production, and acquisition) at the highest level of
abstraction, as computational problems. Each such problem statement is a
computational theory of a portion of language. The total sum of all such problem
statements is a comprehensive computational theory of human language. The goal
of the handwriting recognition research is to accurately model the human
handwriting process. Such a model is, crucial to improving current handwriting
recognition technology. To accomplish this, the statistical constraint inherent
in handwriting, including physical constraints arising from the biomechanics of
the pen/hand system, motor-perceptual constraints arising from the shared desire
to communicate efficiently and reliably, and constraint due to the ad-hoc
convention of handwriting, such as the chosen alphabet and language is
explicitly modeled. //
