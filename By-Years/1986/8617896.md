The Furnarii is an assemblage of approximately 500 species of passerine birds
in South and Central America that live in many habitats and have a variety of
life styles. The group shares a common ancestry and exemplifies the historical
process of adaptive radiation, in which a single group evolves into a diversity
of ecological niches. This general process and its results will be studied
through the comparative anatomy of the limb muscles of representative species.
These will be dissected under the microscope and the anatomical variations will
be described and recorded. These variations will then be used in a computer
analysis to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the group. This phylogeny,
in turn, will be used as the basis for a new classification of the group, and of
an explanation of its interrelationships. In addition, the historical pattern
thus developed will be analyzed in terms of the locomotor specializations of the
various species so as to reconstruct the historical process of adaptive
evolution. Thus, the study will be significant at two levels of analysis. The
first is as a specific study of a particular group of organisms, and the second
is as a general study of the widespread phenomenon of adaptive radiation.
