ABSTRACT Lisa Xu 9523082 Heat transport between blood vessels and their
surrounding tissues will be studied theoretically and experimentally. The focus
of the work is on matched pairs of blood vessels between 80 and 200 microns in
diameter, the model of which will be an exteriorized rat spinotrapezius muscle.
The experimental approach includes infrared imaging of the tissue preparation
and Doppler velocimetry of the blood flow. Exisitng analytical models will be
evaluated and extended to support the experimental findings. Applications
include tissue freezing, cryopreservation, laser surgery and hypothermia
protocols.
