The purpose of this project is to provide undergraduate students With
opportunities to work with a major and increasingly important scientific
instrument and to explore the methods of investigation and analysis that this
instrument can support. The instrument that will be purchased is a Bruker High
Resolution Fourier transform 1H/13C & nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer
system. This instrument will be used to create contemporary examples of proton
and carbon NMR spectra for use in the classroom teaching of organic chemistry,
to analyze intermediates, products and unknowns in the undergraduate
instructional organic laboratory, to present contemporary methods for the
determination of molecular structure in the advanced organic chemistry course,
to investigate enzyme-catalyzed reaction in biochemistry, and to provide
opportunities for sophisticated experiments in the areas of structure
determination, reaction mechanisms and kinetics for group projects and in
student/faculty research. The project includes plans to make data, spectra, and
other materials obtained with this instrument available to others who do not
have access to this type of equipment.
