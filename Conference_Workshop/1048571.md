This award provides support to defray expenses of participants, especially
women, graduate students, postdocs, and young faculty, in a 2-day workshop on
analysis and geometry at Louisiana State University from January 4-5, 2011. This
workshop precedes the annual Joint Mathematics Meeting in New Orleans and takes
the opportunity of this close-by event to gather well-known experts, young
researchers, and graduate students for additional discussion and interactions.

The proposed workshop would bring together people working in different parts of
harmonic and geometric analysis. This meeting will provide a stimulating forum
to cross over the narrow imaginary boundaries between research groups with the
aim that techniques, tools and ideas from different specialties will create new
collaboration. The workshop will also create a forum where young emerging
researchers have an opportunity to meet and interact with established experts in
a small group. It will also give graduate students an opportunity to present
their work and get new ideas and perspectives.
