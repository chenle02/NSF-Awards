This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial Biology for
FY2002. The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of
protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are
not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides
opportunities for recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in
microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of
established scientists, and to broaden his/her scientific horizons beyond the
research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These
fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their
research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves
of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign
locations.

The research and training plan is entitled "Have colicin type antibiotic genes
evolved to increase their host bacteria's competitiveness, or are they selfish
addictive genes?" Colicin type bacteriocins are believed to have evolved as
allelopathic agents that confer a competitive advantage to bacterial strains
that harbor them. This research investigates an alternative hypothesis that
colicin plasmids are selfish elements and utilize a form of post segregational
killing to insure their maintenance by host bacteria.
