Sea urchin herbivory has been demostrated to be a controlling factor in limiting
the distribution of kelp forest habitats. But as yet, its role in limiting the
distribution of seagrass habitats in inadequately investigated. In addition,
bioturbation by infaunal invertebrates, i.e., ghost shrimp and sand dollars has
also been suggested as limiting the local distribution of seagrass habitats, but
the relative importance of bioturbation in controlling the size of seagrass
meadows is also poorly understood. Field experiments will be conducted to
identify the roles of sea urchin herbivory, bioturbation of seagrasses by sand
dollars, and the potential interaction between sand dollar bioturbation and sea
urchin herbivory in limiting the distribution of seagrass habitats. The results
of this study should add to the existing body of knowledge and untested theories
concerning the factors structuring nearshore ecosystems.
