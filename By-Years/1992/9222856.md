Central College is establishing a connection to NSFNET via a 56,000 bits per
second line through the MIDNET mid-level network. The connection enables the
school's faculty and students to communicate and collaborate with the
international scientific and educational community, and to access network
resources such as libraries, databases and supercomputers. This award funds part
of the costs for two years.
