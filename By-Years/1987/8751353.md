The proposed project is a four year teacher inservice activity whose primary
purpose is to introduce to teachers at 24 different sites, mostly in Ohio, the
use of materials that utilize calculators and computers in improving students
mathematical performances in dealing with functions, graphing, variables, and
generalization. The materials were developed by the project staff in a previous
project. During the first year, the teachers will be identified, with the help
of the project staff they will be educated in the materials and their use, and
will receive leadership training. The next two years, the teachers conduct
inservice workshops for other teachers in their districts. The third phase,
during the fourth year, there will be evaluation and dissemination activities.
It is anticipated that the immediate effects of the project will extend to over
200 teachers.
