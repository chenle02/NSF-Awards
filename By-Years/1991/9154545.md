The Education Development Center in collaboration with the Prince George's
County Public School District seeks support for a 3-day planning conference with
follow-up activities that will span the 1991-1992 school year. The conference
and follow-up activities are designed to support the district's efforts to
improve the quality of elementary science and mathematics education programs in
the county by coordinating and conducting training and technical assistance
activities for district elementary education personnel. The conference grows out
of a recently initiated partnership agreement between the County and NSF in
which NSF pledged its support of county efforts to strengthen precollege
educational activities. The focus of the conference is the application of
national and state science and mathematics performance standards in the
elementary classroom.
