Porting scientific codes to new high-performance platforms is a time consuming
and error-prone process. The research funded by this EAGER award will make
scientific codes more portable by raising the level of abstraction. The
Principal Investigators will develop a domain-specific language embedded in C++
for solving partial differential equations. They will evaluate the effectiveness
of their approach by applying their language to the problem of reacting flow
simulations, which is a problem that is important for modeling zero-emission
power plants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Computation is an increasingly important tool
for scientists, but scientists must hand-tune their code for each new machine to
take advantage of the latest high-performance hardware. This research represents
a new approach to implementing scientific codes on high-performance machines.
The approach allows domain experts to write code at a high level of abstraction
while gaining portability across parallel platforms. This research has the
potential to improve the productivity of computational scientists by
transforming the way that scientific codes are developed.
