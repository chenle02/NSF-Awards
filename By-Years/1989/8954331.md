Two two-week summer workshops are being held to acquaint undergraduate
professors with new curricula ideas in the areas of geometry and statistics and
their applications. Leaders in each field, both academics and practitioners, are
interacting with fifty nationally drawn participants to enable them to
understand new developments in these mathematical fields and to prepare
applications-based modular materials suitable for use in their classrooms. Areas
being discussed in geometry include tilings, combinatorial geometry and
computational geometry. Statistics areas include data acquisition (especially
statistically designed experiments), data analysis by graphical methods, and
inference procedures for many-variable data, including new procedures that
require less restrictive assumptions than traditional methods. A formal follow-
up session will be held at the national joint AMS/MAA meetings in January, where
participants may discuss the aspect of the training on their campuses and the
use of modular materials with their students.
