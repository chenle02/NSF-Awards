This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a portable
instrument for measuring the electrical conductivity of rocks in the field.
Electrical conductivity is becoming increasingly useful as a bulk property in
geophysical surveys for interpreting buried geological structures, but large
scale surveys involving the deployment of electrical sources and sensors is
expensive and time consuming. A rapid and inexpensive tool for measuring the
conductivity of small samples from local outcrops would be very helpful in
making efficient deployments of field arrays.
