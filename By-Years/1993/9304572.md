The use of an intense artificial X-ray source for geophysical and well logging
procedures to determine strata formation density, lithology, and composition is
desirable over 1-2 Ci level sources of l37 Cs or 60 Co. An accelerator based
photon source reduces the radiological handling risk and the considerable
expense of down hole loss. In Phase I, North Star Research successfully
demonstrated operation of a innovative 200 kV, 400 A (beam current) Nested High
Voltage (NHV) accelerator and the production of radiation. Notable
characteristics of this device were the small diametric size (10 cm), mass (13.6
kG), and the capability for higher voltage operation (constrained only by the
Phase I drive power limitations). North Star proposes to incorporate
enhancements in accelerator internal design, drive power optimization, and
electron beam control into a package that produces at a minimum 0.663 keV, 100 A
beam suitable for intense radiation production and nuclear logging. The
embodiment of the proposed NHV resulting from a funded Phase II effort would
immediately compete with other logging systems employing l37 Cs.
