There are many applications, including manufacturing, assembly, health care, and
construction, where workers may be hampered by not having enough hands to do
their job effectively. While one approach is to have a mobile robot assist the
human, our project instead focuses on the augmenting human capabilities by
developing a wearable robotic arm. Such augmentation of the human body can
enhance a person's power, efficiency, safety, and quality of work. The project
aims to make these wearable robots act as collaborative teammates, rather than
directly controlled passive tools, making them both intuitive for novices and
adaptable to expert users. This will significantly improve the efficiency and
acceptance of such robots, and positively affect the work conditions of people
interacting with them. The robot arm will be tested with human users performing
tasks for which a third arm is useful. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whereas wearable
robotics is a maturing field, there is almost no research on the human-robot
interaction (HRI) aspects of such robots. This project investigates
collaborative HRI for wearable robots, in four phases: 1) Collecting wearable
collaboration data with a human and a tele-operated robot arm; 2) using this
data to design an anticipatory Conditional Random Field (CRF) model for the
collaboration; 3) developing a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process
(POMDP) controller for the robot; and 4) evaluating the controller in human-
robot interaction experiments with a physical wearable robotic arm, using
metrics of efficiency, fluency, and usability. By doing so, the project
contributes to the state-of-the-art in computational HRI by developing new
probabilistic models for human-wearable robotic collaboration. The project also
contributes new empirical data on how people interact with wearable co-robots
through two human-subject studies. The collected data set on human-wearable-
robotic interaction will be released to serve the research community.
