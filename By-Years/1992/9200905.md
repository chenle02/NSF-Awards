The main goal of this proposal is to understand the controls on the fine-scale
magnetic structure of ocean crust formed at slow- spreading ridges. A high
quality data set consisting of SeaBeam bathymetry, sea surface magnetic and
gravity data has been acquired over the Mid-Atlantic Ridge from 24 degrees to 30
degrees 30 minutes north. The principle investigators will investigate and
analyze anaoalies in these data to test the hypothesis that the fine-scale
magnetic structure is a direct result of volcanism, tectonism and alteration
processes that form and modify the ocean crust.
