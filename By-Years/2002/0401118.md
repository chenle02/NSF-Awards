&lt;br/&gt;Proposal DMS-0401118&lt;br/&gt;PI: Yanyan Li (Rutgers
University)&lt;br/&gt;Title: On some fully nonlinear elliptic
equations&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI proposes to work on some
conformally invariant fully nonlinear&lt;br/&gt;equations which arise naturally
from conformal geometry. In particular he &lt;br/&gt;proposes to prove a very
general fully nonlinear version of the Yamabe&lt;br/&gt;conjecture. The
corresponding Liouville type theorem has been established. &lt;br/&gt;The main
task is to obtain apriori estimates for solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Partial
differential equations arise naturally from physics, geometry,&lt;br/&gt;and
many other fields and form a basis for mathematical modeling of&lt;br/&gt;the
physical world. The proposed research should enhance the understanding
&lt;br/&gt;of fully nonlinear elliptic equations, an important class of
equations&lt;br/&gt;in modeling the physical world. The study of conformally
invariant equations &lt;br/&gt;has found applications in geometry and topology.
Part of the proposed work&lt;br/&gt;concerns important analytical issues for
such equations. We expect that further &lt;br/&gt;applications to geometry and
topology can be made with conformally invariant &lt;br/&gt;fully nonlinear
equations and related ones, and the proposed work should&lt;br/&gt;provide
analytical tools for such applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
