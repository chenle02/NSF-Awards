*** 9661288 Certain This Small Business Innovation Research Phase 1 project
will investigate methods for multiresolution analysis of triangular meshes.
Complex meshes are rapidly becoming commonplace. They require large amounts of
storage and are slow to transmit. Additionally, they often contain more faces
than can be interactively displayed on current hardware. Multiresolution methods
provide a theoretically sound, unified way to deal with complex meshes; however,
many of the algorithms employed thus far do not exhibit the performance
necessary for commercial applications. The goal of the project is to perform the
experimental and theoretical research needed to overcome this problem. This
research has the potential to lead to a standard for the representation and
transmission of complex meshes and will give a big boost to making shape
photography more commercially viable. ***
