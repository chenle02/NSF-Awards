9701550 Sevov The research goals of this project are to synthesize and modify
novel classes of materials to include the metal-borate-phosphate and metal-
borate-phosphonate systems, to study their structure and structure-property
relations, and to evaluate their electrooptical, magnetic and catalytic
properties. The educational goals are to introduce solid-state and materials
chemistry experiments into an undergraduate laboratory course for seniors, and
developing a graduate and undergraduate lecture course on topics in contemporary
chemistry of materials issues. %%% This well integrated research and education
program combines in a very unique way an emphasis on the synthesis,
characterization, and structure-property relations of novel materials exhibiting
functional materials properties of interest to applications areas such as
catalysis, and magnetic and optical materials for devices. Integrating these
current high-priority materials research challenges with the educational
curriculum of this CAREER Program results in the training of students in areas
of growing relevancy thereby advancing science and technology while improving
job prospects for students. ***
