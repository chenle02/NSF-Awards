Researchers at the Marine Biological Laboratory will collaborate with Swedish
scientists to determine how boreal-tundra ecosystems in northern Sweden respond
to climate change. A manipulative field experiment will be conducted to examine
the effects of a warming and doubling of the carbon dioxide on the health of a
dwarf shrub ecosystem. The ecological response to the increased "greenhouse"
conditions will be incorporated into a model that will allow assessment of the
changes from the molecular to whole-ecosystem scale. Feedbacks from the
ecosystem and soil to the atmosphere under the warmed, carbon dioxide enriched
condition will also be examined. This study will facilitate predictions of the
response of a sensitive Arctic ecosystem to climate forcing under postulated
increased "greenhouse" conditions that might occur if atmospheric carbon dioxide
levels are doubled at the same time as global temperatures are warmed.
