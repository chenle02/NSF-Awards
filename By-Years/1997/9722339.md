We propose to develop robust software and algorithms for very high-quality DNA
sequence assembly and multiple sequence alignment. The specific problems we
target are shotgun sequence assembly in the presence of sequencing error,
repetitive elements, and chimeric clones, and multiple sequence alignment under
the maximum-trace scoring function.
