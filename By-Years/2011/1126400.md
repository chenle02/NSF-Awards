Research Objectives and Approaches&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is
the development of innovative modeling, operation, and planning methods for
increased efficiency, reliability, and renewability in "smart" electric power
systems. Essential to this work is the integrated electric power system test
bed, which provides researchers with hardware for physical implementation and
testing. It emulates a three-phase system with digital communication, renewable
energy, and energy storage capabilities. The following approaches to research
will be employed: 1) application of measurement-based techniques to load
modeling, 2) implementation of effective demand response, 3) application of fast
state estimation and optimal power flow analyses to operation and planning, and
4) utilization of storage to increase penetration of renewable
energy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The principal
investigator has significant research experience in smart grid technology and
renewable energy. His most recent works are accepted for publication in the IEEE
Transactions on Smart Grid and Elsevier International Journal of Electric Power
and Energy Systems. The proposed research builds upon his previous work;
however, it also explores the use of physical experimentation to make even
greater contributions to these fields. This work is unique, because it employs
hardware present at few academic institutions in the United
States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The power system test bed
will support multiple senior keystone projects per year as well as play
significant role in the investigator?s "Power Systems and Renewability" course.
Additionally, it will be utilized for high school student outreach programs in
conjunction with the College's Center for Excellence in Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Mathematics which will benefit local lower and middle class
youth.
