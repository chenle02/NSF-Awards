Professor Davis and his research team will examine observed patterns of
chaparral vegetation in California and will relate the patterns observed to the
processes by which vegetation recovers from fire. Two theories and models of the
recovery process currently exist: one contends that vegetation recovers via
random establishment of individual plants; the other contends that pre-fire
patterns of seed assemblages and sprouts govern the revegetative process. In
addition to analyzing pre- and post-fire patterns from other burned areas, the
investigators will conduct a controlled burn in order to document pre- burn
vegetation and seed assemblages, fire behavior, and post-burn seed assemblages
and establishment patterns. This project will yield important insight into
revegetation processes in fragile ecosystems. It will increase our understanding
of environmental responses to natural and human-induced disturbances.
