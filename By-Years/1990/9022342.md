This research represents a major effort to determine the origin of the main
component of cosmic rays in galaxies. The detailed distribution of relativistic
electrons will be obtained from high resolution synthesis maps of non-thermal
radio radiation. Multi- color optical images will define the locations of
various stellar populations, the putative source of the cosmic rays. Comparison
of these two distributions, together with theoretical modeling of the
propagation of the relativistic particles, should determine which stellar
population really acts as the source for cosmic ray particles.
