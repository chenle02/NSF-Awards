This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). This project continues research on Triassic and Jurassic
faunas from the Beardmore Glacier region of Antarctica. Research will be
supported for one field season by helicopter from the site of the previous
Beardmore Glacier camp. The PIs will prepare and study new material recovered
from a number of fossil sites in the region, continue preparation and study of
dinosaur material collected from Mt. Kirkpatrick during their 2003-04 field
season, and place all these fossils in a refined stratigraphic and temporal
framework. This project will advance the understanding of Antarctic life during
the Mesozoic. Study of high paleolatitude faunas will also contribute to the
understanding of biogeography, past climates, and faunal adaptation in polar
regions.
