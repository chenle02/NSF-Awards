When we look at the Universe, we see stars, planets, black holes, neutron stars,
and the gas and dust between them. All of this is made from normal matter.
Astronomers believe that for every pound of normal matter, there are five or six
pounds of something called dark matter. We only know about dark matter by its
gravitational attraction to the normal matter that we see.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators seek to discover where that dark matter
is in our own Milky Way galaxy. If investigators can find spots were the stars
in the Milky Way are jostled in predicted ways, they will learn how dark matter
interacts with regular matter. To find the location of dark matter, the
investigators will study the motions of stars from smaller galaxies that are
falling into the Milky Way, and the motions in the Milky Way disk, which is the
part of our galaxy that includes the spiral arms. These stars will be pulled
towards the dark matter, which will make it possible for identify the dark
matter location and concentration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to providing
researchers with constraints on dark matter in the Universe, the investigators
will directly contribute to education at all levels. Graduate and undergraduate
students will learn how to conduct research. They will connect with the public
through open houses at the campus observatory, by helping to train high school
students who will staff open houses at a local science museum, and by
interacting with more than 15,000 people around the world who voluntarily
contribute their computers to help the researchers do
calculations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
