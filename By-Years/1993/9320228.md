In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division,
Graham Fleming of the University of Chicago will examine chemical dynamics in
condensed phases on a femtosecond time scale. Ultrafast spectroscopy and non-
linear spectroscopic techniques will be used to probe the molecular dynamics in
solution which are usually masked by the featureless nature of liquid-phase
electronic spectra. Ultrashort pulses will be combined with pulse sequences to
study the full range of time scales present in the experimental system and its
solvent. Structures to be studied include biological systems with a
photosynthetic reaction center. Various chemical phenomena such as electron
transfer will be rationalized and predicted using spectral densities. The cage
effect on the dissociation of iodine will be observed to determine the mechanism
of solvent-induced curve crossing. This research will attempt to find examine
several issues. One involves the effect of solvent molecules in liquid solutions
on reactions in an attempt to determine, for example, under what conditions the
solvents form cages around reactive species and keep them close enough for
reaction to occur. Do these solvent molecules modify the reactive condition of
these reagent molecules? How are proteins affected in the water solutions which
are characteristic of living systems? These experiments will also examine some
aspects of the mechanism of photosynthesis in order to gain a fuller
understanding of this important life process.
