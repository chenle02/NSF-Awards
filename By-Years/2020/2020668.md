A team of scholars will investigate dynamics in the development of cities and
states. Understanding the rise of states requires that we characterize their
variations, not just study those that fit rigid stereotypes. Many scholars
assume that capitals develop as one large settlement dominates other
settlements, which in turn control smaller settlements. Yet, hierarchies vary in
the degree to which a capital dominates social dimensions of the state. In some
cases, the capital dominates; in others, it over-dominates (primacy); and in
still others, the capital may be the same size or smaller than “subordinate”
settlements. Primacy can become so extreme that capitals grow to be massively
larger than “subordinate” centers. Such situations are known as “hyperprimacy.”
Variations in the construction of hierarchies reflect and help create divergence
in the trajectory of developing states. The knowledge of the diversity,
successes, and failures of cities can contribute to modern discussions of
urbanization and policymaking. The proposed work will add some historical depth
to the understanding of how cooperation can help create more viable and
resilient social systems and enhance social mobility. This project will train
students from Queens College as well as other
universities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will explore the invention of
what is currently the earliest known city with an orthogonal grid in the
Americas. A preliminary survey of the area suggested the presence of a Middle
Preclassic period settlement hierarchy. Unusually the site has no monuments
which suggests an unusual cooperative form of social organization. The research
will proceed through an airborne LiDAR survey followed by intense archaeological
excavations at both the main and subordinate sites. Project information will be
uploaded to an ongoing website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
