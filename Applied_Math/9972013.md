This award will support research on two main problems. The first is a study of
mathematical models for polymer desorption. In particular, the goal is to model
such anomalous behavior as skinning, where the penetrant substance can become
trapped inside the polymer matrix. The second part of the proposal is a study of
the spatial nature of the nonlocal effects in polymer diffusion, which is caused
by the disparate length scales in the polymer network. The common problem in
describing diffusion in polymers is that the diffusion of the penetrant
molecules in a polymer entanglement network cannot be described by the usual
models (Fick's Law) alone. Rather, one must incorporate other nonlocal effects,
using hereditary integral kernels. This results in a model that contains a
nonlinear partial integrodifferential equation. This problem is perhaps best
described as a moving boundary-value problem where two distinct operators govern
the phenomena on the two sides of the boundary. In this work, existing models
will be refined, and studies of diffusion and dissolution will performed and
compared with experiments. Different geometries and the effects of swelling on
the system will also be considered. Because of their unusual, yet useful,
properties, polymers have become invaluable in industrial production. Diffusion
in polymers does not follow the standard physical laws as diffusion in other
media, and hence a new mathematical approach is needed. In particular, the
penetrant molecules diffuse through interconnected polymer "pockets", which
leads to nonlocal effects. A mathematical model incorporating these effects will
be formulated and solved. One area where polymers are used is in pharmaceutical
applications, where the polymer is often saturated with a penetrant (such as a
medicine), and then allowed to release the penetrant slowly. Several
mathematical studies in various configurations, such as cylindrical devices,
will be undertaken to analyze these phenomena. Thus the research will have
direct impact on nonmathematical areas, such as materials science and
pharmaceuticals.
