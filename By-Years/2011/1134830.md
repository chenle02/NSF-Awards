Planning Grant for an I/UCRC for Optical Wireless Applications
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal #1134830 Georgia Tech
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Georgia Tech seeks to join Pennsylvania State University
(PSU) to establish the center for Optical Wireless Applications. PSU (lead
institution) has already been awarded the planning grant, and has successfully
completed the planning grant workshop. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks
to make innovative contributions to the hardware technology of ExaScale
computing and TeraScale informatics, and advance the state of the art in high
bandwidth wireless data transmission between processor and memory dies and in
wireless communication over optical fibers. The proposed work is divided into
two thrusts. The first deals with the technology of TeraScale information
highway which includes long distance optical communication, regional radio over
fiber (RoF) and wireless end user. The second proposes a completely new approach
to data exchange between a chip multiprocessor (CMP) and (DRAM) main memory
within a computer node, namely a low power millimeter wave wireless data bus
that bypasses the need for the traditional electrical back-plane.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The multi-disciplined nature of the project is aimed to
harness a diverse educational and research approach that nurtures individual
initiative in students who will actively interacts with industry and
universities, to achieve a highly educated and skilled work-force that is able
to compete in the global race to achieve ExaScale computing machines and a
TeraScale information infrastructure. The result of this research is expected to
contribute to business competitiveness, energy security, environmental
protection, and climate forecast.
