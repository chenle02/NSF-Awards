Many real-world widely-used web services, like those built and maintained by
Amazon, Facebook, and others, encapsulate complex program logic within
transactions. Although serializability is the gold standard used to reason about
the behavior of concurrently executing transactions, its enforcement cost has
led many commercial database systems to provide support for, and encourage the
use of, weaker variants, in which a transaction may witness effects from other
transactions as it executes, weakening the strong isolation guarantees provided
by serializability. Weak isolation, while improving availability complicates
program reasoning, making it challenging to verify database application
correctness, or implement useful program transformations, optimizations, and
testing/debugging tools. Safety and security are thus compromised. Further
complicating matters is the interplay between the database and weak consistency,
a property of the underlying data store that exploits replication among geo-
distributed mirrored sites to improve throughput and availability.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not surprisingly, weak isolation and weak consistency
interact in subtle and non-trivial ways. To better understand this interaction,
this project develops new foundational principles and new language abstractions
and implementation techniques sensitive to the different behaviors possible when
strong isolation and consistency guarantees are loosened. The project
investigates new infrastructure for verifying and implementing high-level
programs on modern replicated data stores that support only weak enforcement of
consistency among replicas and isolation among transactions. Results from this
effort will increase the robustness of many widely-used Web services and
systems, and lower the effort, risk, and cost associated with developing and
certifying modern distributed database applications. The investigators will
involve graduate and undergraduate students in this research.
