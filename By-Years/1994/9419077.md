9419077 Jenkins The project will investigate the complex interactions between
forces that result from locomotor activity and the mechanics of the respiratory
system in mammals. Traditionally, mammalian locomotion and respiratory
physiology have been studied as discretely different phenomena, but recently
acquired evidence supports the view that the chest of mammals has evolved to
integrate these activities, both structurally and functionally, in a manner that
previously has not been understood. Bramble and Jenkins (Science, 262:235-240)
demonstrated that inertial displacements of the abdominal viscera in trotting
dogs passively drive the diaphragm independent of diaphragmatic contractions,
which primarily serve to modulate visceral motion. Visceral displacements and
the loading of the anterior chest walls by the forelimbs are among the factors
producing asynchronous ventilation of the lungs and the recycling of air between
their lobes. The present project is designed to further explore these complex
interactions, specifically by documenting (in several mammalian species that
exhibit different locomotor styles) the interrelationships of visceral and
diaphragmatic kinematics induced by different gaits and speeds, the activity of
the primary respiratory muscles, and the ventilation patterns within the lungs.
The resultant data still substantially contribute to a better understanding of
the functional design of the mammalian respiratory system. ***
