The University of Alabama at Birmingham will conduct a two-year program to
stimulate school-wide mathematics achievement in grades 4-6 of four school
systems within the metropolitan Birmingham area. The term "school-wide" is used
here in a technical sense: the model is based on a school as a "unit of change",
the smallest unit necessary to sustain change over the long term, and "school-
wide" involvement means that at least 75% of the teachers will participate. The
project features a six- week summer institute on strengthening content knowledge
through a problem-solving approach, the nature of children's mathematical
thinking, increasing pedagogical skills, and materials development. Throughout
the following academic year, the project staff will visit participant classrooms
to facilitate implementation. A leadership training workshop consisting of five
days in the second summer and five days during the next academic year will
prepare the participants for outreach. A total of 40 teachers will participate
in the six-week institute, and 21 of these teachers will participate in the
leadership training. The University of Alabama at Birmingham and the four local
school districts have contributed an amount equal to 19% of the National Science
Foundation request.
