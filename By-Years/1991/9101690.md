The project will result in a computer program for practical nonlinear analysis
of concrete arch dams under earthquake loading. Vertical contraction joints and
horizontal cracking planes will be approximately represented by the 'smearing'
procedure with a single shell element discretization in the thickness direction.
The program will achieve a balance between the importance of various parameters
of the problem (opening, closing and sliding of joints and cracks, hydrodynamic
interaction, foundation interaction, etc.) and the accuracy to which they are
modeled. The level of accuracy will be sufficient to make more definite
conclusions regarding the seismic safety of arch dams than is currently possible
with linearly elastic analysis. The computational requirements will be small
enough so that the program can function as practical tool. Since many seismic
assessments of concrete arch dams are unsatisfactorily based on results of
linearly elastic analysis, a practical nonlinear analysis tool is needed.
