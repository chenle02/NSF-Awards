9512805 Schwartz Two related projects will be carried out to address problems
raised by "traditional" employment of Ph.D. physicists. The first is a local
pilot program to be carried out at City University of New York. This program
consists of 3 parts: 1) a number of supplemental mini-courses to the traditional
Ph.D. program in the areas of communication skills, computational skills and the
business aspects of high technology; 2) a regular seminar series on traditional
and non-traditional careers; and, 3) workshops on job and career seeking skills
for graduate students in the Ph.D. program. The proposed program at CUNY will be
developed with the input and cooperation of the department chairs, senior
faculty and graduate students. The second project is a national program
involving direct interaction with the faculty and students at universities in
various regions of the nation. This project will nurture local programs to
improve and widen career opportunities for Ph.D. physicists. This second project
involves working with the faculty and students to identify and develop a series
of actions and programs and courses which will maximize and focus the use of
local resources. A career seminar series and strategies for supplementing and
enlarging the scope of courses for Ph.D. physics students will also be
encouraged. ***
