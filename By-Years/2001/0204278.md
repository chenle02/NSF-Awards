The research component of the proposal is to devise automatic macromodeling
procedures that extract higher-level models from detailed lower-level ones for
automated design of Systems-on-Chip. An important aspect of this process,
particularly for analog, mixed-signal and RF modules, is the incorporation of
nonlinearities. This is essential for distortion and intermodulation
characteristics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work is concerned chiefly with
modeling weak circuit nonlinearities. A significane increase in the predicted
fidelity over current (essentially linear theory-based) procedures is expected.
The proposed work is based on Volterra non-linear series expansion that captures
essential non-linearities of a broad class of devices which include power
amplifiers, mixers, frequency doublers, and switched-capacitor filters. The work
is likely to be expandable to companding filters and Analog-to-Digital
converters. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
