The University of Puerto Rico-Mayaguez will develop plans for a five year
project to enhance the research and academic activities of the Computer
Engineering program offered at the Mayaguez Campus. The plan of action includes:
faculty development, laboratory expansion, establishment of institutional
linkage, outreach to industry, course and curriculum development and research
development. Each component will be assigned to a team of two members of the
proposal committee, which will produce all the necessary documents to delineate
each of the components. Trips to well-known universities and industries with
recent UPRM alumni has been proposed to help in the development of the final
document. Also a visiting team will be formed to evaluate the final plan.
