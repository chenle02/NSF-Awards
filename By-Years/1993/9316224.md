9316224 Coe This award provides one-half the funding needed for the acquisition
of equipment to measure the magnetic properties of rocks and minerals. The
equipment includes an alternating gradient magnetometer, a Curie point balance,
a spinner magnetometer, and a magnetic susceptibility bridge. It will be
installed and operated in the University of California at Santa Cruz's
Paleomagnetism Laboratory. The institution is committed to providing the
remaining funds necessary for the purchase of the equipment. The University of
California-Santa Cruz Paleomagnetism Laboratory is engaged in a broad range of
research applications of paleomagnetism that include: interpretation of past
tectonic plate motion inferred from a study of the direction of magnetization of
rocks, sequence of paleoclimate and paleoceanographic events from application of
the magnetic reversal time scale, and measurements of direction and intensity of
ancient magnetic fields to better understand the fundamental mechanism by which
the Earth's magnetic field is generated. These and related studies will make use
of the new equipment. ***
