Professor Andreas Mayr and other members of the Chemistry Department of the
State University of New York at Stony Brook are being supported to conduct a
Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry. For the period
1990-92, ten (10) undergraduate students will spend nine (9) weeks each summer
actively engaged in a variety of research projects. Projects range from
chemistry in molecular and cluster beams to molecular mimics of hydrolase
enzymes. Students will participate in weekly informal lunch meetings, a seminar
series, and a mini-symposium at the end of the program. Minority students will
be able to participate in other summer programs on campus designed to create an
encouraging social environment.
