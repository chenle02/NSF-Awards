Drs. Daniel Engstrom and Herbert Wright of the University of Minnesota propose
a study of lake ecology following the glacial recession of 10,000 years ago in
Glacier Bay, Alaska. This investigation will explore the earliest stages of lake
development in relation to primary succession in vegetation and soils along a
120-year deglaciation chronosequence. Emphasis will be placed on changes in
water chemistry, primary production and phytoplankton composition, and the
influence of catchment geology and hydrology in regulating material flow from
watershed to lake. The problem of early lake ontogeny will be attacked with two
complementary research strategies. (1) Limnological conditions will be compared
among lakes of known age and in different stages of primary catchment
succession, and (2) sediment cores from these same trends in pH, alkalinity, and
algal composition at individual sites. Several hypotheses concerning early
postglacial land/water interactions will be tested, including (a) the
progressive leaching of catchment soils makes lakes more acidic over time, (b)
hydrologic and geologic differences among sites act to control the rates and
direction of limnological change, (c) increased nutrient flux associated with
early soil formation result in an initial increase in lake productivity, and (4)
peat growth and regional paludification impede internal soil drainage and cause
the dystrophication of surface waters. This work has high interests for students
of paleolimnology in particular and paleoecology and ecology in general. It
gains in significance when placed in context of current interests and concerns
about global climatic change and its influence on ecosystems and man-made
systems. How lakes develop and stabilize is also of interest to those studying
how contemporary lakes are disturbed by and recover from acidification. The
investigators and their institution are world renowed for their work in this
area.
