Large pelagic fishes such as blue sharks and swordfish although "cold blooded,"
appear to use heat acquired at the surface to remain warmer than the water at
depth for many hours. Swordfish swim near the warm surface to feed at night, but
move deep into cold water during the day. They appear to manipulate their body
temperature by a thermal hysteresis in the muscle which cools slowly in deep
cold waters, but rewarms rapidly upon return to warm surface waters. Blue
sharks, which swim up and down hundreds of meters in continuous oscillations,
may be obtaining the same thermal advantage. However, their continuous
oscillations may be necessary because they are less effective in managing
temperature than swordfish. Dr. Carey, who has pioneered research on this topic,
will continue his investigations into the process of behavioral thermoregulation
in these fish. He will combine telemetered information with shipboard
measurements of water temperature vs. depth, light and echosounder records to
investigate the factors the fish respond to.
