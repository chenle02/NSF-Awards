Professor Marjorie Caserio and other members of the Chemistry Department of the
University of California at Irvine are being supported to continue a Research
Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry. For the period 1990-92,
ten (10) undergraduate students will spend ten (10) weeks each summer actively
engaged in a variety of research projects. Projects range from biochemistry and
organic synthesis to thin films, molecular dynamics, and atmospheric chemistry.
Provisions will be made for the students to learn a variety of experimental
techniques, learn the results of each other's work, and present a seminar on the
results of their own research.
