It is a well-established fact that protons and neutrons are made up of smaller
constituents called quarks and gluons. In collisions using two beams of heavy
nuclei, a new state of matter is formed, called the quark-gluon plasma (QGP).
This project will answer fundamental questions about the QGP, such as how matter
is transformed from a collection of protons and neutrons to a free state where
quarks and gluons can travel through space unhindered, much like they did in the
primordial soup of matter following the Big Bang. The goal of this proposal is
to the dynamics of the QGP in the presence of a high-velocity quark traveling
through this medium. This provides more information on the flow of quarks and
gluons in this unique state of matter. The research will be carried out at the
European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) using the ALICE
detector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of the Heavy Ion program at CERN is to
understand the behavior of matter at very high density, corresponding to
conditions a fraction of a second after the Big Bang, when a hot, dense medium
of quarks and gluons existed. The goal is to recreate and study these conditions
via colliding nuclei at relativistic kinetic energies. Chicago State University
will contribute to this effort by working on the physics analysis of jets
containing quarkonia and strange particles. This study investigates the
production mechanism of quarkonia and strangeness production in proton-proton
collisions and the response of the quark-gluon medium to jet energy deposition
in lead-lead collisions. The project also includes an R&amp;D contribution to
the construction of the Fast Interaction Trigger (FIT); this effort will provide
opportunities for the involvement of undergraduate students in hardware
projects: the developing, testing and commissioning of particle detectors.
