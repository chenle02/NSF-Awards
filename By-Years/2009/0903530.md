This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to
develop a measurement-driven real-time wear-out model for the time-cumulative
effects of electrothermal stress on the remaining life of multi-core systems.
The approach is to develop highly efficient built-in sensors for accurate
temperature, thermal gradient and current measurements and to use real-time
measured data to build time-dependent conditional probability density models for
electrothermal stress induced circuit failures and time-history dependent system
reliability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merits include new methods
for designing accurate on-chip temperature and current sensors with significant
reductions in area and improvements in power efficiency and new methods for
real-time thermal gradient surface temperature profiling. Merits also include
introducing the concept of time-temperature stress history based conditional
probability assessment for developing optimal power/thermal management schemes.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact includes benefits consumers derive through
lifetime and reliability improvements in a broad range of elevated temperature
limited electronic systems. Significant participation in this project by female
and/or minority students will be maintained throughout this initiative. Research
results on sensor design, reliability enhancement and statistical lifetime
modeling will be integrated into existing and new courses that will be made
available to both on-campus and remote access students. Timely dissemination of
research results and technology transfer will be through conference and journal
publications, WEB page postings, student industrial internships, and close
collaboration with researchers at leading semiconductor companies both in the US
and abroad.
