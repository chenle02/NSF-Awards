Barbara Wyslouzil is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program to continue her experimental research on nucleation of aerosol
particles. The goal of the proposed work is to use small angle neutron
scattering (SANS) to look for structure in multicomponent nanometer sized liquid
droplets in an aerosol. Wyslouzil will be looking for surface enrichment in
multicomponent droplets which she anticipates have internal structures on the
nanometer length scale. She has already perfected a supersonic nozzle design
that produces aerosol droplets of uniform size and has tested the feasibility of
using SANS for performing depth profiling experiments. During the next phase of
this research program, Wyslouzil plans to address three tasks: 1) conduct
experiments with binary nanodroplets to determine their composition and
structure; 2) improve her ability to conduct SANS measurements from aerosols;
and 3) refine the data analysis procedures and modeling for interpreting the
SANS experimental data. Multicomponent, nanometer-sized aerosol particles are
produced by nucleation and condensation in many industrial and natural settings.
Fine refractory particles form in combustion and metallurgical processes while
sulfuric acid - water droplets are produced in stack gases, volcanic plumes, and
as a byproduct of photochemical reactions in the atmosphere. The surface
composition of these particles can strongly affect heterogeneous reactions,
growth and evaporation kinetics, and the accomodation of trace gaseous species.
Wyslouzil's research will contribute to our basic understanding of such
phenomena.
