9710107 Dzombak This is an award the objective of which is to determine
approaches that can be used to address environmental problems associated with
concrete that has been contaminated by oils that contain polychlorinated
biphenyl compounds. The investigator will work at the Alcoa Technical Center for
a period of three months to investigate the historic experiences with using
surface coatings to encapsulate these organic contaminants of concrete,
exploration of new materials and techniques for coatings to reduce their initial
absorption and finding new approaches for addressing this problem. This project
will be performed in collaboration with personnel from the Alcoa Technical
Center in accord with guidelines contained in NSF 95-111 and 95-112, Grant
Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry. The industrial collaborator in
conduct of this project is Dr. John R. Smith, Consultant, EHS Technology Center,
the Aluminum Company of America's Alcoa Technical Center ***
