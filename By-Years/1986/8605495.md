This workshop evaluates and assesses rock fracture mechanics and identifies
priority research areas for NSF solid and geomechanics program. This workshop
will be held in conjunction with the 27th National Symposium on Rock Mechanics,
which generally attracts all key researchers in the area of mechanics of rocks
and geomaterials. A select group of senior individuals, who are leaders in rock
fracture mechanics, will serve as a nuclei in this workshop and generate a
consensus from the rock mechanics community on priority research issues for NSF
research programs. A published report of recommendations will be prepared and
submitted to NSF.
