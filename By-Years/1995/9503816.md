9503816 Nof In this project, the PIs will conduct an analytic study of
oceanographic processes that occur within the Indonesian Archipelago. Particular
focus will be on nonlinear dynamics of flow across a boundary containing
multiple gaps, wave transmission through networks of basins, equatorial
crossing, and baroclinic effects in the lee of sills. Simple experiments will be
attempted to supplement the analytical calculations. ***
