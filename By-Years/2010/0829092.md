CBET-0829092&lt;br/&gt;Cannon&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Numerous U.S.
groundwater sources host unacceptable levels of perchlorate, nitrate, chromate,
vanadate, etc. Available processes for removing these contaminants generally
invoke use of petrochemical-based ion exchange media or membranes, which force
municipalities and their suppliers to rely on non-renewable raw materials that
are mined from non-sustainable and uncertain sources. The investigators are
targeting to devise means of employing instead lignocellulosic biomaterials
(biocarbons) that originate naturally from within America. The team will build
on their recently-devised means of functionalizing the porous biocarbons with
reduced-nitrogen groups that remove perchlorate and other oxyanions. The project
will link into the Sloan Fellowship program for Minority Ph.D. candidates at
Penn State, which is co-led by PI Dr. Cannon. There will also be participation
in Penn State's CURO program, which facilitates minority undergraduate research.
