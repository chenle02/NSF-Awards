Carbon isotope studies of marine limestones detect shifts in the depositional
ratio of organic carbon to carbonate carbon; profiles of 13C are correlative
with major mass extinction events and changes in sea level. During the proposed
renewal period we will complete characterization of the carbon isotope profile
through the Late Paleozoic and the Permian/Triassic boundary. A sequence of two
dozen profiles through the Permian/Triassic boundary in classic sections of the
Tethys Sea, from the Alps to China, will be completed and published. A core of
over 300 m through the Permian/Triassic boundary in a critical section at
Gartnerkofel in the Carnic Alps of Austria, taken in September- October, 1986,
will be the subject of a cross-disciplinary study by a consortium of 12
specialists. The earlier manifestations of the Late Paleozoic carbon isotope
anomaly, previously detected by us and others in the Late Pennsylvanian, will be
confirmed by new collections in the western USA. Geophysical and geochemical
models for shifts in the carbon cycle, sea level and other geological parameters
will be considered in relation to extinction events.
