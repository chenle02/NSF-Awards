This award supports U.S. - Chile Cooperative Research in Crustal Deformation,
work to be performed by Steven N. Ward of the U. of Cal., Santa Cruz and Sergio
Barrientos of the U. of Chile. They propose to study the coseismic displacement
field of the 1960 earthquake in southern Chile and the postseismic deformation
of that event and the 1985 earthquake in Central Chile. Geodetic elevation
changes, triangulation measurements and tide gauge observations will be used to
indicate the location and intensity of coseismic slip and interseismic creep in
great detail. There is important geodetic and seismic data available for Chile.
The U.S. training and Chilean contacts of Barrientos will facilitate the
utilization of these datasets and the collection of new measurements. This is an
excellent opportunity for mutually beneficial scientific cooperation between
U.S. and Chilean scientists. The Chileans will be able to use the advanced
techniques of the U.S. scientists to handle this data and the U.S. scientists
will learn the details of stress accumulation during the earthquake cycle. This
modest award will help maintain a useful international scientific relationship.
