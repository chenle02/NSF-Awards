ABSTRACT CTS-9512541 A three-component fiber optic Phase Doppler Particle
Analyzer/Laser Doppler Velocimeter (PDPA/LDV) which will be acquired for non-
intrusive measurements of two-phase flow. The PDPA/LDV system will enhance
current research projects at the university, and will provide opportunties for a
multitude of new collaborative and interdisciplinary efforts. Research programs
include gas-solid flows and the modulation of gas-phase turbulence in the
presence of particles, turbulence studies using Planar Laser Induced
Fluorescnence, combustion research and turbulent mixing phenomena, chemigation
research, and flow characterization in plasma etch systems. ***
