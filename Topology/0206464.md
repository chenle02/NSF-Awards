Part of this project concerns a continuation of the investigator's successful
application of topological methods to the study of singularities of complex
surfaces and the topology of plane affine curves. One issue to be addressed is
explicit analytic description of singularities with given topology. The general
question is notoriously difficult, but the investigator and J. Wahl have
identified a remarkably broad class of topologies where significant advance can
be made. Another issue is the study of the global topology of two-variable
polynomials, as well as classification issues, which are both of intrinsic
interest and also have potential to contribute to the resolution of the famous
Jacobian Conjecture. A significant tool in this work are the splice diagrams of
Eisenbud and the investigator and a recent generalization of them. In a rather
different direction, the investigator will study invariants of 3-dimensional
manifolds that relate to number theory and algebra, namely the so-called
character and eigenvalue varieties and the Bloch invariant. Connections are
emerging between these invariants that will inform both topology and
algebra/number theory.

Algebraic Geometry, which is essentially the study of the zero sets of families
of polynomials, has always been an important area of fundamental research, and
is also important in such diverse applications as control theory and
communications. Such zero-sets arise, for instance, as the parameter spaces of
processes and the control spaces of automata. The singularities (places where
the nature of the topology changes), are of fundamental significance. This
project has two thrusts: to understand better the link between the analytic
description and the topology of singularities, and to investigate invariants of
low dimensional manifolds that link topology with other fields.
