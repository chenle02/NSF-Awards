The Northeastern University (NU) ITEL Scholarship Program supports academically
talented, financially constrained students receiving degrees in STEM, with a
focus on engineering leadership. This program targets incoming freshmen from
surrounding K-12 school districts and transfer students from partner Community
Colleges. Targeted districts include but are not limited to Boston, Cambridge,
and Medford. Partner Community Colleges include Mass Bay, Middlesex, Northern
Essex Community College and Roxbury Community College. Special emphasis is made
on recruiting and retaining traditionally underrepresented students in this
program. Participants are identified through various partnership programs
including but not limited to the Young Scholars Program, NU Advanced Placement
Summer Academic Support Program, the SummerMath program in Pre-calculus, and the
Northeastern University STEP-UP project. Potential candidates are also provided
application assistance through the Admissions office. This program builds on the
current support systems available for students in the Colleges of Engineering
and Arts and Science. Academic mentoring and support activities and services are
expanded through the involvement of affiliated faculty and students. Through
coordinating services provided across institutional partners, scholarship
recipients are provided the opportunity to belong to a distinguished research
community. Additionally, Scholars participate in NU's Cooperative Education
program.
