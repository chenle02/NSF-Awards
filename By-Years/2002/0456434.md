This is a U.S.-China joint workshop organized by Dr. Eric Hamilton, US Air Force
Academy, and Professor Ruimin Shen, Shanghai Jiao Tong University on web-based
learning to discuss theory, research and practice. The invited participants are
experts in this area. The distance learning by way of web-based learning method
is an important topic. The development of this tool can contribute to greater
effectiveness and broader theories for the design and use of Web-based learning
and to a more fruitful web capacity for NSF programs such as the NSDL. This
workshop will be jointly supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of
China and NSF's Office of Science and Engineering and Division of Research,
Evaluation, and Communications.
