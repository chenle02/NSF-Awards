This work will develop two new strategies to visualize structural
interrelationships between integral membrane proteins and adjacent elements on
the true surfaces of membranes by electron microscopy. The first strategy
produces a composite replica which allows simultaneous visualization of
intramembrane particles in a freeze-fracture replica and related surface
elements in a superimposed replica of the freeze-dried membrane surface. The
second strategy utilizes freeze-substitution methods to fix and dehydrate
freeze-fracture replicas and membrane associated elements. By infiltrating these
thin samples with a layer of resin we will obtain "en face" views of surface
elements with respect to intramembrane structures without subjecting samples to
freeze-drying. The value of these methods will be tested in studies of red cell
ghosts and cultured muscle cells. This will allow a direct structural assessment
of connections that cytoskeletal and extracellular matrix elements have to
integral membrane proteins. Combined with antibody probes that allow the
identification of specific components, these methods promise to provide
important insights into the organization of differentiated membrane domains in a
variety of cell types. External signals are received by cells at the external
surface of the plasma membrane, and information about the signal is transmitted
to the cell interior where biochemical and structural changes carry out the
cell's response. The development of improved techniques for visualization of the
detailed structure, organization and composition of cell surface molecules and
the connection of surface molecules with intracellular skeletal structures will
contribute substantially to understanding of the molecular basis of membrane
physiology and transmembrane signalling.
