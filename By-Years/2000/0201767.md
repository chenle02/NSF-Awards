This joint award made to Northwestern University by the Advanced Materials
Program in the Division of Chemistry (MPS) and the Electronic Materials Program
in the Division of Materials Research (MPS) is to synthesize new macrocyclic
nitrogenous polyketonato/polyketoiminato complexes as well as metal alkyls and
dialkylamides with polar metal-carbon and metal-nitrogen linkages for use as
precursors in conventional, pulsed organometallic beam epitaxy, and atomic layer
epitaxy film growth processes. With this award, Professors Chang and Marks will
study precursor molecular architecture-volatility-thermal stability-surface
reactivity relationships leading to more effective precursors. Transparent thin
films of conducting oxides will be grown from these precursors using precision-
pulsed vapor deposition techniques, and these thin films would have potential
applications in flat-panel display and photovoltaic devices. Lattice-matched
cubic film systems with oxidative dopants will be studied for producing
efficient p-type conductor films using vapor phase deposition onto self-
assembled monolayer templates to create desired film microstructural, optical
and electrical functionalities. This highly collaborative effort will bring
together materials science and chemistry research groups with educational and
research opportunities for graduate and postdoctoral
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, novel precursors with polar
metal-carbon and metal-nitrogen linkages will be prepared for use in
conventional and precision-pulsed vapor deposition processes to prepare
transparent thin films of conducting oxides. These precursors are expected to
possess optimum molecular architecture, volatility, thermal stability and
surface reactivity for the deposition of transparent thin films of conducting
oxides. Sub-micrometer and nanometer scale patterns of the oxide films by soft
lithography and coherent growth of dislocation-free islands will also be
prepared.
