There has recently been considerable controversy over the ability of
terrestrial plants to "compensate" for herbivore damage. If plants can
effectively compensate for the tissue removal caused by herbivores, damage
should have little influence on the population dynamics of plant species.
Although several studies have looked at the influence of herbivory on
semelparous (Flower only once) plants, little research has addressed the impact
of herbivores on the lifetime offspring production of iteroparous (Flowering
every year) species. An experiment will be performed in the Wrangell Mountains
of Alaska examining the influence of chronic lepidopteran (Tortricidae) feeding
on the growth, seed production, and seedling quality of dwarf fireweed,
Epilobium latifolium, a long-lived herbaceous perennial. Plants will be
subjected to three intensities of artificial damage over three years, giving
data to construct probability transition matrices for growth and seed output.
These models can then be used to estimate the influence of different frequencies
and intensities of herbivory on plant performance over the thirty to forty year
life-span of fireweed. An experiment in which compensatory regrowth following
damage is controlled, in order to estimate the importance of regrowth in
mitigating the impact of herbivory will be performed. This work will give one of
the few estimates of the life-time impacts of herbivory on an iteroparous plant
species.
