The objective of this research is to develop an integrated set of techniques to
enhance software safety in process control systems. Examples of relevant types
of software include that which monitors and controls aircraft and other means of
transportation, nuclear power plants, medical devices, manufacturing processes,
and aerospace and defense systems. Although system-safety engineers have
developed procedures to deal with hazards in physical systems, the introduction
of computer control has created new and unsolved problems both for system
engineers and software engineers. The basic approach in this research involves
applying software hazard analysis and hazard control techniques throughout
software development, linking them to the system hazard analysis and control
procedures that are being performed in parallel by the system engineers at the
system level. Confidence is achieved through the use of layers of protection:
The software safety verification and analysis is backed up by using software
safety design procedures that protect against hazardous states resulting from
undetected software faults, including flaws in the software requirements
specification. Both of these are backed up by external hardware protection.
