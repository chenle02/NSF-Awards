This travel grant will be used to partially defray the travel expenses of
selected university student participants of the 2004 Japan-USA Symposium on
Flexible Automation, which will be held in Denver Colorado, July 19-24, 2004.
This is an international, biennial symposium that alternates locations between
Japan and the US. The Symposium will consist of three days of technical
presentations, panel discussions, and keynote speeches, followed by tours to
major university research laboratories and industry production facilities. Panel
sessions provide forums for identifying future needs. Examples of symposium
topic areas include: virtual factories, medical robotics, flexible
manufacturing, and green manufacturing. The financial assistance will make it
possible for 25-30 students from U.S. universities to attend the conference and
learn about research, development, and implementation of flexible automation
technologies in Japan and the US. The students will be selected from a pool of
applicants who are presenting a paper or serving as a panelist. Special
consideration will be given to students from underrepresented groups in the
selection process.
