In this project funded by the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry
Division, Martin Jarrold of Northwestern University will pursue a program of
research to examine the changes in the melting of a material as it decreases in
size from a macroscopic to a microscopic scale. The ion-mobility technique will
be used to study the melting of metallic cluster ions in the gas phase. Using
this method the volume or shape change of a cluster that occurs upon melting
will be sensed. Information about the latent heat of fusion will be determined
using collision-induced dissociation in an ion mobility cell. Measurements will
be performed for a variety of metal and alkali-halide clusters.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Very little experimental data is currently available about
the change in the behavior of melting materials as the size of the bulk material
shrinks to the nanometer regime. This research project will provide insight into
the connection between bulk melting and analogous behavior in very small-size
systems (fewer than 500 atoms) and should ultimately help explain how to prepare
nanometer-sized particles. As such it has implications for turning the synthesis
of nanoscale structures from an art into a science and will affect many aspects
of nanotechnology.&lt;br/&gt;
