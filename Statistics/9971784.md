The proposed research concerns the condensation and analysis of spatial/temporal
data for purposes of classification and anomaly detection. The focus is a new
approach to landmark estimation and spatial clustering based on spatial point
processes. Such processes provide a potentially rich class of models to express
high-level prior knowledge about curves and shapes. These models are more
suitable than commonly used discrete Markov random field models and template
deformation models, especially in situations where there is a lack of training
data. A version of Bayesian nonparametric curve estimation will be developed
using the new approach. A principal objective is to achieve a parsimonious
specification of the landmark information (describing the location of the knots
in a spline curve for example). A further objective is improved methods for
simultaneous inference from temporal data.

The benefit of an efficient statistical model is data condensation, or the
reduction of often unmanageably large data sets to a parsimonious form, without
the sacrifice of key statistical information. Another benefit is that it can
lead to the discovery of interesting anomalies, given the availability of
suitable inferential methods to lend credence to such findings. Specific
applications to be explored include off-line signature recognition and 2D-gel
electrophoresis imaging.
