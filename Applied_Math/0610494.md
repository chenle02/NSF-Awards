This research is to study various aspects of inverse scattering problems arising
in wave propagation and in quantum mechanics and their applications. These
include wave propagation in a nonhomogeneous and absorptive medium and the
determination of the nonhomogeneities and absorptivity of the medium, X-ray
reflectometry and the determination of material properties of stratified thin
films by probing them with X-rays, focusing of waves at target locations and the
determination medium properties by using wave focusing, developing exact
quadratures to analytically continue a reflection coefficient from an interval
to larger domains and their numerical implementation, and solving inverse
scattering problems in order to recover functions with slower decay conditions
at infinity.

The inverse scattering problems investigated have important applications in many
areas such as materials science, nondestructive testing, acoustic imaging, and
remote sensing. The principal aim is to determine properties of a target in a
remote fashion: send a wave onto the target, analyze the scattered wave, and
infer the properties of the target from the scattering data. In addition to its
practical importance in physical sciences, engineering, and other applied areas,
the research will contribute mathematical techniques to various areas of
mathematics and it will also help to train some graduate and undergraduate
students in applied mathematics.
