The objective of this research is to build a base of correlative knowledge to
help define the developmental program of somatic carrot embryogenesis. Srategems
have been developed for manipulation and analysis of single embryos with greater
resolution and precision than previously available, and will be employed to seek
correlations among temporal and spatial patterns of polypeptide composition and
electrical current flow. Special attention will be paid to the embryonic
progression from globular to heart stage, and to regenerating root tissue, and
attempts will be made to define developmental cues based on this data. Further
characterization of the process of root reregeneration will be made through
detailed immunocytochemical examination. These investigation will improve our
understanding of carrot embryogenesis at tissue and cellular levels of
resolution, and provide a context for studies of molecular control of this
process.
