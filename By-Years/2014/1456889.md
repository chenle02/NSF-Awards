This study will examine the effects of reintegrating migrant children into their
families and communities. Using a longitudinal approach and mixed methods, the
results should generate knowledge regarding the policies and practices of
removal and reception of children, providing evidence to inform child protection
and human rights locally and internationally. The research will contribute to
scholarship on migration, reintegration, and the effects of law.

This project engages three areas of scholarship: the migration literature on
deportability, the anthropology of youth, and socio-historical literature of
post-conflict nations. Although prior scholarship has seen children as the
recipients of others' care, and migrants as individuals in motion, the present
project challenges this approach by positing that children are part of a family
structure and that their return has effects on them, their families, and their
communities. Using the household as the primary unit of analysis, the study
examines the effects of youth reintegration on families, peer groups, and
communities. The principal investigator has had access to migrating youth in the
United States and will follow them as they are reintegrated with their families
in Guatemala. The research will employ a household survey, ethnographic
interviews, participant observation, and individual ethnographies.
