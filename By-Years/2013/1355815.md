This project examines cross-national differences in entrepreneurship, among both
men and women, as measured by self-employment. The project investigates the
contexts where women's self-employment is more frequent and more profitable, and
offers insights on the policies for work-family reconciliation that promote
female entrepreneurship. Past research shows US women's self-employment is
profoundly shaped by their family responsibilities. The research seeks to
understand whether policies for universal publicly-funded childcare or universal
maternity leave would help to close gender gaps in entrepreneurship and pay.
Understanding how work-family supports may encourage specific forms of female
self-employment offers a potentially transformative understanding regarding how
to promote women's entrepreneurship.

This study takes an innovative approach to understanding how work-family
reconciliation policies shape women's entrepreneurship across different welfare
state contexts. The project uses data from 15 westernized countries to examine
differences in women's self-employment and work-family policies cross-
nationally. Using social policy data, cultural indicators, and longitudinal
panel data from these locales, this project deploys event history analysis,
fixed effects regression, and multi-level modeling to estimate policy effects
net of controls for individual factors associated with self-employment, labor
force participation, and earnings.

The study's broader impacts are tied to understanding ways to encourage
entrepreneurship in the US, and the project expands the scientific understanding
of the individual and national level factors leading to women's engagement in
self-employment. This project has direct application for increased economic
competitiveness of the US. Self-employment is a driving force behind new job
creation in the US. The findings will be disseminated to media as well as
scholarly outlets. The project also includes extensive training, including in
advanced techniques of data analysis, for involved graduate students.
