This award will supplement the programing effort of an ongoing project. The
project is to develop a schema for computer representation and reduction of data
commonly involved in chromosome mapping projects including genetic linkage,
restriction fragment, and ordered clone techniques. The objectives include
making such a schema the basis of a standard data exchange format. The exchange
of data between researchers would be facilitated and the submission of reduced
data to central institutions would be easier. The reviewers believe this to be
important work and will make a valuable contribution to the field. They are
recommending approval.
