This project supports the dissertation research of a cultural anthropologist
from the City University of New York. The project is to study the role of
archaeology in the maintenance and functioning of the Ecuadorian nation-state,
by examining how images of the archaeological past are used to uphold diverse
models of the idealized nation-state. Through examination of official and
popular media, museum exhibitions, textbooks, and interviews with students and
teachers, the project will assess how groups `use the past` to attain present
political and social goals. The researcher will examine the most well-known
archaeological site in Ecuador to assess how it is represented by the state as
well as by diverse interest groups, including a national Indian confederation as
well as elite groups of wealthy archaeological amateurs. The role of the black
population will also be studied, since they are denied any presence in the
population by the ideology of `mestizo-ization` while defined as totally
inferior by the social preference for white skin. This research is important
because it will shed light on the universal process by which societies
reinterpret the past to attain contemporary social goals. This case study will
be especially valuable, dealing as it does with a country which glorifies its
pre-Inca past while discriminating against contemporary Indian populations and
balancing the multiple claims from its diverse population.
