0948992&lt;br/&gt;Gorring&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will fund an
electronics and computing upgrade on an existing ICP-OES system at in the
Department of Earth and Environmental Studies at MSU. The upgrade will support
diverse research projects within a wide range of disciplines including mantle
and surface processes and bioremediation. Specific efforts include: northeast
United States and the Southern Andes tectonic and magmatic history; marine and
terrestrial sediment and loess-soil sequence paleoclimatic variability; and
water and soil pollution and remediation studies. Research programs are funded
by numerous agencies including NSF. The electronics upgrade will ensure long-
term instrument stability and will extend the life of the instrument allowing
high-quality geochemical data generation for MSU faculty, student researchers
and outside users from local universities, government agencies, and the private
sector. The instrumentation will support a growing and diverse student
population comprised of 60% women and 20% minorities. Students are incorporated
in laboratory and field research. Students lead presentations at international
meetings and are incorporated into peer-reviewed papers. The instrument upgrade
will greatly strengthen regional partnerships. The upgraded instrument will
continue serving both undergraduate and graduate courses. K-12 outreach occurs
in the summer through several in-house programs. The PI provides instrument
training and administration, prioritizes use and assists in scheduling run time.
Academic researchers are asked to contribute to consumables while outside users
are charged a fee for samples which supplies funding for instrument maintenance
and upkeep. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***
