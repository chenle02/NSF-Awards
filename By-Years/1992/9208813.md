This grant supports the research of Professor F. Garvan to work on problems in
additive number theory. In particular he will concentrate on various conjectures
arising from the connection between Dedekind's eta function and partition
theory. He also hopes to continue working on the Macdonald root system
conjectures. This is research in the field of number theory. Number theory
starts with the whole numbers and questions such as the divisibility of one
whole number by another. It is among the oldest fields of mathematics and it was
originally pursued for purely aesthetic reasons. However, within the last half
century, it has become an essential tool in developing new algorithms for
computer science and new error correcting codes for electronics.
