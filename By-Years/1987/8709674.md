This research examines the diffusion of information technology innovation in the
newly emerging video text industry. Existing theories of innovation and of
industry organizations have not been very useful for explaining the widespread
collaborative relationship which this kind of innovation appears to trigger.
This research focuses on why firms do not develop innovations in house, imitate
it or buy it from those who license it, but rather team up with other firms who
have related but distinct technological expertise? Conventional economic
approaches such as industrial organization theory and transaction costs theory
do not provide a satisfactory description as to when and why firms would band
together to exploit a new technology and how the innovations in products and
services come about. This research promises to break new ground by detailing the
interplay between the attributes of the technologies, the strategic
technological competence and distinctive skills of each firm and the new forms
of collaborative institutional arrangements and organization designs.
