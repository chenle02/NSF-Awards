The SiWEDS Center works closely with the industry member scientists and
engineers, carries out a unique multi-university program of research in silicon
materials. They provide critical materials physics and chemistry solutions that
increase the yield, performance, and reliability of silicon materials and
devices used for Giga Scale Integrated Circuits. The SiWEDS targets areas with
great potential for true long-term breakthrough on the one hand, coupled with
near term payoffs on the other. This multi-university I/UCRC is led by North
Carolina State University and involves the University of California-Berkeley,
Arizona State University, University of Arizona, University of South Florida,
University of Washington, MIT, and Stanford University.
