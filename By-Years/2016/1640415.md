This program will study quasar outflows to test the evolutionary paradigm that
links quasars and supermassive black holes to their host galaxies. This will be
accomplished via observational and theoretical work on quasar accretion disk
outflows that will derive the kinematics, densities, ionization levels, and
driving mechanisms of the flows. Elemental abundances in quasar environments
will also be addressed, as will the relationship between quasars and host galaxy
evolution via use of submillimeter-wavelength measurements.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the work include research training of
undergraduate and graduate students, implementation of a clicker system of
classroom response for introductory classes, and public lectures.
