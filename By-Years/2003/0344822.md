Award Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The symposium entitled: "EcoPhysiology and
Conservation: The Contribution of Endocrinology and Immunology" sponsored by the
Society of Integrative and Comparative Biology, examines the contributions that
ecophysiologists are making to conservation biology. This symposium will focus
on overviews of endocrinology and immunology with a special emphasis on
endocrine disruptors in marine, aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates, which are
important to environmental monitoring. New perspectives from the symposium will
aid biologists in identifying stressed individuals, reproduction problems,
source and sink populations, carrying capacity of specific sites, and landscape
features that promote the survival of populations and new metrics to quantify
ecosystem health. These perspectives will provide a mechanistic linkage across
multiples levels of biological organization, centering on the individual
organism. Resulting publications and a website from this symposium will launch a
new direction in organismal physiology called Conservation Physiology. This
field will draw attention to the role that physiologists can play in
conservation biology, spur conservation biologists to revise their text books to
incorporate physiological perspectives, encourage ecophysiologists to undertake
conservation problems, and will also provide fresh examples and materials for
undergraduate and graduate teaching. The combination of physiology and
conservation biology in the new field of Conservation Physiology will have broad
impacts on the fields of integrative and organismal biology. &lt;br/&gt;
