Western Illinois University will conduct a four-year program to create a
nationwide network to support teachers in implementing the NCTM Standards in
geometry. The project will enhance leadership skills of teams for strengthening
teaching practices; examine, document, and refine effective approaches and
materials; enhance teacher knowledge of geometry; and develop sensitivity to
equity issues. The activities will include five regional one-week seminars,
inservice work at local units, and presentations at professional meetings. In
all, 300 teachers of grades K- 12 will participate, and over 4,000 teachers will
benefit from the subsequent inservice efforts. This project was initiated by the
Board of Directors of NCTM and will benefit from its support of the activities.
Western Illinois University and the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics
have contributed an amount equal to 24% of the National Science Foundation
request. ***//
