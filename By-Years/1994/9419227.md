9419227 Crutcher Dr. Richard Crutcher, at the University of Illinois, and Dr.
Thomas Troland, at the University of Kentucky, are continuing a long term
collaborative project to observe the properties of magnetic fields in molecular
clouds in the interstellar medium. The major effort will be to measure magnetic
field strengths using the Zeeman effect. The observations will be interpreted by
detailed comparison with theoretical models of the structure and dynamics of
dense clouds. As a result, in the next few years one can expect a major
expansion in our empirical knowledge of magnetic fields in dense clouds and
their role in the fundamental astrophysical problem of star formation.
