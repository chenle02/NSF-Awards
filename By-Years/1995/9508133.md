9508133 Lange Despite the overwhelming evidence for the role of carbonatite
melts as metasomatic agents in the mantle, the physical properties of these
melts are poorly constrained. Although carbonatite melts are known to have
extremely low viscosities, their density and compressibility (particularly as a
function of composition) are completely unknown. The research goal of this study
is to provide the first direct measurements of density, thermal expansion and
compressibility on a wide variety of multicomponent (CaCO vya1
3-MgCO3-FeCO3-SrCO3-BaCO3-Na2CO3-K2CO3) melts over a wide range of temperature
(1000-17000oC) and pressure (0-35 kbars). After developing a model equation
appropriate to this seven-component system, experiments will be extended to
carbonatite liquids containing dissolved SiO2, P2O5, and F. The long-term
teaching goals include: the active recruitment, advising and support of
undergraduates to pursue research for a senior thesis; teaching an upper
division, required petrology course that allows the students to practice the
application of calculus and thermodynamics to big-picture, tectonically-related
problems of magmatism and metamorphism; teaching summer filed camp each year;
development of a new introductory course that will demonstrate why a knowledge
of geology has implications for understanding the political and economic
structure of a developing country, like Mexico. vya1
