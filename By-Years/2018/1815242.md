Rapid advances in computational capability have enabled dramatic advances in our
understanding of the dynamic sky. Intensive searches though massive volumes of
radio telescope data have revealed "fast radio bursts", highly energetic
millisecond flashes of radio emission from far beyond our Galaxy. This research
will deepen and broaden our understanding of these transient phenomena. Using
advanced algorithms developed by this research, surveys by the Green Bank
Telescope, Arecibo, and others will identify other burst sources, determine
their origins, and use them as probes of their extreme environments and the
intergalactic medium. The STEM abilities of graduate and undergraduate students
will be increased through their involvement in the research. In addition, an
inexpensive radio astronomy system capable of detecting celestial radio sources
will be developed for tutorials and laboratory exercises for undergraduate and
high school students.

The proposed research will provide the observational basis to understand the
origin of short duration radio transients such as Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs),
probe their population statistics and central engines, and investigate their use
as probes of extreme host environments and the intergalactic medium. New
algorithms will be developed for single pulse, transient, and pulsar searches,
including the implementation of a "finding survey with follow-up" that is robust
to selection effects and radio interference. A special area of focus is the
Galactic center, where exotic binaries, transient sources, and possible local
counterparts to the FRB population may be identified.
