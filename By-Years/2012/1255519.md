Amala Dass from the University of Mississippi is supported in a CAREER award
jointly funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry (MSN)
program of the Division of Chemistry and the Office of the Experimental Program
to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR). Professor Dass and his students
study gold-metal (Cu, Ag, Pd) alloy nanomolecules, which are ultra-small gold
alloy nanoparticles (< 3 nm, < 500 atoms) of molecular definition with specific
numbers of metal atoms and protecting ligands. Their chemical and physical
properties are unique and different than in bulk materials due to quantum-size
effects. Alloy Nanomolecules of the following composition: Au38 Metal38-x
(SR)24, Au144 Metal144-x (SR)60 and Au324 Metal324-x (SR)92 will be synthesized
using wet co-reduction methods. The compositional assignment will be performed
using matrix assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) and electrospray
ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry. The nanoalloys will be further characterized
using optical spectroscopy, electrochemistry and X-ray diffraction methods.

This research will facilitate the understanding of these alloys in this size
regime where quantum effects play important roles. These have potential
applications in catalysis, plasmonics, solar cells and medical diagnostics. As
part of this CAREER educational program, Professor Dass and his students will
develop a K-12 outreach program to North Panola high schools and involve high
school and undergraduate students in the proposed research. These programs will
encourage the participation of younger and under-represented students in science
careers.
