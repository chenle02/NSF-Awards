9552560 Valenta The California Museum of Science and Industry requests
$1,103,410 over three years to work in a partnership with the National Council
of La Raza to develop two content-rich "discovery rooms" in the Museum that are
supportive of further learning in the larger museum context and that guide
parents from culturally diverse backgrounds in supporting their children's
science learning at the museum and in the home. A major component of the project
is the "Our Place Academy," a comprehensive education program that will train
Latino parents of preschool and school-age children to serve as learning
facilitators in the discovery rooms. The curriculum of the Academy will focus on
skills that will both serve Latino parents as partners in their children's
science education and as leaders and disseminators within their own communities.
A training guide entitled, "Making it our Place" will be developed as a
practical guide for building a trained staff from the parents in a community to
facilitate learning in a discovery setting. Target audience is parents with
preschool and school-aged children.
