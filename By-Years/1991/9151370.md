The Department of Geography and geology is acquiring a gravimeter to provide
hands-on data collection ability for students in the introductory through upper
division courses. This acquisition allows introductory students to observe long
period seismic waves and calculate earthquake epicenters. Advanced students, in
geophysics courses, are using the equipment to measure earth tides , conduct
gravity surveys, and calculate anomalies. The instrument is also increasing the
ability of
