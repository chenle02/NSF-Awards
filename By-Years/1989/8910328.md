The purpose of this proposed project is to develop a methodology for designing
efficient parallel and distributed algorithms for very large-scale engineering
computational problems. A novel systematic algorithm design methodology based on
the concept of hierarchy, aggregation, and disaggregation (HAD) will be
developed. These three concepts are integrated with the popular techniques of
divide-and- conquer, recursion and iteration to form a systematic approach to
parallel and distributed algorithm design. To demonstrate the power of this
general methodology and to root the methodology is some specific engineering
fields, engineering computational problems used as test cacaos. Three parts of
this project include: The General Methodology Study, The Large Scale Problems in
Data Networks, and Dynamic Programming Problems. Implementations and simulations
for all the algorithms developed in the tasks will also be carried out.
