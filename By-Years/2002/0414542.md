This project is focused on the development of a series of practical and
mechanistically defined allylic amination and etherification processes with
amines, ammonia, ammonia equivalents, phenols and aliphatic alcohols, including
reactions to form oxygen and nitrogen heterocycles by intramolecular allylic
amination and etherification and intermolecular amination and etherification
followed by ring-closing metathesis. These reactions will be explored, in part,
with new phosphoramidites containing less stereochemical complexity and fewer
electron-donating substituents. To uncover the origin of regio- and
enantioselectivity, allyl complexes that are intermediates in the catalytic
process will be isolated and structurally characterized. The mechanism of the
reactions will be probed, exploring whether rearrangements of diastereomeric
allyl complexes or attack of nucleophiles on the allyl intermediates is
faster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award from the Organic and Macromolecular
Chemistry Program supports the research of Professor John F. Hartwig, of the
Department of Chemistry at Yale University. Professor Hartwig is developing new
methods for the synthesis of molecules containing nitrogen and oxygen. Such
molecules are ubiquitous in natural products and in pharmaceutical candidates,
and the development of effective methods for their formation with high control
of three-dimensional structure is essential. By pursuing a fundamental,
molecular-level understanding of the reactions forming such molecules, Professor
Hartig's research is expected to lead to important advances in the design of new
and effective catalysts with high selectivity, fast rates, low catalyst
loadings, and broad scope.
