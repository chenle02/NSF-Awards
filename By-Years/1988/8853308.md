The goal of this project is to upgrade the biological and technical training of
women undergraduates through the improvement of their light-microscopy
laboratory curricula. A major thrust of the project is to enable students to
view living organisms and tissues, and to learn modern techniques for the
examination and evaluation of living cells, cell processes and structures. The
addition of phase, polarized and fluorescence capabilities, and of stereo and
invited microscopes, increases the level of instructional sophistication and
significantly upgrades the technical proficiency of emerging students. The new
microscopes upgrade the entire departmental curriculum, greatly expanding the
range of laboratory experiments available in each laboratory offering, and
broadening independent student research program, thus making the women
scientists emerging from this department more competitive in today's competition
for graduate school admission and for places in the scientific/technological
labor market. The grantee institution is matching the NSF award with an equal
sum obtained from non-Federal sources.
