Scientific and engineering disciplines ranging from structural biology to
computer vision rely on data collection and analysis to guide scientific
discovery. Critically, in such applications, the systems under study constrain
and govern the structure of information in collected data. The goal of this
research project is to develop a family of statistical models that enables a
systematic extraction of relevant statistical information from these datasets by
bringing together interdisciplinary concepts from statistics and optimization.
The approach under development aims to provide a new set of statistical tools
that is adapted to this class of problems and that could have a transformative
impact on several scientific disciplines.

This project is articulated around a core set of techniques to analyze datasets
in the context of a latent algebraic structure, often arising from the physical
laws underlying the data collection processes. Unlike more traditional
statistical problems where a linear underlying structure is often built into the
model, data-driven science generates problems with algebraic but often non-
linear structure. The project focuses on problems of central importance in a
variety of scientific and engineering disciplines, including signal processing,
structural biology, and computer vision, that share a similar feature: the need
to leverage algebraic structure in order to extract information from data. The
project aims at developing a systematic approach to analyze this family of
problems, together with a general procedure to construct computationally
efficient algorithms using low-rank tensor decomposition. Importantly, these
methods can be proved to be statistically optimal and therefore make the most
efficient use of collected data.
