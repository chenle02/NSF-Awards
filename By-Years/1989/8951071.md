Students are benefiting from a calculus curriculum enriched by the integration
of computers into instruction. A classroom- laboratory is equipped with IBM
compatible machines and software with graphing and symbol manipulating
capabilities that allow simulations and demonstrations. Students see calculus in
action and can devote more time to the analysis and synthesis of new ideas. The
institution will provide funds to match this grant.
