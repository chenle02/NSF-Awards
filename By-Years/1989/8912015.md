A three-year modeling study will address equatorial and coastal ocean
circulation, using a 2.5-layer numerical model that includes thermodynamics, and
allows entrainment and detrainment between layers. Specific applications are: 1.
Determination of which processes are necessary to make the model realistic; 2.
Stability of equatorial and coastal currents; 3. Extension to mid-latitudes to
address subduction; 4. Frontal Instabilities; 5. Effects of turbulent coastal
flow on biological processes; and 6. Westward propagation of coastally generated
gyres.
