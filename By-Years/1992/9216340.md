9216340 Prinn This is a broad-based research project focused on the chemistry
and chemical evolution of the atmospheres Earth and other planets. The work
involves development of chemical-dynamical atmospheric models, measurements of
atmospheric constituents focussing on hydrocarbons (gas chromatography) and
hydroxyl radicals (active titration), and development of a unified theory for
the origin of atmospheres. The principal areas in the research program are: (a)
Field measurements of nonmethane hydrocarbons (gas chromatography) and hydroxyl
radical (active titration) as contributions to the International Global
Atmospheric Chemistry (IGAC) Project. (b) Development of chemical-dynamical
atmospheric models and biogeochemical cycling models to aid interpretation of
data obtained in (a). (c) Studies of the current state and origin and evolution
of planetary atmospheres including effects of large collisions and surface-
atmosphere reactions, and taking into account early solar system processes
determining initial planetary volatile contents.
