In March 1999 about 150 researchers gathered in Como, Italy for the first
International Conference on "Analysis of Microbial Cells at the Single Cell
Level". The beautiful surroundings of Como were an excellent setting for
discussing the function of individual cells and how individual cells can be
analyzed. The Conference participants, a mixture of biologists and engineers,
addressed the three questions: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WHY do we need to analyze
at the single-cell level? This gives important information about cellular
function, cell-cell interactions in different ecosystems, and because population
dynamics, to a large extent, determines the overall function of large scale
cultures used in the biotech industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HOW do we analyze
at the Single Cell level? Through the use of flow cytometry, image analysis, and
mathematical models it is possible to analyze cellular function at the single-
cell level. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WHEN to analyze at the single-cell level? Both
in basic research on cellular function and in applied research aimed at
improving biotechnology processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In June 2002, the second
International Conference on this theme will take place in Vejle, Denmark. At the
Conference, the focus will again be on the three questions: WHY, HOW and WHEN,
and the latest developments within this interesting research field will be
presented. With the advances in genomics, the rigorous analysis of the phenotype
becomes an important and timely issue. The Conference also aims at further
strengthening and enlarging the scientific network established at the first
Conference, and to promote specifically communication between biologists and
engineers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The organizing committee plans to submit a
final report of the Conference to the National Science Foundation soon after the
Conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
