A large and unique data set of current, inverted echo sounder and
microstructure profiles collected in Puget Sound will be analyzed to identify
and quantify turbulent mixing induced by tidal forcing, free-shear
instabilities, intrusions and hydraulic jumps over sills. The analysis will
constrast interior mixing away from topography to boundary mixing due to
topographical features.
