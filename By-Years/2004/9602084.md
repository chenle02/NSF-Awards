The aim of this research is to clarify the conceptual foundations of quantum
theory through a careful study of the principles which govern correct quantum
reasoning. A particular focus will be the rules which determine whether or not a
quantum history--that is, a series of quantum events at successive times- -makes
physical sense. Previous work needs to be put into a consistent mathematical and
logical framework that will make it easier for students to learn the subject,
and aid in applying quantum theory to new fields, such as quantum computation
and various problems in modern atomic physics. It is well known that the
predictions of quantum theory violate a mathematical condition known as Bell's
inequality. Situations where this occurs will be studied to see whether the
violation points (as many physicists maintain) to the presence of mysterious
long- range forces in nature, or whether it simply indicates that derivations of
Bell's inequality do not conform to the rules for sound quantum reasoning.
