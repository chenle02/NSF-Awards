A 32-node hypercube computer will be provided for researchers at Cornell
University for research in the Computer Science Department and the Center for
Theory and Simulation in Science and Engineering. This equipment is provided
under the Instrumentation Grants for Research in Computer and Information
Science and Engineering program. The research for which the equipment is to be
used will be in the areas of solving numerical optimization problems on
distributed memory message-passing multiprocessors, implementation of two-
dimensional FFTs on the hypercube, a language which is a comprise between
imperative and functional languages and which combines some of the storage
efficiency of imperative languages with the ease of parallelism detection of
functional languages, and parallel algorithms for solving sparse systems of
linear equations where the coefficient matrix is symmetric and positive
definite.
