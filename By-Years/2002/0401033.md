The PI will study the theory of types in representation theory of p-adic groups,
intiated by Bushnell-Kutzko, from different angles. Firstly, we (jointly with
Julee Kim) would like to show that the pairs constructed by the PI are actually
types. This is known so far only when the expected corresponding inertia classes
consist of supercuspidal representations. Secondly, the PI has shown that the
compact open subgroup in this construction underlies a natural smooth group
scheme. We envisage that there should be more algebrao-geometric structure on
the pair, possibly a cohomological realization of types. This will bring new
connections with other parts of representation theory where
geometric/cohomological method is used.

The representation theory of p-adic groups is part of the Langlands program, a
philosophy linking representations with number theory and automorphic forms.
Hence it is the corner stone of many applications of the latter. The theory of
types is a new development in the past 10 years and sheds new lights on the
subject. But the types are rather complicated objects and are well-understood
only in special cases. This project will endow more structures and meanings to
the types to enable new connections with number theory and its applications.
