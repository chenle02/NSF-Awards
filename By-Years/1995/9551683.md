This project obtains a robotic sample changer controlled GC/MS facility directed
toward undergraduate education and student research courses. The robotic sample
changer controlled GC/MS enables unattended data collection on student samples
overnight and on weekends. The GC/MS is being networked to a series of existing
data stations, allowing student data processing, analysis, and use in lecture
courqes. The GC/MS results are being integrated with the results from other
spectroscopic (especially multinuclear NMR) and crystallographic techniques.
Laboratory studies in the sophomore through senior years emphasizes hands-on,
research-based laboratory experiences. Mass spectra and GC data is being made
available to other users via the Internet, in combination with NMR data for the
same compound. Summer courses on advanced instrumentation operation and data
analysis techniques are being offered to college faculty.
