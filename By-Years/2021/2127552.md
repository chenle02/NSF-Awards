The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology
Transfer Program (STTR) Phase I project is to advance a new women's health
device to address stress urinary incontinence (SUI). The estimated lifetime risk
of urinary incontinence surgery in women is 20% by age 80, with 41.3 million
women estimated to suffer from urinary incontinence by 2050. The associated
market had an estimated value of $1.6 billion in 2018, with projections to reach
$2.3 billion by 2026. The proposed device addresses this need and improves
clinical outcomes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Technology Transfer
Program (STTR) Phase I project aims to demonstrate the mechanical feasibility of
a non-mesh surgical device by developing the first viable prototype and
iterating elements of the device design based on mechanical tests (strength,
stiffness, and durability) of each of the deviceâ€™s components (i.e., the elastic
band, the tissue anchor, and the bone anchor) and the device as a whole. The
technical objectives include using computational simulations to assess the
material stiffness and optimize placement, preparing and testing materials, and
ensuring strength and longevity of the assembled
device.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
