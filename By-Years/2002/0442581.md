&lt;br/&gt;The OPTIC project is developing new upper-level physics curricular
material by combining computational physics expertise with interactive
engagement teaching techniques that have been developed and tested for
introductory physics. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Teaching and
learning in upper-level physics has received less attention than in introductory
physics. In addition, current research topics have only been integrated slowly
into these courses in a meaningful way. This project combines curriculum
innovation and design with recent progress in computational and theoretical
physics and physics education research to address upper-level physics.
&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The OPTIC project impacts physics
education nationwide by collaborating with an already-funded National Science
Digital Library (NSDL) project. New material is useful in at least three ways:
(1) as a basis for undergraduate work in traditional courses; (2) for developing
new material based on current topics such as biological physics and non-
equilibrium statistical physics that are usually accessible only to graduate
students and researchers; and (3) as useful material for student research
projects. The material is XML-based and is being integrated into digital
libraries for local, national, and international dissemination.
