The principal investigator will do research on VLSI design models and
methodologies. In the direction of modeling, he will find models that describe
accurately the constraints and requirements of the physical design process. In
the direction of methodologies, he will apply algorithmic techniques to design
automation problems, which are mathematical and formal, so that they can be
evaluated and analyzed prior to experimentation. Professor Liu will concentrate
on these topics: (1) two-dimensional approaches to the layout problem; (2) the
extension of floorplanning techniques to non-slicing modules and L- shaped
structures; and (3) the investigation of algorithms that might profit from
parallel computation, e.g. simultaneous global routing. This research addresses
the need to produce rapidly layouts of very and ultra large-scale integrated
(VLSI/ULSI) circuits which operate efficiently. It is a need that has become of
paramount importance as such devices become more complex and the industry
increasingly competitive. There are many approaches to problems in VLSI/ULSI
design; however they suffer from one of two problems. Either the design methods
are heuristic and can fail unexpectedly because analysis methods are not well
developed; or formal algorithms, which are well understood, take too much time
when very large circuits are involved. The basic need is for more realistic and
sophisticated models of computation and new analysis methods that will lead to
efficient VLSI/ULSI design methods. Professor Liu proposes to solve research
problems in VLSI theory (e.g. floorplanning, routing and parallel design
techniques) and put the solutions in software form to further study them. The
principal investigator has, in the past several years, turned his attention to
VLSI, where he has made important contributions to theory while keeping
practical problems in mind.
