It is proposed to explore a new approach for the realization of a high-density,
high-mobility, 2D electron layer in the hitherto- unexplored quantum-Wigner-
crystal regime. Quantum correlations will be investigated by measuring tunneling
rates out of the layer. The experiments should also give access to the dynamic
aspects of tunneling in the presence of many-body interactions.
