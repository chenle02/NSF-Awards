9412417 Hadden This project will examine ways to expand participation in the
selection and ranking of national goals for national science and technology
policy. It will organize and sponsor a one year process to initiate and
institutionalize a national forum on science and technology goals, with
participation from a broad cross-section of the United States population and
representation from groups not traditionally part of science and technology
policymaking, including nonexpert citizens. This project will develop a mission
statement, governing structure, and set of procedures for making decisions,
including how decisions will be made about who will be asked to participate. In
order to identify, develop and sponsor specific programs, the national forum
must have a structure, a set of procedures that allow for orderly and fair
decisionmaking and a clear sense of how participants will be chosen and
recruited. Answers to these questions entail critical choices about values that
will be reflected in the national forum's character and mission. There are three
phases of work in this year. The first phase will set up three committees
corresponding to the three questions to be answered: mission, structure, and
participation. These committees will be made up of people from an "interim
governing council," twenty members of which have already committed to the
project. The committees will each develop proposals that will be delivered to
all participants. The complete interim council will meet for three days in
Austin, Texas, to come to conclusions about the committee proposals. The last
phase will be dissemination of results to professional, scientific, technical,
business, trade union, academic, and public interest groups, government
officials, and the scientific and technical press. At the end of this process,
the national forum should be ready to start one or more trial programs. ***
