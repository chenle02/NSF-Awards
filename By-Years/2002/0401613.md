This RUI activity focuses on the experimental determination of more precise
values of the differential cross-section ratio for electron scattering from
neon, argon, krypton, and xenon atoms for scattering angles from 0-180 degrees.
Also measured will be the experimentally-normalized doubly-differential cross-
sections for near-threshold electron-impact ionization of helium, neon, argon,
krypton, and xenon for scattering angles of 5-130 degrees. The broader impacts
relate to the education of undergraduate students at this RUI institution.
