This award will use Artificial Intelligence to greatly speed up theoretical
calculations in elementary particle physics. Currently the detailed non-linear
equations governing the interactions of elementary particles are not directly
solvable, so a computational technique called Lattice Field Theory is used to
approximately solve them at separate points in space (the lattice) and then
combined to get an approximate result. The precision which can be obtained is
only limited by computational time. Currently the largest High-Performance
Computers in the world are kept busy with Lattice Field Theory equation solving.
This work will apply a new technique called Normalizing Flows to greatly reduce
the required compute time for these calculations.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Normalizing flows are a class of deep generative models
that can effectively model complex, high-dimensional distributions and have the
potential to transform many areas of physics. These models are designed by
composing many simple invertible neural network layers designed to efficiently
compute the desired result. These flows can model the probability distribution
of data from a real experiment and thus spend computational time only on the
parts of the calculation that will dominate the required solution. This award
will develop these normalizing flows for lattice field theory. The work will
also enhance public outreach in the New York Public School system and maintain
an active Artificial Intelligence social media
presence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
