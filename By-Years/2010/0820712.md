The last decades have witnessed an escalation in the transnational movement of
people, capital, technologies, and discourses circulating in the name of health
and life. New kinds of global actors, termed medical tourists and medical
refugees, are the focus of increased attention, concern, and optimism. These
travelers, ranging from the poor to affluent, desperate to dissatisfied,
traverse multiple biopolitical borders in search of biomedical therapeutics for
themselves or to supply organs for others. While such processes have become a
critical component of global mobility and contemporary biopolitics, they are an
under-analyzed aspect of migration studies and social scientific research.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop explores the conditions of these global
quests for biomedical therapeutics or "medical migrations." The organizers have
convened twelve scholars, whose research tracks global flows of medical
migrants, in the first systematic investigation to ask: what do these
transnational movements reveal about the contemporary conditions and
consequences of the global biopolitics of beauty, health, and life? The workshop
is guided by three specific aims: (1) to develop and refine the analytic
category of medical migration; (2) to develop a tool-kit of comprehensive and
cutting-edge concepts and methods for anthropological research into the global
flows of people, capital, technologies, and discourses, which circulate in the
name of health and life; and (3) to disseminate the participant's collective
work by publishing an edited volume on the topic of medical migrations intended
to reach both a popular and an academic audience.
