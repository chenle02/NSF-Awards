Orr and Pitts will study the structure of nonselfadjoint operator algebras. In
particular, they propose to classify all closed two-sided ideals in continuous
nest algebras. Understanding these ideals is likely to lead to new constructions
and techniques with triangular operator algebras. Additionally, Pitts proposes
to find conditions weaker than hyperreflexivity which ensure that a CSL is
stable, and Orr proposes to study ideal structure of CSL algebras and new
maximal triangular algebras. The general area of mathematics of this project has
its basis in the theory of algebras of Hilbert space operators. Operators can be
thought of as finite or infinite matrices of complex numbers. Special types of
operators are often put together in an algebra, naturally called an operator
algebra. These seemingly abstract objects have a surprising variety of
applications. For example, they play a key role in knot theory, which in turn is
currently being used to study the structure of DNA.
