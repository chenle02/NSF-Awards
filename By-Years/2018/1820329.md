This SBIR Phase 1 project aims to produce songs that are optimized for learning
and memory. While music has long been recognized for its mnemonic properties
(e.g., the ABC song, the 50 states song, etc.) and is widely used as a memory
aid in the context of early childhood learning, music-based educational products
for the broader K-12 market are rare. Music is unique in its ability to engage
learners, make learning enjoyable, and transfer information into memory more
readily. Yet, music is predominantly experienced as an entertainment medium. The
goal of this research is to position music as a credible pedagogical tool by
scientifically crafting songs that support the learning of critical academic
skills and concepts - offering today's learners a relevant, effective and
efficient medium for boosting learning outcomes.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical innovation proposed is a
scientific framework for mnemonically optimized music and songs. This research
features two distinctive innovations: 1) isolation and identification of the
mnemonic drivers of songs, and 2) operationalization of these drivers as
parameters for the creation of songs optimized for learning. Methods employed
include computational and statistical modeling, expert input, and behavioral
measurement. The potential impact of this research addresses a pressing academic
need -- how to teach students using pedagogy that is relevant, engaging and
scientifically sound. If proven feasible, this research will fuel creation of a
unique musical form designed specifically to enhance memory and learning, with
application to K-12 learning and beyond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
