This award provides funding to the University of Kansas for a three-year REU
Site in Biomechanical Engineering under the direction of Dr. Kenneth J. Fischer.
The project will involve 10 undergraduate students each year for a ten week
summer program. Students will work with a faculty mentor on individual research
projets in biomechanical engineering. In addition to individual research
experiences, students will be involved in several group activities. These
activities will provide the student with 1) a breadth of exposure to different
scientific problems and research approaches, 2) detailed information about
additional educational career opportunities, 3) an environment that facilitates
student-student and student-faculty interactions, and 4) an opportunity to
explore research ethics in the field of biomechanical engineering. These group
activities will include a weekly seminar, a research ethics mini-series, tours
of research laboratories, and social activities. At the end of the summer
program students will give an oral presentation at a research symposium, and
will submit a report on their research project to their faculty mentor. Students
will also have the opportunity to attend a national scientific meeting of their
choice.
