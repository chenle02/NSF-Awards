Most strategic thinkers are of the opinion that the next world war, should one
occur, will not start with a "bolt from the blue," rather, the gravest threat to
international stability is usually taken to be an escalation of some minor
incident or conflict to a major international crisis and, ultimately, to a
global thermonuclear war. The researchers will study the escalation process by
using the contemporary methodology of games of incomplete information. This
methodology allows a more realistic asessment of escalation than more standard
models that assume complete information. In general, in complete information
games, war never breaks out and escalation never occurs. By contrast, the
dynamic processes discovered under incomplete information more closely match
those observed in the real world. The proposed modeling effort differs in one
very significant way from other incomplete information models; the players in
the games under study are provided with two distinct ways (other than outright
capitulation) to resist a challenge. This, in turn, permits the introduction of
an intermediate level of interstate conflict into the analysis and a more
realistic assessment of the conditions associated with stable deterrence. By
delving into these conditions the investigator will gain insight into the
precise set of circumstances in which sub-strategic deployments make limited war
possible and total war either more or less likely. For example, by assuming that
the players are unsure of each other's intentions to wage nuclear war, but that
each knows that the other will (or will not) choose to fight at a sub-strategic
level, the consequences of adopting a "Flexible Response" posture (or a policy
of Massive Retaliation) can be assessed. Similarly, by further assuming
incomplete information by each player about the other's willingness to fight
both at the sub-strategic and the strategic level, the implications of various
mixgures of these two policies can be addressed and the consequences of
different "mixes" of conventional and tactical weapons with strategic weapons
can be explored.
