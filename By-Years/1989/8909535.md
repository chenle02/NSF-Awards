This project is aimed at the design of linear-processor parallel algorithms for
various graph problems, and to discover the hidden structure in these apparently
simple problems. The focus is on the problems of finding various types of
spanning trees in graphs and on discovering new topological properties of these
problems related to planarity, separability, genus, thickness, and courseness.
The model of computation is the PRAM. A secondary objective, is the design of
topologically-oriented workstation tools for algorithm animation and
visualization to assist in this design and discovery process. These tools have
the potential be a significant addition ones of paper and pencil in research
related to graph theory.
