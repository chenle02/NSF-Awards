This project is a study of the chemistry of iron sulfide minerals, and the
factors controlling their distributions and composition in natural sediments.
The primary focus of the proposed research is on the interaction of transition
and class "B" metals with iron sulfide minerals, and builds on recent results.
Experimental research on mackinawite reaction kinetics, and the coprecipitation
of non-Fe metals with this phase will be undertaken to provide information
relevant to metal behavior in sulfidic environments. The distribution of several
important "trace" metals in "reactive", dissolved and pyrite phases will be
studied in a variety of sulfidic sediments to determine the primary factors
controlling the transfer of these metals into pyrite. These studies will be
augmented by "jar" experiments with radiotracers.
