The propagation and scattering of electromagnetic waves in dispersive and
inhomogeneous media are of essential importance in microwave, THz (tera-hertz)
and light-wave technologies. The effects of dispersive dielectrics, such as
biological tissues, rocks, soil, snow, ice, plasma, optical fibers, and radar-
absorbing materials, must be taken into account in the design of electromagnetic
devices. The understanding of these effects leads to new devices with unique
characteristics. Due to geometric complexity, interface discontinuities,
solution singularity and time-varying nature of the solution, the development of
efficient and accurate numerical methods for solving dispersive media problems
remains a challenging issue in computational mathematics. The goal of this
proposal is to develop a new efficient and accurate numerical method for
modeling, analysis, and simulation of electromagnetic wave problems in
dispersive and inhomogeneous media. In this project, the investigator will
construct stable and reliable formulations based on the weak-Galerkin finite
element method for handling the complex geometry, interface discontinuity and
low regularity solution, and then extend the analysis to time dependent
problems. New mathematical schemes will be developed based on dispersive media
models and complicated coupling of field components at the dielectric interface.
The proposed approaches will be applied to a number of realistic problems,
including microwave breast imaging, ground penetrating radar and double negative
metamaterial. Advanced computational tools developed in this project, including
those for constructing efficient numerical formulation, handling complex
geometries and interface discontinuities will lead to a major advance in
mathematical modeling and computation of wave scattering and propagation in
dispersive media.
