0220566 Winant &lt;br/&gt;Using 10 years of data from the Mineral Management
Service's Santa Barbara Channel-Santa Maria Basin study, the PIs will
characterize the local internal tide regime. The major objectives of the
proposed study will be to identify the structure of tidal band motions in the
central California region, calculate the energetics associated with the internal
tide, and identify possible dissipation and mixing sites. Mean annual time
series of the key internal tide properties will be developed and assessed in
terms of the annual cycles of the local mean flow and stratification. The
influence of intermittent events in the mean flow field, stratification and
meteorology on the internal tide structure will be identified. Aberrations from
the mean annual cycles corresponding to El Nino and other interannual induced
changes in meteorology and ocean conditions will be identified. With the
information generated by this study, it will be possible to quantitatively
assess the effects of internal tides on water quality and resource management
issues in the geographical region of study and in similar coastal shelf regions
of the western United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
