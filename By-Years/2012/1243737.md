A novel method is developed to convert long video sequences from a single camera
into 3D panoramic visualizations. The approach holds the promise to work at near
real-time on a laptop. The 3D content allows users to change view angles and it
also supports panoramic views. The system has two real-time software components:
(1) the image matcher that generates multi-view panoramic mosaics from 2D image
sequences; and (2) the 3D renderer that can provide an end user a virtual fly-
through or walk-through of a scene using commercially available 3D displays. The
approach promises real-time 3D visualization for a broad range of camera types
(high end/low end color, IR, even gamma-ray/r-ray imaging), camera motions
(linear, circular), motion platforms (airborne, ground vehicle, hand-held), and
scene distances (from a few inches to thousand feet). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
technology has matured from research into environmental monitoring, security and
defense applications, where video was captured from a single camera on board an
aircraft or ground vehicle. The system is able to produce 3D visualizations of
the videos for further video data analysis, scene understanding and scientific
discovery. The technology has applications not only in defense and environmental
monitoring, but also in entertainment, medical imaging, inspection, real estate
and land survey/development industries. There are many 3D ready devices, from
TVs, to smartphones in the consumer market already. But the content is still
missing. To address this unmet need, the team is building a smartphone
application to enable user-generated 3D content, without requiring a 3D camera.
