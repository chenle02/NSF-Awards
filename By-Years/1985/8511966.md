This work studies the basic constraint relating changes in image irradiance and
relative motion of an image-sensing system with respect to the environment. The
solution for the motion, as well as the shapes of the objects in the
environment, given time-varying images, is based on a calculus of variation
formulation. It is expected that the discrete versions of the resulting Euler
equations can be solved using iterative methods applied to a grid. Algorithms to
recover motion and shape are tested, and a design for real-time hardware
implementation is developed. The planned approach uses information from whole
image regions instead of special feature points. This approach also avoids the
computation of optical flow, an intermediate product used in one previous
partial solution of this problem. An important goal is the development of
algorithms which can be executed in a cooperative fashion on a grid, utilizing
recently developed architectures for parrallel computing.
