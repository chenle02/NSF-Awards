The principal investigator will study the qualitative behavior of solutions to
a class of problems from multidimensional elasticity. The problems to be
considered are equilibrium problems for realistic models of homogeneous,
isotropic, hyperelastic materials in two and three dimensions. In particular,
the stored energy functions in these problems blow up as the determinant of the
deformation gradient approaches zero. The main goal of the project is to
determine a priori regularity and qualitative behavior of solutions. The
principal investigator will also investigate uniqueness of solutions as well as
qualitative properties of solutions to specific boundary value problems, such as
the one describing uniaxial extension of a hyperelastic bar.
