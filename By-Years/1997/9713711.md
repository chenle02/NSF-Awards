9713711 Fischer A study of the tribochemical polishing of silicon will be
undertaken. The objective is to find a more environmentally acceptable polishing
medium than the currently used chromium oxide and to improve the tribochemical
polishing of surfaces consisting of different materials deposited on silicon
wafers, such as they are encountered in the fabrication of integrated circuits.
The study will involve a close examination of the polishing mechanisms involving
chromium oxide and the related friction-activated surface reactions as well as a
study of the chemical characteristics of the polishing fluids and their effect
on polishing performance. ***
