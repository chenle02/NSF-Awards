The research submersible Alvin is operated by the Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution in support of scientific programs undertaken by US oceanographers.
The boat carries a pilot and two scientists and has made major contributions to
US oceanography, ranging from research on the biology of the deep sea to the
formation of the ocean crust. It is the only deep diving submersible routinely
available to the US community. This year will mark the 25th anniversary of Alvin
operations and the present award will support a symposium to summarize the
scientific accomplishments of this unique national resource. The symposium is
being jointly supported by the National Science Foundation, the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration and the Office of Naval Research.
