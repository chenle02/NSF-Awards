In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor Durig, a world-renowned spectrscopist will organize the
Twelfth International Conference on Raman Spectroscopy. This conference will
bring together spectroscopists and theoreticians from all corners of the world,
and the NSF support will provide funds specifically earmarked to facilitate the
participation of graduate students and postdoctorals. The meeting, with an
expected participation of 500 scientists, will be held at the University of
South Carolina, and will be comprised of plenary lectures, invited talks, and
