The challenge in biology is increasingly not the availability of data or even
of computational power, but rather the ability to interpret results and
effectively apply computer hardware advances to critical scientific problems. In
particular, the explosion of sequence and three-dimensional structural
information is fundamentally changing biology by extending our understanding of
many basic biological processes to the atomic level. The fields of biology,
mathematics, physics, and chemistry find common ground in exploring biological
structure-function relationships. To fully exploit this paradigm shift,
analytical software aimed at this juncture between fields must be made
accessible to the scientific community. Even in the field of structural biology,
where advances have previously paralleled the increased speed and affordability
of computers, the software to perform essential tasks consistently runs behind
this rapid hardware development, and many aspects of high-end and parallel
computing are dramatically under-utilized. Yet, scientists developing new
computational methods for use in their own specific fields and projects are
hard-pressed to develop and support generally usable software that takes full
advantage of new hardware. The Computational Center for Macromolecular Structure
(CCMS), is a three-institution project that unites researchers at The Scripps
Research Institute, the University of California at San Diego, and the San Diego
Supercomputer Center to meet this challenge. As a collaborative structural
biology effort between scientists, applied mathematicians, and software
engineers, CCMS is a productive way to develop and disseminate new techniques
for determining and analyzing- macromolecular structures and to bring high-end
computing power to the user's workstation via the network. This Group Proposal
seeks continuing support for CCMS to d evelop, distribute, and support
innovative software for advancing research on biological macromolecules at the
interface of biology, applied mathematics, computer science, and chemistry. . ~
