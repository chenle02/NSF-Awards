Windom 9413534 This award provides funding for acquisition of a system upgrade
to the existing Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS) located at
the Skidaway Institute of Oceanography (SkIO). This upgrade will consist of a
laser ablation system that allows for multi-element analysis of solid samples,
an ElectroThermal Vaporization (ETV) furnace that allows multi-element detection
limits about one ppb using an interference eliminating "dry" plasma, and a
mistral high-efficiency nebulizer that dissolves samples before induction into
the ICP-MS. Investigations to be undertaken with this advanced capability
include fish otilith layer trace metal analysis, rare earth element
determinations, Thorium ratios in marine sediments, trace metal mobilization and
transport in rivers, estuarine geochemical processes, sediment geochemistry, and
groundwater discharge effects on coastal ocean chemistry. SkIO will contribute
over 100% in matching funds for this acquisition and the upgraded instrument
will serve as a regional asset for area environmental, geological and marine
sciences universities and research institutions. ***
