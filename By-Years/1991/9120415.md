ABSTRACT The goal is to investigate the architecture of the language processing
system via the study of how the system copes with ambiguity. Two classes of
models are contrasted: serial models, in which only one interpretation of an
ambiguity is considered, and constrained parallel models, in which several
interpretations may be briefly considered in parallel. A second factor is
whether probabilistic cues may influence the interpretation(s) that are
generated for an ambiguity. Two different ambiguities are investigated:
syntactic ambiguities and pronominal reference ambiguities. The specific aims
are to investigate 1) the interaction of cues that are encountered before an
ambiguity and ones encountered after an ambiguity, 2) the interaction of cues
from different levels of linguistics representations, such as syntactic and
discourse-level cues, and 3) individual differences in ambiguity resolution as a
function of working memory capacity. Earlier research has relied heavily on one
dependent measure, reading time at the disambiguation. Six supplementary
measures are proposed: 1) examination of reading time in other regions, 2)
studies in which ambiguities are resolved with a highly favored interpretation,
3) examination of cues that follow the ambiguity, 4) norming of stimuli to
manipulate cue strength on a continuum, 5) the use of examination of individual
differences. It is expected that the addition of these methods will distinguish
the opposing models more precisely than in much previous work.
