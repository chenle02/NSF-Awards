This award contributes to the nation’s security and welfare by developing data-
driven decision tools designed to improve police and first-responder operations.
The project simultaneously addresses improved patrol zone design and efficient
officer staffing. Police zone designs in large U.S. cities can become outdated
if not effectively revised to keep up with population growth, changing
transportation patterns, and urban development, leaving vulnerable communities
at risk. In addition, police staffing nationwide continues to be constrained by
limited budgets and high attrition rates. This project will leverage the vast
amounts of data that are available today to create new analytical models and
algorithms that promise significant improvements over traditional approaches.
The research outcomes in this project will be informed by data from the City of
Atlanta, Georgia but will be of value to police agencies nationwide. In
particular, the project will develop computational decision support tools with
interactive graphical interfaces to visualize police zone reconfiguration and
police workload change. The research team will make available computer codes for
data analysis, zone design and staff planning free of charge to other interested
agencies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research methods employed in this project
will bridge several fields in operations research and data analytics, including
spatial-temporal models in statistics, queueing theory in applied probability,
and discrete stochastic optimization. The project will create high fidelity
models for police emergency service systems using large-scale police reports and
census and transportation data. By leveraging modern statistical and queueing
methods, the service system will be modeled and analyzed using stochastic
methods in order to estimate intensity, location, and categories of emergency
calls, as well as the service capacity and travel time of police officers and
first-responders. The project uses optimization methods to develop efficient
algorithms for zone design and staffing based on these stochastic models. The
model’s effectiveness in preventive policing and equitable coverage will be back
tested through empirical analysis of policing data. The project will involve
graduate students who will be learn how modern optimization methods can be used
to improve design in a service sector critical to the nation's
security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
