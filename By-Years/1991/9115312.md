This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) involves preliminary study of
the role of plants in weathering by a two-fold approach; a field study on the
island of Hawaii and on Mt. St. Helens, and laboratory analyses. Hawaii offers a
unique opportunity to study weathering because here there are: (1) dated basalts
ranging back to more than 4000 years (2) a wide range of plant life, from
lichens and algae to well developed rainforest, within small regions of constant
bedrock lithology and constant microclimate and (3) access to the expertise of
biologists who are presently studying plant ecology in the same area. We plan to
measure the thickness and mineralogical and chemical composition of weathering
rinds on young flows and to determine the chemical composition relative rates of
weathering in the presence and absence of specific biota. Modeling of the
geochemical carbon cycle and its effect on atmospheric CO over Phanerozoic time
(Berner, 1990) has revealed the importance of knowing more about how land plants
affect chemical weathering. This includes both the effect of plants on the rate
of uptake of CO by silicate weathering and the feedback response of plant-
mediated weathering to changes in atmospheric CO .
