CTS-0238636&lt;br/&gt;O. Velev&lt;br/&gt;North Carolina State
U.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal is focused on three different concepts for
developing and manufacturing colloidal templates, namely using electrophoresis
and dielectrophoresis as well as supercritical Carbon Dioxide. The combination
of electrophoresis and dielectrophoresis are flexible tools for developing
colloidal templates that should be scalable to manufacturing uses. The use of
supercritical carbon dioxide as a medium for performing the templating provides
control over the process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational plan consists of
integration of microfluidic devices into the undergraduate laboratory and the
development of specific course modules in areas such as Colloidal Science that
could be then incorporated into other courses. The PI also plans to establish
collaboration with NC A&amp;T, an HBCU.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
