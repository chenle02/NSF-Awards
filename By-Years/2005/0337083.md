Many grasses, including some economically important crops, are considered
"orphan systems" because they do not have sequence databases that permit
efficient genetic fingerprinting, mapping and gene fragment identification.
Modern breeding depends on molecular tools such as these. The justification for
support of this project as a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) is that
this is a short-term, proof-of-concept project that will develop an urgently
needed tool to meet these needs.

This project will begin to develop a database of Conserved Non-Coding (CNS)
sequences to cover the grasses. The CNS sequences are large, exact phylogenetic
"footprints" in the non-protein coding parts of genes. They can be obtained by
pair-wise comparison of sequences from whole genome and Expressed Sequence Tag
(EST) collections. CNS sequences make excellent Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
primer sites. Since the CNS sequences are highly conserved, a PCR primer
designed by comparing, for example, maize and rice, will work in the other
10,000 grasses as well. This project will determine the feasibility of finding
CNS sequences and designing primer pairs using the available sequence resources.
If it is successful, the long-term goal will be to develop about 4000 primer
sequence pairs that amplify specific polymorphic fragments of known, mapped
genes, across all grasses. These sequences will be valuable tools for
understanding genome architecture across the grasses, as well as for mapping.

Broader impacts The results will be made available through a project web site
that will include viewing tools to enable the user to sort and select sequences
of interest. The outcomes of the project will have a broad impact, facilitating
research on grasses, and allowing tools from well characterized systems such as
maize and rice to be leveraged for less well developed, but agronomically
important relatives such millet.
