ABSTRACT This project will study the causes and consequences of dual- earner
couples' decisions to share parenting equally. The background characteristics of
equally-sharing couples, the ways in which they develop an equal division of
childcare responsibilities, and the impact of this nontraditional division of
labor on wives, husbands, marriages, and children will be examined. The project
will entail three phases: 1) telephone interviews with husbands and wives in 400
couples, designed to identify a sample of equal-sharing couples and to
illuminate the factors that influence parents' assessments of the division of
childcare; 2) of paternal participation, including 60 middle- class and working
class couples who share parenting equally; 3) a set of interviews with husbands
and wives in 30 expectant couples who intend to share parenting equally and
follow-up interviews with husbands and wives in the original 60 equally sharing
couples. The research will inform our understanding of the development of
identity in adulthood, the link between sex-role ideology and family
organization, the barriers that keep men from full participation in the family,
and the potential benefits that fathers' full participation might bring.
