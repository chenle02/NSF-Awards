Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;The PI requests support for preparation of a
large collection of vertebrate fossils recently recovered from the Central
Transantarctic Mountains (CTAM) of Antarctica. These fossils will be used to
place early Mesozoic Antarctic dinosaurs and other vertebrates into a global
evolutionary, biogeographic, and faunal context; assess the degree of endemism
in Triassic vertebrate faunas of Antarctica; constrain temporal relationships of
the Triassic Antarctic vertebrate faunas; and refine the stratigraphic context
for the Triassic Antarctic vertebrate assemblages to establish a
paleoenvironmental framework. The lower and middle Triassic fossils offer a rare
window on life in terrestrial environments at high-latitudes immediately after
the Permian mass extinction. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts:
&lt;br/&gt;The PI will use their fossils to educate the public about the
geologic, climatic, and biologic history of Antarctica by visiting local
schools. They will create and publish at least two new videos to the Burke
Museum blog that relate the graduate student?s experience of fieldwork in
Antarctica. They will also update the Antarctica section on the UWBM "Explore
Your World" website with images and findings from their field season.
