The research program of Dr. Michael Harmata in the Department of Chemistry at
the University of Missouri-Columbia will be supported by the Organic Synthesis
Program. The principal investigator will study the scope, stereochemistry and
mechanism of a reaction class known as 4+3 cycloadditions. The paucity of data
regarding the process make it a fertile area for the investigation of new
methodology leading to the construction of important ring-containing compounds.
The goals of the work are to establish the efficacy and scope of the
intramolecular 4+3 cycloaddition of dienes with alkoxyallylic cations,
particularly those derived from the corresponding allylic sulfones and to apply
the emerging methodology to the synthesis of structurally interesting and
important molecules.
