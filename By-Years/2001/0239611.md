Krzysztof Szalewicz of the University of Delaware is supported by the
Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to develop and apply symmetry-
adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) to investigations of intermolecular
interactions in molecular clusters and the condensed phase. Part of the effort
will be devoted to further extensions of SAPT that will improve convergence,
treat open-shell systems, handle species of increased size, and provide for a
physical decomposition of interaction energies into electrostatic, exchange,
induction, and dispersion contributions. Applications include the structures and
thermodynamic properties of van der Waals complexes, condensed phases of carbon
dioxide, and mixtures of water and methane.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
will enhance understanding of phenomena dependent on intermolecular interactions
such as properties of clusters, liquids, molecular solid phases, and many
biochemical processes. This activity may contribute to new pressure and
temperature standards, help in developments of green chemistry, aid explorations
of energy resources, and provide data for constructing models of the atmosphere.
