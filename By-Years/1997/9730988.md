The objective of the research is to develop an integrated system for monitoring
live load and verifying live load carrying capacity of highway bridges.
Therefore, the proposed research will deal with the development of the control
system for live load on bridges and the control system of live load carrying
capacity. The anticipated major contributions will include: the improvement of
field testing procedures using remote sensors and transmitters on-site
processing of the data, calculation of critical truck loads, accumulated fatigue
load spectra, maximum deflection, derivation of reliability-based criteria for
acceptability limits, elements of active control with on-site response to
critical overload as determined by comparison with the developed reliability-
based criteria, integration of truck weigh-in-motion with diagnostic testing and
proof load testing, derivations reliability-based criteria for establishing
proof load level for bridges. The research will be based on the experience
gained in an extensive field testing program and bridge reliability analysis at
the University of Michigan.
