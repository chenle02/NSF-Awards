Shpectorov, 97-0114 The principal investigator will study affinization as
applied to dual polar spaces. This process produces a large variety of
interesting geometries with almost classical diagrams. There are many nice
examples including several geometries of sporadic simple groups. The principal
investigator proposes find all the most symmetric --flag-transitive-- affine
dual polar spaces. The field of group theory is the mathematical theory of
symmetry and interacts with many other disciplines, for example physics and
chemistry outside of mathematics, coding theory, number theory and geometry
inside mathematics.The investigator?s particular area is finite groups and
geometries. It is an old subject but still facing great unsolved problems and
with many opportunities for breakthroughs.
