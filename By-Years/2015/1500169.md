Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Global warming mobilization of the large (up to
50% of global) reservoirs of reduced organic carbon associated with northern
permafrost regions of the Arctic, and conversion to radiatively important
atmospheric (greenhouse) gases such as CO2 and CH4 presents a positive warming
feed back of potentially considerable strength. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Currently
there is a lack of understanding of how fast and to what extent this stored
organic matter is microbially transformed within Arctic watersheds and Arctic
coastal systems. Despite the marked ?old? (14C depleted) label of permafrost
carbon compared to contemporary organic matter, the comparitive lack of an
?aged? C signature in the downstream Arctic river systems presents something of
a conundrum. Further, the rapid remineralization of permafrost reduced carbon is
not consistent with the notion that reduced (permafrost) carbon is
recalcitrant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research aims to examine the partition,
chemical and isotopic compositions, and ages of carbon species, including
organic and inorganic/dissolved and particulate carbon, as well as lignin/lipid
biomarkers in three subarctic/arctic rivers (Chena, Porcupine, and
Sagavanirktok) and their basins. This will enable a comparison along a
latitudinal gradient covering sporadic, discontinuous and continuous permafrost
exposures, as well as along temporal scales from initial spring freshet to full
summer and fall season and freeze-up.
