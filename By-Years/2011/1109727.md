Dr. Fischer will use the CHIRON spectrometer on the CTIO 1.5-m telescope to
search for exoplanets via the radial velocity technique. She will target 30
bright late-type (G and K dwarf) stars with the goal of achieving 1 m/s
measurement precision with new instrumentation after first testing it in a
laboratory environment. The PI and her team will also develop a Doppler
simulator to help determine the best possible observational precision.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will train postdoctoral research associates,
graduate and undergraduate students in research and instrumentation. The team
will also work on the ?jitter? observational problem, which results from
vertical atmospheric motions on small spatial scales, and if solved, would have
wide applicability to other fields of astronomy. They will also conduct a hands-
on ?Pathways to Science? program for school children, and help the Yale
planetarium director develop a new show on exoplanets.
