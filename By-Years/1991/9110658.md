The purpose of this study is to analyze the stabilization of posture during
stepping. The research will combine experimental and theoretical approaches.
Experiments on normal subjects will measure ground reaction forces and the
electrical activity of muscles using surface electrodes. The mechanical system
is described by a 3-dimensional mathematical model that has 8 degrees of
freedom; this model will be used for the interpretation of the experimental
results. The research will increase understanding of the stepping process, and
may lead to the improved design for functional electrical stimulation systems.
Such systems are being increasingly utilized in research to restore motility in
paraplegic individuals.
