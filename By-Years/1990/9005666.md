This award supports the research in algebraic combinatorics of Professor Curtis
Greene of Haverford College. Dr. Greene's project is to continue his work in a
number of areas related to partially ordered sets, tableaux, and representations
of the symmetric group. This research falls in the broad category of
combinatorics, which is one of the most active fields in today's mathematics.
Fundamentally, combinatorics represents a systematization of the very first of
all mathematical activities, counting. In its modern development, however,
combinatorics has gone beyond just counting to make use of a wide variety of
advanced mathematical techniques, and although its roots go back several
centuries, the field has had an explosive development in the past few decades
because of its importance in communications and information technology.
