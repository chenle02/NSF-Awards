This award is supporting travel for sixteen researchers to attend the Public
Policy Issues in Cyber-Security and Privacy for Small Grid Technology to be held
Chicago, IL, September 30th ? Oct 1st, 2009. Background:

The push toward more economic and cleaner electricity supply is spearheading the
implementation of smart grid technology in the electricity industry. The
effective deployment of digital communication and control technology in the
smart grid raises concerns over cyber-security and privacy. While some of these
concerns pertain to the technology aspects, there are numerous issues of a
policy nature that have not been adequately explored. The goal of the workshop
is to support dialog on public policy issues in cyber-security and privacy for
smart grid technology. It will bring together interested stakeholders, domain
experts, and policy makers from government agencies, national labs,
universities, developers and vendors, industry associations, and consumer
organizations from the U.S. and other countries. The workshop is designed to
provide a forum for the in-depth discussion of the most pressing issues and to
address policy requirements for providing practical ways to safeguard the cyber-
security of the smart grid technology and to insure that the privacy concerns of
individuals are effectively addressed.

The sessions of the workshop will focus on thematic thrusts in the areas of
need for regulation or self-regulation, the key policy musts, and the role of
standards in the assurance of cyber-security and privacy.

The workshop is co-funded by the McArthur foundation.
