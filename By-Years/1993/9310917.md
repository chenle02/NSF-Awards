9310917 Miller Perhaps the most important advance in archaeology over the past
40 years has been the development of absolute dating techniques, beginning with
Carbon-14, which allows for the dating of materials back as far as 30,000 years,
and continuing on with Potassium/Argon techniques for much more ancient
materials. However, no such dating technique was available that covered the
period of our prehistory between 30,000 and 300,000 years ago. Recently, this
group of scientists has developed an important and reliable dating technique
that covers a good deal of this interval, by using eggshell, especially ostrich
eggshell, but now likely generalizable to new materials: fish earbones, the
"doors" of gastropods, and so on. They will pursue these applications in this
project, as well as expanding the technique to more recent time intervals, and
refining it. This project will expand our understanding of the origins of modern
humans, currently a very contentious subject.
