This award provides funding to the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities (UMN),
to upgrade the experimental capabilities of the George E. Brown, Jr. Network for
Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES), A System for Multi-Axial Sub-
assemblage Testing (MAST) facility at UMN that will be operated by NEES
Consortium, Inc., as a national shared use facility during FY 2005 - FY 2014.
The requested equipment provides Pseudo-dynamic testing capability for the UMN
NEES site, and was selected based on recommendations of the site visit teams for
annual review and input from earthquake engineering researchers interested in
using this equipment site. The scope of work includes developing a local pseudo-
dynamic server that will control ramp-and-hold pseudo-dynamic testing as well as
continuous pseudo dynamic testing. These added features will enable NEES
researchers to conduct near Real-Time testing and slow continuous pseudo-
dynamic testing including sub-structuring in conjunction with the existing 6-dof
capability of MAST. This capability was not provided at this site under the
original cooperative agreement CMS-0086602.&lt;br/&gt;This equipment will be
available to the earthquake engineering research community through the NEES
Consortium, Inc., UMN NEES facility. This award is funded by the NSF NEES Major
Research Equipment and Facilities Construction (MREFC) project and is a
component of the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program
(NEHRP).&lt;br/&gt;
