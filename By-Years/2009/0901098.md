The proposed research lies on the interaction between Gromov--Witten theory and
other subjects in mathematics and physics, including birational geometry, moduli
of curves, and mirror symmetry. The main themes of the proposal are the
functoriality of Gromov--Witten theory under crepant transformations and the
mirror symmetry in the orbifold category.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gromov--Witten
theory lies in the intersection of many exciting research areas in mathematics
and physics. On the one hand, the theory itself has remarkable conjectural
structures. Investigating these structures requires some new insights into the
theory and input from other areas. This provides a lot of interesting problems
for classical subjects in mathematics. On the other hand, it also helps to
discover deep relations and connections between existing mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;
