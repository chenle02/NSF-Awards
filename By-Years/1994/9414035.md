ABSTRACT CTS-9414035 Roger Doherty The purpose of this equipment grant proposal
is to modernize the microscopy facility of the Mechanical Engineering at Drexel
University (ME-DU) by acquiring an analytical scanning electron microscope (SEM)
equipped with an EDS X-ray detector and its microanalytical processor. This
equipment will substitute the corresponding aging instruments that are currently
available at ME-DU. This equipment is important for a large number of research
projects, including the following: {SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol"} Processing of
Ceramic Polymer Nanocomposites Using Thermal spray (NSF) {SYMBOL 183 \f
"Symbol"} Plasma Sprayed Lightweight Coating for Lightweight Structure (NSF)
{SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol"} Evaluation and Control of Microstructure During Spray
Deposition (NSF) {SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol"} Structure-Processing-Properties in
Ceramic-Ceramic Composites Manufactured by Transient Plastic Phase Processing
(NSF) {SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol"} Semisolid Processing of Spray Cast Alloys and
Composites (NSF) {SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol"} Investigation of the Micromechanics of
Failure Unidirectional Composites Using Laser Raman Spectroscopy (NSF) {SYMBOL
183 \f "Symbol"} In-Situ Metal Matrix Composites Via VLS Reactions (ONR) {SYMBOL
183 \f "Symbol"} Modeling and Microstructural Development During Spray casting
(ONR) {SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol"} Recrystalization and Deformation Processing of
Polycrystalline Metals (NSF/ALOCOA) The currently available SEM has been
continuously used for over 11 years and is essentially at the end of its useful
life. The responsibility of maintaining the machine in good working condition,
training students in its use and driving the instrument for occasional non-
expert users, will be assigned to the full-time technician currently employed by
the ME-DU for the microscopy laboratory. The technician is overseen by the
principle investigators of this proposal. The new SEM machine will also be used,
as was the previous SEM, in t he senior design projects and teaching of
undergraduate courses at Drexel in light of the newly developed Drexel
Curriculum which has an emphasis on the laboratory experience.
