Gama-Torres 9308040 This applicant will study a novel gene regulating embryonal
carcinoma cell differentiation and tumorigenesis in a mutant cell line differing
in these properties from the parent cell line. Specifically, sequencing of the
region of DNA flanking a single insertion mutation has revealed an open reading
frame with no homology to any known mouse gene. Further analysis of the gene
encoded at the disrupted locus will be pursued. This work will be conducted in
the laboratory of Dr. Paulette J. McCormick at the University at Albany, State
University of New York. ***
