9312037 Wetherbee Fond du Lac Community College (FDLCC) requests support from
NSF for connection of its campus network to NSFNET. They will contract with
MRNet for delivery of Internet services. These services would support joint
projects on the FDLCC campus and on the Fond du Lac Reservation funded by the
Department of Energy, the National Science Foundation, and the Environmental
Protection Agency specifically designed to support young Native Americans in
pursuing scientific careers. FDLCC would be the first Minnesota Community
College System campus to join MRNEt and one of the first American Indian Higher
Education Consortium (AIHEC) members to offer Internet services on campus. FDLCC
would be in a good position to provide leadership and technical assistance,
especially in utilizing Internet services,other AIHEC institutions. The College
needs greater functionality and network speed to be able to access
supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers along with being able to
implement a more reliable mail system. Students and faculty research will
benefit from the link. This is also a unique opportunity for the school to
explore innovative educational resources. ***
