Using molecular biology to bestow a characteristic on a product that permits its
selective removal from a multicomponent cellular extract can be of immense
benefit in the downstream processing of the products of biotechnology, including
enzymes, hormones and antibodies. Theory and past results both indicate that the
addition of charged tails to proteins can aid the selectivity of separation
methods. This proposal seeks to fuse polypeptide tails to proteins in order to
enhance the recovery of proteins. Beta-galactosidase has been chosen as a model
protein to carry out this proposal. The work plan includes the following: 1.
Design of the polypeptide tail. 2. Synthesis of the gene segment for the tail.
3. Cloning this segment into the beta-galactosidase gene. 4. Expression of the
gene in E. coli. 5. Assessment of structural and/or activity changes in the
target protein. 6. Recovery of the fused protein by precipitation and two-phase
aqueous extraction. This grant application is an excellent example of the type
of cross-disciplinary proposal we wish to see in the Engineering Directorate's
Biotechnology Program. The Principal Investigators are considered to be well
qualified to carry out the proposed research.
