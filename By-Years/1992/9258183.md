The fundamental properties, materials issues, and applications of
superconducting materials at high frequencies will be studied. High frequency
measurements of superconducting electrodynamics and magnetic flux dynamics are
key to understanding the fundamental properties of superconductors and testing
the emerging theories of cuprate superconductivity. These measurements also
provide a means of materials characterization and are essential for developing
new applications of superconductors.
