This RAPID proposal seeks funding to develop, build and deploy a proto-type full
ocean depth Ocean Bottom Seismograph (OBS) in the Mariana Trench in January
2013. Current OBSs are limited to deployment depths of 5000-6000m, and the few
experiments that have deployed at or near those depths have had poorer
instrument and data return rates. The scientific need for full ocean depth
instruments is increasingly being recognized with recent large tsunamigenic
subduction zone earthquakes, as well as broader interest in full global coverage
of seismic monitoring for understanding deep earth
processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs have been offered the opportunity to
utilize full-ocean depth technology developed for the recent manned dive by
James Cameron to Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench. In addition, a cruise of
opportunity exists in January 2013, in which the instrument will be deployed at
about 8600 m and collect approximately a week of seismic data at
depth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
development project has the long term potential for using full ocean depth OBSs
to monitor and perhaps forecast areas at risk for large destructive submarine
earthquakes. Large submarine earthquakes in the last decade alone have taken
hundreds of thousands of lives globally, cost hundreds of billions of dollars
and resulted in catastrophic environmental damage such as the Fukushima nuclear
power plant disaster.
