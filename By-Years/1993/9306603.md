9306603 Burney Paleoecological techniques will be employed to characterize
anthropogenic versus background-level environmental change and extinction in
Madagascar. Trends in biotic communities will be measured on long time scales to
contribute information on temporal variability, paleobiogeographic
distributions, and causative mechanisms needed to evaluate and predict present
and future biotic responses to environmental stress. Stratigraphic microfossil
analyses, will be combined with collaborative efforts in dendrochronology,
paleontology, archaeology, and geochronology to evaluate competing hypotheses
concerning the causes of the late Holocene subfossil extinctions, and to begin
constructing models of biotic change in Madagascar on ecological and
evolutionary time scales. %%% This research represents an ideal opportunity to
conduct an interdisciplinary study of the causes of large-scale extinctions. In
particular, the research will attempt to evaluate the effects of human land use
versus climate change on patterns of biodiversity in the tropics. Such
information is essential for understanding and predicting future man-induced
changes on global species richness. ***
