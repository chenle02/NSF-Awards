9353803 Lobos Supporting Girls in Science Endeavors will link school and
community groups to encourage upper elementary and middle school girls and their
families in active science pursuits. Cranbrook Institute of Science, a science
museum north of Detroit, will be the catalyst for this effort which will bring
together more than 75 professionals and associations already recognized for
their focus on science issues. The museum will initiate this collaborative
effort which is expected to reach more than 800 girls with sustained science
programming. Four specific tasks will be included in the year-long effort: 1)
Science Programs for Girls consisting of direct hands-on science activities, 2)
Parent Support Activities comprised of family centered events, including
seminars and a newsletter, 3) a conference for leaders of organizations
interested in science for girls and 4) a Network for science program leaders and
teachers. The result of this effort is expected to be a dedicated corps of adult
leaders and parents who can knowledgeably encourage girls in science, and more
than 800 girls whose positive experiences and new contacts will sustain their
interests in science. ***
