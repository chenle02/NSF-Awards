9314372 Williams This award provides travel support for Dr. Dana Williams of the
Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Dartmouth College, to spend two
months conducting collaborative research with Professor Iain Raeburn at the
University of Newcastle in Australia. As a part of this cooperative activity,
Dr. Raeburn will make a reciprocal visit to Dartmouth College in late 1994 or
early 1995 supported by the Australian Department of Industry, Technology and
Regional Development. The topic of the research is the definition of the Brauer
group for dynamical systems. Dynamical systems are mathematical realizations of
physical situations involving time evolution or symmetries. Recent theoretical
work has led the collaborators to the realization that there is an important
underlying structure in which various non-commutative systems associated to a
fixed commutative system form a group - the equivariant Brauer group. Using this
new approach will allow the initiation of a program which applies sophisticated
algebraic techniques to dynamical systems.
