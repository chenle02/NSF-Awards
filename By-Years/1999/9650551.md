The project consists of enhancing the laboratory content of an existing
biochemical engineering course. The bio-engineering laboratory is being used in
three separate week-long experiments and one quarter-long independent research
project. The three basic modules are as follows: (1.) Basic Techniques_safety
and culture of different types of cell using sterile technique; (2.)
Biomolecular Separation_protein and nucleic acid electrophoresis along with
polysaccharide separation using open column GPC; (3.) Microbial
Fermentation_Quantification of growth parameters and mathematically modeling of
the reactor. The independent project is open ended and determined by the student
within the timed budget constraints of the course. This project takes a minimum
of 30 hours to complete and requires an oral presentation of the results. Major
pieces of equipment required for support of this course include a water
purification system, laminar flow hood, -80+C freezer, an Inverted phase
contrast microscope, and a personal computer. This equipment can be utilized by
other laboratory courses in biology chemistry and chemical engineering.These
improvements can result in graduates of chemical engineering who are more
prepared to work with scientists with bioscience backgrounds.
