The chemistry and mineralogy of air-borne components of marine sediments can be
used to trace the source location of the dust. From these data it is possible
then to trace the trajectory of air masses and winds at times in the past. This
proposal requests support to develop a formal data base of surface sediment
mineralogy, aerosol mineralogy, and air mass trajectory for the Pacific Ocean.
These data can then be used to reconstruct past winds and air mass movements
with greater accuracy. The research is important because the reconstruction of
past wind directions and intensities provides important information about how
the atmosphere responded to past climate change. Past wind intensities and
directions also help to test the sensitivity of General Circulation Models,
since wind direction and intensity are principal output from these numerical
simulations.
