Professor Faris will conduct research in the mathematics of wave propagation in
random media. The spectral and scattering properties of the waves will be
studied. Faris' major goal is to describe the role of scattering resonances in
determining the scattering properties of a random obstacle. Another goal is to
understand random wave diffusion. The study of random media is of great interest
in modern physics and mathematics. The idea here is that in certain types of
materials the atoms are not arranged in a regular manner. In fact the materials
tend to look rather chaotic. The mathematical model then is probabilistic, and
one tries to find statements which are true with probability one.
