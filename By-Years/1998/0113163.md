This project addresses the need to improve the way we
access&lt;br/&gt;experimental data and theoretical models associated with
nuclear and particle physics reactions. Tools will be developed in order to
achieve: (1) more efficient searching within the database of existing
measurements; (2) interactive comparisons between data and models constructed to
describe them; (3) the incorporation of new measurements into the system. A wide
range of capabilities will be presented in order to satisfy both the novice and
advanced users. Private accounts will be available to professionals wishing to
analyze preliminary experimental results, or plan for new measurements.
Methodsdeveloped here will be applicable to other scientific databases as well.
Linking such sites through the Internet promises to accelerate much of the
background checking required in scientific research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
