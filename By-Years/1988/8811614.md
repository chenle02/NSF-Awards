Impedance tomography is the process of generating an electronic image from the
impedance characteristics of a body of matter. This technique has been used
successfully as a tactile sensor. This reserach project is concerned with the
creation of a high resolution, two dimensional impedance imaging array capable
of taking an electronic picture of a wall growing cell culture. Fundamental to
this system is the two dimensional cross bow array. While some progress has been
made on this array, several significant problems remain. One such problem with
the two dimensional cross bar array is the determination of the localized
impedance measurements at the intersection points of the two grids which
comprise the array. Initial efforts have indicated variations of impedance of
only 5% to 10% change leading to poor localization. Research will be conducted
to improve the measuring cell impedances and to develop techniques to monitor
the growth of cell colonies with impedance measurements; electronics to scan an
area of the cross bar array; galvanostats needed in shielding the principal
wires from extraneous currents; fabrication of the cross bar arrays.
