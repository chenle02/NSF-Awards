In the 1960s, plate tectonics, a model of the Earth based on the notion that the
surface of our planet is paved with a mosaic of rigid plates that move large
distances of geologic time, revolutionized the geological sciences and explained
the distribution of dangerous earthquakes and hazardous volcanoes. The societal
relevance of plate tectonics is hard to overestimate. Yet even then, there were
hints that there are regions affected by diffuse deformation, where the rigid
plate model does not entirely apply. Just how and why diffuse deformation occurs
is not well understood, and a thorough analysis is long overdue. The project
will address that problem, in a systematic way, for the first time by
quantifying the rheology and dynamics of diffuse plate boundaries using thin
viscous sheet models. The chief broader impact of this work lies in its
implications for our understanding the working of our planet at the most
fundamental level. The work also has more specific implications for improving
hazards due to earthquakes and volcanoes.
