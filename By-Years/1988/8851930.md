SUNY Ulster County Community College will purchase an inductively coupled plasma
spectrometer and automatic sample changer. This equipment will be used to
improve instruction in the water quality monitoring program at SUNY Ulster.
Students who are training to become water quality monitoring technicians will be
introduced to the type of instrumentation that now is used by commercial and
governmental laboratories to monitor for trace pollutants in water supplies.
SUNY Ulster County Community will match the NSF grant with an equal amount of
funds.
