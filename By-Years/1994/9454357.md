*** 9454357 Weissglass This is a four-year project to disseminate effective
strategies to accelerate progress in achieving equity in mathematics education.
Two target audiences are a national cadre of 144 professional developers and a
California cadre of teacher leaders. Each group will be involved in 24 days of
workshops over two years with expectations to use these strategies in their own
settings between workshop sessions. National participants will be recruited in
teams from existing and forthcoming mathematics education projects. The project
will provide on-going support for professional developers through electronic
communications and a newsletter. The project request is $ 3,099,940 with cost-
sharing as $ 809,212 or 26%. ***
