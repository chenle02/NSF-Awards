Device performance of GaAs metal- semiconductor field effect transistors
(MESFETs) on conventional semi-insulating GaAs substrates has been limited by
backgate or sidegate effects which can lead to undesirable cross-talk between
neighboring devices and thus impose limits on packing densities. Recent research
has shown that incorporation of a low temperature buffer layer grown by
molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) can result in many performance improvements,
including elimination of backgating. Because of its very high processing cost,
MBE is not commercially viable production method. We propose to form an effect
buffer layer using ion implantation, demonstrated manufacturable process. One of
the dominant characteristics of the MBE-grown buffer layers is an excess of As
in the film. Ion implantation is well suited to simulate the MBE layers since
implantation conditions can be tightly controlled to precisely engineer the As
profile by adjusting implantation parameters such as dose, energy, and dose
rate. Phase I work is to use ion implantation to produce As-rich isolating
buffer layers in GaAs. The structural and electrical properties of the buffer
layers will be studied and compared to those of MBE-grown layers.
