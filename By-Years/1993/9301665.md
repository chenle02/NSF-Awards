Larvae of sea urchins develop larger ephemeral feeding structures when food is
scarce and accelerate development of postlarval structures when food is
abundant. The proposed research will test whether similar adaptive plasticity
occurs in larval development of other marine animals and can be seen in natural
populations of larvae. The research will also test the effects of endogenous
food supplies on larval development.//
