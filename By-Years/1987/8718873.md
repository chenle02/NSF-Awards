The objective of this proposal is to understand how an environmental signal,
submergence, is translated into greatly accelerated growth of deepwater rice. At
the cellular, physiological and biochemical/molecular level, Dr. Kende will
continue his investigation to show how lower levels of oxygen increase the rate
of ethylene formation by enhancing the activity of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-
carboxylate synthase in the internode. He will also investigate the relationship
between ethylene production and the plant's subsequent responsiveness to
gibberellin. Dr. Kende and his group have provided important information on how
gibberellin and ethylene interact to regulate internodal extension in deepwater
rice. In his current proposal he will extend these studies and incorporate
additional biochemical and biophysical studies that will elucidate hormone
action during the physiological response to submergence of this agriculturally
important crop.
