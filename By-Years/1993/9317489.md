9317489 Walker A Phosphorimager is a replacement for autoradiography. The
instrument uses imaging plates that are coated with a special phosphor that
traps and stores radiation energy. The stored energy is stable until the plate
is scanned with a laser beam which releases the energy as luminescence. The
luminescent signal is detected by a photomultiplier and the data are ultimately
stored as a digital signal. Sophisticated software running on a workstation
allows the data to be displayed, analyzed, printed and stored. The principal
advantage of a phosphorimager over traditional autoradiography is the wide
dynamic range and increased sensitivity. This state of the art instrument will
make a variety of experimental analyses more sensitive and facilitate
quantitative analysis of the data collected. u ~ @ ^ G +G + P 4 ^ \ ? R U V ^ _4
