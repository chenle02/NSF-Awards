The main goal of this workshop award is to gather specialists in Secondary Ion
Mass-spectrometry (SIMS) who will present and discuss technical approaches to
scientific problems, instrument operation and improvements, standards, and
service to the national geochemical community. This workshop will bring together
scientists and students from the nation's geological SIMS laboratories,
instrument manufacturers, and other interested parties to discuss the state of
the art of SIMS microbeam analysis techniques and scientific results. The BGSW
is of great importance to the national geochemistry community since it
represents the only regular meeting of researchers from geochemically-oriented
SIMS labs in the United States. These facilities are vital for developing new
geochemical SIMS applications and for providing access and expertise to
scientists from across the country who require SIMS capabilities to carry out
their own research.
