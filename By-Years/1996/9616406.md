9616406 Roman The University of Maryland, Horn Point Laboratory will continue
the scientific planning and management activities of the Coastal Ocean Processes
(CoOP) research initiative. The CoOP program seeks to promote interdisciplinary
research in the coastal ocean. Its goal is to obtain a new level of quantitative
understanding of the transports, transformations and fates of biologically,
chemically, and geologically important matter over the continental margins. CoOP
planning is being undertaken by a group of scientists dedicated to organizing
large scale efforts in interdisciplinary coastal ocean basic research. Through a
series of workshops and the deliberations of a scientific planning committee,
activities are undertaken to define the actual process studies and long-term
measurements to be made.
