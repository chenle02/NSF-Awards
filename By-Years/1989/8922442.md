This award will support collaborative research between Dr. Ted Flanagan,
University of Vermont, and Professor S. Rundqvist, Department of Inorganic
Chemistry, University of Uppsala, Sweden. The objective of the project is to
investigate the solution of hydrogen (and hydride formation) in a series of
metal p-element compounds which have the stoichiometry of metal phosphides.
These all have the same tetragonal Ti P structure. The thermodynamic
measurements of hydrogen solution will be made at the University of Vermont and
the structural determinations of the hydrogen (deuterium) positions in the
lattices will be carried out in Sweden using neutron diffraction. The
combination of the two approaches is desirable, becuase it will allow a more
complete interpretation of the results to be made. The understanding of the
behavior of these systems is important because they have features in common with
related systems of some technological interest, e.g. H in silicon and amorphous
alloys.
