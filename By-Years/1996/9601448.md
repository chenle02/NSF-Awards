We are submitting this proposal to conduct a two-and-one- half day "First
International Symposium on Molecular Dynamics of Biomembranes". The University
of North Carolina at chapel Hill and Duke University will host this meeting of
experts in computer simulations, computational chemistry, structural biology,
biomembrane structure, and high performance computing as the first in a planned
series of "Triangle Biophysics Symposium". This symposium will bring together
the ideas and expertise of leading researchers in these areas, and will be
highlighted by a poster session (both traditional and electronic) to view and
discuss the latest developments in the molecular dynamics of membrane systems.
