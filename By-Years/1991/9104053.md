Professor Stevens will work on special values of L-functions and their relations
to arithmetic geometry. He intends to continue working on the exceptional zero
conjecture of Mazur, Tate and Teitelbaum. He also plans to work on modular
symbols. This project falls into the general area of arithmetic geometry -a
subject that blends two of the oldest areas of mathematics: number theory and
geometry. This combination has proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently
solved problems that withstood generations. Among its many consequences are new
error correcting codes. Such codes are essential for both modern computers (hard
disks) and compact disks.
