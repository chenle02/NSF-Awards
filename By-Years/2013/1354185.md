For this project, a cross-disciplinary and intra-disciplinary research team will
use multiple field data collection methods including statistical, genomic, and
ethnographic methods to document the role of experts in the interpretation and
reception of information about human genetic variation to members of the public.
DNA sampling will be conducted for 300 study participants from three age cohorts
(young [18 to 30 years], intermediate [31-50 years], and older [51 to 70+]
adults) with each cohort equally represented by females and males.

The results of the project will be shared with participants and the public
through a public interactive exhibit and accompanying website.
