The objective of this research is to develop the engineering technology base to
produce structural parts in ceramics from both solid powders and gas precursors.
If successful, this technology has the potential to produce order-of-magnitude
productivity improvements in design visualization, prototyping, and parts-on-
demand and to dramatically shorten development cycle times for engineering
systems by breaking the modelmaking/prototyping bottleneck. This technology does
not directly compete with conventional processes for large production numbers,
but competes in low production number situations such as the production of
prototype parts, design visualization models, casting patterns, and parts on
demand. The feasibility of Solid Freeform Fabrication has been experimentally
demonstrated using Selective Laser Sintering on polymeric materials, a process
developed during our research in this area.
