This project will examine which of two possible causes, difficulty in feeding or
constraints on development, are responsible for setting the lower limit for the
size of fish. The findings will help test theories of life-history evolution,
and provide developmental and functional insights into limitations on
recruitment in marine fisheries. The size of individuals spans many orders of
magnitude, but is constrained at the large and small extremes by principles of
physics. As organisms become smaller, the world surrounding them becomes more
resistive to their movements, which are thought to limit the size of fish
offspring to no smaller than 4.5 mm. At this size, fish larvae experience
difficulty feeding. Alternatively, size at birth is also related to the time it
takes to reach maturity. This project will test these alternatives using guppies
as a model system. The project incorporates undergraduate mentoring and research
training. Additionally, the project will utilize the guppy as a model for the
teaching of evolution and ecology within local high school classrooms.

This project involves two miniaturization manipulations: hydrodynamic and
developmental. In the first manipulation, the researchers will increase the
viscosity of water using dextran, thereby effectively miniaturizing the
offspring in size, but not development. In the second manipulation, the
researchers will remove yolk from the eggs of developing embryos, thereby
miniaturizing and prematurely delivering the young. Because guppies are live
bearing, the yolk manipulation requires culturing guppy embryos in vitro in
order to access the yolk sac. With a pulled capillary tube, yolk will be removed
such that guppy embryos will be forced to feed exogenously at approximately 4.4
mm. Feeding rates will be compared between the hydrodynamic and developmental
manipulations to determine if size or maturity is the limiting feature when
feeding on suspended food items. Feeding trials will be filmed using high-speed
video to measure jaw kinematics and determine the Reynolds number under which
the feeding apparatus is operating during suction feeding.
