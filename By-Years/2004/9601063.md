9601063 Roye The principal investigator in this study will use an invertebrate
model (the commercially important blue crab) to study nerve cells in a central
nervous system that organize a well defined behavior occurring in a single body
appendage (withdrawal of the first segmental appendage, the antennule). He will
use appropriate modern techniques (intracellular recording, fluorescent dyes
injection, etc.) to identify and map each cell involved to the production of
this particular behavior. A great benefit of the model used is that each cell in
the neural network under investigation can be identified as a unique entity
present in all blue crabs. Studies of this type are important if a real
understanding of how the behaviors generally (including those of man) are
created by brain neural networks. The potential value of a complete
understanding of the form and function of neural networks that produce behavior
is enormous, with implication for computer design, robot fabrication, etc.
