9255225 Royce Ballinger The major goal of the Nebraska EPSCoR Committee is to
design a practical, farsighted plan for science and engineering infrastructure
development and technology transfer as part of its expanded responsibilities as
an official science advisory board to the Governor of Nebraska. A key element of
the plan is to sponsor specific research enhancement programs in Behavioral
Biology, Metallobiochemistry, and Materials Research on Nanostructured and
Complex Systems. Researchers from the University of Nebraska Lincoln, the
University of Nebraska Omaha, and Creighton University will participate in the
research programs. The overall program objective is to bring for the first time
a logical and well ordered approach for: 1) evaluating the science and
engineering strengths and needs of the state; 2) providing a forum for
discussion between universities, the state government and the private sector in
setting both short and long term goals, priorities and achievement standards for
research; 3) establishing mechanisms for evaluating the effectiveness of the
sponsored programs in achieving enhanced competitiveness for Nebraska's
scientists and engineers and in fostering long range economic development for
the state, and 4) promoting science and engineering in the schools and
communities of Nebraska. ***
