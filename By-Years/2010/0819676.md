0819676&lt;br/&gt;Bulbul Chakraborty&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports
the US-India Planning Visit: Collaborative Research on the Statistical Mechanics
of Granular Materials. US PI Chakraborty of Brandeis University will visit
Professor Deepak Dhar, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai and
Professors Chandan Dasgupta and Sriram Ramaswamy, Indian Institute of Sciences,
Bangalore. They will finalize a collaboration on developing a theoretical
framework to describe collective properties of granular assemblies and the
jamming transition. The Indian collaborators are leading theorists in the field
of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and disordered systems at two well-
known research institutions in India. The topics they will address fall within
the theory of granular systems and are closely related to Chakraborty?s current
research supported by DMR (0549762). This planning visit will not only add an
international component to the current grant, but will extend its scope and add
high intellectual value through collaboration with renowned Indian
scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
