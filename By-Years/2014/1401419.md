This proposal concerns the relation between two different areas of algebra:
group theory, the abstract study of symmetry, and algebraic number theory, the
study of algebraic numbers, like the square root of 2 (as opposed to
transcendental numbers, like pi). The main link between these two fields is
provided by algebraic geometry, the geometry of systems of polynomial equations
in several variables. A key theme in the proposed work is monodromy, which
encapsulates the symmetries revealed by a parametrized system as the parameter
follows a closed loop. Monodromy problems arise in many settings, in both pure
and applied mathematics. For instance some of the techniques under study in this
proposal have been used by the proposer and others to determine which kinds of
computations can be carried out by different kinds of quantum computer.
Algebraic number theory has found important practical applications, especially
in the development of modern cryptosystems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theme of
this proposal is group theory in relation to algebraic number theory. The main
goal is to use group theory as a tool, for instance in analyzing images of
l-adic Galois representations, or Mordell-Weil groups of abelian varieties over
Galois extensions of the rationals. The secondary goal is to study groups,
especially linear groups, using methods from number theory and algebraic
geometry, including the circle method, etale cohomology, and deformation theory.
