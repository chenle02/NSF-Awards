9423188 Dusanic Trypanosoma musculi is a protozoan parasite which resides in the
bloodstream of the infected mouse. It lacks intracellular stages and provokes a
protective immunity against reinfection after the parasites (trypanosomes) are
cleared from the general circulation. Parasites can not be detected and there is
no evidence of an active infection. However, trypanosomes persist in the
capillaries (vasa recta) of the kidneys long after they can no longer be found
in the peripheral blood and other tissues. This host-parasite relationship
provides a model for studies of latent infections in immune hosts. This project
is designed to describe the precise locations of the parasites in the vasa
recta. It will describe their morphology and reproductive activities, their
interactions under conditions in the vasa recta, and their biochemical and
surface characteristics. The data obtained will indicate whether these kidney
forms represent a unique stage in the trypanosome's life cycle and provide
insights into the persistence of the parasites in the immune host during latent
infections. ***
