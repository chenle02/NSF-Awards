Drilling of the San Andreas Fault under Earthscope's SAFOD has started this
summer (2004)&lt;br/&gt;and will recover geologic samples that offer unrivaled
opportunity to study seismogenic&lt;br/&gt;fault rocks and fault mechanics, and
relate fault processes to the seismic processes. We&lt;br/&gt;propose a two-day
mini-workshop to coordinate the research efforts by various
scientist&lt;br/&gt;teams on core and cuttings samples that will be obtained
during the various stages of&lt;br/&gt;SAFOD drilling. A small group will
convene in Paso Robles, CA on October 8-9, 2004 to&lt;br/&gt;discuss research
priorities and efforts, as well as make a visit to the nearby drill
site&lt;br/&gt;at Parkfield where samples are temporarily stored. The workshop
conveners are Jim Evans&lt;br/&gt;(Utah State), Teng-fong Wong (Stony Brook) and
Ben van der Pluijm (Michigan). This&lt;br/&gt;workshop will help coordinate
research efforts of various groups, identify any gaps in
our&lt;br/&gt;characterization studies, and begin to develop strategies for
integrating the rock&lt;br/&gt;characterization efforts with other results from
SAFOD, including fluid and gas&lt;br/&gt;measurements, borehole geophysical
measurements, seismic monitoring, and in-situ stress&lt;br/&gt;measurements.
