The 2010 Pacific Institute for the Mathematical Sciences Summer School in
Probability will be an opportunity for a few top researchers in the field to
interact directly with the advanced graduate students and recent graduates. The
participants will learn the current techniques in the most significant areas of
probability theory, including random surfaces, quantum gravity, coalescents,
Schramm-LÃ„owner Evolution (SLE), Dirichlet forms, and mixing times of Markov
chains. It is expected that the participants will engage in active research on
some topics covered by the main courses and related areas. PIMS Summer School
2010 will be a great opportunity for graduate students and junior researchers to
learn some of the most significant modern probability theory from the top
experts in the field. The junior participants are often current and future
academic faculty, able to spread the knowledge of the modern techniques further
in the research community.
