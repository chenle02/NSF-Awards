Network design encompasses an array of problems as diverse as vehicle routing,
facility location, and telecommunications. Problems in this area naturally fall
into two types: capacitated and uncapacitated, according to whether potential
edges in (or flows through) the network are capacitated. While uncapacitated
network design problems are well studied and reasonably tractable, capacitated
problems seem to be considerably more difficult, in part because good integer
programming formulations for them are largely unknown. This research will focus
on an important network design model, the problem of designing a centralized
processing network. This research will focus on the development and
implementation of cutting-plan algorithms, based on linear programming, for
several variants of this problem.
