This award will permit the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to manage U.S.
dues for the membership of the Committee on Data for Science and Technology
(CODATA) in the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU) for the
12-month period beginning January 1, 1988. The National Science Foundation (NSF)
also provides funding to the NAS for the U.S. Advisory Committee for ICSU and
the U.S. National Committees for 20 constituent unions. The Division of
International Programs coordinates NSF's activities in fostering international
scientific cooperation, including providing broad access by U.S. scientists and
engineers to the benefits of selected nongovernmental international
organizations. ICSU, with its worldwide representation of scientific fields, is
among the more important of these for U.S. scientists and engineers. CODATA is
an interdisciplinary scientific committee of ICSU that seeks to improve the
quality, reliability, management, and accessibility of data of importance to all
fields of science and technology. Because all major industrialized nations are
members of CODATA, and all major scientific unions are represented, CODATA
provides a unique forum for U.S. scientists and engineers to advance their
international interests in a wide range of disciplines and to help solve
associated data problems. In consideration of the merit of CODATA as a way of
providing opportunities for cooperation in a multinational and multidisciplinary
context, and of the highly satisfactory management of U.S. participation in ICSU
overall through the NAS, the program manager recommends an award.
