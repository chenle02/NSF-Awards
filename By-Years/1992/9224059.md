Recent studies in steam ecology have indicated that stream sediments support a
biologically active community. This community is connected to the surface stream
by vertical currents that transport substances such as nutrients and organic
matter between these two areas. Even when the stream appears "dried up", flow
may continue beneath the sediment surface; thus, biological activity can
continue in this "hyporheic zone" during drought. While it is know that the
hyporheic zone is biologically active; the source of energy supporting these
activities is unknown. The goal of this research is to determine how the
hyporheic zone is "fueled" on a seasonal basis and between flood- disturbance
events. A combination of field measurements and experiments will be conducted to
test several hypotheses explaining the economy of this ecological system. Chief
among these are that organic matter is derived from surface photosynthesis and
transported either as dissolved or particulate material deep into the hyporheic
zone. An alternative is that organisms of this depend on material derived from
the terrestrial watershed (e.g. leaves, twigs, decomposed wood) and transported
to the stream channel during flash floods. A better understanding of the
hyporheic zone as part of the larger stream ecosystem will aid in managing this
resource wisely and in extending environmental protection to all functional
components of the ecosystem, including subsurface and groundwater elements.
