Permafrost temperatures at depth represent a systematic running mean of the
temperature history at the permafrost surface. Global changes, such as climatic
warming are, or will be, reflected in the permafrost temperature profiles.
Recent permafrost temperature measurements show that some Alaskan permafrost has
warmed as much as 4 C over the past 50-100 years and limited meteorological data
suggest that this warming is directly related to changes in mean air temperature
in an area where carbon dioxide warming is predicted to be the greatest. A host
of serious environmental and engineering problems that have a substantial impact
on the use of polar lands are associated with warmer and/or thawing permafrost.
However, data on the thermal regime of permafrost in Alaska are very sparse and
mostly unusable because of surface disturbances near the drill holes. This
investigation will measure permafrost temperatures at sixteen undisturbed sites
along the trans-Alaska pipeline corridor which includes Alaska's three major
climate and permafrost zones and at fifteen other widely distributed sites in
Alaska. Measurements will include temperatures in the air, at the ground
surface, in the active layer, at the permafrost table and in the permafrost to
depths of 80 m or more. Interpretation and modeling of these data will be
carried out to determine the relationships between temperatures at all levels
and the effects of changes in surface temperatures on the permafrost. These
studies will contribute to our ability to extract information on past climate
from the permafrost temperature profiles. Drilling the holes, the greatest cost
of these investigations, has already been completed.
