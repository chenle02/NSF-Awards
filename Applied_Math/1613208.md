The study of financial questions under model uncertainty has recently attracted
renewed attention. From a practical point of view, no single predetermined model
can fully describe a complicated financial market; it is more reasonable to take
into account all probabilistic models that are compatible with market data.
Another reason to consider model uncertainty lies in the fact that different
investors may have different beliefs or predictions about how the market would
evolve, reacting differently to the same stimuli. In this research project, the
investigator studies several stochastic optimization problems under model
uncertainty that are related to differential and Nash equilibrium in game
theory, quantile hedging, and derivative pricing with transaction costs. These
studies aim to illuminate some aspects of model uncertainty, which can be
applied not only to financial markets but also to other dynamical systems.

Mathematically, model uncertainty is usually represented by a non-dominated set
of mutually singular probabilities (a negligible set under one probability can
have positive mass under another probability). The investigator analyzes four
stochastic optimization problems when the uncertain evaluation criterion varies
in the nondominated probability set: (1) to determine whether a robust Dynkin
game has a value and admits an optimal triplet; (2) to determine whether a
robust non-zero-sum game among many players has a Nash equilibrium; (3) to find
an optimal strategy for a robust quantile-hedging problem; and (4) to find a no-
arbitrage condition for a robust continuous-time form of the fundamental theorem
of asset pricing with transaction costs. The lack of a reference probability in
the nondominated probability set makes difficult the use of classic tools, such
as the dominated convergence theorem and Komlos separation lemma, to analyze the
nonlinear expectation associated to the probability set. This project aims to
develop new methods to handle the much more complicated probabilistic situations
under model uncertainty. These are expected to be useful also in the more
general subjects of stochastic control and optimization.
