Rubin 0108857 This investigator develops and applies mathematical techniques for
the study of activity patterns in conductance-based neuronal network models
incorporating features, such as continuous coupling, diffusive interactions, and
heterogeneity in parameter values, that have largely been neglected in previous
mathematical work on these systems. Many of the mathematical results relate to
the derivation and subsequent analysis of subsystems of equations capturing
dynamics on disparate time scales. One challenge in this endeavor is that the
additional features considered prevent the application of known methods that
could otherwise be used to reduce the subsystem sizes and thereby facilitate
analysis. The particular activity patterns that are investigated are sustained,
localized activity of cell populations in the thalamus involved in sleep rhythms
and in tracking head direction; wave propagation, block, and reflection in
inhomogeneous neuronal media such as branching, thickening, or damaged neurons;
and periodic and chaotic oscillations in a heterogeneous population of
respiratory pacemaker cells in the brain stem. While this work is motivated by
particular neuronal systems, it provides new steps in directions with broad
relevance. Thus, the results of this project yield insight into pattern
formation and selection mechanisms that apply in specific neuronal contexts but
that also constitute more generally occurring phenomena. Neuronal networks of
the central nervous system can typically display multiple types of rhythmic
activity, ranging from periodic bursts of synchronized oscillations to traveling
waves of activity to more disorganized patterns. Many of these forms of activity
appear to be relevant to fundamental neuronal processes. The overall goal of the
investigator is to study mathematically the oscillatory population rhythms and
wave propagation arising in certain models of neuronal networks, based on
systems involved in such disparate tasks as navigation, respiration, and the
generation of sleep rhythms. This work elucidates the mechanisms that allow
these networks to support, and to modulate between, distinct activity patterns.
These results lead to conclusions about the roles of various biophysical
parameters in shaping network dynamics, with individual contributions teased
apart in a way that may be quite difficult to achieve with a purely experimental
approach. Such findings can then serve as guideposts for future biological and
computational experiments.
