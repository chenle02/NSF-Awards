This proposal is aimed at continuing and strengthening the regional workshop
series `Lie Groups, Lie Algebras and their Representations.' The express purpose
of the Workshops is to provide research level lectures for advanced graduate
students and post doctoral students working in areas related to Lie groups, Lie
algebras and their representations. Lie theory is a fundamental part of modern
mathematics and plays a key role in harmonic analysis, differential geometry,
number theory, algebra, algebraic geometry, and mathematical physics.

The workshops supported by this proposal take place over weekends three or four
times a year in California and other parts of the Western US. They provide novel
and stimulating research and study opportunities for graduate students and
junior researchers to become acquainted with research and researchers in the US
and visitors from other countries who are working in Lie theory and associated
areas.
