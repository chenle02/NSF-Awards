9604230 Silk Plant habit, the positioning of plant organs, is in the focus of
the proposed research. The work originates from a unified hypothesis, based on
existing models for the functioning of wood fibers, to explain twining of vines
and the unique monocot leaf display. Early in development of a twining organ
transient axial curvature and torsion are produced by gradients in the primary
growth rates. The work focuses on several experimental strategies to support and
test the central hypothesis. First, measurements in situ of forces that are
produced by vines around a supporting pole and measurements of leaf curvature in
wild type and mutant plants during development are monitored using unique
equipment. The data are correlated with fiber production, orientation and
distribution in the cell walls and measurements of lignification are done.
Forces of elasticity and springback are determined. Macroscopic measurements are
correlated with data after ultrastructural analysis. The results will be
correlated with light capture by plants. Results will shed light on how plants
use changes in habit to optimize their performance under particular
environmental conditions.
