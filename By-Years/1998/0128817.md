This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the
problem of constructing high-assurance real-time, networked embedded systems.
The project will develop a design environment, called HARBINGER, supporting the
specification, composition, analysis, and refinement-to-code of embedded
systems, in a way that preserves consistency between requirements and code.
HARBINGER will also supported guided refinement, e.g., by generating resource
tradeoffs throughout the process, enable capture and reuse of design knowledge,
and yield formal proofs of correctness to the extent possible. It is anticipated
that HARBINGER will lower the cost of producing new embedded systems and improve
the assurance of their correctness. Once in use, HARBINGER will also make
radical improvements in the evolution of systems originally constructed in its
environment. Practical problems such as targeting applications to changing host
platforms will be handled much more easily within HARBINGER&lt;br/&gt; In this
project, the firm will assess the practicality and effectiveness of the
HARBINGER approach for commercially important applications. This will require
selecting an initial market with strong requirements for high assurance software
and systems as the basis for a proposal for the next phase of the research.
Initial application candidates include automotive and aviation vehicle control
systems, areas in which the firm has extensive connections. In both of these
areas, attention will be paid to the practical consideration of legacy code and
to the impact of important new protocols.&lt;br/&gt;
