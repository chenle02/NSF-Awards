This grant will support a multi-agency workshop on microelectromechanical
systems (MEMS). The purpose of the workshop is to introduce MEMS to a broad
range of Federal agencies, and to seek applications of the technology in the
solution of problems faced by these agencies. Three specific objectives of the
workshop are (1) to introduce MEMS to representatives of several Federal
agencies, (2) to identify MEMS applications relevant to these agencies, and (3)
to provide a high-quality report on the status of MEMS technology and a
prediction of future developments and applications.
