Microbial ecologist are unsure of the composition and Traditional culture
dependent methods for microbial communities cannot ensure the recognition of all
community members. This limits understanding of how toxicants and genetically
engineered organisms affect natural microbial communities. Recently the
development of new molecular methods for analyzing a specific cellualr
component, 16S ribosomal RNA, was completed as a means of identifying the
various inhabitants of natural microbial communities without traditional culture
techniques. The initial results using these methods demonstrate that natural
communities do contain many inhabitants which were previously not noted in
microbial studies. The composition and structure of a model hot spring
cyanobacterial mat community will be determined in this proposal through in
depth comparative analysis of 16S rRNA sequences previously obtained for the
microbial mat. This should reveal the magnitude of the differences between real
community complexity and that portion described by the pure culture collection.
The well-studied nature of this model will also be explpoited to investigate the
trophic structure of the community, as well as possible problems limiting the
application of all rRNA methods usng 16S rRNA-based hybridization probes.
