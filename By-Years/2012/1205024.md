This project addresses theoretical physics at the interface of nuclear physics,
particle physics, and astrophysics. There are two major themes: i) exploring the
role of neutrinos and their self interactions in core-collapse supernovae as
well as in the Early Universe; ii) exploring the structure of nuclei at or far
from the line of stability using a combination of analytical and numerical
techniques.

Research activity contributes to the national priorities in nuclear science such
as neutrino physics and rare-isotope science. Neutrinos play an essential role
in physics and there is a fascinating interplay between neutrino properties and
various astrophysical phenomena. They are rather special particles with their
seemingly very small masses and feeble interactions with ordinary matter.
Neutrinos make an exceptional probe for astronomical environments that are
typically concealed from the standpoint of other observation techniques, such as
optical and radio observation. They also impact supernovae, the explosions that
end the lives of highly massive stars. Understanding the structure of rare
isotopes (short-lived nuclei not normally found on Earth) could lead to a better
understanding of the physics of nuclei, origin of elements, and fundamental
interactions, as well as applications for society. The project will directly
involve graduate students as part of their preparation as future scientific
leaders.
