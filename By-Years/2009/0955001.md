"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5)."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this EAGER proposal
is to produce and characterize bio-binder from swine manure to be used as
partial replacement for asphalt binder on highways and airport pavements. Bio-
binder is produced from thermochemical conversion of swine manure to both
eliminate the need for huge manure storage lagoons and improve asphalt binder
characteristics. This proposal is focused on the preparation, modification and
characterization of bio-binder from manure mainly for asphalt
pavements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will strengthen the areas of bio-
fuel, energy and sustainable infrastructure design. These areas are attractive
to both students and researchers who are seeking an understanding of the
relationships between biology, agriculture, chemistry, and engineering to
produce environmentally friendly replacements for construction materials to
protect and improve the health of individuals and our environment. Production of
bio-binder from manure can address this need in addition to finding a solution
for manure and waste management. This becomes even more significant taking into
account the relatively low cost of bio-binder production. While asphalt binder
costs $2/gallon, biobinder can be produced at $0.54/gallon. The broader impact
of the proposed partnership will be demonstrated through the exposure of
minority students at NC A&amp;T which is one of the top Historically Black
Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) to the recent advances in materials
characterization, and to reach broader audiences ranging from university
educators to industry technicians.
