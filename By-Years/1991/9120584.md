This project supports a cultural anthropologist with extensive experience in
Africa and in the Philippines studying the home- town linkages of urban workers
in Yoruba society, Nigeria. In contemporary third-world societies, many people
are highly mobile but maintain ties with their home base. This project studies
how hometown links are operationalized in the context of the 1980's economic
crisis. Using ethnographic and survey methods, the project will examine
individual, family, and organizational links to the hometown, analyzing gender
and socioeconomic differences in the reliance on these ties. Information from
Africa will be compared with the investigator's similar case study from the
Philippines. This study is important because it will provide a corrective to the
simplistic view of third world migration as "push" from opportunity-poor rural
areas and "pull" from opportunity-rich urban sites. The reality is that urban
migrants maintain important ties with their place of origin. The knowledge from
this case study will be useful to those concerned with urban problems in the
third world, as it will illuminate the reasons and values behind rural-urban
population movements.
