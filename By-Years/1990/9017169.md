Redoubt Volcano, Alaska has been in a state of eruption since December 1984.
This exploratory research project is for deployment of a portable observatory to
obtain badly needed ground-truth information. A unique research opportunity
exists at present at Redoubt Volcano to learn much about eruptive processes,
glacier-volcano interaction and interpretation of seismicity at an active
andesitic volcano. Most of the needed equipment (Seismographs, TV cameras and
radios) have already been purchased by AVO and W.M. Keck Foundation funds.
Separate funding is available for additional equipment, publication charges etc.
The building would be located on ice on a 4000' high ridge 14 km north of the
volcano. It has a double roof for protection against possible pumice bombs and
researches would dig a bomb shelter in the ice for the unlikely event of a very
strong explosion. The seismicity is so high at present that even in a short,
e.g., 10 day, observation window, one could learn a lot about the physical
processes that cause the great variety of ground vibrations. The budget is for 1
month of P.I. time, helicopter deployment of the hut and basic video and
photographic equipment. Additional costs for the experiment will be covered by
AVO as matching funds for this NSF Grant.
