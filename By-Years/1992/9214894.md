Infinite Horizon Optimization is the study of infinite stage stochastic and
deterministic mathematical programs. This subsumes a rich and important class of
applications including production and inventory control, equipment replacement,
optimal search and capacity expansion. Within the framework of an infinite
dimensional linear space, this project will: (1) employ best approximations from
finite horizon optimal solutions to force convergence to an infinite horizon
optimum, and (2) construct a theory of duality for the doubly infinite case to
establish necessary and sufficient conditions for infinite horizon optimality
and finite horizon optimal convergence.
