This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project proposes to develop
innovative technical solutions and products that reduce coal mine gas explosion.
Methane explosion is the major cause of mining casualty and economic loss. The
list of world coal mine explosion is a long and shocking one. Even today, 300
years after human?s initial mining of coal, methane explosion still kills
thousands of miners each year worldwide. Developed naturally within coal seams,
methane is known for explosion hazard and chemical neutrality, which makes it
highly dangerous but difficult to remove. Although modern technologies have been
developed to pre-release methane or to dilute it by ventilation, it is
practically impossible to eliminate the threat due to frequently occurred gas
bursts and accumulation. Due to economic concern, mine owners and managers
hesitate to take prompt action in response to each gas alarm. Sometime, their
hesitation proved to be deadly. Torrey Hills invented a technology that can
effectively capture methane from ambient atmosphere and convert it to safe
chemicals, and thus can reduce explosion risk and operation shutdown loss to
coal mine owners. The main features of the technology are room-temperature and
room-pressure operation, complementary to ventilation, attendance free, and
portable.

The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes not only
addition of economic value to coal mine owners and operators, but also
contribution to the overall society wealth in a broader sense by reducing life
loss and improving environmental protection. The world coal market is estimated
to be $400-600 billion per year. According to World Coal Association, the direct
economic loss caused by coal methane explosion is over $10 billion worldwide
each year. Nevertheless, the broader indirect costs are difficult to measure,
including loss of life, hardship on the affected families, disruption to the
local business, legal burden on the companies, and associated costs to
governments and the society.
