Abstract Gong/Li

Simple C*-algebras are basic building blocks in the theory of C*-algebras. The
principal investigators, Guihua Gong and Liangqing Li, propose to continue their
research on the classification of simple, separable, amenable C*-algebras. They
also plan to apply the classification results and the techniques developed in
the classification project to study group actions on C*-algebras and
differential topology (e.g. the Novikov conjecture on the homotopy invariance of
higher signature).

The passage from a finite to an infinite number of degrees of freedom in quantum
physics led to the mathematical theory of certain infinite dimensional algebras,
called C*-algebras. A C*-algebra is an algebraic system, similar to that of
numbers, with its operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and
division. But unlike the multiplication for numbers, the multiplication in a
C*-algebra is not commutative ---- that is, in general, X times Y is not as same
as Y times X. This important feature corresponds to Heisenberg uncertainty
principle in Quantum Mechanics. The simple C*-algebras are those that cannot be
broken into smaller pieces, and in some sense all C*-algebras are built out of
them. The investigators propose to work on a complete enumeration (or
classification) of simple amenable C*-algebras. They expect that progress on the
proposed research will result in important contributions to several mathematical
fields including operator algebras, differential topology, and also to the
understanding of the infinite dimensional world of quantum physics.
