This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to determine the
feasibility of a novel turbine, forced convection reactor for high rate
synthesis of diamond by chemical vapor deposition. The low growth rate of
diamond by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is the largest factor hindering the
commercialization of CVD diamond products. Based on experimental and computer
simulated results from a rotating substrate hot-filament assisted CVD reactor
and an oxy-acetylene torch reactor, the rate of diamond growth is limited by the
rate of mass transport of growth species to the diamond surface. Phase I work is
aimed at demonstrating the feasibility of high rate diamond growth by increased
mass transfer rates in a turbine, forced convection CVD reactor. The scope of
this work includes: 1) designing and building a turbine, forced convection CVD
reactor, and 2) performing experiments to demonstrate an order of magnitude
increase in diamond growth rates. Increased mass transport, i.e., forced
convection, will be achieved by using a turbine to pump process gas from the
activation zone, i.e., the filament, to the substrate. Experiments will
concentrate on both standard and non-standard conditions known by the proposer
to grow good quality diamond. Computer modeling of the fluid mechanics and mass
transport rates will support the experimental program. The proposed work will be
performed by one full-time engineer at North Coast Crystals, Inc. and one
subcontract by Case Western Reserve University to perform the computer modeling.
