The objective of this research is to enhance the quantum efficiencies (IQE) of
GaN based light emitting diodes (LEDs) to be used for solid state lighting
closer to 100%. The approach is to reduce harmful defects in device layers and
enhance photon generation and create better Ohmic contacts to enhance photon
extraction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The proposed research addresses four critical
scientific issues in enhancing IQE (LEDs). These critical thrusts include: (1)
thin film epitaxy across the misfit scale on nonpolar (r-plane) sapphire; (2)
management of stresses and charge through control of defects and interfaces; (3)
nanostructured thickness variation or quantum confinement of active carriers,
and (4) formation of low-resistivity transparent Ohmic contacts. The GaN layers
on sapphire have planar misfit ranging from 1.19 to 16.08%, therefore, epitaxial
layers will be grown by domain matching epitaxy where integral multiples of
planes match across the film-substrate interface. The misfit strain can be
relaxed within two monolayers and the misfit dislocations confined within this
layer to reduce the density of threading dislocations. Low-resistivity contacts
will be created using novel Ga- and Al-doped ZnO with NiO or MoOx interlayer
which increases the work function to reduce Schottky barrier.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;There is a tremendous societal benefit from this project as the
solid-state lighting (SSL) offers an entirely new lighting paradigm, compared to
existing incandescent lighting. The SSL efficiency can approach 400 lm/W,
compared to ~ 17 lm/W for incandescent bulb and ~ 50 lm/W for fluorescent bulb
with power consumption in SSL an order of magnitude lower than incandescent
lighting and life expectancy of over forty years. The proposed research has a
strong educational component in terms of teaching and training of graduate
students. &lt;br/&gt;
