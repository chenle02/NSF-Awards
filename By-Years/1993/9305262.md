Major mountain systems are in part the result of large infusions of magma bought
on by the interaction of plates at subduction zones. A classic problem in
geology has been the "room problem", namely how are large volumes (thousands of
cubic miles) of magma physically accommodated in the earth's crust, i.e., how is
the requisit space created. The investigators have recently proposed a
mechanical model that explains how space for magmas can be created via P-
fractures. This project will test this hypothesis by gathering field data and by
conducting computer experiments. This project also has the potential of
providing insights into the structural controls on ore deposits that may lead
ultimately to improved strategies for exploration.
