This award provides core funding for the Committee on Geological and
Geotechnical Engineering (COGGE), a standing committee under the National
Research Council's Board on Earth Sciences and Resources. COGGE is the focal
point within the Board on Earth Sciences and Resources for scientific,
technical, and public-policy issues pertaining to the engineering applications
of Earth Sciences. The committee's scope encompasses Earth processes and
materials, including the mechanics of rock and soil, and focuses on safe and
responsible human development, risk assessment, and mitigation of natural
anthropogenic hazards. The committee organizes and oversees studies: 1) to
identify, investigate, and report on questions relating to geological and
geotechnical engineering to government, industry, academia, and the public; 2)
to provide scientific and technical information to inform public policy on
geological and geotechnical engineering issues; 3) to identify new technologies
and potential applications; and, 4) to promote the acquisition and dissemination
of knowledge. In addition, the committee provides a forum for discussion among
academic and professional groups, government agencies, and private industry to
enhance national and international cooperation and exchange of information.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The committee activity spans all areas of geological and
geotechnical engineering, will identify new areas of needed research, and will
provide increased understanding of the importance of geotechnology in addressing
societal needs. The COGGE's mission is driven by the need to promote the
responsibility of the geoengineer throughout the lifecycle of geoengineered
facilities and structures; from site selection and facility design, to
construction, operation, maintenance, and decommissioning. Issues include the
geoengineering concerns associated with natural and built environments,
radioactive and hazardous waste isolation and remediation, mitigation of natural
hazards (e.g. earthquakes, landslides, rising sea levels), environmentally sound
and safe recovery of natural resources, and interest in defense structures in
rock. Projects undertaken, whether mandated by Congress, requested by federal
agencies, or self-initiated, will be conducted by ad hoc committees under COGGE.
Projects, governed by NRC guidelines, will result in peer-reviewed reports, and
will provide geoengineering advice for decision makers.
