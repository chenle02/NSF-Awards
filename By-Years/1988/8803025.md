This award supports a cooperative research project on high-temperature
superconductors to be conducted by Prof. Herman Fink of the University of
California at Davis and two researchers at the Atomic Center in Bariloche,
Argentina: Dr. Arturo Lopez-Davalos, Solid State Theory Group, and Dr. Francisco
De La Cruz of the Low Temperature Laboratory. They will investigate the
properties of high-temperature superconductors and the magnetic and critical
current properties of superconducting micronetworks. On the theoretical side,
they will study the effect of the inclusion of a small coherence length
(coherent electron pairs are the basis for superconductivity) in the fundamental
Ginzburg-Landau equations. Such theoretical interpretation is urgently needed in
view of the explosion in experimental results produced world-wide since the
discovery of nitrogen-temperature superconductivity. In addition, they will
study the magnetic properties and the critical currents (the most severe
limitation of these materials is low critical current) of ladder networks and
square lattice arrays. The work on superconductivity at Bariloche is of high
quality and the collaboration with Prof. Fink will strengthen that effort. The
Argentinian group brings vast experience in the properties of superconductors
and has made many contributions to the literature in this field. Previous
collaborative work has been highly productive.
