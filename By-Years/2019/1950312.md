This project aims to serve the national need of preparing high-quality STEM
teachers. The major goal of the project is to recruit and prepare undergraduate
STEM students for teaching careers in biology, chemistry, and mathematics. The
project includes a paid internship with a community organization to spark
student interest in teaching. The project will provide scholarships and
additional supports to help the Scholars earn bachelorsâ€™ STEM degrees and learn
how to be highly effective STEM teachers. For example, the Scholars will be able
to earn a micro-credential in maker education. This experience will help the
Scholars develop strategies to succeed as teachers in high-need schools. The
project will provide ongoing support from community partners and mentor teachers
to help the new teachers persist in the teaching profession.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is led by Saint Edward's University, a
Hispanic-serving institution, and includes partnerships with Del Valle
Independent School District, UTeach Maker, Co.Lab Community Makers, and
Breakthrough Central Texas. The project seeks to support and prepare 18
undergraduates minoring in teacher education and majoring in biology, chemistry,
or mathematics, to achieve certification and become highly qualified middle and
high school STEM teachers. The long-term goal is to develop a self-sustaining
pool of STEM teacher candidates who gain skills in maker education to increase
their effectiveness as teachers. A teacher circle approach to induction support
seeks to create a learning community of makers, educators, and alumni of the
Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program. Research activities aim to understand
the role of experience with maker education on teacher professional growth and
to document the impact of community partners on STEM teacher recruitment and
identity development. This Track 1: Scholarships and Stipends project is
supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The
Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to
become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 STEM
teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also
supports research on the persistence, retention, and effectiveness of K-12 STEM
teachers in high-need school districts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
