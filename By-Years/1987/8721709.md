Piecewise quadratic programming is an important model in optimization. This
model has many potential applications in theory and practice including dual
quadratic programming, stochastic quadratic programming with simple resource,
and parametric quadratic programming. Recently the author has started a
systematic study on this topic and has implemented a direct algorithm for
linearly constrained convex separable piecewise quadratic programming (PQP).
This research will continue the investigation on PQP in the following areas:
direct and indirect algorithms, both exact and approximate; network related PQP
problems; PQP as an approximation to general nonlinear separable programming
with linear constraints; and applications of PQP in parallel computation. The PI
has developed expertise through his doctoral research that qualifies him well
for the project. Northwestern provides an excellent environment for this type of
research. An award is highly recommended.
