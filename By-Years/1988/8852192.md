Gas Chromatography is being integrated across the curriculum with the concepts,
practice and specialized uses of modern separations technology being employed.
Significant improvement in the laboratory component of the curriculum is
resulting with the introduction of both general purpose and research grade GC
instruments. Three general purpose GC instruments have been purchased in order
to introduce chromatography concepts to General Chemistry students. They are
being used as an integral part of sample analysis in the Organic Chemistry
laboratory and as a quantitative analysis tool for the Analytical Chemistry
laboratory. A research grade capillary GC coupled with a chromatography
workstation and a purge and trap analyzer has been purchased for use in the
Advanced Analytical and Organic, Physical, Inorganic, and Individual Research
courses. Efficient GC separations, computer collection and manipulation of data,
and the ability to study a wide variety of samples utilizing purge and trap
techniques is allowing new, relevant laboratory experiences to be offered to
chemistry majors, and is enhancing student research capabilities. The grantee is
matching the award from non-Federal sources.
