The project will study the theoretical underpinnings of deep learning, a widely
successful approach to various data-extensive applications. A comprehensive
understanding of deep learning is crucial for the development of principled
design and training of deep learning models, ultimately reducing computational
burden and human costs. The research will span three foundational and
complementary directions: understanding well-trained deep neural networks,
examining deep learning training dynamics, and exploring data processing in
interior layers of deep learning models. By bridging the gap between the complex
training paradigms of modern neural networks and existing theories, the project
will demystify these black-box models, making them more interpretable and
efficient for a wide range of scientific and engineering applications. The
project will offer multiple interdisciplinary opportunities for boosting the
professional development of the next generation of statisticians and data
scientists. The research activities will focus on three research projects to
develop a comprehensive understanding of deep learning from a statistical and
mathematical perspective. The first project will analyze symmetric geometries in
the final stages of deep learning training, developing novel optimization
techniques and statistical insights. The second project will provide a detailed
understanding of the dynamics of modern deep learning training, integrating
statistical and inferential ideas into the active field of deep learning
dynamics. The third project will investigate how deep learning separates data
according to class membership across all layers of the neural network, using
techniques from random matrix theory, non-convex optimization, and learning
theory. The successful completion of these research projects will result in a
geometrization of deep learning methodologies.
