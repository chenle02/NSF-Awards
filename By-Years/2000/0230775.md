This SGER proposal is an outgrowth of collaboration between Horn Point
Laboratory,&lt;br/&gt;University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science
and the University of Trieste and&lt;br/&gt;the Laboratory for Marine Biology,
Trieste, Italy. It is to support the participation of&lt;br/&gt;DK Stoecker and
a graduate student in an Italian expedition to the Ross Sea during
the&lt;br/&gt;austral summer 2002-2003. Techniques which have been recently
developed to investigate&lt;br/&gt;the autecology and population dynamics of
temperate, coastal bloom-forming algae will be&lt;br/&gt;applied to polar
protists from the Ross Sea. This collaboration presents a
tremendous&lt;br/&gt;opportunity to compare the role of microzooplankton grazing
in bloom dynamics in temperate&lt;br/&gt;and polar systems, determine if polar
microplankton have ectocellular protease activity&lt;br/&gt;and to obtain
samples of the photosynthetic ciliate, Mesodinium rubrum and its
crytophyte&lt;br/&gt;algal "prey" from the Ross Sea for molecular analysis.
Futhermore, the cruise would&lt;br/&gt;contribute to the education of a graduate
student in polar science and provide material&lt;br/&gt;for his dissertation. It
would also contribute to continued collaboration between UMCES&lt;br/&gt;and the
Marine Biological Laboratory in Trieste, Italy.
