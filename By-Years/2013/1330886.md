This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to
develop a prototype foodborne pathogen analyzer that will employ a novel credit
card sized sampling device to extract, detect, identify, and quantify the
presence of specific pathogens in food matrices in 1 - 2 hours at the required
sensitivity (10 - 100 cfu/g). The goal is to extend the successful Phase I
measurements of 104 cfu/g Salmonella typhimurium in spinach within 2 hours to
10-100 cfu/g S. typhimurium on equipment and in cheese, Listeria monocytogenes
in cantaloupe, Escherichia coli O157:H7 in ground beef, and Campylobacter jejuni
in poultry. Foodborne diseases affect as many as 50 million people in the United
States each year, resulting in 130,000 hospitalizations and over 3,000 deaths.
Unfortunately, current methods used to detect these pathogens rely on lengthy
growth enrichment steps that take 1 - 4 days, negating effective prevention of
contaminated food distribution and consumption. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
broader impact/commercial potential of this project, if successful, will be the
development of a platform technology to detect pathogens on food handling
equipment or in food in 1 - 2 hours. This will benefit the food industry by
increasing productivity, minimizing withdrawals and recalls, and most
importantly, minimizing illness outbreaks and potentially saving lives. The
small footprint of the analyzer will allow measurements in process plants and
supporting labs, and eventually, at food sources, ports, and inspection
stations. It can also speed the process of identifying the source of an
outbreak, helping minimize illnesses and deaths. The knowledge gained by
developing the proposed sampling system will allow developing similar systems
that can monitor pathogens in water supplies, detect bioagents in air, and
infectious pathogens in hospital patients (e.g. detection of Staphylococcus
aureus, human immunodeficiency virus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis).
