The objective of this research is to push the limits of electronics to THz
frequencies and to increase society?s awareness to the new possibilities offered
by the combination of electronics and nanotechnology. The approach is based on
demonstrating the superior performance of nitride nanowire transistors and on
identifying the best methods for circuit-level integration of these new devices.
This research will enable the basic building blocks required for the development
of ultra-broadband wireless communication, advanced imaging and radar,
electronic THz spectroscopy and THz digital computation.

The intellectual merit of the proposed program lies in maximally leveraging the
flexibility and unique properties of nitride semiconductors, with advanced
processing technologies and high frequency analysis and modeling. Through this
interdisciplinary approach, which combines electrical engineering, materials
science and semiconductor physics, this project will demonstrate new
breakthroughs that will push the limits of high frequency electronic performance
beyond the THz barrier.

The broader impact of this work is to increase society's awareness of some of
the most exciting new challenges in electrical engineering. This effort will be
highly integrated with the proposed research through numerous outreach
activities, including student education (with special emphasis on
underrepresented students), development of teaching modules for K-12 education
in collaboration with high school teachers, dissemination of research results
through the internet and virtual labs, and collaboration with the electronics
industry to transfer the proposed research to commercial applications.
