Title: The Method of Alternating Projections

The method of alternating projections (MAP) is an iterative procedure for
determining nearest points from a set that is the intersection of a finite
number of closed convex sets. This method has found use in at least 15 different
areas of mathematics, which includes solving linear equations and inequalities,
signal analysis, and computed tomography. The main practical drawback of the
MAP, at least for some applications, is its slow convergence. We will study
rates of convergence for the MAP by extending the notion of ``angle'' between
subspaces to that of more general convex sets, as well as determine means for
accelerating the convergence of the MAP. In addition, we expect to show that the
speed of convergence of the MAP is directly related to a property (the ``strong
conical hull intersection'' property) of the convex sets in question that we
have studied in several papers over the last 20 years.

The method of alternating projections is an algorithm for computing nearest
points in certain sets by a repetitive application of the same few simple steps.
Since the method has applications to so many different areas of mathematics (one
of the earliest being in medical imaging via X-rays), it is important to know
how fast (i.e., how many steps) this algorithm needs to take before the results
give good accuracy of the exact solution. The ``rate of convergence'' of the
algorithm deals with the question of how fast the algorithm is for any given
problem. For those problems when the rate of convergence is slow, we will also
study ways to make the algorithm work faster by making appropriate modifications
of certain steps in the algorithm.
