This project will develop and publish probability modeling software along with
supplementary curriculum materials for middle school. The project will draw on
the research and personnel of several current and recently completed projects
that have been researching how students reason and learn about probability
through a modeling approach. The computer models developed would expand the
possibilities for student learning about stochastic processes.

Three major products will result from this project: (i) commercially developed
probability simulation software; (ii) published replacement units for
traditional texts, using computer simulation to teach probability; and (iii) a
data bank of assessment items for researchers and classroom teachers, to
evaluate the development of the big ideas in probability. Development of the
materials will proceed using 'backward design'.

The actual programming will be done under a subcontract to an experienced
technology firm. The developers have assembled a team of experts in mathematical
probability, mathematics education, learning theory and software design. They
will do pilot and field tests in two school districts serving diverse
populations, and have a good plan for using the feedback from these experiences.
A formative evaluation will scrutinize the development process, while an
independent summative evaluation will investigate the results of implementations
in the field test sites with respect to student achievement. Commercial
publishers have already expressed interest in the project.
