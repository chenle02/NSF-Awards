Bunimovich will study mechanisms of space-time chaos and elucidate some
convenient and widely used but vague notions of coherent structures, patterns
and intermittency. To do this, he will study the behavior of some classes of
coupled map lattices that demonstrate most purely these types of motion. He will
consider also the related problem of transport in extended systems by
investigating the thermodynamic limit of the first examples of systems of
arbitrary number of interacting particles recently proven to be ergodic. This
project involves research in ergodic theory. Ergodic theory in general concerns
understanding the average behavior of systems whose dynamics is too complicated
or chaotic to be followed in microscopic detail. Under the heading "dynamics can
be placed the modern theory of how groups of abstract transformations act on
smooth spaces. In this way, ergodic theory makes contact with geometry in its
quest to classify flows on homogeneous spaces.
