The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II
project is to enable a new manufacturing paradigm that can enable long-term
autonomy of manufacturing via a proposed swarm 3D printing and assembly (SPA)
platform, a method to coordinate robotic assembly. The first envisioned
application is the architectural precast construction industry, which suffers
from a shortage of skilled labor, long turnover time, and high cost of equipment
and operation for making precast molds. This technology will further enable
novel cooperative and autonomous manufacturing modalities.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II
project realizes the cooperation of multiple independent 3D printing and
assembly robots. The technical objectives are to improve the current platform,
with technical focus areas of: improving the printing speed of individual 3D
printers, fully automating material refill and build plate placement, developing
planning and scheduling algorithms to support large-scale SPA for multi-job
printing, and creating a new calibration method to improve printing
quality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
