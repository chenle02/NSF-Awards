Eukaryotic genes often have regions of DNA which do not encode protein sequence.
These regions, called introns, are transcribed into RNA but are spliced out
before the mature messenger RNA is translated into protein. Dr. Brian D. Keith,
a Postdoctoral Fellow in Plant Biology, plans to study this process in
Arabidopsis Thaliana in the laboratory of Dr. Gerald Fink at the Whitehead
Institute. Because the inability to correctly splice a messenger RNA for an
essential protein would be lethal, he will first make temperature sensitive
mutants, mutants which can correctly splice the mRNA at one temperature and not
at another, and then look for splicing mutants. This work should contribute to
our understanding of a fundamental mechanism in plants about which little is
known.
