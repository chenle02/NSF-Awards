The aim of the proposal is to isolate and characterize the inhibitor(s) of tuna
skeletal adenylate kinase (AK) found in mammalian normal sera. Sera from cat,
goat, guinea pig, and human have been tested and each is able to inhibit tuna
skeletal muscle AK. AK from skeletal muscle of terrestial mammals is not
inhibited. Isolation of the inhibitor will permit characterization of its
interaction with AKs. This information will permit further research on possible
endogenous regulators which may suggest approaches to design of AK inhibitors.
Future research will involve conformation and binding studies on purified tuna
AK and isolated serum inhibitor. The potential role of this inhibitor as an
endogenous AK regulator will be assessed.
