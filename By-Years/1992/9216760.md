Scientists, engineers and technical managers often work in teams. The ability to
work as part of a team contributes importantly to organizational productivity.
Yet despite a strong tradition of theory and research on groups, little is known
about the acquisition of teamwork skills, especially in technical domains. This
research investigates how technical students and professionals learn teamwork in
software development. A theoretical framework for examining individual and group
change in coordination behavior and teamwork skills is developed. Then, studies
of the development of teamwork skills in student software development teams are
conducted. The research examines the effect of students' experience on changes
in team structure and communication, and of how patterns of team coordination
are associated with team performance and with individual performance and
cognitive learning. The analysis is then extended to actual organizations with
studies of changes in patterns of coordination and learning in software
development teams in two organizations. Two field studies are conducted: (1) a
cross-sectional study of how coordination patterns in teams are associated with
cognitions and attitudes about teamwork, and (2) a longitudinal study of
socialization for teamwork, examining the influence of experienced group members
on changes in the coordination behaviors, cognitions, and attitudes of novices.
