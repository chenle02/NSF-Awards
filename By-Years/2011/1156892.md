This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) at the National Science
Foundation supports the renewal of a Research Experiences for Undergraduates
(REU) Site at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU). The VCU REU program
encompasses a practices and a perspectives component. The program provides a
valuable research experience (practices) for students predominantly from non-
PhD-granting schools whose research opportunities are limited. It also develops
student perspectives on scientific careers and career planning beginning with a
training period that teaches skills common to all scientific research. Students
quickly move to research labs to carry out their assigned research project.
Development of the perspectives component continues with a visit to a local
pharmaceutical facility (Pfizer), where the students participate in mock
interviews and a panel discussion with a variety of scientists. Each student's
oral and written communication skills are developed by: (1) writing a proposal;
(2) revising their personal statement; (3) presenting a research poster at the
halfway point; and (4) giving a final oral presentation and submitting a final
written research report. The program's intellectual merit is defined by student
participants conducting fundamental research. In this context, they gain
perspectives on career decisions, specific technical expertise that gives them
an advantage on their applications for jobs or graduate school, and the get see
real life applications of a degree in chemistry or a related technical
discipline. The broader impact of this REU program stems from its focus on
recruiting students from universities where undergraduate research opportunities
are not generally available. Women and minority participants are targeted
specifically. This program provides research experiences to heighten students'
interest in chemistry and to motivate them to remain in science.
