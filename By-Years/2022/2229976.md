The interplay between AI and cybersecurity introduces new opportunities and
challenges in the cybersecurity of AI as well as AI for cybersecurity. However,
operations and configurations of AI cyberinfrastructure with a security mindset
are rarely covered in the typical curriculum. To fill this gap, this project
intends to develop hands-on training materials and provide mentored training for
trainees in engineering and science-related disciplines. By transforming and
integrating training materials into the curriculum, this project benefits the
potential cyberinfrastructure professionals in the community at large. This
project has the potential to develop the research workforce in operating AI
cyberinfrastructure with a security mindset to meet national and economic
priorities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This projectâ€™s goal is broadening adoption of
advanced cyberinfrastructure. This project develops a holistic technical
approach for cybertraining: to identify, apply, and evaluate AI techniques which
are inextricably related to well-defined operational cybersecurity challenges.
The project intends to develop a Docker-based training platform that simulates
and pre-configures a variety of scenarios to support hands-on AI
cyberinfrastructure operations in the context of cybersecurity. Three levels of
projects (exploratory, core, and advanced) are designed and integrated into the
platform to help researchers and educators customize and develop for different
education and training environments. The project broadens the access and
adoption of advanced AI cyberinfrastructure while integrating
cyberinfrastructure skills with the security mindset to foster inter-
disciplinary and inter-institutional research collaborations. In addition to
dissemination through publications and social media, the outcomes from this
project have the potential to benefit the greater cyberinfrastructure community
and beyond. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is jointly funded by OAC and the
CyberCorps program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
