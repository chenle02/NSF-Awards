9616950 Huang In this project, the PI will examine the dynamic role of non-
uniform diapycnal mixing in the oceanic circulation, using both theoretical and
numerical approaches. Principal focus will be on the dynamic role of double
diffusive processes in the maintenance of the thermohaline circulation under
natural boundary conditions, and the dynamic consequence of bottom-intensified
mixing on the thermohaline overturning.
