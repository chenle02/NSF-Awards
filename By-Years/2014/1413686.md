The main goal of this 3-year project is to investigate the thermal and magnetic
structure of sunspots by using simultaneous high-resolution observations of
magnetic field and mass motion at different heights in the solar atmosphere. The
project will shed more light on four major science topics, namely: (i) three
dimensional magnetic structure of sunspots; (ii) three dimensional thermal
structure of sunspot; (iii) effect of magnetic field on spectral line profiles;
and, (iv) magnetic and velocity structure near solar flare locations. The first
three topics also have broader implications to stellar astrophysics.

The broader impact of this project includes observations of the Sun that have
application to space weather, stellar astrophysics, and training of both
undergraduate and graduate students to becoming the next generation of solar
physicists. In particular, this 3-year project will: (i) enable better
understanding of the magnetic field structure of Sun-like stars and their
chromospheric activity; (ii) provide improved understanding of the magnetic
field, mass motion, and thermal structure of active region chromospheres to help
identify unstable magnetic configurations that may impact space weather; (iii)
help identify specific science problems for which the higher spatial resolution
of the future DKIST will be crucial; and, (iv) contribute to educating
undergraduate and graduate students in observational solar physics. The project
will involve undergraduate students from the California State University at
Northridge, which is designated as a Hispanic Serving Institution, as well as an
Asian American Native American Pacific Islander Serving Institution. The
research and EPO agenda of this project supports the Strategic Goals of the AGS
Division in discovery, learning, diversity, and interdisciplinary research.
