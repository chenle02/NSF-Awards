They will apply column fractionation to magnetic colloids to produce multi-gram
quantities of ferrite `nanoparticles' of well defined crystallinity, morphology,
defect content and norrow size distribution and perform polarized neutron
diffraction experiments to detect, locate and charaterize magnetically anomalous
regions within the particles. In addition, polarized neutron reflectometry will
be used to examine the magnetization depth profile of ferrite films. Particulate
ordering in these colloids will also be investigated.
