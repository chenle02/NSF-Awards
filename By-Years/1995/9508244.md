This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
will assist the Department of Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin at
Madison with the purchase of a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer.
This new instrumentation will enhance greatly research in a number of areas
including the following: physical chemistry, polymer dynamics, catalysis, and
biophysical chemistry. A nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer is used
to obtain information about molecular structure (what types of carbon and/or
hydrogen atoms and/or hetero-atoms are present, what are the relative number of
each type of atoms and how are they connected to one another in the molecule)
and molecular dynamics (how rapidly are the various parts of the molecule
moving). This instrument is essential for any meaningful, modern synthetic
chemistry research program.
