The embryo sources of hailstones and the processes responsible for subsequent
growth are not well understood. A field experiment, the North Dakota
Thunderstorm Project, is scheduled for the summer of 1989 during which research
aircraft and Doppler radar systems will be used to collect data on
thunderstorms, particularly those producing hail. Professor Smith will analyze
date collected from the T-28 research aircraft and the dual Doppler radars. He
hopes to better understand the dynamics of hail storms and improve the
conceptual models of seeding for hail suppression. //
