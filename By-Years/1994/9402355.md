9402355 Reichert The research proposed in this application addresses engineering
and materials aspects of assembling integrated optical waveguide immunosensors.
As presented, immunochemistry, coupled with novel optical detection phenomena,
is a powerful approach to in situ biosensing problems. This work develops thin
film integrated optical waveguide fluoroimmunosensors with: (1) increased
sensitivity to ultra-low analyte concentrations, and (2) the ability to perform
multi-analyte detection on a single chip device that can be mass produced
inexpensively in large quantities. The novel aspect of the work is not the
production of multichannel waveguide, grating coupled waveguides or thin film
waveguide immunosensors. The innovation is combining these three technologies to
produce a multichannel, grating coupled, thin film immunosensor, and making them
with optical properties in a manner that is fully process oriented. ***
