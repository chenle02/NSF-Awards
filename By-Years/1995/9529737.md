9529737 Hey This project will collect high-resolution deep-towed sidescan and
bathymetric data to map the detailed pattern of faults, fissures, and recent
volcanic eruptive sites along a section of the East Pacific Rise at 30 degrees
south. CTD/nephelometer mounted on the vehicle will provide precise hydrothermal
plume distributions, and tow-yo surveys will determine two-dimensional anomalies
of temperature, particle concentration and the dissolved fraction of certain
chemical species. The objective of this project is to understand the structural
controls on hydrothermal venting at superfast spreading rates, the temporal
controls on venting, and the relative importance of hydrothermal venting and
deep ocean currents in forming far-field plumes.
