This project is on the nature of tropical interannual variability. Since the
Southern Oscillation-El Nino (ENSO) is the most prominent mode of interannual
variability, it will be the focus of much of the analysis. The effort includes
both observational studies and diagnostic studies of General Circulation Model
(GCM) experiments. The observational study will span the global tropical belt,
while the modeling work will be limited to the tropical Indian and Pacific
oceans, and will exploit a new suite of ocean analyses being generated by the
experimental GCM operations at the National Meteorological Center. The two
specific research thrusts are : (i) the relationship between tropical quasi-
biennial variability (QBO) and the ENSO phenomenon, and (ii) the r ole of the
Indian Ocean sea surface temperature variability in the ENSO phenomenon. This
work is important because it will enhance our understanding of the interannual
climate variability in the tropics and may lead to improvements in dynamics
extended range prediction for tropics.
