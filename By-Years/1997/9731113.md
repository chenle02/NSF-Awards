AST-9731113 Abstract A new type of chopping secondary mirror will be built for
the 6.5 meter upgraded Multiple-Mirror Telescope (MMT). Only a thin glass
membrane will be "chopped" instead of a large, rigid, secondary mirror. The
membrane figure is maintained by servo control against a highly stable backup
structure.
