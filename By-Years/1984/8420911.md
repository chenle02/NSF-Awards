This research covers the testing and calibrating of Fourier Transform Infrared
measurement techniques developed by using combustion devices of increasing size
and flame complexity. The program is divided into three tasks: calibration--
measurements are made of species emittances (ash, char, soot, and coal), and
measurements of temperature, size, and concentration are performed under
monitored conditions using well-characterized feedstocks; application of
laboratory-sized burners--measurements are made to map the flame, including
analysis by tomography to obtain spatially-resolved data from the line-of-sight
measurements; automated procedures are implemented for data analysis; and
application to pilot scale furnace--this task is performed in a pilot-scale test
furnace with an optical access.
