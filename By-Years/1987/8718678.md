Environmental stress in the form of high ionic strength has been surmounted by
a number of organisms in a number of ways. In general, little is known about
electron transfer or coupled energy conservation in any of the extreme
halophiles. In preliminary studies, the investigator has found that electron
transfer mechanisms observed with proteins from nonhalophilic bacteria must be
distinct from the extreme halophiles, as electrostatics appear to play an
important role in the elctron transfer proecss. Thus, proteins operating in the
periplasmic space in moderate and extreme halophiles must control specificity by
the use of factors other than electrostatics. In addition, extreme and moderate
halophiles appear to have redox proteins which have generally lower redox
potentials, are strongly acidic, and in at least two cases have redox potentials
which are ionic strength-dependent at high ionic strengths. Thus it appears that
in the course of adaptation to a high ionic strength environment, structural
alterations at the molecular level have taken place. It should be emphasized
that halotolerant bacteria, those able to live both with and without salt, are
not obviously different from fresh-water bacteria. Three halophilic organisms
will be studied with this grant. Soluble redox proteins (c-type cytochromes and
iron-sulfur proteins) from these bacteria will be characterized in terms of
location and the effect of osmoregulators and ionic strength on redox
potentials, spectral properties, and thermal denaturation. Data will be analyzed
in terms of known structural properties and supplemented by computer modeling
utilizing 3-D structures of related proteins. Finally, some basic physiological
processes will be studied. It is anticipated that the proposed studies will
provide new insights into the molecular properties controlling biological
electron transfer, a better understanding of the physiology of halophiles, and
an increase in our knowledge of the structural and chemical parameters that
control protein stability.
