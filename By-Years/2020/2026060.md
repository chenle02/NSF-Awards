The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to identify potential therapies for a
multiple myeloma (MM) patients. Newly diagnosed MM is typically sensitive to a
variety of therapies, but relapse is common in later stages. Personalized
analysis would improve treatment decisions. This project will develop new
testing for personalized medicine. Although the initial target is MM, this can
potentially be applied to other cancers or diseases. Personalized medicine can
lead to reduced healthcare costs, optimized drug development, and improved
patient care.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research
(SBIR) Phase II project will help develop methods and techniques that will be
used to offer new tests for guiding the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM)
patients. The test relies on resolving changes of cancer cells collected from
patients upon exposure to various drug options by measuring the mass of
individual cells. Today MM is the second most common hematologic malignancy in
the world. Unfortunately, today there are no biomarkers to define therapeutic
susceptibility of MM patients to identify a personalized treatment regimen. This
project aims to address this problem by developing a high-throughput single-cell
mass measurement platform based on suspended microchannel resonators (SMR) to
resolve the effects of the drugs on the cancer cells. In this project a new
generation of SMR chips with linked single-cell imaging, image processing and
cell classification will be developed to analyze a 20-drug panel in three
hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
