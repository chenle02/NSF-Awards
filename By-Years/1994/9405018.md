9405018 This proposal concerns computer simulations of phase transitions. In
general the work focusses on lattice systems via Monte Carlo, molecular dynamics
and spin dynamics methods. The models to be investigated include transitions in
magnetic materials, cubic binary alloys, crystal growth, adsorbates and high Tc
materials. Static and dynamic critical phenomena will be of primary interest
particularly with reference to confined geometries (e.g. capillarity). %%% This
proposal considers phase transitions in condensed matter. It uses computer
simulation to elucidate mechanisms and behavior as these transitions are
approached as a function of temperature or concentration. The systems to be
studied are the high temperature superconductors, two component alloys, magnetic
materials and adsorbing gases. Also the mechanisms of crystal growth will be
investigated. How these behaviors change when the system is confined (as in a
capillary for example) is of particular interest. Such work lies at the heart of
our understanding of much materials behavior.
