Three investigators will study problems in Kaehler geometry, calibrations,
spinors, and Teichmuller theory. These involve Chern currents, slicing, spin
structures, harmonic maps between Teichmuller spaces, the Thurston boundary of
Teichmuller space, and moduli spaces of compact Riemannian surfaces.
Differential geometry is the study of the structure and shape of generalized
surfaces. These investigators will concentrate their efforts on surfaces based
on the complex numbers rather than the real numbers. A Teichmuller space is the
reduction of one of these complex generalized surfaces to a system of lower
dimensional objects which are easier to understand. These investigators will
continue their studies of such spaces in an effort to apply these new theories
to questions arising from particle physics.
