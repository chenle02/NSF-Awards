Award is for a multichannel seismic survey across the offshore portions of the
Chicxulub impact crater. The multichannel seismic survey will be added on to a
funded British tomographic survey that will be conducted in the summer of 2003
aboard the R/V Maurice Ewing. The multichannel seismic survey will map features
that cannot be constrained by the tomographic study, including the geometry of
the peak ring, and the possible thrust boundary beneath the peak ring. The
modeling effort, together with the multichannel seismic profiles will determine
the approach direction of the impactor and constrain the angle of impact to with
10 degrees. The multichannel seismic profiles together with the tomographic data
will complete the required site survey over two proposed IODP
sites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
