A fundamental advantage of distributed systems over centralized systems is
fault-tolerance: correctly functioning processors can successfully complete a
computation in the face of failures by other processors. The design and
efficiency of fault-tolerant applications increases with the severity of the
failures that may occur. Most practical fault-tolerant systems tolerate only
very simple failures (such as stopping); there has been no formal
characterization of the effects of different types of faulty behavior. The
proposed research is a formal study of different types of faulty behaviors,
comparing them in several ways. The expected results will greatly expand the
utility of existing systems, allowing them to be modified to tolerate more
severe failures. This proposal outlines two primary methods by which this
research is to advance. The first is the study of translations that
automatically convert applications designed to run in systems with benign
failures into ones that run in systems with more severe failures. The second
method used here is the study of processor knowledge. Techniques from this area
promise to lead to more thorough analysis of the effects of failures on the
computation and communication necessary to solve certain problems in systems
with failures.
