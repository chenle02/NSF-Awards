This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop the
next generation of photonic devices through innovative tunable electro-optic
(EO) photonic bandgap materials. The resulting EO photonic bandgap materials
will be useful in applications such as high-speed modulators, filters, and
switches. These devices promise to enable photonic integrated circuits and
eventually a system-on-a-chip. A one-dimensional tunable EO photonic bandgap
modulator/filter will be designed and demonstrated in Phase I. The feasibility
of an EO two-dimensional photonic bandgap structure will be studied in Phase I
and implemented in Phase II.

The commercial application of this project is in the optical communications
industry. The resulting EO materials will be useful in applications such as
high-speed modulators, filters, and switches. These devices will enable photonic
integrated circuits. The materials are expected to have the highest EO
coefficient among the known solid materials: about 100 times that of LiNbO3.
Electro-optic films are also inherently fast in response. An EO photonic bandgap
material modulator with miniature size and lower driving voltage is possible.
