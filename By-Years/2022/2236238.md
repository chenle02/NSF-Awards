Bioelectronic medicine can revolutionize how we practice medicine in offering
effective non-opioid pain management, and providing compelling alternatives to
other pharmaceuticals for conditions such as epilepsy, traumatic brain injury,
high blood pressure, rheumatoid arthritis, sleep apnea, urinary incontinence,
and treatment-resistant depression. Bioelectronic medicines are neurotechnology
devices that read and modulate the electrical activity of the bodyâ€™s nervous
system to control, regulate, or restore function. Medical care that uses these
devices to continuously monitor physiological biomarkers and autonomously
deliver therapy will significantly reduce clinician burden, improve patient
compliance, and reduce adverse drug reactions and abuse. However, current
bioelectronic medicine devices are too large to target small nerves for
effective therapy, deliver indiscriminate stimulation on large nerves resulting
in significant off-target effects, and lack the sophistication for closed-loop,
automated processing. This project will address these issues through key
innovations in circuit design, system development, and closed-loop control.
Project impact is extended through a multi-tiered education initiative to
bolster the local semiconductor and neurotechnology workforce with collaboration
from industry experts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop a
wireless, miniaturized neurotechnology interface that selectively records and
stimulates from specific fascicles within a larger nerve. The proposed work will
make advances in three areas. First, the project will develop and validate a new
stimulation technique that significantly reduces the volume of an implant and
improves its safety and reliability regardless of electrode size. Second, the
project will develop a new bi-directional wireless link that exceeds state-of-
the-art efficiencies by co-design recording, stimulation, and wireless
circuitry. Lastly, the project will use this new interface to evaluate machine
learning optimization systems in a closed-loop experiment that targets specific
nerve fascicles in the sciatic nerve of an animal
model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is jointly funded by ECCS and the
Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research
(EPSCoR).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
