Atomic absorption spectroscopy is an important method of elemental analysis that
undergraduate chemistry students should encounter at all levels of the
curriculum. We are adapting proven atomic absorption experiments that use both
flame and graphite atomization procedures and implementing them into the
laboratories for Introductory Chemistry, Environmental Chemistry, and
Instrumental and Experimental Chemistry. These experiments are taken from the
recent educational literature, have an environmental, real-world content and
thus are relevant to the experiences of our students, both majors and non-majors
alike. The instrument is also being used by undergraduates as part of a variety
of research projects. New laboratory manuals are being written to reflect the
increased emphasis on atomic absorption spectroscopy and the manuals can be
disseminated to other institutions wishing to incorporate atomic absorption
spectroscopy into their curriculum. The experiments and the success of our
students in mastering atomic absorption will be disseminated to the chemical
education community through presentations at local and national meetings,
publication in chemical education journals, and personal contacts.&lt;br/&gt;
