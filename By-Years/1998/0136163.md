0136163&lt;br/&gt;Chuenpagdee&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a workshop
proposal submitted by Dr. Ratana Chuenpagdee, College of William and Mary, and
Dr. Kungwan Juntarashote, Kasetsart University, Thailand, to organize a workshop
on "the roles of education in sustaining integrated coastal management efforts"
for May 12-16, 2002 in Bangkok, Thailand. This is an important workshop to
address the challenges of coastal zone management. This workshop will bring
together educators, students, researchers, and coastal managers from the USA and
the Asia-Pacific region to exchange examples of successful education programs on
integrated coastal zone management and to develop an education toolbox that will
be used to share information, resources and experience in sustaining integrated
coastal management processes. The meeting will include 15 U.S. participants (5
students and 10 experts and educators) and 15 Asian participants (4 students and
11 experts and educators). This proposal meets an important NSF goal of human
resource development, and addresses an important issue for sustaining the global
coastal ocean environment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
