The University of Wisconsin Oshkosh has integrated an important type of
computing called digital signal processing, or DSP into its academic programs.
The technique is used to extract information from data in fields such as
geophysics, astronomy, meteorology and medicine. Currently DSP is practiced at
UW Oshkosh in three different academic programs: physics, computer science and
geophysics. Support from the National Science Foundation, matched by UW Oshkosh
funds, will be used to purchase a graphics computer workstation, consisting of a
Digital Equipment Corporation MicroVax graphics workstation, so that students
learning DSP can practice with problems of real-world size and complexity. In
addition, data from experiments such as acoustic imaging within the earth, or
magnetic resonance data, will be analysed as part of student projects.
