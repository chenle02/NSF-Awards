This project funds travel expenses for US graduate student participation in a
Workshop on Algorithms in Communication Complexity, Property Testing, and
Combinatorics in Moscow, Russia, April 9-13, 2016; a Workshop on Proof
Complexity in St. Petersburg, Russia, May 15-20, 2016; and a Workshop on Low-
Depth Complexity in St. Petersburg, Russia, May 21-25, 2016, as part of a
special program in complexity theory at St. Petersburg during April-June 2016.
The special semester and its tutorials and workshops will promote research in
theoretical computer science and logic, areas with important applications for
computer science. All three workshops include introductory tutorial lectures.
The US graduate students will benefit from participation in the tutorial courses
and workshops, and have a valuable opportunity to interact with and learn from
an international community of researchers in complexity, and to promote their
research and education training.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proof complexity has
important connections to computational complexity, and to the highly successful
computer-based theorem proving systems. Proof complexity has made substantial
advances in the understanding the complexity of resolution theorem proving, and
better understanding of algebraic proof systems. Low-depth complexity studies
the complexity of functions that can be computed with low-depth Boolean and
arithmetic circuits. Low-depth complexity is intimately connected with research
into communication complexity, proof complexity, algorithms for NP-hard
problems, learning and cryptography. Property testing and communication
complexity deal with understanding what can be feasibly computed or approximated
when given only part of the input, or when the input is shared among multiple
parties. All these areas are of fundamental importance for a better
understanding of algorithms and proof search.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Main web
