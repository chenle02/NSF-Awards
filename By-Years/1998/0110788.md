The Seattle protests against the World Trade Organization not only received much
media attention, but also demonstrated the growing importance of public pressure
for political accountability of international economic institutions. The
importance of such pressure raises several issues about the relationships among
domestic social movements, transnational organizations, and international
institutions. Social movements face special problems of collective action in
contending against transnational opponents. They may deal with the problems by
organizing domestically against the consequences of global economic actors, by
supporting transnational umbrella groups, or by creating movement organizations
that span two or more nations. This project examines how and why domestic
activists select certain channels to become transnational actors.

In studying the "transnationalization" of social movements, the project focuses
on five sectors of transnational activism (labor, religious/human rights,
indigenous groups, global warming, and genetic foods), and three international
institutions (the United Nations, the European Union, and the World Trade
Organization). It creates a quantitative data set from the existing archive of
the Yearbook of International Organizations, and adds to the data set
information obtained on protests at international conferences, on founding and
government funding of activists groups, and on network links among domestic
movements, transnational organizations, and international institutions. Analysis
of the data set allows the investigators and others interested in transnational
movements to understand how domestic forms of contention give way to
transnational mobilization.
