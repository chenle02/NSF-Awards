The Cleveland Museum of Natural History contains over two million specimens and
related documents in their archaeology and physical anthropology collections.
These objects were gathered in a systematic fashion on many research expeditions
and as such contain a valuable resource for anthropological research. The museum
has completed several collections managment projects in the past, making the
collections safe and accessible to researchers. However, the documentation that
accompanies these collections is in need of improvement. To date, this
information has been inaccessible, damanged by continuous use, and proven time
consuming to use. With this grant, the museum will be able to computerize and
cross index its collections papers. This will produce a data base that can be
used by several researchers simultaneously and prevent serious deterioration of
the resource. The collections of the Cleveland Museums of Natural History are
used by scholars from all over the world. They are the basis for significant
anthropological and interdisciplinary research. With this improvement grant, the
collections will be even more accessible and will stimulate integrated and
comparative research.
