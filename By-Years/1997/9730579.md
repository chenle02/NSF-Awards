9730579 Brown The project will investigate two topics relating to the kinematics
of ocean surface gravity waves. For the study of wave scattering by randomly
rough topography, a diffusivity will be derived within a transport equation
framework. For the study of extreme wave events, an integral representation of
transient surface gravity wavefields will be derived, using Maslov integral
formalism.
