Thermal hysteresis producing antifreeze proteins lower the freezing point, but
not the melting point, of water by a special mechanism which makes them
extremely effective antifreezes. These antifreeze proteins (AFPs) have been
reported in many cold blooded animals (polar marine fishes, insects, spiders,
centipedes), but they have been best studied in fish where the biochemistry of
the AFPs are well understood and certain of the AFP genes have cloned and
transferred to other organisms (salmon, plants, bacteria). The AFPs from the
overwintering larvae of the beetle Dendroides canadensis are by far the most
active AFPs known. The studies outlined in this proposal will allow us to
continue our work on these interesting AFPs. Biochemical characterization of the
AFP will continue and in addition we will clone the Dendroides AFP gene. The
gene will be sequenced, providing the amino acid sequence of the protein and
allowing comparisons to the fish AFPs. Also, the function of the AFPs in the
membranes of epidermal cells located just under the cuticle of the larvae will
be investigated. These studies will further our understanding of the role of
AFPs in insect cold tolerance. Because of the high activity of this AFP the
results could have applications in cryopreservation, agriculture and frozen food
technology.
