This project supports the deployment of additional instrumentation during the
NASA-funded North Atlantic Aerosols and Marine Ecosystems Study (NAAMES). This
study is focused on characterizing the properties and annual bloom cycles of
marine plankton ecosystems, and on investigating how remote marine aerosols and
boundary layer clouds are influenced by plankton ecosystems. This research will
help determine whether it is the phytoplankton bloom state or the large
reservoir of dissolved organic carbon in the ocean that is responsible for the
organic enrichment of sea-surface aerosol. The results are important for
accurately modeling the exchange of carbon between the oceans and the atmosphere
and for understanding its influence on climate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sea
Sweep, an in-situ sea-surface aerosol (SSA) generator, will be deployed on the
first two NAAMES cruises (November of 2015 and May/June 2016) to characterize
the effects of surface seawater biological activity on the physical, chemical,
optical and cloud nucleating properties of freshly emitted SSA. The investigator
hypothesizes that the phytoplankton bloom state is not the dominant control over
the magnitude of the organic fraction in freshly emitted SSA. Instead, he
hypothesizes that the large reservoir of dissolved organic carbon in the ocean
is responsible for the organic enrichment of SSA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
NAAMES project provides an excellent immediate opportunity to measure freshly
emitted SSA and to assess the seawater parameters that affect its flux out of
the ocean, composition, and impacts on clouds and chemistry in the marine
atmosphere.
