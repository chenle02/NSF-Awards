CTS - 9613241 Arne Pearlstein University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign ABSTRACT
The project is a combined computational and experimental effort at developing a
generic field-enhanced continuous electrophoretic separation of chiral
pesticides. The process is three-dimensional, and amplifies small
electrophoretic mobility difference into large variations in azithumal
displacement in an annulus, using an axisymmetric swirl flow. Enantioselective
complexation with a chiral species provides the electrophoretic mobility
difference. Computational work will focus on the effects of diffusion, field
strength, geometry and swirl. Buoyant or electrohydrodynamic secondary flows
will also be evaluated. The electrophoresis cell will be fabricated at NIST,
where experiments will focus on the separation of herbicide enantiomers. The
project may lead to an economical alternative to chiral separation for both
commercial production and developmental testing. This will reduce the
application levels of chiral pesticides and their environmental burden.
