Professor Pincus will continue his investigation of currents associated with
the index structure of certain algebras of operators. In particular he will
study certain bundles and sheaves which are associated to the local index which
he invented as well as finer invariants. He will also study the geometric
meaning of the principal function, an extension of the index which is also
defined on the essential spectrum. Professor Pincus' research is in the general
area of the theory of operators on Hilbert space. These operators are
essentially infinite matrices of complex numbers. Such operators or linear
transformations have applications in every area of applied science as well as in
pure mathematics. This type of research is an attempt to classify certain
important categories of such objects.
