This renewal grant is for an ongoing study of correlated lattice electron
systems. The viewpoint is that of self-consistent-field approximations and
parquet theory. This allows the generalization of Hartree-Fock theory to systems
having strong correlation and large electronic fluctuations. This provides a
semi-analytical alternative (and test) for numerical techniques like exact
diagonalization or simulation. In addition to development of renormalization
group techniques for this class of theory, various issues concerned with
superconductivity and charge-density ordering in strongly correlated materials
(such as high-Tc superconductors) will be studied. %%% The electronic structure
of solids determines most, if not all, of the common properties of materials on
which present and future technology is based. However, there are large classes
of materials for which our present understanding is quite limited. One such
class is strongly correlated materials (including high-Tc superconductors), in
which the forces between electrons are very stong. This grant funds a project
intended to extend to this new class of materials a group of theoretical
techniques which allow the properties of normal systems to be understood.
