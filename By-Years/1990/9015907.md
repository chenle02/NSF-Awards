The molecular order in thin films of surfactant solutions on solid surfaces
will differ from that in bulk solutions. The unique features of the ordering may
include the self-assembly of monolayers on the bounding interfaces, the
induction of new liquid crystalline order in the film, and the ordering of
macromolecular assemblies such as micelles within the film. Such structures will
affect the stability and dynamics of these films and will control the wetting
and spreading of bulk fluid bodies attached to them. Although the subject of a
number of earlier investigations, questions remain open concerning the
arrangement of surfactant molecules in thin films on solid surfaces. Direct
measurement of this molecular ordering will clarify some of these outstanding
issues, providing new understanding of the influence of interfaces on self-
assembly and impacting on a number of technologies which involves interfacial
properties and spreading of surfactant solutions. X-ray and neutron
reflectometry are rapidly evolving techniques which can probe the molecular
arrangements in such films. Using these techniques, the nature of the molecular
monolayers on the bounding interfaces of thin films on solid surfaces and the
ordering of the surfactant molecules within the films is explored.
