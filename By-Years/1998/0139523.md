The Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Northern Arizona University will
host a summer research program for six students recruited nationwide. Minority
students and students from colleges and universities without doctoral programs
are especially encouraged to apply, and have been a major component of previous
programs. The program will run for eight weeks, with each student working on an
individual project tailored to his or her own mathematical background. Two
students will work with each faculty advisor in a subject area to include
Applied Mathematics and Analysis and Combinatorics. Descriptions of projects
available for each forthcoming summer are posted on the department's homepage at
http://odin.math.nau.edu/ REU/. As well as carrying out their research, students
participate in seminar series, each giving a fifty-minute presentation at the
end of the program. Students also write up their work in a form suitable for
publication; these will put into a single bound volume. Students are encouraged
to give talks at meetings etc. after the program has concluded, and the most
successful will submit their work to a journal for publication.
