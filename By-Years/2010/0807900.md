The awardees will carry out a research program on extended emission line regions
(EELRs) around quasars, which are thought to be the result of a superwind
emanating from the active region. Superwinds may be fundamentally important in
limiting the buildup of galaxies via a feedback loop. The primary goals of this
research are to: 1) characterize physical conditions in the brighter parts of
several EELRs; (2) measure large-scale velocity fields in the EELR gas; (3)
measure velocities in emission-line gas close to the QSO; and (4) quantify the
relative levels of star formation and nuclear activity in matched samples of
QSOs with and without luminous EELRs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts
include training of research students, undergrad exercises, and public lectures.
Also, a dedicated server will improve public access to a photoionization code.
