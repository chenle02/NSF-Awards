Beach, FL 321142817 ILI - Instrumentation Project: Life Sciences Title:
Computerizing a Human Anatomy and Physiology Laboratory The objective of this
project is to give students experience with computer equipment and to increase
their familiarity with physiology. A Human Anatomy and Physiology laboratory is
being equipped with computer-interfaced data acquisition stations to collect
data from traditional physiology experiments such as muscle contractions, nerve
action potentials and respiratory movements. Using appropriate software, data
can be stored, analyzed, manipulated and retrieved. Also, the simulation
capabilities of the computer are being used for those experiments not easily
completed in a three-hour laboratory.
