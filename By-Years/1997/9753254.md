This award of the program for Professional Opportunities for Women in Research
and Education (POWRE) supports the research and educational activities of
Professor Leah O'Brien of Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville. Research
focusses on high resolution molecular spectroscopy of gas phase radicals, with
particular emphasis on nuclear hyperfine analysis and interpretation. In
academic year 1997-98, work will be conducted at the University of British
Columbia, at the National Solar Observatory facility at Kitt Peak, and at
Southern Illinois University, in concert with undergraduate and graduate
students. The significance of the research is not only the acquisition of the
fundamental molecular constants obtained by spectral analysis, but also
interpretation of these results, particularly as they relate to chemical bonding
and reactivities. The opportunity afforded through the POWRE program will
enhance Professor O'Brien's research and leadership potential and her
educational mentoring of students at a predominantly undergraduate university.
