The PI will carry out a multifaceted suite of experiments to investigate the
physical links among local energy minimum (LEM) domain states. LEM-LEM
transitions, and thermoremanent magnetization (TRM) in magnetite,
titanomagnetite, and pyrrhotite. This work would utilize magnetic domain
observations coupled with measurements of TRMs in single particles.
