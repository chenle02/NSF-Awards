ABSTRACT Why do adolescents engage in different types of activities? Why do
some work hard on their school subjects while others get involved in other
activities, including problem behaviors? Do these activity choices related to
the educational, vocational, and family options they pursue in their early
twenties? This is a longitudinal follow-up to an existing large scale data set.
These investigators have developed a theoretical framework to investigate such
questions and have used this model to study during the ontogeny of education and
role-related choices during adolescence in a sample of 2380 youths. This project
follows this sample as they make the transition into adulthood and will assess
the utility of the framework for predicting adult role choices and look at the
long term sequelae of adolescent behavior patterns and social experiences. Two
type of data will be collected. A telephone interview will be conducted, and
data will be merged with questionnaire data collected with other support. These
data will then be used to test basic theoretical predictions.
