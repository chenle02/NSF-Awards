Little is known about how and why learning occurs in organizations, whether it
persists, and how to transfer it. The proposed research empirically investigates
the persistence of learning within organizations and the transfer of learning
across organizations. The role of turnover in learning and its persistence are
also examined. The analyses are based on data collected from one firm in the
aerospace industry producing an advanced jet and from three plants of the same
firm in the automotive industry producing a light truck. The research estimates
production functions with variables included to assess the importance of
persistence, transfer and labor turnover in affecting the efficiency of the
production process. In addition to testing whether learning persists, whether it
transfers, and whether turnover is related to the rate of learning, the research
aims to develop a theoretical model of learning in organizations that integrates
and explains the empirical findings. The research will advance scientific
knowledge about why learning occurs in organizations and whether it persists and
transfers. It should have implications for organizations to improve their
productivity and hence, compete more effectively.
