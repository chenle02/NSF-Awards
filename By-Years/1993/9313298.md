9313298 Clegg This award supports the renovation of the laboratories for the
Curriculum of Applied Science, a research and research training effort in
materials science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The
renovation in progress will modernize 7333 square feet of lab space in two
buildings, Venable Hall and Phillips Hall. The remodeled laboratories are
essential in order to house modern instrumentation and train students in the
most modern technologies necessary for materials research. The research to be
performed in the renovated spaces includes: nonlinear optical studies of
materials; materials theory; NMR in solids, and quasicrystals; polymer
synthesis; surface spectroscopy; thin film photochemistry; high dielectric
materials; ion beam modifications and characterization; and NMR semiconductors
and insulators. This renovation project will have direct impact on the research
and training environment of over 20 faculty, and well over 100 graduate,
undergraduate, and postdoctoral students. ***
