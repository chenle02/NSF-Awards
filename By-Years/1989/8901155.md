This proposal is for support to examine the diversity of the soil bacterium,
Frankia in China using biochemical and physiological characteristics of this
species. This cooperative study is proposed by Dr. Dwight Baker, Yale
University, and Professors Ruan Ji-Sheng, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese
Academy of Sciences. Frankia is an important N2-fixing bacterium. This research
can provide useful data on this group of symbiotic organisms. This project is
jointly supported by the NSF and the Academy of Sciences.
