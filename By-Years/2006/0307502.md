AST-0307502&lt;br/&gt;Begelman, Mitchell C.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not all of the
matter which comes under a black hole's influence ends up inside, because
accretion of just a small amount releases enough energy to expel a much larger
amount. These outflows carry a lot of energy and profoundly affect the black
hole's environment, as demonstrated by recent X-ray and radio observations
showing that cooling flows - gas thought to be cooling and slumping into the
centers of clusters - can be stopped completely by the outpouring
energy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will study the details of this
influence, exerted not by outbursts but through a milder process called
"effervescent heating", on the X-ray-emitting atmospheres of galaxy clusters,
and on the growth of supermassive black holes at high redshift. The
investigators will study the physical basis of effervescent heating and its
implications through analytic modeling and state-of-the-art numerical
simulations. They will research whether the tight coupling between galaxies and
the formation of their central black holes arises from feedback via the released
energy, and achieve new understanding of how the formation and evolution of
super-massive black holes is linked to the formation and evolution of galaxies
and galaxy clusters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will promote
undergraduate science education and help with the general public's understanding
of scientific research, because black holes have a widespread fascination which
makes them an excellent "hook". The PI will also maintain his contacts with
science journalists and popular magazines, continue with his own writings, and
use his research results in his generally available courses.&lt;br/&gt;
