Certain environmental signals and cues, such as background color and day length,
are capable of altering the appearance (phenotype) of the pupae of swallowtail
butterflies. The ability to respond to environmental signals is known as a
conditional strategy. This research proposal offers a means to investigate the
underlying biochemical and genetic mechanisms responsible for this conditional
strategy. The research team will use methods from chemistry, molecular and
cellular biology, mathematics, computer science and population genetics. Some of
these methods include protein isolation, DNA sequencing, immunology and
histology, computational biology and theoretical population genetics.

Conditional strategies are now regarded as an important but poorly understood
mechanism for adapting to changing environments. Such traits are especially
common in important pest species, such as insects, and may be a key factor in
the ability of insects to survive and reproduce in changing climates and
agricultural conditions. Therefore the research will provide important insights
into fundamental biological processes of potential economic importance. In
addition, the proposed research is highly interdisciplinary, and will introduce
several dozen undergraduate science majors to state-of-the-art research methods
in the context of modern biological theory.
