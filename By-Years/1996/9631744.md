9631744 Yamaguchi This proposal is a continuation of a program senior design
project program which has been successfully implemented over the past six years
at ASU. The program centers on a "bottom-up" approach to rehabilitation which
requires the participants to interact directly with their clients; this permits
the students to learn the needs of the client first-hand and to be open to
suggestions, resulting in a sense of pride and ownership in the final products
for both parties. Another philosophy conveyed to the students is the idea of
developing "culturally appropriate" solutions which can be easily maintained by
the clients and their caretakers. Fifteen senior design projects will be
solicited each year to design prototype devices to aid persons with
disabilities. A graduate student will act as a liaison to establish and maintain
continuous connection between the biomedical engineering program at ASU and
surrounding communities serving and/or supporting persons with disabilities. The
ideas and feasible projects for the program will be generated through this
connection. Each senior design student selected to participate will then
establish contact, via the graduate liaison, with coordinating clinicians and a
specific person with a disability, and work together with that person to
generate the design specifications of the device to meet the specific need of
that individual. The student will design, build, deliver and evaluate a
prototype device to aid the individual in improving independence. Two
undergraduate students will be supported each summer to follow up with each
client to make necessary modification and completion to the device, which will
ensure that the device can actually be used by the client, and train the
students on quality control and custom service for biomedical devices aiding
persons with disabilities. ***
