The Department of geology is purchasing an energy dispersive analytical system
accessory for their scanning electron microscope. Advanced undergraduate
students are using the equipment to analyze individual mineral compositions as
well as accomplish semi-quantitative whole rock analyses. The ability to use
backscatter electron detection is enabling students to analyze fine grained
rocks and study the intrapore mineral growth
