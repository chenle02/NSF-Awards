This project is designed to address emerging issues of global change (i.e.
greenhouse effect, ozone depletion, deforestation, water pollution, loss of
biological diversity, etc.) and the impact these changes may have on humans. The
project will also relate these issues to the processes and concepts of the
science taught in secondary schools. Development of five or more multi-activity
modules, sequenced into an instructional unit, will be developed for high school
biology, chemistry, and physics classes. A parallel version for use in junior
high will also be developed. The modules will include (a) the nature of the
research and resulting data that has led to an understanding of the issues, and
(b) an emphasis on the implications of the topics for domestic and world social,
political and economic issues. Research data and background understandings for
the module developers will be provided by the active involvement of scientists
from the Byrd Polar Research Center and the Center for Mapping at the Ohio State
University. Classroom ideas for use with the research topics will be generated
by teachers and developed into modules by the project staff. Continued input and
monitoring by the research scientists will assure accuracy in representing both
the subject matter and the methods of science. Similar involvement by teachers
and science educators, with formative pilot testing, revision, and summative
evaluation, will assure that pedagogy is sound and materials workable in
classroom settings. Creative use of instructional methodologies such as
simulations and laboratory exercises will be accompanied by adaptations of
remote imaging, geographic information systems, and other data gathering and
analysis techniques. Finally, the project will develop a model teacher workshop
for dissemination of the materials through the National Science Teacher
Association (NSTA) conferences and will meet NSTA requirements for distribution
through that association.
