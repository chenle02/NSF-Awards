AST-0908276&lt;br/&gt;Campins&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is a three-year
spectroscopic study of 20 Cybele and Hilda asteroids. Cybeles and Hildas orbit
between two significantly different populations of primitive asteroids, those in
the main belt and those in the Jupiter Trojan clouds. Many Cybele and Hilda
asteroids can now be reached by near-infrared and mid-infrared spectroscopy,
which is diagnostic of the mineralogy of the asteroid surfaces. This study will
determine if Cybele and Hilda asteroids show surface characteristics similar to
Jupiter Trojans, and will therefore test the recent dynamical models that argue
that many asteroids in this region are actually captured objects from the
primordial transneptunian belt. This team has already demonstrated the potential
of this observational approach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduate and graduate
students, some female or members of other under-represented groups, will be
directly involved in the research. The methods and results of this research will
be incorporated into undergraduate and graduate courses, and the results will
also inform public outreach activities.
