The goal of this project is to understand structure of 3-dimensional Poincare
duality groups, Kleinian groups, flat conformal structures, polygons in
symmetric spaces and apply the latter to the representation theory.

This project focuses in part on the structure of symmetries of objects naturally
arising in geometry, algebra and physics. Such symmetries include both discrete
symmetries (like the ones of wallpaper patterns and regular solids) as well as
continuous symmetries (like translations and rotations of the space). Presence
of ``negative curvature'' (which implies for instance that sum of angles in a
triangle can be less than 180 degrees) makes study of such symmetries more
interesting and challenging.

Polygons provide a link between geometry and Lie theory, which is a field of
mathematics which involves both continuous and discrete symmetries. Polygons,
which are familiar objects from the high-school geometry, become much more
complex when considered in negatively curved spaces. The ``side-lengths'' of
polygons in such spaces become vectors rather than numbers. Such polygons
provide a poverful tool in the Lie theory.
