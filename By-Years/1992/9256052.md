Occidental College will initiate a four-week, residential, Young Scholars
project in and mathematics for 32 students entering the 9th and 10th grades.
This summer and academic year program will emphasize working in small groups
which focus on the processes of mathematical development: seeking patterns,
formulating conjectures, reasoning accurately, and writing and speaking clearly.
Problems will be chosen from areas of discrete mathematics to illustrate basic
themes of modern mathematics: pattern, dimension, quantity, uncertainty, shape,
and change. Follow-up activities include classes, lectures, career and college
admission workshops, field trips, publication of student works, and required
Science Fair participation.
