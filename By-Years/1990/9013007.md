A large number of biotechnology processes depend either directly or indirectly
on the physical and chemical properties of cell surfaces. The aim of this
research is to develop a new technology called cell surface engineering. This
can be defined as the manipulation of cellular surfaces and their exploitation
for practical applications. Recombinant DNA techniques are to be employed to
coat cells with desired receptor proteins and enzymes. Potential applications
include the production of inexpensive cellular adsorbents suitable for a wide
range of affinity purifications, the development of multipurpose bacterial
vaccines, enzyme immobilization, cell adherence on surfaces, and controlled
biofilm formation for the prevention of biofouling/bacterial corrosion.
