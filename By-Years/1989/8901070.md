The patterns of water and nitrogen acquisition and utilization by two species
of oaks growing on serpentine-derived soil will be investigated. Preliminary
results indicate that Quercus agrifolia and Q. durata differ in rooting depth,
and that the availability of water and nitrogen in the soil varies with both
depth and season. It is hypothesized that, as a result of spatial interactions
between soil resource availability and root distribution, neighboring
individuals of Q. durata and Q. agrifolia have access to different levels of
nitrogen and water. It is further predicted that neighboring individuals of the
two species should differ in the acquisition and utilization of nitrogen and
water. These hypotheses will be investigated using both field and controlled
environment studies. Information on rooting depth will be compared with the
availability of water and nitrogen at several depths. The seasonal patterns of
nitrogen and water acquisition and utilization for several sets of adjacent size
matched plants will be followed, and the ways in which Q. durata and Q.
agrifolia acclimate to nitrogen and water availability will be investigated by
growing plants under nutrient sand-culture conditions designed to simulate the
resources available to shallowly and deeply rooted plants.
