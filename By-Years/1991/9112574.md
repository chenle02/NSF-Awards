This proposed research aims at fabricating tailored microstructure
ferroelectric and superconducting thin films on semiconductors substrates with
and without buffer layers, and developing a thorough understanding of the
structure-property correlations in ferroelectric and superconducting films. This
will be achieved by controlled and systematic variation in the microstructure of
the ferroelectric films on semiconductors and on epitaxial buffer layers on
semiconductors. To facilitate the tailoring of the microstructure, buffer layers
will be deposited which act as diffusion barriers and provide good thermal
matching between the film and the substrate. This approach will be also used to
deposit crack-free superconducting thin films and related superlattice
structures on semiconductor substrates. %%%% This research will provide tailored
processing of ferroelectric films to obtain the desired electrical properties.
Ferroelectric thin films on semiconductors are important electronic devices such
as non-volatile memories. This research will also lead to the fabrication of
crack-free epitaxial superconducting films and related structures on
semiconductor substrates. This study aims to develop a thorough understanding of
the structure-property relationships in these films.
