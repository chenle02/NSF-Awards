The ability to manipulate protein molecules to form unique assemblies is the
basis of this study. Isolating proteins by anchoring them to lipid layers at
air-water interfaces provides a means to effect their ordering in two
dimensions. Fundamental studies of the process of two-dimensional protein
crystallization is one goal of this study. Another is to achieve the controlled
growth of three-dimensional protein arrays and crystals. Through a careful
choice of materials and conditions, three-dimensional protein arrays are to be
assembled by deploying additional ordered layers on a two-dimensional protein
crystal via protein-ligand or protein-protein interactions. Such crystals are a
representation of the more general phenomenon of biomolecular self-organization.
Ultimately, these novel phases are to form the basis for developments in ordered
thin films and layered structures with potential applications in such diverse
areas as sensor technology, medical diagnostics and optical and electronic
devices.
