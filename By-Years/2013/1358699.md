The long-term future of reef ecosystems depends on the continued persistence of
corals as essential habitat builders. Environmental threats facing coral reefs
globally include chronic and acute thermal stress (which can result in ?coral
bleaching" as a result of the expulsion of their symbiotic algae), increasing
CO2, and nutrient pollution. This project will assess the independent and
interactive effects of these stressors using a new molecular based technique
showing that coral bleaching susceptibility depends on the symbiont:host (S:H)
cell ratio in coral tissues. Corals with higher ratios (more symbionts) are
predicted to be more susceptible to thermal stress, suggesting that abiotic
factors that affect symbiont densities can directly influence thermal tolerance.
This new metric of symbiont density is of physiological relevance and has
already revealed patterns that differ from currently used metrics, thus
providing new insights into the dynamics of these symbioses. This project will
also continue the development and application of these methods to further our
understanding of the ecology of coral-algal symbioses, while helping to
elucidate the responses of these critical ecosystem engineers to complex changes
in their environment. The proposed activities will help us understand how
tradeoffs in the regulation of symbiotic partners respond to the environment and
relate to the differential susceptibility of corals to environmental
stress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of molecular assays to quantify
symbiont abundance represents a technical resource that will help advance the
field of coral ecology. This project will train a postdoctoral researcher and
several students (graduate and undergraduate), helps expand a new state-of-the-
science running seawater laboratory, establishes a new coral nursery as an
educational resource, and will be incorporated into ongoing activities in K-12
outreach and involvement with mass media for broader public outreach.
