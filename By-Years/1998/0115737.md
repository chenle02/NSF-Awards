This grant provides the American Mathematical Society with funds to be used over
three years to support mathematically talented U.S. undergraduates for a
semester of study at the MATH in MOSCOW program of the Independent University of
Moscow. Funds will be used to underwrite approximately half of the typical cost
for a semester of study in the program for ten undergraduate students per
(academic) year. The Independent University of Moscow (IUM) is a small, elite
institution of higher learning focusing primarily on mathematics. It was founded
in 1991 at the initiative of a group of well-known Russian research
mathematicians, who now comprise the Academic Council of the University. The
faculty of the IUM has well-established connections with the research community
in the U.S. and Europe. The costs to administer this program are being fully
absorbed by the AMS, and all the funds provide will be used to support the
students.
