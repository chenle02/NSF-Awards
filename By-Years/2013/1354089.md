Understanding how organisms communicate with one other and how communication
systems arise and change over time is a major challenge in biology. This project
provides a rare opportunity to investigate the origin and diversification of a
chemical communication system at the molecular level in amphibians (salamanders
and frogs). In addition, this research can provide a novel framework for
applications in computer science, where current research is focused on building
systems that can evolve and use communication to accomplish jobs and then adapt
as needs change. The project will also contribute to the training of a
postdoctoral researcher and numerous undergraduate students in collaboration
with MSU's BEACON Center and an ongoing REU site award.

Specifically, the objectives of this work are to trace the evolutionary link
between compounds that amphibians produce in the skin as antimicrobials and
their later use as pheromones; to purify and test the efficacy of those
compounds as antimicrobials and pheromones; and to identify the molecular
mechanism used to smell those compounds. The results will be obtained through
the use of bioinformatics and genomics to trace the genetic history of genes,
protein biochemistry to isolate and test the gene products, behavioral
experiments to determine which compounds function as pheromones, and
electrophysiology to identify the neuronal mechanisms responsible for sensing
the pheromones. Results from these studies will be disseminated through peer-
reviewed publications and through presentations at scientific conferences. All
data will be available upon request and deposited at Dryad and the NCBI Trace
archive.
