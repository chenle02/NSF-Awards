Morehouse College is requesting funds for 30 African-American computing
undergraduate students and eight computing faculty to participate in a
collegiate planning workshop that will be co-located with the 41st Annual
National Black Data Processing Associates (BDPA) Technology Conference & Career
Fair. The workshop will be held at the Hyatt Regency Hotel during August 1-3,
2019. The workshop focuses on increasing the number of Black computing
professionals at the undergraduate level.

Workshop activities will examine best practices and seek to articulate
strategies for collaborating with the information technology industry to
increase internships for historically underrepresented minority students
pursuing computer science and information technology careers. Proceedings will
be disseminated broadly to other institutions of higher education, particularly
Historically Black Colleges and Universities.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
