Groups appear in numerous areas of mathematics, chemistry and physics and have
had tremendous impact as an organizational tool within mathematics. They often
appear as the set of symmetries of a geometric object, for example, of
3-dimensional space, a molecule or a crystal. Oftentimes, the set of symmetries
themselves, i.e., the group, has a natural topological structure. That is, one
can speak of one symmetry being close to another, as in the case of two
rotations of 3-dimensional space being close if they differ by a small angle.
These latter groups are called topological transformation groups and are
trivially related to geometry via the geometric object of which they are the set
of symmetries. However, other topological groups are not so easily viewed as
coming from geometry. This is, for example, the case for the systems of
solutions to many differential equations which form a group under addition
called a Banach space. However, one of the principal ideas of the present
project is that all topological groups have natural intrinsic geometric
structure which is defined jointly by their topological and algebraic structure.
Moreover, this geometric structure can in many cases provide significant insight
into the structure of the group by blotting out finer details that obscure the
global or large scale properties of the group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary
aim of this project is to investigate the coarse geometry of topological and, in
particular, Polish groups. In earlier research, the PI has established and
investigated a natural coarse structure that every topological group is equipped
with and which coincides with that traditionally studied on finitely generated
or locally compact groups, Banach spaces or even homeomorphism groups of compact
manifolds. Particularly interesting subclasses to be studied are the Polish
groups of bounded geometry for which the geometric structure theory is well-
advanced. Several interesting questions on the extent of this class of groups
remain open, for example, whether every Polish group of bounded geometry is
coarsely equivalent to a locally compact group. The research program is by
nature interdisciplinary. While its origins lie in descriptive set theory, the
main examples of groups to be studied arise in various disciplines of
mathematics, including functional analysis, logic, and geometric and
differential topology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
