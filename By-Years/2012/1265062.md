1265062&lt;br/&gt;Tanguay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fundamental goal of this
potentially transformative research project is to investigate the feasibility of
ultra compact optical imaging systems for ultraminiature cameras that are
designed for chronic surgical implantation in the human body. Such
ultraminiature cameras must be at once extremely small, very low mass, and very
low power, as well as being both biocompatible and hermetically sealed for
chronic implantation. Recent advances in biocompatible optical materials,
optical systems design, and CMOS image sensor array technology potentially
enable this extreme miniaturization. Biomedical imaging applications of such
ultraminiature cameras include an intraocular camera for retinal prostheses, a
wide field-of-view eye-tracked extraocular camera for retinal prostheses, a
miniaturized eye-tracking camera, and bioimplantable cameras capable of post-
surgical interrogation. In the intraocular camera application, the
ultraminiature camera is designed for implantation within the human eye, with
capability for partially restoring vision in those blinded by photoreceptor
degenerating diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and age-related macular
degeneration (AMD). The intraocular camera is designed to couple directly to a
pixellated microstimulator array that is proximity-coupled to the retinal
surface. The development of such an ultraminiature intraocular camera (IOC)
would eliminate the need for an external head-mounted or eyeglass-mounted camera
in retinal prostheses, and provide for a completely implantable prosthetic
device capable of restoring sight with foveation to the blind, at the same time
relieving surgical complications.
