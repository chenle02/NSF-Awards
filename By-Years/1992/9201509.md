The primary objectives of this research are to assess restriction-site and DNA-
sequence variation within the region common to pericentric inversions of
chromosome 6 in the common deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), and to determine
whether linkage disequilibrium exists between specific DNA haplotypes and each
of the three morphs of this chromosome. These data will be used to evaluate two
alternative hypotheses for the origin (monophyletic or convergent) and
maintenance (selection or recurrent mutation) of the widespread pericentric-
inversion polymorhisms in P. maniculatus and the related deer mouse species P.
sitkensis and P. oreas. The sample will include deer mice collected from natural
populations throughout North America. The pericentric-inversion system of P.
maniculatus represents an ideal mammalian model to test the general
applicability of the genetic hypotheses and evolutionary principles derived from
the paracentric-inversion system of the fruit fly Drosphila pseudoobscura.
