The goal of this project is to carry out mathematical research in topological
algebra at points of contact with other mathematical and non-mathematical
disciplines, e.g. control theory. The first area of investigation centers on the
Lie theory of semigroups, particularly connections of the theory with problems
of local and global controllability on a Lie group. Another class of problems
concerns questions related to semigroup analogs of Hilbert's fifth problem. The
second area of investigation concerns continuous lattice and topological
semilattice theory and connections with the theory of computation.
