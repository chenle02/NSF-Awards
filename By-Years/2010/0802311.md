This project develops an educational pathway for audio video systems
specialists. These specialized multimedia technicians meet the industry needs of
such organizations as conference centers, hotels, sports arenas and other venues
requiring integrated, high technology communication needs. Specialized courses
are developed in Audio Visual Technology Systems to complete the curriculum. In
consultation with an advisory committee, business and industry representatives,
and trade organizations, an Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degree is created
that provides the foundation for the audio visual systems specialist. In
addition to creating and implementing a curriculum for an AAS degree for audio
visual systems specialists, customized business training is offered for
incumbent workers. This project 1) meets industry's growing demand for entry and
advanced level audio visual systems specialists, and 2) develops the educational
opportunities that allow these highly specialized technicians to climb
educational and career ladders. Specific activities include 1) developing
curriculum, courses, and training materials; 2) recruiting students into AAS and
certificate programs and corporate training; 3) developing, maintaining and
strengthening industry relationships; 4) strengthening the educational
continuum; and 5) disseminating the program development model, curriculum, best
practices and outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;
