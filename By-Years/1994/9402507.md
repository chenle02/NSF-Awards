9402507 Berndt In this project the P.I.s will conduct an experimental study to
investigate methane production and serpentinization over a wide P,T and fluid
composition range. Their results will have a bearing on methane production and
serpentinization in subseafloor hydrothermal systems and C-cycle in oceanic
environment.
