This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II Project will develop a novel
drug solubility enhancing process for improving yields from costly drug
discovery efforts, where up to 40% of new drug candidates have poor water
solubility and are abandoned despite promising biological activity. Phase I
research developed a novel nanoformulation process using the ElectroNanospray
process that improved model drug solubility 20-40 fold. In Phase II, the new
process will be tested to enhance solubility of a model class of pain
therapeutics, the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

By expanding the universe of potential drug candidates and by developing
enhanced delivery methods for existing drugs the project will seek to enable the
development of new drug therapies with an initial emphasis on pain management.
