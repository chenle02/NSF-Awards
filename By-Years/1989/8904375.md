Fluxes of materials through subduction zones are crucial to the evolution of
the lithosphere-mantle system. This study is aimed at understanding of processes
involving rocks, aqueous fluids, silicate melts and their interactions at
several locations within the framework of subduction. Complex sequences of
events may occur between subducted crust and continental crust. This study
consists of 8 separate experimental projects that focus on significant parts of
the subduction interaction.
