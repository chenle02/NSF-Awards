The genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying the choice between neural and
epidermal cell determination will be studied in the fruit fly, Drosophila
melanogaster. Eleven extant mutations that affect eye development through
modifying the phenotypic effects of the "Split" allele of the "Notch" locus,
alone or in combination with the "Enhancer of split" mutation will be
characterized. These studies have the potential of identifying intracellular
mechanisms required for neuronal cell determination.
