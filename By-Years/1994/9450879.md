9450879 Walczak The chemistry curriculum contains no modern electrochemical
experiments and very limited equipment to perform such experiments.
Electrochemical and spectroelectrochemical (combining electrochemistry and
spectroscopy) experiments are important in both industrial and academic
applications and the equipment to do these types of experiments is standard at
many comparable colleges. To maintain the excellence of the chemistry department
at St. Olaf College we propose to obtain the necessary equipment to incorporate
electrochemistry and spectroelectrochemistry into Instrumental Analysis
Laboratory (Chem 378), Analytical Chemistry Laboratory (Chem 256), Physical
Chemistry Laboratory (Chem 257), and Advanced Synthesis Laboratory (Chem 374).
The equipment would also be used in student research, in conjunction with Chem
375, Chem 398 and our summer research program.
