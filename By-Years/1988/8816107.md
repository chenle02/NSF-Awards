This project is aimed at determining the heat transfer resistance which develops
due to formation of an air gap between the mold surface and the solidifying
metal as a cast metal begins to cool. The thermal stresses due to the
contraction and their relaxation due to creep will be modeled, as will the heat
transfer due to conduction between contacting surfaces or through thin
lubricating films, partial conduction through contacting asperities , and
radiation across the air gap. The model studies will be coupled closely with
experimental work performed in collaboration with industrial researchers at an
industrial test laboratory.
