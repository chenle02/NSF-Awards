This is a one year cooperative research project proposed by Dr. Neil Lundberg,
Florida State University, and Professor M. P. Chen, Taiwan University, supported
by the AIT (U.S.) - CCNAA (Taiwan) Cooperative Science Program. This proposal
plans to core the active collision zone close to Taiwan. The U.S.-Taiwan Program
provides funds for U.S. scientists' travels and incidental laboratory expenses
to enable Dr. Lundberg and two students to participate in a coring program in
the collision zone south of Taiwan, while the Taiwan National Science Council
provides the ship and field support. Dr. Lundberg is well known in this field of
science. The subject is of significant importance to provide information useful
to understanding the collision processes occurring in this area.
