Recent evidence suggest that viruses may be very important in marine food webs,
with some estimates suggesting they are responsible for the majority of
bacterial mortality, and driving a significant component of nutrient cycling. If
these estimates are correct, the scientific community will need a major
rethinking of our conceptual models and modification of the performance and
interpretation of many currently-accepted field measurements. However, the
evidence to date is only from a few samples, and the methods and results are in
real need of verification before they can be accepted with confidence. The
objectives of this project are to use a variety of independent methods to
measure from marine samples: (1) mortality rates of bacteria from viral
infection in the context of bacterial growth and mortality from other sources
including protistan grazers, and (2) the rates and mechanisms by which free
viruses are removed or destroy. There are no known direct means to measure
virus-induced bacterial mortality in natural mixed population, so two indirect
methods will be used: (a) electron microscopy of field populations containing
mature intracellular viruses, and (b) native virus population size changes and
removal or decay rates in field samples. Rates will be compared to estimates of
bacterial growth, grazing losses, and size-fractionated total mortality in an
attempt to assemble a "source and sink" budget for large enclosed samples. Rates
and mechanisms of viral decay and removal will be studied with both natural
populations and cultured viruses. This project includes some laboratory work,
but primarily field studies to be performed in nearshore and offshore
environments off California. The use of multiple methods, cross-verified with
each other, should greatly increase the confidence in any conclusion that are
reached.
