As part of an ongoing College of Engineering Curriculum- Laboratory
Revitalization Program, the Chemical &amp; Materials Engineering Department is
developing an innovative Unit Operations Lab consisting of nine new experimental
stations and nine new corresponding computer simulation programs and data
acquisition systems. Together with a modular control lab and analytical
instrumentation, this forms a new laboratory complex for a flexible, modular
approach to chemical processing at the systems level. It features industrial
caliber equipment compatible with laboratory scale operations. The intent is to
provide the undergraduate student with an education involving equipment, program
simulators, data acquisition systems, and a mode of conduct representative of
professional employment situations, consistent with a wide diversity of the
chemical industry. The planning and implementation of this effort is being
closely coordinated with an industry advisory group.This project involves the
procurement of three items, i.e., heat exchanger, gas absorption, and chemical
reactor units for the Unit Operations Lab. These constitute the threshold core
from which the comprehensive curriculum-laboratory structure evolves.
