This project is awarding scholarships to academically talented and financially
needy students and is supporting the scholars through a variety of structures
and programs. Women and students from underrepresented groups are being
especially targeted for support. Student scholars are enrolled in engineering
programs and the need for professionals who have expertise in these fields is
vital to the region's growing high tech industry. The project is improving
retention and graduation through implementation of the Academic Resource Center
that provides mentoring, tutoring, and supplemental instruction services for the
scholars. Scholars are also participating in a mathematics bridge program just
prior to their first-year at the university.
