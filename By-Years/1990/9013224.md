Precipitation will be collected as part of Phase II of the AEROCE network in
the North Atlantic and analyzed for the trace metals Al, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Pb,
and Zn. The purpose is to; (1) characterize the trace metal chemistry of North
Atlantic atmosphere, and (2) assess the impact of continental emissions of trace
metals on atmospheric chemical processes, as well as the impact of their
deposition on biogeochemical cycles in the North Atlantic Ocean. Specifically
the data will be used to; (1) determine the source and flux of trace metal
emissions from continents surrounding the North Atlantic, and (2) evaluate the
deposition and impact of continentally derived trace metals on biogeochemical
processes of seawater.
