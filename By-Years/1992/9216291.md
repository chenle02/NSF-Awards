In this project the transient chemical and physical processes during
electrokinetically enhanced contaminant transport in soils will be investigated
to develop a predictive tool that could be applicable to complicated situations
of soil contamination. The investigation is composed of two phases: laboratory
work and analytical work. In laboratory work, simulated specimens of
contaminated soil with heavy metals and organic substances will be subjected to
long term electrokinetic tests. In the analytical phase of the work, an existing
model of second order kinetic approach for solute retention and transport in
soils will be interfaced with an existing shell of an expert system augmented
with the new data and base rules. A prototype system will be developed which
updates the initial conditions of the algorithmic model in time steps as pH,
redox potential, and soil retention capacity changes in time and space.
