9423865 BLAUT STEA The research entails a set of discrete projects designed to
test the hypothesis that mapping (the creation and use of representational
models of landscape) is a ubiquitous activity by humans of all ages. The
projects entail archaeological, cultural, and child-developmental approaches,
and archival, ethnographic, and experimental methodologies. The team of
collaborators includes researchers experienced in each of these approaches and
methodologies. Projects will be carried out in the US, Mexico, and England (the
English research is not being funded through this award). The studies and
associated theoretical work will be only a partial test of the notion that
mapping is a cultural universal; positive results would suggest that map-making
and -reading are more widespread across eras, cultures, and personal development
stages than has generally been recognized. The investigators hope that the
current work will lay a foundation for further study of how people learn to
construct and to read maps.
