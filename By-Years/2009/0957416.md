With this Renewal Award, the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms
Program continues to support Professor Dean J. Tantillo for a proposal that uses
modern computational chemistry, coupled with laboratory experiments to uncover
the fundamental principles of reactivity that govern mechanisms of carbocation
rearrangements leading to terpene natural products. The goals of this research
are to (a) use modern quantum chemical methods to assess the energetic viability
of various complex carbocation cyclization mechanisms leading to terpene natural
products and to characterize the electronic structures of the intermediates and
transition state structures involved in these processes. And (b), assess the
ability of these intermediates and transition state structures to engage in
noncovalent/intermolecular interactions with functional groups present in enzyme
active sites. In short, this project will uncover general principles of
carbocation reactivity that are relevant to a wide variety of complex
rearrangements.

This award will lead to an increased understanding of unusual types of chemical
bonding, support the training of postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate
students, and build a network of collaborations between experimentalists and
computational chemists. In addition to the fundamental importance of the
chemistry uncovered through this research, the projects pursued will be used to
provide students with multidisciplinary approaches to mechanistic chemistry and
expose them to careers that utilize such expertise. The results of this research
will be incorporated into the University of California COSMOS Summer Program for
high school students interested in science, and a biennial symposium that
exposes postdoctoral, graduate, undergraduate, and high school students to
careers in theoretical chemistry.
