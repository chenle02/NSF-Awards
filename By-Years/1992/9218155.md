This award supports a two-year collaborative research project between Professor
Therese Cotton of Iowa State University and Professor Katsume Niki of Yokohama
National University. The objective of the research is to develop methods for
enhancing the heterogeneous electron transfer process at the electrode surface.
An understanding of those factors that are important for reversible electron
transfer could result in the preparation of bioelectronic devices based upon the
photosynthetic components. Professor Cotton will continue development of
monolayer methods and use resonance Raman spectroscopy (RR) and surface-enhanced
resonance Raman scattering (SERRS) to characterize the monolayers. Professor
Niki will develop electrode surface modifications for improving electron
transfer kinetics. The adsorbed monolayers will then be characterized by
electroreflectance spectroscopy. Also involved in the project is Professor
Robert Uphaus of Iowa State University. The U.S. and Japanese groups have
complementary expertise in the characterization of proteins and other
electroactive species on electrode surfaces. The use of RR and SERRS in the U.S.
component of the research will provide vibrational spectra of the various redox
active species. The Japanese group will determine electroreflectance spectra on
the same systems. Measurement of optical changes in the pigments as a function
of potential will be extremely valuable in those cases where the vibrational
spectra overlap strongly. Moreover, the use of optical measurements may enable
the accurate determination of the midpoint potential of BChl and BPheo in the
reaction centers. This information is very important with respect to the
mechanism of photoinduced electron transfer.
