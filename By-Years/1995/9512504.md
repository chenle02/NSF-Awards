9512504 Maldonado This proposal requests advanced instrumentation for
characterizing new optical materials (nonlinear biaxial crystals organic and
inorganic ) and wave guide devices. The instrumentation (i.e. laser systems,
ellipsometer, spectrum analyzer, etc..) would be used to verify experimentally
the theoretical' studies and predictions of the Electro-Optics Group at the
University of Texas in Austin. In particular, the propagation constants of
hybrid modes in planar and channel biaxial waveguides are to examined as well as
waveguide devices, such as guided-model resonance filters. ***
