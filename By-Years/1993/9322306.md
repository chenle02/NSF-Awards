9322306 Kennedy This Research Experiences for Undergraduates project at the
Department of Mechanical Engineering at Clemson University will identify and
encourage those students who have demonstrated the interest and ability to make
original contributions to the field of mechanical engineering through research
activities. By introducing these students to the opportunities that exist in
both graduate school and in an academic environment, it is hoped that a
significant number of the participants would elect to continue their studies
beyond the B.S. level. ***
