AI planners have traditionally made certainty and simplicity assumptions which
have obscured two important distinctions: that the time at which a plan is
executed differs from the time at which the plan is built, and that the planning
agent's model of the world will differ from the real world. Relaxing these
assumptions indtroduces the problem of maintaining a planning agent's world
model, which will be both imcomplete and dynamic. A framework for representing
and maintaining such a model, has been developed which takes into account
reports from external sources (e.g. sensors), the agent's proposed actions or
plans, and external forces that may aid or confound those plans. Extensions to
this framework will allow the agent to reason about (1) execution-time reports
from sensors, thus allowing it to detect planning failures and learn from bad
predictions, and (2) complex causal structures, thus allowing it to represent
more realistic physical systems (like the ones studied in the qualitative-
physics literature).
