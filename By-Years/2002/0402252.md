This project is producing and disseminating a series of twenty instructional
videos based upon laboratory exercises contained in five new information and
communications technology textbooks that were developed and published with
earlier funding. The videos serve as enhancements to the textbooks and allow for
customization by end users as stand alone products. The PI plans to deliver all
videos in a variety of formats including CDs, DVDs, and streamed through the
PI's institution's website. This flexibility allows instructors to addresses
distance-learning needs and the diversity of student learning styles and
backgrounds. All videos are being enhanced by closed captions, voice narration
and talking menus and all are being produced in both English and Spanish. The PI
will disseminate the videos in CD and DVD formats through the center's network
of partnering colleges and through the textbook publisher, Delmar Publishing. In
their evaluation, the investigators plan to use a mixed method approach
involving both qualitative and quantitative data to assess student and
instructor satisfaction as well as gains in student learning.
