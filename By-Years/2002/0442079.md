A new international project, entitled 'Analysis, Integration and Modeling of the
Earth System' (AIMES), is being established to build on, improve and expand the
former Global Analysis, Integration and Modeling (GAIM) project as a central
international and interdisciplinary activity on the study Earth System as a
whole.

AIMES will promote activities that link the human and physical sciences for
Earth system analysis. Specifically, AIMES will focus on two thematic
approaches: coupled understanding of the physical/biogeochemical Earth system;
and the human dimensions interface to the physical Earth system. The new AIMES
Project Office will aid AIMES scientists and the overall research community
interested in this area by developing enabling projects on: tools and
techniques, especially advanced modeling techniques; and fast-track Initiatives,
e.g., rapid assessments in support of science and policy uncertainties.

Research activities within the new AIMES project will be derived from both
ongoing GAIM activities and new initiatives. These will lead to a growing
synergism between development of human dimensions projects and advancement of
fully coupled models that would allow the fuller and accelerated inclusion of
historical human impacts into Earth System models, providing insights into
sensitivity analyses that will be useful in developing future scenarios.
