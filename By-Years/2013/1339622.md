This award supports the bi-annual teacher workshop of the Lowell Educational
Astronomy Program (LEAP). LEAP is a science enrichment and outreach program for
5th-8th grade Navajo and Hopi children and their teachers. The program pairs
astronomers with teachers for one year. The astronomer visits the classroom
throughout the year, leading astronomy discussions and hands-on activities in
collaboration with the teacher. The astronomer also holds star parties at the
school and involves tribal educators in presenting traditional astronomical
knowledge. The year-long partnership culminates in a field trip to Lowell
Observatory in which the students visit the Observatory's Steele Visitor Center
during the day and observe on two research telescopes at night.
