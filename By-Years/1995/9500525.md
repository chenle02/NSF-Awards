ABSTRACT 9500525 Danchi, William Townes, Charles $1.7M is being provided to
expand the University of California, Berkeley imaging interferometer. This
pioneering instrument is expanding the technique of spatial interferometry into
the 10 micron atmospheric window. The improved instrument will be used in the
study of circumstellar dust shells and protoplanetary disks. It will also
further our understanding of heterodyne detection at these wavelengths and of
the structure of turbulence in the Earth's atmosphere.
