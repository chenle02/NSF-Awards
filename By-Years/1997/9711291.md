ABSTRACT There is mounting evidence that the very low oceanic inputs of some
essential trace elements may limit the ability of primary producers to acquire
major nutrients and grow. This this project the principal investigator will test
the hypotheses that (1) low zinc concentrations in the surface oceans may limit
the rate of inorganic carbon uptake by phytoplankton; (2) that cadmium and
cobalt may substitute for zinc in some species; and that (3) the relative
availability of carbon, zinc, cadmium, and cobalt may effect differentially the
growth of diatoms and coccolithophores and thus influence through the so-called
rain ratio (calcium carbonate/organic carbon export to the deep sea), the
efficiency of the biological carbon dioxide pump and hence the partial pressure
of carbon dioxide in surface seawater. These hypotheses will be studied using
laboratory experiments with diatoms and coccolithophores and groundtruthed
through a small sea-going field program.
