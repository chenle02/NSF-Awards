The Federal Construction Council (FCC) is a continuing activity of the Building
Research Board of the National Academy of Sciences. Its fundamental purpose is
to provide a common base for technical studies by those federal agencies that
are responsible for the design, construction, and operation of federal
government facilities or for construction-related research. During 1987, work
will continue on the development of a conceptual framework for an integrated
computer data base encompassing the entire construction process. The following
advisory studies are included in the 1987 program: Developing a Building
Research Agenda for the Nation; Integrated Data Base Development (Plan V);
Public Buildings and Liability Related to Hazardous Materials; Improved
Construction Cost Estimating During Preliminary Planning; Protection of Federal
Facilities Against Terrorism; Analytical Methods of Designing Buildings; and
Improving the Quality of Designs for Federal Facilities.
