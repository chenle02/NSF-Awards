Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;The MCM-SkyTEM project mapped resistivity in the
McMurdo Dry Valleys and at Cape Barne on the Ross Island during the 2011-12
austral season using an airborne transient electromagnetic method. The SkyTEM
system is mounted to a helicopter enabling a broad geophysical survey of
subsurface resistivity structure over terrain that is inaccessible to
traditional ground-based methods. Resistivity measurements obtained distinguish
between highly resistive geologic materials such as glacier ice, bedrock and
permafrost, and conductive materials such as unfrozen sediments or permafrost
with liquid brine to depths of about 300 m. The PIs request funding to derive
data products relevant to physical and chemical conditions in potential
subsurface microbial habitats of the McMurdo Dry Valleys, similar cold regions
on Earth and other planetary bodies. They will use these data products to
characterize the hydrologic history of McMurdo Dry Valleys as well as the
subsurface hydrologic connectivity in the region to investigate the implications
for nutrient and microbial transport. The PIs will make these data products
accessible to the research community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts:
&lt;br/&gt;Polar microbial habitats are of high societal and scientific interest
because they represent important testing grounds for the limits of life on Earth
and other planetary bodies. Project deliverables will include teaching aids for
undergraduate and graduate students. Two Ph.D. students will obtain advanced
research training as part of this project. The PIs and students on this project
will also engage in informal public outreach opportunities by presenting at
local K-12 schools and reaching out to local media outlets on stories relating
to SkyTEM research.
