94066183 Edwards This award provides partial funding for two technical support
positions in the Department of Geology &amp; Geophysics Minnesota Isotope
Laboratory at the University of Minnesota. The technical work in the isotope
laboratory is labor- intensive, involves maintenance of sophisticated
instrumentation, requires extensive training of senior and student researchers,
both on- and off-campus, and needs the full-time attention of dedicated
technicians. The Minnesota Isotope Laboratory is involved in fundamental
research to establish high-resolution global climate (glacial-to- interglacial
time scales) and regional climate (century to decadal time scales) chronologies.
