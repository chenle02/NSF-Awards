The investigator will proceed with his research on iterated quadratic
polynomials relative to hyperbolic dynamical systems and analysis of components
of the Mandelbrot set. Dynamical systems on algebraic surfaces (K-3 type) and
structural studies of Teichmueller space-Bers boundary-using complex analytic
techniques will also be investigated.
