This research program explores fundamental physics and potential applications of
controlled quantum systems at the interface of quantum optics and nano-science.
The work involves the interplay between theory and experiment and involves
potential applications within two broad areas. The first is the sensing and
quantum manipulation of individual spins, and the second is quantum optical
control using nano-photonic systems. Specifically, we are developing a novel
technique for nanoscale magnetic sensing that makes use of coherently
controlled, individual electronic spins associated with diamond impurities.
Furthermore, this system is being used for quantum control of nano-mechanical
motion of the magnetized tip associated with an Atomic Force Microscope (AFM).
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts include development of a new,
interdisciplinary area of physical sciences. We are providing critical insights
into the fundamental physics of controlled, complex quantum systems. New tools
are being developed that make use of coherent quantum phenomena for unique
applications ranging from information science to biology and medicine. Our
collaborative program provides exceptional opportunities for education and
training in this new area involving the interface of several fields of
fundamental physics, material science, and device engineering. We disseminate
physics knowledge through teaching, international collaborations, review
articles, lecture notes, workshops and summer schools. To enhance the
appreciation and understanding of science, public talks will be combined with
outreach efforts, such as visits to elementary schools.&lt;br/&gt;
