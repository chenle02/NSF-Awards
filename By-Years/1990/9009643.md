Multiprocessor architectures are being widely investigated to overcome the
performance limitations of traditional uniprocessor computer systems. VLSI and
Wafer Scale Integration (WSI) of the entire multiprocessor architecture on a
single wafer further enhance the system performance by eliminating long off-chip
signal delay and interconnection. However, an efficient fault tolerance scheme
is essential for the VLSI/WSI implementation to achieve a practical level of
yield and reliability. This research is developing practical design
methodologies capable of efficiently realizing large fault tolerant
multiprocessor architectures of regular interconnection structure on a single
large area VLSI circuit. The study is based on nonprobabilistic model to produce
practical results which can be used in actual implementation. We are also
developing efficient wafer testing and diagnosis schemes.
