This proposal is for the continuation of thermospheric tidal studies being
conducted with the NCAR thermosphere/ionosphere general circulated models. The
proposed project addresses detailed understanding of the lower thermosphere
global dynamics and mesosphere/thermosphere coupling. The investigator plans to
conduct and disseminate the results of NCAR model simulations in support of
CEDAR campaigns and working groups. Moreover, she will continue to refine,
update, and validate the theoretical models.
