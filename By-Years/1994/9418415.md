9418415 Blankenship Experiments are proposed to extend the current understanding
of the energy trapping processes, primary photochemistry and early secondary
electron transfer reactions in photosynthetic reaction centers that contain FeS
centers as early electron acceptors. The particular systems that will be studied
included reaction centers from the primitive anoxygenic organisms known as
heliobacteria as well as Photosystem I of oxygenic photosynthetic organisms.
Specific proposed experiments include low-temperature picosecond transient
absorbance spectroscopic studies of energy transfer and trapping in both
heliobacteria and Photosystem I, picosecond transient absorbance measurement in
the blue spectral region in both systems, and investigation of secondary
electron transfer reactions in heliobacteria monitored using EPR and millisecond
timescale transient absorbance spectroscopy. These experiments will give new
insights into the energy trapping process in reaction centers that contain
integral core antenna pigments and will help to identify and characterize some
of the early electron acceptors in these systems, including chlorophylls,
quinones and FeS centers. %%% This project will increase our understanding of
how plants and other photosynthetic organisms convert the energy of sunlight
into chemical energy. The process of photosynthesis supplies all of our food and
most of our energy needs. Many aspects of how photosynthesis works are not
understood at a deep level. This project is designed to give detailed knowledge
of the chemical mechanism of this essential biological process. ***
