The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division is
supporting research by Professor Duncan on gas-phase complexes of metal ions
with organic ligands using electronic spectroscopy and photochemistry in a
molecular beam environment. The experiments measure the geometry of the complex,
its vibrational motions, and dissociation energies. Particular interest attaches
to the first spectroscopic studies of metal-ion pi complexes. %%% In the gas
phase, metal ions are capable of attaching to small organic molecules forming
complexes with unusual bonding and energy characteristics. These are being
studied inspectroscopic and photochemical experiments with a view toward a
better understanding of the nature of the forces holding the complexes together.
