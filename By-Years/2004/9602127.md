This research program has the primary goal of microscopic prediction and
explanation of the properties of strongly interacting quantum many-body systems
crossing several disciplinary boundaries but with an emphasis on nuclear many-
body problems. Some activities and expected results include the study of high-
momentum nucleons in nuclear ground states by applying Green's function
techniques to quantitative prediction of the (e,e'p) cross section. A
corresponding study will assess the potential of two-proton removal experiments
as a probe of the nucleon-nucleon interaction in the nuclear medium.
Calculations involving self-consistent determination of nuclear-matter spectral
functions will establish the density dependence of medium modifications of
nucleons and their effective interactions and generate in-medium phase shifts
and cross sections relevant to the analysis of heavy-ion collisions. Fundamental
features of pairing by predominantly repulsive interactions will be studied in
the framework of a new separation transformation of the gap equation. Correlated
basis functions (CBF) calculations of superfluid pairing gaps in neutron-star
matter will furnish critical inputs for models of the rotational dynamics and
thermal evolution of neutron stars. Variational-CBF and correlated density
matrix theories adapted to inhomogeneous environments will be applied to pairing
in non-uniform nuclear systems, resonant vapor modes of the helium liquid-vapor
interface, Bose-Einstein condensation phenomena in trapped atomic clouds, and
phase transitions in lattice spin systems and lattice gauge models.
