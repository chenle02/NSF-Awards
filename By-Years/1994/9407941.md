Bull 9407941 Virulent infectious diseases have been some of the most fear-
provoking biological phenomena of human existence. From the historical scourges
of the plague, TB, malaria, and pneumonia to the recent emergencies of
hemorrhagic fever, AIDS, and the drug resistant TB, mortality rates after
infection have been known to exceed 50% for some of these diseases. Yet not all
infectious microbes are virulent enough to kill, and one challenge for biology
is to unravel the causes of virulence. Molecular biology is making important
inroads on this problem for some diseases, but the population biology of
virulence -- why the virulent forms of a microbe prevail over avirulent ones in
the population -- lacks a solid empirical foundation. The work proposed here
will develop this foundation using bacterial virus as a parasite of a bacterial
host. Experiments will be conducted to study how the population dynamics of a
parasite infection influences whether a virulent or an avirulent form evolves.
Assays of the viral DNA sequence will indicate the genetic bases of these
changes. Overall, this study will serve as a model for uniting molecular and
population biological approaches in studying disease virulence.
