This project will help defray expenses for U.S. scientists in participating in
the international Institute of Mathematical Statistics Symposium on Applied
Probability to be held August 16- 19, 1989 at the University of Sheffield,
England. The Symposium will bring together probabilists and related applied
scientists from around the world. The format will allow for invited addresses,
special topical sessions, and contributed papers sessions. Particular efforts
are planned to involve young researchers. The term "applied probability"
describes research dealing with uses of probability is areas such as physics,
biology, economics, sociology, engineering, and management sciences.
