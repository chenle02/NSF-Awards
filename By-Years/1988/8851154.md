Acquisition of a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer is improving the
instruction in chemistry. The instrument replaced an aging dispersive IR
spectrometer. Students are using a modern computer- controlled instrument which
utilizes the Fourier transform method, which are two of the more important
developments of the last few years. Two modern sampling accessories are
extending the use of the IR to samples for which spectra previously could not be
obtained. The instrument is being used in organic, physical, analytical, and
advanced laboratory courses as well as in the undergraduate research program.
Significant use in the non-majors courses is providing the non-science students
with exposure to the power of computer search and spectroscopic techniques in
identification and analysis of polymers and drugs. The grantee is matching the
award from non-Federal sources.
