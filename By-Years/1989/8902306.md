A major objective of PRA/STIA is to encourage greater understanding of the
research university system of the United States because it is both the center
for scientific research and for education of future scientists. This system has
been undergoing change over the past twenty years and will experience even
greater changes over the next two decades. It is important to gauge how major
societal and technical changes have affected, and are likely to affect research
universities. For these reasons it is timely to bring together scholars and
policy analysts concerned with research universities to discuss the results of
several major research projects on the subject. Such discussions will likely be
of specific value to PRA as well as to other Federal decisionmakers. The
Pennsylvania State University Institute for Policy Research and Evaluation and
the Center for the Study of Higher Education will host a workshop on "Research
Perspectives on Research Universities" held April 14-15, 1989 at Pennsylvania
State University. PRA/STIA will support the cost of this workshop, with
associated costs being covered by the University. The workshop will include
eight sessions, concerned with historical, international, university-industry
relations, Federal policies, and sponsored research. The last session will be a
roundtable discussion. A workshop report will be prepared and other channels for
disseminating the results will be used.
