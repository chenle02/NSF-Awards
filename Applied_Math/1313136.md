While defects in materials play a fundamental role in material failure, their
analysis remains a major challenge in applied mathematics. This is partly due to
the difficulty of formulating precise mathematical models, and partly due to the
difficulty of analyzing the free surfaces and singularities involved. The
investigator extends recent successes in the analysis of globally minimizing and
locally minimizing quasi-static evolutions to both locally stable quasi-static
evolutions and dynamic evolutions. One goal is to develop and study new models
for cohesive fracture and plasticity with softening, based on local stability
rather than global minimality (which is mathematically problematic). The
investigator also studies existence and analyzes fundamental properties of
dynamic fracture solutions, based on models he formulated previously.

The failure of materials rests on the nucleation and evolution of defects such
as cracks, plastic regions, and damage. The ability to accurately predict
failure depends on the quality of the underlying mathematical models of these
defects, as well as on understanding fundamental properties of solutions.
Substantial challenges remain in these areas, both in formulating sound models
and in the analysis of qualitative behavior of solutions. The investigator seeks
to make fundamental progress on these fronts, by developing new models that are
both mathematically well-posed and significantly more physically realistic than
existing models, and performing the mathematical analysis necessary to assess
their accuracy.
