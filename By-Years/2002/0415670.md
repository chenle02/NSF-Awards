&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most natural processes, from interactions among subatomic
particles to atmospheric processes that dictate weather, are nonlinear, meaning
that the relationships among variables cannot be described by simple lines.
Nonlinearities lead to such mathematical phenomena as chaos and catastrophes, in
which small changes to the inputs to a system &lt;br/&gt;lead to large changes
in the outputs. Ecological systems are full of nonlinearities, and in addition
they experience stochastic noise created by a random, unpredictable environment.
The combination of nonlinear dynamics and stochastic noise has the potential for
making ecological systems impossible to predict, because the chaos and
&lt;br/&gt;catastrophes of nonlinearities are exacerbated by the noisiness of
natural systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work will address the
interactions between nonlinear dynamics and stochastic noise in model ecological
systems in an attempt to find general properties that will make natural systems
more predictable. Even though there is the potential for extremely complex
interactions between nonlinear dynamics and stochastic noise, &lt;br/&gt;many
data sets from real ecological systems show patterns approximating the behavior
of noisy but linear systems. Part of the research project will be directed
towards confirming or refuting this observation by developing statistical
techniques to detect nonlinearities in ecological data. The other part of the
research will ask from a theoretical perspective what types of dynamics are
expected to be exhibited by nonlinear stochastic systems, and whether these
expectations are in fact similar to truly linear stochastic dynamics. Many key
environmental problems require stochastic population models. The proposed work
will offer ecologists new tools for interpreting data. There will be excellent
training for one post-doc, and many opportunities for
undergraduates&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
