The purpose of this research is to design and analyze discrete
algorithms&lt;br/&gt;approximating solutions to combinatorial optimization
problems.Because&lt;br/&gt;many of these problems are NP-hard,an exact solution
is often not feasible;&lt;br/&gt;in such cases approximation algorithms are a
viable alternative.In addition&lt;br/&gt;to attacking approximation problems
that seem to require new strategies,&lt;br/&gt;another main goal is to
investigate the applicability of design principles de-&lt;br/&gt;veloped
successfully for traditional discrete optimization problems to
com-&lt;br/&gt;parable tasks occurring in other areas.In any ase,a rigorous
performance&lt;br/&gt;analysis is always intended.&lt;br/&gt;A .rst focus is the
#P-complete permanent problem,which is of much&lt;br/&gt;importance in
statistical physics and combinatorics.Rough approximations&lt;br/&gt;(up to an
exponential factor)can be obtained in deterministic polynomial&lt;br/&gt;time
and possibly even mu h faster on a parallel machine.Such a
solution&lt;br/&gt;would allow to solve the outstanding bipartite matching
problem of parallel&lt;br/&gt;computing.Even though the matching problem is easy
for a sequential&lt;br/&gt;machine,it is very hallenging to coordinate the many
processors of a parallel&lt;br/&gt;machine to worksimultaneously and e .ciently
on the same matching.It is&lt;br/&gt;also proposed to attackthe parallel
matching problem with a novel version&lt;br/&gt;of more traditional network .ow
methods.&lt;br/&gt;Another theme of this proposal is the approximation of NP-
hard opti-&lt;br/&gt;mization problems by traditional methods like lo al
search,the comparison&lt;br/&gt;method,semide .nite optimization,or some
combination of these.It is even&lt;br/&gt;proposed to investigate the
approximation of some problems in P,as this&lt;br/&gt;could have interesting
applications in parallel computing.
