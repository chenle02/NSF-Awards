major recent achievements in the areas of Condensed Matter and Materials
Physics, (2) identify new opportunities, needs, and challenges facing Condensed
Matter and Materials Physics, and (3) articulate for leaders in government,
industry, universities, and the public at large the important roles played by
Condensed Matter and Materials Physics in modern society. This assessment will
be one of eight volumes comprising a larger survey with the heading Physics in a
New Era. %%% A study will be made to (1) identify major recent achievements in
