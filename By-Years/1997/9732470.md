9732470 Ramesh Risk is inevitable in management of technological innovations.
However, little information exists on the adoption of financial risk management
techniques (such as valuation of "real options") to reflect managerial
flexibility in R&D projects. In the proposed research, the applicability of
option pricing theory to real-world project management in the (recently
deregulated) electric utility industry will be tested. In particular, the real
options methodologies developed by Dixit & Pindyck, Grenadier & Weiss and by
Mitchell & Hamilton will be used to analyze selected electric utility industry
innovation management problems. A new real options methodology for evaluating
R&D investment alternatives in the utility industry is proposed. This proposed
methodology consider factors unique to utility industry including the new
competitive environment; the matured nature of technological and the danger of
employee resistance to changes in work practices, which may be necessary for
adoption of new technology. A software package that implements this methodology
will be developed. Graduate courses and seminars based on this work for the
interdisciplinary industry-oriented "energy markets" program will be introduced.
The findings and the methodology will also be adapted to other management of
innovation situations.
