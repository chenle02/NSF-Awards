This NSF Minority Post Doctoral Research Fellowship will support research and
training for a minority scholar to work in molecular anthropology, specifically
for a Y chromosome-based study on the genetic diversity of Native Peruvian
populations. The project will provide the researcher extensive training
experience in method and theory of molecular anthropology, and this training
will both complement and supplement her previous Ph.D. work at the University of
Michigan. This two-year project will be carried out primarily in the laboratory
of Dr. Anne C. Stone of the University of New Mexico, supplemented with
occasional collaborative training and technical work with Dr.B.Lizarraga,
Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, and V.Rubin, Universidad Ricardo
Palma, Lima, Peru. The proposed project is in depth study of Native Peruvian Y
chromosome genetic diversity. Specifically, the project aims to: (1)
characterize Y chromosomal genetic diversity in Native Peruvian groups via
intensive population sampling, (2) test for significant correlations between
genetic diversity measures, on the one hand, and variables that may have shaped
genetic structure of these native populations, including past demographic
events, on the other, and (3) conduct these tests on both a regional (Peruvian /
Andean) and continental (SouthAmerican) scale. The study focuses on the non-
recombining component (NRY) of the chromosome to resolve the population genetic
structure of Native Peruvian populations. Population affinity, level of genetic
diversity and gene flow will be examined using population genetic analyses. Y
chromosomal haplotypes will form the basis of these comparisons, and these will
be constructed using combinations of relatively slow mutating Single Nucleotide
Polymorphisms (SNPs) and faster mutating Short Tandem Repeats (STRs). Thus far,
Dr. Lizarraga and V. Rubin have sampled over 100 individuals from 6 populations
throughout diverse geographic areas and linguistic families for the purposes of
this project.&lt;br/&gt;
