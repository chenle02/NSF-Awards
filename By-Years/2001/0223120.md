The proposal is for an experimental and analytical investigation to improve the
understanding of evaporation mechanisms and the effects of individual forces on
fluid flow and heat transfer in thin films under high heat flux conditions. The
PI will develop an analytical model for thin film evaporation that includes
thermocapillary force, surface tension, friction, wetting, and disjoining
pressure. He will also develop an experimental system to measure film thickness,
interface velocity and film profile under high heat flux conditions. The effects
of electrostatic fields on the disjoining pressure and the effects of surface
microstructures on the thin film evaporation will also be addressed. The results
would help advance applications in a variety of emerging technologies in which
microchannel evaporative flows occur.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
