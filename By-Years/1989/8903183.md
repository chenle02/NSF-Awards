Description: This project supports the U. S. component of a cooperative project
by Dr. C. N. R. Rao, Professor, Solid State and Structural Chemistry Unit of the
Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, with Dr. John Honig, Materials Research
Center, Purdue University. The research covers development of novel oxide
materials with special focus on high temperature superconductors. The work
includes synthesis of interesting oxide systems and examination of structure-
property relations. It also includes the discovery of new classes of oxides with
unusual electronic and magnetic properties, including the very inportant
property of superconductivity at relatively high temperatures. This project is a
renewal of research that Drs. Honig and Rao carried under earlier NSF grants.
Scope: The collaboration of Professor Rao's team at Bangalore and Professor
Honig's team at Purdue has been successful and resulted in a significant number
of publications. Rao is one of India's most distinguished scientists. He has
done pioneering research in numerous areas of materials and structural
chemistry. It is likely that this project will result in significant advances in
the field of new materials and better material characterization. Dr. Honig is a
participant in a newly established Indiana Center for Innovative
Superconductivity Technology, which was provided $500,000 for the first year of
operation by the State of Indiana. His work with Dr. Rao would fit well with the
objectives of that center, and with enhancing materials science research in the
U. S.
