Iowa State University will initiate a 4-week residential Young Scholars project
for 20 students in grades 8-9 in molecular biology. This four-week enrichment
program in molecular biology stresses both content instruction and science
practice through laboratory experimentation utilizing research techniques and
equipment. Twenty 8th and 9th graders will spend a minimum of 20 hours a week in
the laboratory, carrying out experiments and developing research skills.
Lectures covering relevant topics in chemistry, biochemistry, cellular and
molecular biology, and biotechnology provide the background for the laboratory
sessions. Participants design, execute, and present the results of an
independent project in a public forum. Career exploration is emphasized through
interactions with scientists, visits to industrial laboratories, and career
planning exercises. Participants are encouraged to continue independent study
through a quarterly newsletter. Research incentive grants are available and
assistance is given in presenting papers at science fairs and symposia.
