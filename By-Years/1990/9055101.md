Ferrum College will initiate a three-week, residential Young Scholars project
in Aquatic Ecology for 30 students entering grade 8. The students will be
involved in a research project on leaf decomposition in streams. This aquatic
ecology project will develop knowledge and skills in biology, chemistry,
statistics, and computer use. During the three-week session participants will
also learn about the discipline area, research work, and career path of active
scientists in aquatic ecology and other fields.
