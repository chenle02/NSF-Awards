Computing hardware in the Department of Astronomy at Cornell University
supports diverse research in theoretical and observational space science and
astrophysics. At present the local SUN-based network includes an obsolete server
and obsolete 3/50 workstations that must be replaced. Increased network traffic
requires purchase of an additional terminal server. An extra hard disk drive is
needed to handle the data processing of large data sets using AIPS, IRAF, and
other software packages.
