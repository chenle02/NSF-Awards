This is a post Loma Prieta earthquake (Oct. 1989) investigation project in
learning from this damaging event. The thrust of this project is to evaluate the
performance of university buildings located at the campus of the University of
California at San Francisco (UCSF) from the damage observations and seismic
behavior analysis. The UCSF campus has gradually grown over the years to now
encompass 80 buildings located throughout San Francisco. As such the campus
exhibits a wide range of building types and standards and, in addition, strong
motion records are available for this site from the California Division of Mines
and Geology, thus making it ideally suited for this evaluation. Several
buildings of different types will be chosen for detailed evaluations. Evaluation
methods from the Applied Technology Council ATC-14 document will be employed to
perform consistent, realistic, cost effective assessments of the performance
during the Loma Prieta earthquake of the existing buildings against their
standards of record. Observed damage, causes of any failures, likely building
responses, actual and potential life-safety hazards, and capacity/demand margins
for the Loma Prieta and future earthquakes with respect to UCSF buildings will
be identified and discussed. These findings will be extended to behavior of
university buildings in general with respect to their standard code of record in
a final report to be issued at project completion. The building stock of a
variety of construction types and ages will enable the seismic performance of
older buildings be evaluated and the associated generic potential life-safety
hazards be rectified.
