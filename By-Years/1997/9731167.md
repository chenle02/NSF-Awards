AST-9731167 ABSTRACT Funds will be used for development of the Phase Diverse
Speckle (PDS) technique for the post-detection correction of aberration of solar
images due to atmospheric fluctuations. The effort will extend the utility of
the PDS technique to narrow-band, polarimetric, and spectroscopic data sets.
Novel reconstruction algorithms that employ optimal and unified estimators will
be developed by analogy to current PDS algorithms. In addition, refinements to
current algorithms with regard to regularization (suppression of noise
amplification), space-variant blur, and time-series processing will be made.
