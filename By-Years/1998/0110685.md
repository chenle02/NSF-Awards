This award, made to the University of Utah in support of Professor Joel Miller's
research is supported by the Advanced Materials Program in the Chemistry
Division. The research deals with the design, synthesis, characterization and
properties of metalloporphyrin-based magnetic materials.The broad goals of the
research are to understand the fundamental science that governs behavior in
organic-based magnets, to identify new magnetic phenomena, and to to make
organic-based magnets with enhanced and controllable critical temperatures and
coercive fields. The research will elucidate structure-function relationships in
the one dimensional manganeseporphyrin-tetracyanoethylene system including the
role of the metal atoms, the pressure dependence, the photomagnetic response and
the role of spins on the periphery of the porphyrin ligand. The one dimensional
systems will be extended to two and three dimensions by covalent bonding and by
supramolecular hydrogen bonded manganotetraphenylporphyrins. New types of
magnets will be prepared based on new classes of radical-ion acceptors capable
of binding two manganese moieties. A feature of the research will be extensive
collaborations with experts for structural and performance measurements and for
computational modeling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will provide a
fundamental understanding of magnetic behavior in molecular and supramolecular
organic magnets as well as provide more temperature-stable, higher field
magnets. Soluble molecular magnets will advance thin film magneto-optical
applications. Collaborations with international chemists and physicists will
provide strong interdisciplinary training for students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
