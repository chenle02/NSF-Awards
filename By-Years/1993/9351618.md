Josefson 9351618 The project will purchase Silicon Graphics Indigo Workstations,
along with the software packages, SYBLL and SPARTAN. This equipment will allow
calculations on real molecules as the basis for teaching principles in the
inorganic, P-chem, and biochemistry courses. Among other applications, we will
use ab initio and semi-empirical calculations to investigate the nature of the
chemical bond. Real-time graphics will allow students to visualize wave
functions, electrostatic potential maps, orbital symmetries, and molecular
motions, making these abstract principles more concrete. Basing these courses on
calculations and visualization of real molecules could begin a major shift in
the way students learn course principles, providing an innovative alternative
for other undergraduate teachers. ***
