This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
will assist the Department of Chemistry at the University of Arizona in the
purchase of a cluster of IBM workstations. This equipment will enhance research
in a number of areas including the following: theoretical chemistry, NMR,
crystallography and molecular modeling. %%% A workstation network of fast,
modern computer workstations is a new way to satisfy the computing needs of
chemistry departments. Such a "computer network" also serves as a development
environment for new theoretical codes and algorithms, provides state-of-the-art
graphics and visualization facilities and supports research in state-or-the-art
applications of parallel processing.
