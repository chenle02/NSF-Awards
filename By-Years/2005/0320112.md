This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will study the
feasibility of the development of a low cost infrared sensor for the monitoring
and detection of ethylene oxide (ETO). ETO is widely used in the chemical
industry as a feedstock chemical, and is most commonly used as a sterilant gas
in hospitals and related facilities. ETO is very toxic to humans (the OSHA TWA-
TLV is 1 ppm), and is also a suspected carcinogen. Currently, the two most
frequently used methods for monitoring ETO in the workplace are electrochemical
gas sensors and gas chromatography (GC), both of which have several drawbacks
and neither adequately meet the current federal regulations. In this research, a
low cost monitoring and detection sensor based on infrared spectroscopy will be
developed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators fully expect the commercial
version of the sensor will not only benefit the medical industry, but will also
have potential benefits in the safety, industrial, and chemical industries where
gas detection and monitoring are critical for worker safety.
