ABSTRACT This research is focused on the relation between stress, cortisol
release (a physiological indicator of stress), and measures of behavioral
distress in infants. It promises to produce new data on this relationship, for
although research on the relation between stress and cortisol has been a part of
the infant research literature for many years, such research has not included
behavioral measures. Intensity of discomfort and cortisol release has also been
studied in past research, but again, the behavioral correlates have been
neglected. Bringing standardized behavioral observations into the study of
infant stress promises to provide a better understanding of the factors that
influence infants' stress reactions. This program of research promises much
information on the relationship between stress and physiological and behavioral
reactions to it. Studied over varying stress intensities, and over children of
different ages, the study promises to tell us much about the effects of stress
on infants. This information is important both theoretically and practically,
and will enrich our understanding of fundamental developmental processes in
infancy. ***//
