This award will provide one-half the funds needed to acquire a spinner
magnetometer to be installed and operated in the Department of Geology at
Occidental College. The College is committed to providing the remaining funds
necessary for this acquisition. The instrument will be used primarily by the
Principal Investigator and his undergraduate students who are actively engaged
in research on the variation of the intensity of the Earth's magnetic field
during magnetic polarity reversals in the past as recorded in rock magnetism.
