This research project is concerned with the problem of efficient, interactive
and approximate similarity search in high-dimensional data sets. Large
repositories of high dimensional data are central to a vast array of disciplines
and applications, and the degree to which they can be exploited depends
critically on the availability of efficient and smart tools for search and
retrieval, analysis, and mining. The methodology involves approaches whose
origins lie in several disciplines beside classical data management, including
optimization, information theory, pattern recognition and signal compression.
One line of attack hinges on the concept of approximate (rather than exact
nearest neighbor) search which enables explicit search complexity-accuracy
tradeoff analysis and includes: (a) the derivation of new accuracy criteria for
effective tradeoff calculation; and (b) joint optimization techniques to design
combined clustering and compression in the feature space as a framework for
direct optimization of the search complexity-accuracy tradeoff. A second line of
attack is concerned with interactive search involving relevance feedback from
the users. It develops reduced complexity search techniques for relevance
feedback mechanisms. The final phase of the project merges the two main thrusts
to develop an efficient interactive approximate search system that optimizes the
complexity-accuracy tradeoff. The project is inherently interdisciplinary and
the advances made in it are expected to impact numerous disciplines where high-
dimensional databases are of importance, as well as various areas of human
endeavor -- scientific, medical, social, arts, entertainment, security, and
more. The project Web site (http://www.scl.ece.ucsb.edu/html/prmdb_1.htm) is be
