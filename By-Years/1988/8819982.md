Olfactory communication plays a major role in the social systems of most
mammals, yet the complex functional nature of mammalian pheromones is not well
understood. Pheromones are chemicals vented by an individual of a species which
when encountered by another individual of the same species results in behavioral
and/or physiological changes. Although major economic advantages have been
realized through research on insect pheromonal systems, further understanding of
the communication mechanisms are necessary to provide the basis for practical
applications in mammals. Indeed Dr. Muller-Schwarze will use wild species that
are considered as pests in North America as his experimental animals to examine
the function of pheromone secretions in the complexity of their natural
environment. Along with Dr. Webster, he will isolate and identify the major
constituents of the "territorial" pheromone. Changes in the chemical
compositions of these pheromones will be tracked by season and for individuals
of different sexes and ages. Dr. Muller-Schwarze will analyze the behavior of
these free-living mammals exposed to various mixtures of components. The goal is
to elucidate how chemical signals modulate mammalian behavior and which
chemicals are responsible for what response. These studies will not only
contribute to a general functional understanding of mammalian pheromonal systems
but the specific knowledge gained can be applied as a management tool with
mammalian species considered as pests.
