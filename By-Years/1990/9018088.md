Three different aspects of plant peroxisome biogenesis will be pursued: (1),
the means by which the expanding membrane of oilseed glyoxysomes acquires its
protein and lipid is an integral part of the organelle biogenesis. The
hypothesis will be tested that lipid bodies contribute membrane lipid to
differentiating oilseed glyoxysomes; (2), parameters and conditions necessary
and/or sufficient for recognition and tranlocation in vivo of malate synthase,
isocitrate lyase and catalase into peroxisomes of cultured monkey kidney and
selected plant cells will be determined; (3) studies will continue on
deciphering patterns of regulation and developmental expression of catalase
isoforms during the changeover from glyoxysomes to leaf-type peroxisomes, and of
isocitrate lyase and malate synthase during glyoxysome differentiation in
maturing and germinated seeds. The availability of an embryo culture system is
expected to provide a unique means to help resolve regulation patterns within
maturing seeds. Peroxisomes occur in virtually all eukaryotic cells, conducting
a variety of essential metabolic functions depending on the cell type in which
they reside. They are not capable of synthesizing their own phospholipids or
proteins, and are therefore dependent upon the selective and complicated
intracellular trafficking mechanisms responsible for their biogenesis. The
objectives of this proposal are to examine the molecular and biochemical bases
of selected, interrelated aspects of peroxisome biogenesis; the emphasis will be
on cottonseed glyoxysomes.
