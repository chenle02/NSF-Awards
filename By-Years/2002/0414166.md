Symposium P: Nanoscale Materials and Modeling-Relations Among Processing,
Microsructure and Mechanical Properties&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2004 Materials
Research Society Spring Meeting&lt;br/&gt;San Francisco Moscone
West&lt;br/&gt;San Francisco, CA&lt;br/&gt;April 12-16,
2004&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of
this symposium will address the relations among synthesis, structures, and
mechanical properties of nanoscale materials, studied using experiments and/or
modeling. The focus will be on new phenomena observed in nanostructured
materials when the characteristic length scales (such as grain size or layer
thickness) approach nanometer dimensions. The spectrum of invited speakers was
chosen to draw in the leading edge in this field with the newest results, and
the sessions cover topics ranging from metals to biologically-derived materials.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The impact of this
symposium will be to foster new awareness and interaction between researchers in
this emerging field, and particularly expose new researchers (via this funding)
to the established members of the community. The goal is to advance knowledge in
the area of structure-property relationships in nanomaterials, be able to use
this information in conjunction with advanced processing techniques, and to
design nanomaterials with desired advanced mechanical
properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
