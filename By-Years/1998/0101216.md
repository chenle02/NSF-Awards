This project focuses on a study of strong optical superradiance that utilizes
cold ytterbium atoms contained within a magneto-optical trap and a short-memory-
time optical cavity. Strong superradiance comprises the regime of radiative
decay where correlations within a material sample lead to radiative energy
damping on time scales substantially different from the natural lifetime of the
constituent quantum systems. The use of the short-memory-time cavity accelerates
the time scale on which superradiance occurs within a specific atomic sample
while leaving the system dynamics otherwise unchanged. As a result, strong
superradiance can be observed in optically thin atomic samples and therefore in
the absence of intra-sample field propagation effects. The use of cavity
acceleration and essentially non-dephasing atomic ytterbium provides the first
experimental opportunity to demonstrate and investigate strong superradiance
under conditions similar to those assumed in original descriptions.
