&lt;br/&gt;This award is for the acquisition the following equipment: an MTS
structural test system and ARAMIS three dimensional non-contact deformation and
strain measurement system. The acquisition of these structural testing
components will enable the Structures and Computational Mechanics laboratory at
Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology (RHIT) to undertake fundamental and applied
research in the area of structures and mechanics of new and promising materials.
This will be done in collaboration with industry and/or government institutions.
Most importantly, the research activities will propel some of the best
undergraduate students into the advanced degree pipeline so that the United
States can stay competitive with the rest of the
world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Successful acquisition of this equipment will
benefit RHIT, the Civil and Mechanical Engineering departments, and the students
and faculty members involved. The following are the anticipated impacts of our
proposal: recruitment of RHIT students to graduate school, enhanced
quality/marketability of RHIT students for the job market, improved curricula,
faculty development, and improved laboratory capabilities at RHIT. Additionally,
RHIT can undertake outreach programs with the goal of attracting under-
represented students into the fields of science, math and engineering. The
proposed research use of this equipment will contribute directly to improving
the performance of the built infrastructure and also lead to a better
understanding of the anisotropic material properties of fiber reinforced polymer
composites. Finally, planned research use of this equipment will also further
the development of a nationally accepted fracture toughness testing standard for
concrete.&lt;br/&gt;
