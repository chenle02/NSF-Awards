ABSTRACT The receipient has been chosen for a National Science Foundation
Presidential Faculty Fellow Award. The receipient will continue his research in
the transport of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur through Arctic tundra
ecosystems to include both physical and geochemichal transport mechanisms and
pathways. These studies will lead to a better understanding of broad
environmental problems such as acid rain, eutrophication, species introductions,
and climate change. The research will lead to a predictative capability for
ecosystem function to show how organisms react to each other and to human-
imposed change. Fundamental questions about geochemical cycling within organisms
at both the regional and global scales will be examined. A novel technique
involving the use of stable isotopes will be applied at the scale of entire
ecosystems and will be used to estimate the current carbon balance in arctic
ecosystems. Determination of the processes controlling the current carbon
balance will allow the principal investigator to predict the changes that may
occur during forecasted climate change in the arctic.
