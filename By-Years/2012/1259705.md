The Environmental Scholars Program is supporting three cohorts of academically
talented students with demonstrated financial need in attaining baccalaureate
degrees in chemistry, environmental forest biology, environmental resources
engineering and environmental science at the SUNY College of Environmental
Science and Forestry. In addition to scholarship aid, the project is engaging
scholars through a series of activities with a unifying theme of global
environmental change, including cross-disciplinary and career-preparation
seminars, service-learning projects which emphasize science communication, and
capstone research experiences. The intellectual merit of the project lies in its
comprehensive plan to support scholars through a rigorous cross-disciplinary
academic program in an area of national need. Broader impacts include leveraging
partnerships to support energetic recruiting for a diverse talent pool and to
provide internship and career-advancement opportunities to connect graduates
with the STEM workforce and graduate programs.
