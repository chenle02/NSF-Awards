0203865&lt;br/&gt;Mason&lt;br/&gt; Problems on the asymptotic behavior of
functionals of the empirical distribution have long attracted the interest of
probabilists and have led to the development of new methods and theory that have
enriched both mathematical statistics and probability theory. A classic example
is the problem of the asymptotic distribution of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov
statistic, which ultimately led to the development of the theory of weak
convergence and strong approximations. Over the next few years the investigator
plans to concentrate his efforts on large sample theory problems connected with
particular functionals of the empirical distribution. These include the L1-norm
density estimator process, integral functionals of density estimators and local
empirical and U-statistics processes.&lt;br/&gt; The anticipated results should
have potential use in the development of a class of practical goodness-of-fit
techniques and statistical estimators. In fact, these investigations have
already given rise to a number of new methods to assess and describe in an
intelligent way the behavior of the underlying mechanism that generates natural
phenomena.&lt;br/&gt;
