In this project researchers will perform a synthesis motivated by findings at
individual flux tower sites that extreme weather and climate events (e.g.,
droughts, floods, hurricanes, and ice-storms) lead to pronounced and protracted
anomalies in key components of the measured local carbon and water budgets. The
PIs will assess the degree of commonality across flux tower sites in the
response of the ecosystem to extreme events, derive a coherent description of
these responses, and use remote sensing data to extrapolate spatially coherent
and persistent impacts on ecosystems, specifically on vegetation, that
subsequently may impact carbon and water balances and climate trajectories on a
larger spatial scale. The PIs will also assess the ability of land surface
models spanning a wide range of complexity to simulate the observed response of
terrestrial state variables and fluxes to extreme events when driven by observed
meteorology. The project is composed entirely of a team of early-career
scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work is supported under the NSF Carbon and
Water in the Earth System solicitation, an interdisciplinary funding opportunity
from the Directorate of Geosciences.
