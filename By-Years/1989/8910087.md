This research will seek to elucidate the interaction between the biophysical
chemistry of proteins and the adsorption surfaces used in ion-exchange
separations. The study will take a structural, molecular-scale approach through
the use of genetic engineering to produce charge-altered forms of a single test
protein of known structure. The variation of adsorption isotherm and adsorption
thermodynamics resulting from each systematic change in charge groups on the
surface of the protein will provide a direct test of the involvement of each
protein residue in the adsorption of the protein. Ion Exchange chromatography
has already emerged as an important tool in biotechnology. Many of the phenomena
related to the adsorption of proteins on ion exchange resins are poorly
understood, however, including the tendency of the adsorption process to
partially damage the protein, which reduces its usefulness. By using genetic
engineering to modify only small regions of the surface of the protein, this
project should make a major contribution to the fundamental understanding of the
ion exchange of proteins.
