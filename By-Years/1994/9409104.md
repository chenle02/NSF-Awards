9409104 Regan This research will analyze computational problems which are
solvable in linear time, or which belong to very small uniform circuit classes.
Linear time has not received nearly as much attention as the concept of
polynomial time, and has been considered to lack a good machine model. Previous
work has developed the "Block Move" (BM) model, which is a significant extension
of the "Block Transfer" (BT) model of Aggarwal, Chandra, and Snir, and showed
the BM to have good properties of robustness and universal simulation for linear
time, and to characterize some of the low-level circuit classes. The present
work will use new tools given by the BM for nonlinear lower bounds on time and
for deeper analysis of low-level complexity classes. The BM treats "random"
access to data as having tangible cost, as observed with real machines, and
quantifies memory latency and tangible cost, as observed with real machines, and
quantifies memory latency and communication delays between processors and data.
The question of how much random access is needed to solve a problem is related
to older classic problems of determinism versus nondeterminism. A new approach
to lower bounds is to be pursued further, this work will analyze computational
problems in terms of information structures apart from particular machine
models. ***
