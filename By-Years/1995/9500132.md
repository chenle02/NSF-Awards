9500132 Gutowski This research builds on prior work done on double diaphragm
forming process of polymer matrix composite. That research had led to the
understanding of stress build up in a simple, small scale part. Scaling up to
complex, large (e.g.: airplane wings) is the subject of this research. A major
barrier is the onset of laminate wrinkling in very large parts made of aligned
fiber polymer matrix composite. In order to understand the source of through
thickness stress distributions, actual through thickness deformation patterns
will be followed through medical imaging techniques. In a separate industry
funded research, attempts will be made to measure in-situ laminate stresses
which when combined with the basic understanding from this research may lead to
a closed loop control over the deformation sequence to avoid laminate wrinkling.
Effective strategies for automating advanced composites manufacture are needed
by aerospace companies who are eager to take advantage of the enormous design
freedom afforded by composites in primary structures. But, the cost of doing so
is a major barrier. Effective forming techniques can reduce cycle times
dramatically, and are capable of producing a wide range of part geometries.
Because of the range of part shapes that are either being produced or are under
consideration for aerospace application, a flexible process is required. This
work is aimed at developing innovative techniques of making defect free parts at
a fraction of current cost. This research has the potential to be extended into
medical technology as well. ***
