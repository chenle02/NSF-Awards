The goals of this project are to improve the understanding of key issues in
galaxy formation and evolution, especially the origin of the structure of dark
matter halos and the evolution of their baryonic contents. It will address the
questions that have arisen concerning cold dark matter (CDM) type models by
developing analytic and semi-analytic treatments based on, and tested against,
high-resolution simulations. These will provide detailed predictions of galaxy
properties at both high and low redshifts, to be compared to space and ground
based data especially from the Deep Extragalactic Evolutionary Probe (DEEP)
program. These simulations feature use of the Adaptive Refinement Tree (ART)
technique, which adjusts the resolution automatically to follow particles in
dense regions, and can now use particles of different masses to improve mass and
force resolution. This permits the identification of all dark matter halos that
can harbor bright galaxies. In addition the project will use a second tool,
Semi-Analytic Merging (SAM) to model the outcomes of various star formation and
feedback scenarios in CDM galaxy formation. These SAM models will be used to
study the structural and chemical evolution of galaxies, including gas cooling,
star formation, supernova feedback, satellite merging, and the effects of dust.
They model dust emission, and allow the prediction of galaxy counts and
integrated backgrounds over wavelengths from the far-UV to the sub-mm. These
predictions will be invaluable for interpreting data from previous and planned
space missions such as COBE, SIRTF, GALEX, etc. The computer codes for the ART
and SAM models will be made available to the public. .***
