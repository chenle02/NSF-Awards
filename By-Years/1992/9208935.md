The loss of nitrogen from coastal ecosystems through denitrification is
believed to be a major sink for nitrogen, particularly in eutrophic
environments. The focus of this project is a thick macroalgal canopy that
carpets the bottom of Waquoit Bay, a eutrophic embayment on Cape Cod, MA. The
macroalgal canopy frequently exceeds a thickness of 15 cm. Within the upper
third of the dense mat, O2 concentrations are high during the day due to
photosynthesis and NH4+ concentrations are low (several uM). In contrast, the
lower portion of the canopy is anaerobic even during the day and NH4+
concentrations are very high (hundreds of uM). Therefore, within a zone about 5
cm from the algal surface conditions are favorable for nitrification with
sufficient O2 from photosynthesis and diffusion from above and NH4+ diffusing
from below. It is hypothesized that high rates of denitrification may occur at
the high NH+4/low O2 interface within the algal canopy due to the existence of
denitrification-nitrification coupling in this zone. The hypothesized
interaction is in fact a triple coupling of photosynthesis-nitrification-
denitrification. This hypothesis will be examined in a series of experiments to
be conducted at the Marine Biological Lab in Woods Hole, MA, a facility close by
to Waquoit Bay. The project will evaluate nitrification and denitrification in
specially constructed chambers containing sediment, algal canopy material, and
overlying water. These questions relate directly to ongoing work at Waquoit Bay
which is one of the current sites under investigation through the Land Margin
Ecosystem Research Program (LMER) and the measurements obtained will be an
important input into the nitrogen budget of this system.
