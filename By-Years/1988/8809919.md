Reasoning about the operational behavior of programs written in languages whose
parallelism is implicit can be difficult. This is true for purely functional
languages, logic programming languages, and even imperative languages such as
Fortran (when used with a vectorizing compiler). Research is proposed to study
formal methods for expressing the operational semantics of parallel (and in
particular functional) programs. More specifically, an investigation of the
suitability of pomsets for this purpose is proposed. A symbiotic goal is the use
of the formal tools to reason about and guide the design of meta- linguistic
devices (such as annotations) to refine operational behavior. The research
includes addressing deficiencies in previous pomset semantics; applying pomsets
in new operational setting; the development of a notion of systems semantics to
capture program, compiler, and machine; and the development of abstraction
techniques to allow compile-time inferencing of operational behavior.
