The crust-magma interface in basaltic lava lakes occurs at a crystallinity of
about 55%, which marks the transition from rigid, albeit partially molten, crust
to viscous magmatic suspension. Most of the original temperature contrast
between the magma and its enclosure occurs within this crust with the remainder
occurring within a few meters of the advancing solidification front (i.e.
crust/magma interface). The potential bouyancy available for large scale
convection is thus limited by this reduced temperature contrast and length
scale. The ensuing Rayleigh number is about 1010 times smaller than previously
thought. The overall style of convection is not one of turbulence. The PI will
investigate the dynamic and petrologic evolution of a sheet-like magmatic body
cooling from either only the top or from both the top and bottom. The overall
theme extends present and previous investigations by B. Marsh, G. Brandeis, and
C. Jaupart. The critical issue of investigation is the dynamic interplay between
crystallization attending advancement of the crust-magma interface and small
scale convection in the suspension zone, just inward of the advancing crust.
