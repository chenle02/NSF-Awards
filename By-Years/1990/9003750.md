Yeast provides an excellent system for the study of Golgi secretory function
because of its tractability to genetic, molecular, biochemical, and cell
biological analyses. This project focuses on the role of SEC14p, the protein
gene product of the SEC14 gene identified previously as being required for
normal yeast secretory activity. Prior work under NSF support has shown that
SEC14p is a cytosolic protein, which somehow is required for export of proteins
from the lumen of the Golgi. Also, extragenic suppressors of sec14-ts have been
characterized. The long-term goal of the project is to understand, at the
molecular level, how the secretory process functions. The specific aim of the
proposed research is to identify and characterize the specific membrane
compartment of the Golgi apparatus which is involved in the function of SEC14p.
This study will involve enrichment of the compartment from temperature-sensitive
sec14 mutants by biochemical means, and immuno-identification of these
compartments using antibodies against various gene products known (from genetic
analyses) to be involved in SEC14p function. The function of the Golgi in the
secretory process is an important question relevant to several disciplines of
the life sciences. These studies will make an important contribution to this
area of research.
