The Northwest Center for Sustainable Resources (NCSR) project is a
collaborative effort of Northwest high schools, community colleges, higher
education institutions, private industry, government agencies, and Native
American tribes and of applied international research groups to create a
comprehensive center of innovative educational programs to support the efforts
of agencies, industry, and business for ecosystem restoration and natural
resource management. Program completers will enter employment as advanced
technicians in a variety of science-based occupations targeting sustaining and
restoring our natural resources or who can continue for advanced degrees.
Associate degree programs in diverse natural resource and environmental fields
will be created or undergo major curricular revisions to incorporate a central
focus on aquatic/terrestrial ecosystems. Secondary schools and colleges and
universities will complete the conduit that will provide a seamless delivery of
basic scientific content, principles and process culminating with hands-on
applications, accomplishing major systemic change. Internships in industries and
agencies will provide the fertile ground to produce a workforce capable of
contributing to a unified approach to restoration, environmental clean-up,
watershed enhancement, sustainable forestry and fisheries, and habitat
restoration. The Center programs will provide innovative, transportable models
for developing problem solving, communication, and collaborative skills that
match the requirements of an advanced scientific, technologic workforce
necessary to transform the workplace to high performance. The NCSR will provide
a model for collaborative efforts to address urgent regional, national, and
global needs while acting as a national center of excellence for advanced
technological education through its comprehensive dissemination activities. An
electronic national clearinghouse, published instructional materials, and two
national teleconferelces assure wide national impact.
