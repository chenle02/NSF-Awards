Eggers The long range focus of this research is on improving the performance of
parallel programs. One thrust uses compiler technology to obtain better
multiprocessor cache performance, i.e., reduce the amount of sharing-related bus
traffic. The initial phase of that work is the detection of false sharing and
measuring its impact on cache miss ratios and bus utilization. Another area of
investigation is measuring the amount and type of program level parallelism in
nonscientific parallel programs and determining the levels of hardware
parallelism that best execute them. The current focus of the research is in the
following areas: 1. Compiler reorganization of shared data; 2. Runtime code
generation; and 3. A protection model for a single address space architecture.
