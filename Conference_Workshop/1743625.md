This National Science Foundation award provides support for the CBMS Conference:
Additive Combinatorics from a Geometric Viewpoint, to be held at the University
of South Carolina during May 21-25, 2018. The main speaker at this conference is
Dr. Jozsef Solymosi from the University of British Columbia, one of the leading
researchers in this area. The interaction at this event is expected to establish
new partnerships and strengthen existing connections between researchers at
other southeastern universities and those at the University of South Carolina.
Moreover, a focused lecture series summing up current research in additive
combinatorics in an accessible way substantially contributes to the professional
development of the participants who will include Ph.D. students and junior
researchers, as well as faculty from small colleges and teaching institutions,
offering them valuable opportunities to enter collaborative networks.
Recruitment from groups that are underrepresented in the mathematical sciences
is a priority for the PIs.

The impact of additive combinatorics in general mathematics and theoretical
computer science is enormous.  The geometric viewpoint involves turning
arithmetic problems into geometric problems, which can then be solved by
geometric means - including discrete geometry, convex geometry, and some
algebraic geometry. An archetypal example of this approach is Elekes' bound on
the sum-product problem using the Szemeredi-Trotter theorem on the number of
incidences between points and lines. Participants will see that arithmetic,
algebra, combinatorics and geometry are intimately connected in unexpected ways.
Dr. Solymosi's lectures will culminate in a monograph that will provide an
accessible reference to graduate students, and fill a literature gap in an area
where many results are found only in highly technical journal publications. The
