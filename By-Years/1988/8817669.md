This is an MRI Planning grant proposal which will develop a plan to manipulate
coral transplants and observe their regeneration to artificial injuries under
different field situations. During the planning period, the PI will carry out a
computer library search on the following three subjects for the last five years:
a) Cnidarian - zooxanthellae relationships b) tissue regeneration in cnidarians
c) systematics of zooxanthellal Activities directly related to the proposed
research include: a) study site selection b) design of the transplant set-up,
and c) experimental design
