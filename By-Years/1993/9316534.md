9316534 Williamson Recent global decreases in stratospheric ozone induced
largely by anthropogenic release of chlorofluorocarbons have led to a
corresponding increase in ultraviolet radiation that is potentially damaging to
natural ecosystems. While the most serious changes have been in polar regions,
little is known about how either freshwater ecosystems or higher trophic levels
may respond to changes in ultraviolet radiation. This workshop will proposed to
gather international experts in ultraviolet-B radiation and freshwater
ecosystems. The workshop will assemble scientists to assess what is known and
what needs to be known about how ultraviolet-B radiation influences freshwater
ecosystems. A priority list of critical research objectives with a special focus
on higher trophic levels will be developed. The meeting will evaluate current
instrumentation and biological dosimeter techniques for quantifying
ultraviolet-B radiation in the water column, provide a special lecture series to
students and faculty from area universities, and encourage collaboration from
different disciplines, countries, and regions. The proceedings will be published
as a special volume of the journal Archiv fur Hydrobiologia. ***
