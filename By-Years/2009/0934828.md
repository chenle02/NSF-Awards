This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This engineering education research
award to VA Polytechnic Inst &amp; State University will study the development
of engineering design thinking in undergraduate engineering students using
innovations in cognitive science and new methods of analysis. The study will
take place over three years at two engineering schools, George Mason and
Virginia Polytechnic and State University. The techniques to be used will be
drawn from design theory, cognitive science, mathematical modeling and
information theory plus engineering education research. The understanding of the
relationship between design teaching and student learning is far from complete
and the results from this project will help to fill the gap. The results will be
presented at technical conferences and published in professional journals. The
goal is to better prepare students for the practice of engineering through more
effective development of their design talents. The results will increase
student?s interest in engineering and will enhance the number of students who
complete engineering degrees and are ready to fill engineering jobs.
