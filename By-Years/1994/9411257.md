9411257 Stann This Americas Program award will support a workshop, organized by
the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), to assess
priorities for implementing the 1993 United Nations Convention on Biological
Diversity. The workshop will be the first phase of a project to work
cooperatively with the nations of the hemisphere in implementing the Convention,
and will bring together leading members of the biodiversity community of the
Western Hemisphere with other science leaders of the region. The meeting will
take place in Manaus, Brazil, in June 1994. The Convention on Biological
Diversity has placed numerous requirements on signatory nations to develop
comprehensive strategies for conservation related to economic and social
development. The workshop will entail the preparation of complete status reports
reflecting the readiness of the countries' infrastructure, education and
training, and funding resources to carry out national biodiversity conservation
strategies. An expected outcome of the workshop is the promotion of biodiversity
collaborative research in the region. ***
