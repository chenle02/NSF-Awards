9418384 Kimbrough The Mesozoic to Recent tectonic history of western North
America involved subductions, arrival and translations of terranes due to
oblique relative plate motions, uplift and sedimentation, rotation and final
amalgamations to North America. Within this framework many discrepancies exist
between paleomagnetic data and geologic data concerning amount of origin
parallel displacement and the timing of those displacements, as well as
difference in models of uplift of batholiths and the fate of this erosion
products. This project will focus on syn-orogenic conglomerate shed from the
rising peninsular ranges batholiths into forearc basins. Distinctive geologic
and geochemical characteristics of the batholiths will be used to specify source
areas for the forearc basins. Results will greatly increase the geological basis
for discriminating between "fixist" vs. "mobilist" models for orogen- parallel
transport of terranes outboard of the batholiths, and should help tip the scales
on several unresloved problems of the California border lands.
