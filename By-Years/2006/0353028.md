A grant has been awarded to John C. Price for the development of a cryogenic
parametric charge amplifier with improved sensitivity for biological mass
spectrometry applications. A current major trend in biological mass spectrometry
is extension to the megadalton mass range through the use of electrospray and
laser desorption ionization techniques. Many studies of importance to
biotechnology,medical diagnosis, and molecular biology are possible in this mass
range,including the identification of intact viruses and study of
protein/nucleic acid complexes. Soft ionization techniques produce megadalton
ions with tens to thousands of elementary charges and a broad charge
distribution. Existing mass spectrometers only measure the mass-to-charge
ratio,and in many situations it is not possible to resolve or identify the
individual charge states,so that multiple charging places severe limits on mass
resolution. This problem can addressed by charge detection mass spectrometry
(CD-MS), a technique in which ions are passed through a Faraday tube connected
to a sensitive charge amplifier, so that the charge may be directly measured on
individual ions. However, CD-MS is limited by the poor resolution of existing
charge amplifiers, not better than about 50 electrons root-mean-square (e- rms).
This research project will develop a new type of cryogenic parametric charge
amplifier with improved sensitivity for CD-MS applications.
