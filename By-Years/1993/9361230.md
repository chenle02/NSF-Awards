9361230 Ting Beryllium is a candidate material for applications requiring low
density, strength, and/or thermal performance, such as space structures, heat
shields, radiators, and nuclear fusion reactor first wall components. However,
the use of beryllium is limited by its moderate thermal conductivity and
brittleness, both of which result in a low thermal shock fracture toughness.
This also places a limitation on the thickness of a beryllium component, which
can impose limits in lifetime for application such as Be plasma facing tiles. It
is proposed to develop a graphite-fiber-reinforced beryllium composite which
will manifest the advantages of both beryllium and carbon/carbon composites, and
which will ameliorate the disadvantages of either one. A preliminary experiment
has suggested the advantages of using highly graphitic fiber to eliminate or
reduce interface reaction. The graphite fiber proposed for use is vapor grown
carbon fiber (VGCF), which is the most graphitic fiber know to be available. In
the proposed fabricate the composites. Effort will be directed toward examining
interphase formation, if any, between VGCF and Be, and demonstrating a VGCF/Be
composite with improved thermal and mechanical properties. ***
