One of the most enduring problems of prime number theory is to determine how
many elements remain when a set of numbers is sieved. There is a large
literature on this topic, originating in seminal papers of Viggo Brun in 1914,
but even today the best known bounds are either not optimal or not proved to be
optimal. By starting with a simple sieving situation and then moving
incrementally to more complicated configurations, it is hoped that optimal
bounds can be found, accompanied by proofs of optimality. The past work on the
PI on the pair correlation of the zeros of the Riemann zeta function has been
interpreted as providing evidence that the zeros are spectral in nature. The
Pair Correlation Conjecture itself is equivalent to an assertion concerning the
mean square distribution of primes in short intervals. In new work with k.
Soundararajan, it is proposed to extend the second moment heuristics to other
moments, and hence develop heuristics concerning the distribution function of
primes in short intervals. It is hope that this new information, when
interpreted in terms of zeros of the zeta function, will provide further
insights concerning the distribution of the zeros, including the Riemann
Hypothesis.

The seemingly irregular distribution of prime numbers has been a puzzle to
mathematicians for many centuries. In the early 20th century, new ideas were
introduced, which allowed one to deal with sieving for primes as a problem of
linear programming. This led to many new results, but even today the linear
programming extremals remain to be found in most situations. By starting with a
simple situation and moving incrementally to more complicated ones, it is hoped
that it will at last be possible to locate the extremal configurations.
Heuristics concerning the distribution of primes in short intervals can be
developed from the Hardy--Littlewood prime k-tuple conjecture, and the insights
gained from such reasoning has an impact on other aspects of prime number
theory, including the famous Riemann Hypothesis which dates from 1860.
