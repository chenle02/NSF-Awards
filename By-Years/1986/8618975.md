This project involves various studies on developing analytical models for
cellular and developmental processes in biology. The main goal of this research
is to explain pattern formation in developing cell populations as mechanical-
chemical phenomena that can subsequently be formulated as mathematical models
involving partial differential equations and finite difference equations. In
earlier work of this type the investigator relied on the linear stability
analysis. He now proposes to use nonlinear reaction-diffusion type models, and
plans to use computation and simulation. The questions that will be addressed
include: 1. What are the mechanochemical mechanisms underlying epithelial
folding during embryogenesis? 2. How are spatial patterns of mesenchymal cell
aggregation established? 3. What is the mechanochemical mechanism underlying
cell motion? 4. How are the patterns on mollusk shells and butterfly wings laid
down? The project falls in the general broad area of mathematical modeling of
biological phenomena and as such is of interdisciplinary nature. The tools used
is this research include laboratory experiments, mathematical analysis and
computing. The investigator is a well established respected senior researcher
with an outstanding track record.
