The "Multidisciplinary Sustainability Modules: Integrating STEM Courses" project
is creating a framework for incorporating multidisciplinary projects in college
science education. Faculty representing Biology, Computer Science, Mathematics,
and Physics are working together to develop multidisciplinary educational
modules which will be available for use by other faculty as well. For this
project, a clear distinction is made between the terms multidisciplinary and
interdisciplinary. Faculty or students are not expected to be fluent in all the
disciplines needed to solve the problem for the multidisciplinary approach.

Using these multidisciplinary modules, students examine complex, large-scale
problems like those encountered in the scientific study of sustainability, and
the students work collectively with other students from different disciplines
using a set of online tools for exchanging data, code, reports, and expertise.
STEM students who use these modules are gaining a better understanding of the
methods needed for solving many complex, twenty-first century science problems.

An instructor's guide and the wiki-based web interface provide faculty at
different institutions opportunities to easily participate in the
multidisciplinary learning process. Results from the project evaluation are
being shared through conference presentations and publications in a wide variety
of disciplines.
