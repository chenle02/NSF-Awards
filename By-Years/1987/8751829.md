The Scholastic, Inc. Project, Super Science: A Mass Media Program, will launch
two classroom science magazines, one for grades 1 - 3, another for grades 4 - 6,
with a companion series of computer disks materials. They will stress hands-on
and inquiry activities that mix science with reading, math and social studies.
The science and technology skills and know-how that students will need as
consumers, workers, and citizens will be an important aspect in the development
of the project. The student magazines will have teachers guides and a special
periodical for early grade teachers. Project staff will use a three-part project
team support effort to develop Super Science. First, a panel of leaders in
science education will serve as advisors and consultants to ensure the
pedagogical soundness; second, administrators and teachers in nine ethnically
diverse districts nationwide will help formulate the scope and sequence plan for
the magazines and software and will test for class practicality, third, The
Triangle Goalition for science and Technology Education will help search out
practicing scientists to serve as consultants to assure the scientific validity
of the materials. Scholastic Inc. was founded in 1920 with a single publication.
The company now publishes 29 classroom magazines for students and 5 professional
magazines for teachers and/or supervisors as well as textbooks, paperbacks for
students and classroom software. The publishers will invest in excess of $5.2
million during the 4 years development phase and will continue the activities in
subsequent years. This proposal was submitted in response to the Program
Solicitation, "Programs for Elementary School Science Instruction II," which
encourages "troika" partnerships among publishers, school systems, and
scientists/science educators.
