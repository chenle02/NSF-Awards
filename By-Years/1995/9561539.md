This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project targets the creation of
enhanced strains of algae for the production of stable isotope biochemicals.
Tools developed in the project can then be extended to generate improved algal
strains for manufacturing vitamins, oils, fuels, foods, and pharmaceuticals.
Phycotechnology, the application of biotechnology to improve algae-based
systems, has great potential but is still in its infancy. This research will
make it possible to develop new strains of algae of commercial interest that
cannot be produced by standard genetic crosses. The feasibility of making hybrid
algae strains that maintain the combined properties of the two parental strains
that would not otherwise hybridize will be demonstrated. The technology
developed here to produce new strains of commercial algae will be applied to
lower the costs of production for algal derived stable isotopes and increase the
variety of economically feasible compounds. Also, the enhanced strains will be
licensed to industry and academia for use in aquaculture, energy production,
nutritional supplements and elsewhere.
