This research will focus on some problems in ring theory and representation
theory. Questions on affine algebras, related to their growth and their simple
modules will be examined. Further the representation theory of semisimple Lie
algebras, with special attention to highest weight modules will be considered,
as well as, the module theory of some related finite-dimensional associative
algebras. This research is in the general area of ring theory and representation
theory. These areas are currently very active and it is valuable to have someone
who can bridge these subjects. One can expect results of significance to the
mathematical community.
