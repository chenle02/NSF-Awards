The goal of the project is to elucidate mechanisms of genetic instability in
Neurospora. Knowledge gained from the project should shed light on several
general areas: recombination, mutation, and evolution. In addition, the project
has practical significance for Neurospora geneticists and researchers working on
related fungi (e.g. plant pathogens). During the grant period we will: 1)
determine whether RIP is responsible for low- frequency inactivation of
duplicate genes in vegetative tissue; 2) attempt to derepress RIP, by mutations,
in vegetative cells for use in subsequent genetic and biochemical experiments;
3) isolate mutants deficient in RIP; 4) determine if an inverted linked
duplication is subject to RIP, premeiotic reciprocal recombination, or both (to
provide a test of the idea that high- frequency premeiotic deletion of sequences
between linked duplications results from reciprocal recombination and to provide
information for a potential approach to isolate RIP mutants); 5) determine if
unlinked duplications are subject to recombination processes ("gene conversion"
and reciprocal exchange) prior to meiosis; 6) identify the postulated DNA-
cytosine deaminase involved in RIP; 7) investigate the resistance to RIP of
rDNA, and the effect of RIP on the transposon Tad. Filamentous fungi have an
unusual process, known as RIP, by which they inactive all but one copy of most
genes present in more than one copy. This process was discovered by the
Principal Investigator during a previous NSF award. The mechanism and
significance of this process are unclear, and the PI hopes to learn more about
them during this award. A better understanding of RIP will lead to more
effective methods for genetic manipulation of industrially important fungi.
