9313199 Farrell The goal of the proposal is to obtain crystals of the tubulin
dimer suitable for X-ray diffraction studies and to use them to obtain the
three-dimensional structure of tubulin. For initial screens of crystallization
conditions Dr. Farrell will isolate chemically homogeneous tubulin from a yeast
strain we have constructed which contains a single a-tubulin gene and a single
b-tubulin gene. If necessary, the tubulin genes would be further altered to
optimize the chances of obtaining tubulin suitable for crystallization. Tubulin
will be isolated from yeast using a new method that Dr. Farrell has recently
developed. The method yields approximately 5-10 mg of pure tubulin from 88L of
fermenter-grown cells. This method, together with the ease of gene manipulation
in yeast, has made it possible for the first time to use gene alteration
techniques to assist in obtaining chemically and conformationally homogeneous
tubulin for crystallization. ***
