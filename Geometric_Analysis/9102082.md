This grant supports the research of Professor P. Sarnak as principal
investigator and Dr. Zeev Rudnick as a post-doctoral associate. Professor Sarnak
will work on the spectral theory of automorphic forms and its applications to
number theory and combinatorics. He hopes to make progress towards the general
Ramanujan conjecture. Dr. Rudnick is working in automorphic forms. He intends to
apply techniques derived from the study of automorphic forms to counting integer
points on affine varieties. He is also investigating the behavior of Euler
products. This is research in the field of number theory broadly conceived.
Number theory starts with the whole numbers and questions such as the
divisibility of one whole number by another. It is among the oldest fields of
mathematics and it was originally pursued for purely aesthetic reasons. However,
within the last half century, it has become an essential tool in developing new
algorithms for computer science and new error correcting codes for electronics.
