Construction site layout is widely acknowledged to have a substantial impact on
efficiency by affecting the travel time of workers, transportation of materials
and equipment around a jobsite, and by its potential impact on workes safety.
Yet formal design approaches for site layout exist only in a few specific sub-
areas, e.g., crane selection. Publications which address the overall site layout
problem tend to offer, at best, empirical guidelines for designing an efficient
layout. Knowledge-based systems have achieved levels of performance comparable
to that of human experts for problems of diagnosis or selection in several
domains. However, expert systems for planning or design tasks are far more
difficult to construct and have achieved only modest levels of performance to
date. In addition to the generic challenges associated with developing expert
systems for design tasks, an expert system for construction site layout raises a
number of specific research issues including: integration of multiple knowledge
sources,spacial reasoning and temporal reasoning. To address these issues, the
BB1 blackboard architecture will be used. This was specifically designed to
employ and mediate between multiple knowledge sources in expert systems, and
which has been extended in an ongoing research project to address the problems
of spatial reasoning. The proposed research has the potential to advance the
practice of construction engineering, and to contribute to the development of
expert systems for spatial layout in a number of domains.
