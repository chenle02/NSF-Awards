This proposal is motivated by the desire to better understand blood flow in
coronary arteries that contain more than one obstruction. It is based on the
premise that under pulsatile flow conditions the compliance of the upstream
obstruction and the distance between the two obstructions strongly affect the
pressure vs flow relationship in the artery. Experimental observations on a
flow-loop will be compared with predictions derived theoretically. The project
may yield new understanding of the development of multiple obstructions in
coronary arteries, and may also lead to more incisive interpretations of
coronary angiograms.
