This research is to develop a compact flow sensor for high accuracy
semiconductor process control. This sensor will be based on a new variation of
infrared (IR) absorption spectroscopy called Spectral Correlation Detection. In
this approach, the reactant concentration is quantified by IR absorption to
control reactant flow rates for deposition or etching applications. This direct
IR measurement contrasts with current methods which indirectly meter species
flow rates. While this system will be assembled and calibrated for model metal
alkyl compounds, such as trimethylgallium, this IR sensor is versatile and can
be applied to a wide variety of deposition or etching species. The development
of an IR vapor phase flow controller based on Spectral Correlation would have
significant commercial application. This sensor would improve the quality of
silicon, III-V and II-VI semiconductor devices, optical components, and thin
films.
