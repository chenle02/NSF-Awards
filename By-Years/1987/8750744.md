This project will provide laboratory equipment to improve undergraduate
instruction in the physiological processes involved in human cognition. The
equipment purchased would present, record and analyze event-related potentials
(ERP). Students taking courses in the physiological basis of behavior would
learn the fundamental principles involved in ERPs, gain experience in its
operation in a variety of experiments investigating the relationship between
physiology and cognition, and would learn experimental applications of this
technique.
