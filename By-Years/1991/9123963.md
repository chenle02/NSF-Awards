This award is in support of one element of the project: Paleoclimates from
Arctic Lakes and Estuaries (PALE). The study of pollen in sedimentary deposits
has been one of the primary sources of information on continental
paleoenvironments and will undoubtedly be one of the predominant proxy climate
indicators in the reconstruction of Arctic paleoenvironmental conditions. This
project will refine and further test techniques for the extraction of pollen
from sedimentary deposits for dating by radiocarbon accelerator mass
spectrometry. These extraction techniques have recently been shown to be
effective in isolating pollen from contaminants that are probably responsible
for significant inconsistencies and uncertainties in sediment dates obtained by
the traditional method of 14C radioactive decay dating of bulk sediment samples.
The development of improved pollen extraction and radiocarbon dating techniques
will greatly facilitate the preparation and dating of samples of interest to the
general palynology and paleoecology research communities.
