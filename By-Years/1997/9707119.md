9707119 Farley This grant provides $149,996 as three years partial salary
support for a technician to oversee operation and maintenance and to provide
training to new users of the Caltech Noble gas geochemistry laboratory. The
addition of a skilled technician to this facility will allow the PI to continue
development of novel and exciting techniques utilizing rare gas geochemistry to
elucidate fundamental problems in the Earth sciences. Specific examples of the
PI's accomplishments to date include, the PI's development of apatite helium
thermochronology. This technique utilizes known diffusional rates of 4He from
decay of uranium and thorium series nuclides in apatite to constrain cooling
histories. Additionally, the PI's discovery of correlations between the flux of
extraterrestrial helium to seafloor sediments and global climate and faunal
changes are potentially significant for our understanding of the linkages
between the Earth's climate and extraterrestrial factors. ***
