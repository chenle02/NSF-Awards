This proposal is for the purchase of a fluorescence- activated cell sorter to
replace one purchased in 1983 at the inception of the Center for Fluorescence
Research in Biomedical Sciences at Carnegie Mellon University. The PI and co-PI
are leaders in the flow cytometry community and the current FACS has been used
in 38 research publications in cell biology in the 9 years since its
installation. No other instrument exists at CMU. Limitations in its capabilities
compared to newer instruments and difficulties with repairing and maintaining it
justify replacement. The group of major and minor users receives over $3,290,000
in direct cost research support per year from federal and other agencies,
including over $690,000 per year from NSF. The proposal replacement instrument
will be used for research in a number of areas of cell, molecular and
developmental biology, including membrane traffic, somatic cell genetics,
fluorescent probe development, mitochondria physiology and cell differentiation
and will be an integral part of the recently-established NSF Science and
Technology Research Center in Light Microscopy Imaging and Biotechnology at
Carnegie Mellon University
