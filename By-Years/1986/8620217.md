This natural products chemistry project is a collaborative research effort at
the interface of biology and chemistry directed toward identifying the chemicals
that marine organisms produced to control and defend their environment. It is
supported jointly by the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry and Biological
Oceanographic Programs. The chemical and biological foundations of chemical
defense in marine plants and selected marine invertebrates will be investigated.
The project will focus upon defining the natural products chemistry of "avoided"
marine plants, gorgonian corals and didemnid ascidians found in the Caribbean
Sea. The natural functions of specific marine secondary metabolites will be
defined. Specific components of this project are as follows: (1) chemical
studies of the bioactive components of "avoided" marine algae, including those
of the previously un-investigated genera Vidalia, Wrightiella, Bryothamnion, and
Trichogloea; (2) chemical studies of Caribbean gorgonian corals, such as those
of the genera Pseudopterogorgia, Eunicea, Lophogorgia, and similar
investigations of "avoided" didemnid ascidians; (3) the development of a feeding
inhibition bioassay, to be utilized (in reef habitats) to measure feeding
deterrence and avoidance phenomena; and (4) the continuation of an
interdisciplinary program, with marine ecologists, exploring the natural
functions of marine defensive chemicals, that is their effects on feeding,
reproduction, larval settling phenomena and survival.
