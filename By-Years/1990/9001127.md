The Konza Prairie Research Natural Area was established in 1970 using
replicated watershed units to study the effects of fire frequency on tallgrass
prairie. Seastedt and Benning propose to take advantage of this long-term fire
frequency experiment with a retrospective analysis of indices of net primary
production (NPP) using remote sensing and Geographic Information System
procedures. They will test the hypotheses that 1) fire frequency has measurable
effects on remotely sensed indices of foliage NPP, 2) that topoedaphic effects
influence watershed patterns, and 3) that growing season precipitation mediates
fire frequency effects. The results from this effort will be combined with small
plot studies to modify the CENTURY model so that it accurately predicts fire
effects on NPP and soil dynamics. This research addresses an important part of
vegetation - atmosphere interactions and is related to the problem of detecting
effects of global change on biotic processes. The institutional support for this
research is outstanding.
