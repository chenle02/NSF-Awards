The SCI-LINK project is designed to translate the results of current scientific
research, particularly in the environmental sciences, into a form suitable for
teaching in middle/junior and senior high school classrooms. Teachers from North
Carolina and Minnesota will be linked with scientists from Universities in those
states and from agencies such as the U.S Department of Agriculture and the U.S.
Forest Service in programs which include visits to research sites, performance
of laboratory experiments, and summer institutes which include both instruction
and the development of curriculum materials for use in the pre-college
classroom. The teachers participating in the first year of the project will
serve as Master teachers in the later years to form the core of a network of
teachers and scientists and to offer a series of workshops which will draw more
teachers into the network. Cost-sharing in the amount of $150,000 is 23% of the
NSF contribution to the project.
