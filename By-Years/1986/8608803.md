To rehabilitiate an existing steel-framed building, it is necessary to evaluate
the strength of the structure in terms of its load-carrying capabilities. A
further analysis for wind effects is also required to determine the suitability
of the structure in its original condition and after strengthening, if required.
Current methods of analysis are inadequate to determine the full capacity of the
structural system because they neglect the effect of the geometrical changes in
dimensions of the main beams and columns. This project will investigate the
significance of nonliner effects of geometry and material properties in relation
to the analysis of two-and three-dimensional frame systems. The design methods
to be studies are the plastic analysis and the limit state methods. The project
will develop detailed procedures to estimate the influence of geometric effects
on the stiffness and strength of plastically designed frames. In addition,
simplified rules to determine when a second order analysis is needed will be
developed.
