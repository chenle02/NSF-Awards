This project investigates the use of ultraviolet light to set the weights on
synapses in a Hopfield style neural network. Specifically, the P.I. will:
determine which geometrical structures are best suited to controlling a UV
writable floating node; determine how well the nulling works over parameter
variations such as temperature and power supply variations; and develop the
circuits and layout necessary to implement a Hopfield style neural network. The
P.I.'s previous work on using ultraviolet light to set voltages on poly-silicon
gates in a standard CMOS integrated circuit is a solid base from which to
progress.
