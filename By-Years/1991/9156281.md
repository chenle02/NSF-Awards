Introductory Biology is being revised to make it a more creative, engaging, and
participatory experience for both potential majors and for non-majors. The
intention is to strengthen student interest in Biology by designing an exciting
and more realistic new course. The new lab format will involve doing real
laboratory experiments and learning real research skills such as experimental
design and data analysis. The students work in small groups that use the 'PI
system' and write group lab reports modeled on the writing of a scientific
paper. Students who take the revised course will have a clearer grasp of how
laboratory science is actually done and will have first-hand knowledge about
such key ideas as hypothesis creation and testing, data collection and
interpretation, and scientific writing. This experimental course is being
compared with the current introductory biology course by a team of evaluators
from other institutions.
