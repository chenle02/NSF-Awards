The Alfred Renyi Institute of Mathematics, together with the Hungarian Academy
of Sciences, the Eotvos Lorand University and the Janos Bolyai Mathematical
Society are organizing a conference in the summer of 2013 to celebrate the 100th
birthday of Paul Erdos, one of the most influential mathematicians of the 20th
century. The conference will be held July 1-5, 2013, in Budapest, Hungary, in
the historical building of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. There will be only
invited talks by outstanding mathematicians who will create a scientic program
with intellectual merit on a par with Erdos's incredible research achievements.
Invited speakers who have accepted our invitation include several winners of the
Fields Medal, Wolf Prize, Nevanlinna Prize, and other major prizes. One of our
underlying goals, in addition to honoring Paul Erdos, is to bring together these
exceptional researchers and study the relationships between their work and
Erdos's work. We are confident that the meeting will inspire new insights and
further collaborations from these "mathematical giants". There is no doubt that
Erdos's work will continue to be the source of beautiful developments in
mathematics and in other fields.
