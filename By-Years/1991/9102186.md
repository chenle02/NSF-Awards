Professor Igusa will study the K-split irreducible pre- homogeneous vector
spaces. In particular, he wishes to complete the calculations for the local zeta
functions in the remaining cases. He also intends to investigate non-standard
factors of universal p-adic zeta functions. This project falls into the general
area of arithmetic geometry -a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of
mathematics: number theory and geometry. This combination has proved
extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems that withstood
generations. Among its many consequences are new error correcting codes. Such
codes are essential for both modern computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
