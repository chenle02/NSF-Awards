During the last three decades, great strides have been made in the understanding
of our dynamic planet. The concept of plate tectonics is one of the most
revolutionary advances in science and has completely changed the way geologists
look at the Earth. One of the most important areas in the development of the
concept of plate tectonics is the Appalachian Orogen.The workshop will focus on
an understanding of the tectonic elements and timing of the Appalachian Orogen
by examining geologic transect through the Southern Appalachian Orogen in North
Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia and the far Northern Appalachian Orogen across
Newfoundland. In addition, the Northern Appalachian Orogen will be examined in
less detail.
