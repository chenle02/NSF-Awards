This Research award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry
program supports work by Professor Thomas Mallouk at The Pennsylvania State
University to carry out fundamental studies on the synthesis, reaction
chemistry, and physical properties of new layered metal oxides. This class of
inorganic materials lends itself to rational design because of the availability
of intercalation, ion-exchange, and exfoliation/re-stacking reactions. Oriented
attachment reactions of oxide nanosheets will be developed to realize three-
dimensionally bonded solids with tailored magnetic and electronic properties.
New topochemical reactions will be used to introduce dopants and defects, which
will modulate the electronic and protonic conductivity of layered solids and
thin film superlattices derived from them. Oriented particle membranes, which
are of interest as solid electrolytes for intermediate temperature fuel cells,
will be made by combining the magnetic orientation of nano- and microcrystals
with electrophoretic assembly. This research will be coupled to an outreach
effort that provides high school students from under-represented groups with
hands-on experience in nanomaterials chemistry through an Upward Bound Math and
Science summer program. The project will continue to develop guided-inquiry
capstone projects for the materials- and environmentally-focused sections of the
general chemistry laboratory at Penn State, and will contribute to K-12 science
outreach efforts in local schools. Layered metal oxides are a class of inorganic
solids with unique ferroelectric, magnetic, superconducting, and catalytic
properties. The elaboration of their chemistry is important to realizing new
functional materials that combine, for example, ferroelectricity and magnetism,
and to exploiting their reactivity for applications in catalysis and energy
conversion.
