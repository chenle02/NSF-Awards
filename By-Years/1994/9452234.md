9452234 Yanik A student computing laboratory is being established, making
possible innovations which principally fall into three areas: collaborative
learning, the use of journals, and technology. The use of journals will be
expanded by the establishment of a computer "bulletin board" for the posting of
questions and comments among the students and between students and instructors.
Because the preparation of mathematics teachers is a primary mission of the
division a primary focus is integrating technology as an important tool in
teaching mathematics.
