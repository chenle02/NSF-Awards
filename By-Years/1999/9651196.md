Biology students do not receive sufficient hands-on experience in modern
experimental techniques or in the interpretation of data derived from these
techniques. The equipment used in this project, along with other equipment
recently acquired, provides meaningful laboratory experiences utilizing current
technologies for students planning careers as scientists or technicians. The use
of computers is simplifying and enhancing data analysis and manipulation,
providing students with a rapid visual representation of the results. This
project facilitates the incorporation of current and powerful techniques such as
polymerase chain reaction, nucleic acid hybridization, monoclonal antibodies,
and fluorescent probes into instructional laboratories and undergraduate
research. The project can improve research opportunities and outcomes for
minority students at the university and at minority institutions in Memphis that
have cooperative research programs with the university. The new equipment can
also be used for undergraduate research and the training of area high school
teachers, talented high school students, and undergraduates from other
institutions in the Mid-South. The impact of the project can be evaluated by
monitoring the number of students, particularly women, minorities, and persons
with disabilities, who major in the division, choose to enter graduate school or
B.S.-level employment in science-related areas, apply for and receive research
awards, or participate in undergraduate research. Dissemination of results can
occur through publications in journals concerned with science education, through
the educational divisions of professional societies, and through undergraduate
research presentations at professional meetings.
