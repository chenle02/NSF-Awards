This research concerns heat transfer by natural convection. Thermally driven
cavity flows at high Raleigh number occur in a wide variety of scientific and
industrial applications. Of particular concern to the semi-conductor industry
are convective flows that arise in the preparation from the melt of high quality
substrate materials. The manufacture of opto-electronic solid state devices for
communications technology requires substrates of greater purity and homogeneity.
Current device considerations also make it desirable to grow crystals of larger
diameter by increasing the melt size. These production problems are influenced
by the convection patterns generated by changes in the melt geometry. Horizontal
growth techniques of the gradient freeze type are known to be strongly dependent
on such scale effects. Some vertical growth methods can have stagnant zones in
the lower part of the melt which also lead to manufacturing difficulties. The
investigation will consist of a comprehensive examination of these cavity flows
with specific reference to their aspect ratio dependence and to the overall heat
transfer across the cavity.
