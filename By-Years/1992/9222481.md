Abraham This research is on fault modeling and test generation for mixed signal
integrated circuits. In the area of fault models, defect and yield statistics
are being used to derive comprehensive fault models for analog circuits. These
include functional fault models useable in design for test and test generation.
New test generation algorithms are being derived for analog circuits, and
techniques are being developed to interface the analog tests with the digital
circuitry in a mixed signal circuit. The fundamental theories are being
validated experimentally with designs and data from industry.
