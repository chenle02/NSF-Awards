The principal investigator will study the inference problems in the setting of
asymptotic structures for dependence, distribution tails and characteristic
functions. This research will be carried out in several general areas, including
extremes of stationary sequences, partial sums of a stationary sequence and
nonparametric function estimation. A number of new techniques will be developed,
including the use of Fourier analysis to determine rates of convergence in
nonparametric function estimation.
