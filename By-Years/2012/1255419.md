A star's age is one of its most fundamental parameters. It is also, for isolated
'field' stars, notoriously difficult to measure accurately. Two standard stellar
chronometers - the age-rotation and age-activity relations - generally struggle
to produce age estimates with uncertainties better than 50%. The PI will tackle
this problem by combining a wealth of new observations from the Palomar
Transient Factory Open Cluster Survey with follow-up spectroscopy and X-ray
observations. He will assemble a complete, uniform sample of rotation periods
and activity measurements for low-mass stars in six open clusters ranging in age
from 35 Myr to 2.5 Gyr. By examining the relationships between stellar age,
rotation, and activity, he will address three basic questions: (1) the
rotational period distribution of low mass zero-age main sequence stars, (2) the
evolution of rotational periods of low mass stars with ages &gt; 500 My, and (3)
the possible divergence of age-activity and age-rotation relations at ages &gt;
500 My. The work will provide a significant leap in our understanding of stellar
ages. In turn, this will inform us about the composition and internal structure
of stars, and it will allow us to better understand stellar magnetic fields.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will also perform a wide-ranging set of synergistic
education and outreach activities centered on ensuring that students from
underrepresented minorities have successful transitions into graduate school. As
the Director of Columbia University's Bridge to the Ph.D. in the Natural
Sciences scheme, he will play a leading role in recruiting, mentoring, and
educating post-baccalaureate minority students in a structured program designed
to ensure their continued success in Ph.D. programs.
