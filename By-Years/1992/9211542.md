This is a study of active labor market policies, such as job placement, job
training, and job creation policies in 17 nations from 1950 to 1988. Active
labor market policies consist of direct government intervention into labor
markets for the primary purpose of reducing unemployment. It presumes that
participants are ready and willing to work. Labor market policies constitute the
most active policy in the otherwise passive welfare state repertoire, because
its goals are to make the labor force more flexible in adjusting to the
restructuring of the domestic and international economies. The focus of the
study is to examine the relationship between the political and economic
characteristics of a society and its labor market policies. Data from official
statistics in the 17 countries will be analyzed using time-series models, pooled
cross-sectional models, and a combination of regression analysis and
institutional analysis. This study will make a major contribution to the
understanding of the conditions under which governments will develop active
welfare state policies aimed at reintegrating citizens into the labor market
rather than relying on more passive policies such as welfare benefits.
