Recent studies from this laboratory have established that hydrogen tunneling
occurs in the yeast alcohol dehydrogenase and bovine serum amine oxidase
reactions. These initial findings suggest that room temperature tunneling may be
fundamental feature of enzyme catatlyzed hydrogen transfer reactions.
Investigation will be extended in order to: (i) Determine the generality of
hydrogen tunneling in enzyme catalyzed H:, H. and H+ reactions, thereby
establishing a data base for such behavior; (ii) Characterize the parameters
which are likely to control the probability of tunneling, in particular the
roles of reaction driving force, E.S binding interactions and protein motion;
and (iii) Initiate computational work, with the goal of discriminating among
possible models for nuclear tunneling at enzyme active sites. Ultimately, such
studies are expected to provide insight into the shape of reaction coordinates
at enzyme active sites. Over the past few years the role of quantum mechanical
effects in enzyme reactions have gained importance. Although the area of
electron tunneling has been the focus of extensive on going investigatrions the
phenomenon of hydrogen tunneling in biology has received relatively little
attention. It is a particular promising area to pursue to find answer too many
features of enzyme catalysis.
