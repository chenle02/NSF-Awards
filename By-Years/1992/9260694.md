The feasibility of fabricating Nb3Al multifilamentary superconducting wires
through a Jelly-Roll technique using commercially available aluminum alloy
sheets, which contain Mg and/or Si, will be investigated. Oxygen free high
conductivity copper will be incorporated into the conductor design as the
stabilizer. The conventional wire fabricating processes with low temperature
extrusion will be tested. The superconducting properties of the new materials
such as Tc or Jc will be measured. The microstructures of the superconducting
composite materials will be examined and characterized. The aim is to develop a
superconducting wire with properties that exceed those of current materials.
