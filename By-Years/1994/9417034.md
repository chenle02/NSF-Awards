9417034 Blumenthal: This award is to provide support for the International
C.elegans Meeting to be held at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin,
June 1995 and June 1997. Research on the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans ranges
from such global problems as the functioning of an entire nervous system and the
evolution of form to the molecular bases of gene structure and function. C.
elegans has become an important experimental organism for the study of many
aspects of animal biology, particularly the genetic and molecular bases of
development and behavior. The goal of the meeting is to enhance exchanges of
knowledge, methods, mutants, and clones which is vital in establishing the sense
of excitement and collegiality that characterizes this field.
