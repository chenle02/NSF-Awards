9727795 Dighton Mycorrhizal fungi are able to form a biological bridge between
two resource patches. Nutrients and carbon can then be translocated between
patches by the fungi. This SGER research will use new technology, Fourier
Transform Infrared Radiometry (FTIR) to (1) determine the cascade of
decomposition products in response to fungal enzymes on resource islands with or
without fungal bridges, and (2) assess if decomposition products from different
plant materials can be determined qualitatively with this technique. This
research has direct application for linking microbial diversity in the soil with
ecosystem function through the process of decomposition. This will be the first
attempt to use FTIR technology to link structure and function in soil microbial
ecology.
