9722262 Bargonetti This career proposal is integrating laboratory experiences
and research into undergraduate and graduate programs for students at Hunter
college. This investigator is studying p53 as a cell cycle check point factor.
The undergraduate students will examine the effect of p53 on the growth curves
of mammalian cells in culture, and look at the effects of p53 on transcriptional
activation. The graduate students will look at the distribution of p53 during
the cell cycle in cells before and after induced DNA damage, and also look at
the DNA binding properties and phosphorylation state of p53. These studies will
provide information on how p53 controls cell growth. %%% This career award is
combining the research with the training of undergraduate and graduate students
at Hunter College. Since Hunter College is a minority institution, a number of
underrepresented minorities will be trained in this research which will provide
important information on how a protein, p53 acts to regulate the cell cycle. ***
