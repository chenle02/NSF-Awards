This project seeks to develop adaptive techniques for high performance graph-
based reasoning systems that allow users to control the tradeoffs between
computational resources and solution quality. The main thrust of this project is
to introduce adaptability and scalability in algorithms for constraint
optimization, probabilistic inference, and decision making under uncertainty.
The project is structured into subprojects that study: (1) iterative belief
propagation for graphical models; (2) hybrids of stochastic local search and
inference; (3) search guided by partition-based heuristics; and (4) mixed
probabilistic and deterministic (constraint) networks. These subprojects are
tied together by the PI's ongoing research on the unifying framework of
"parameterized bounded inference" that combines the two paradigms of search and
structure-based inference. Endowing graph-based algorithms with increased
adaptability and scalability is important not only to progress in AI and
computer science but also to application in many domains. An additional goal of
this project is to package the developed algorithms in one software reasoning
and evaluation shell (REES) to allow uniform empirical evaluation and to
facilitate dissemination of the project's results by researchers, educators and
application builders.
