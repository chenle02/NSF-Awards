Complexity in science arises in particular problems that may not be fruitfully
studied as isolated systems acting independently of others. Often these problems
are instead advantageously studied using computer simulation, but only if a
method for correctly modeling the interactions of subsystems can be devised.
This project involves computational approaches to a variety of problems that
exhibit complexity in geophysics. Specific applications are in the general areas
of fluid dynamics (two-phase flow and flow in porous media) and nonlinear
seismic inversion. In each of these problems, the seemingly intractable
interdependence of component parts may be surmounted by the design of elementary
computer algorithms that produce complexity in macroscopic, aggregate behavior
while maintaining simplicity at the microscopic, component level.
