The research team at the University of Colorado will investigate how some
typical molecules in biofuels break down prior to burning, a process known as
pyrolysis and one that is still poorly understood. This is important because the
type of products due to this breakdown has implications in how the later
combustion process will proceed. The proposed research effort involves teaching
and learning at both the undergraduate and graduate levels, and ensuring that
opportunities are accessible to all students. Graduate student research
assistants are full participants in research projects and are supported by
appropriate course work and in depth mentoring by senior project personnel. They
have the opportunity to travel to other collaborating laboratories, attend
scientific meetings, and present and publish their work.

The proposed research addresses questions regarding the reaction mechanisms and
kinetics of the thermal decomposition of carboxylic esters, R1COOR2. Carboxylic
esters commonly appear as the main components of biofuels. They form fuels that
are similar in combustion properties to petroleum-based fuels. The thermolysis
chemistry of many of the large organic molecules encountered in biofuels is
poorly understood or completely unknown. In addition to exploring the pyrolysis
reaction mechanisms of these molecules, the principal investigators plan to
measure rates of reaction for determination of kinetic mechanisms. The
experimental approach involves the use of miniature (0.6 mm x 2 cm) tubular
reactors. These reactors will be equipped with molecular diagnostics:
photoionization mass spectroscopy (PIMS), matrix infrared absorption
spectroscopy (IR), resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI), and
microwave spectroscopy. The work should have a significant impact on
understanding of the first steps in the reaction of carboxylic ester based
biofuels and find immediate applicability in engineering simulations. The
research will lead to technology improvements in the area of renewable biomass
derived fuels that can replace petroleum-derived fuels.
