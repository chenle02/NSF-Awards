Interesting and timely experiments in the areas of helium 3 and helium 4 mixture
films, localization, and the behavior of helium in restricted/disordered
environments will be performed. In each case, the vehicle to the phenomenae of
interest is a helium film and in a number of situations the experiments address
questions which transcend the helium community. They will study mixture films by
means of the combination of NMR and third sound techniques with a focus on an
elucidation of the advent of interactions among the helium 3. In the area of
localization, they seek to observe and study frequency dependent localization
and correlation effects in two dimensions predicted by emerging theory. In other
work, they seek to study the properties of helium in cylindrical and disordered
media.
