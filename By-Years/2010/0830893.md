Computer Science (31)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project provides scholarships
for graduate students seeking degrees in an MBA program with an emphasis on
Information Assurance (IA). This degree gives students a strong background in
business and policy as well as education and technical training in IA. Students
in this program are engaged in a variety of research projects focused on the
broad theme of organizational information asset protection, and they interact
with experts in the field of IA through a series of professional seminars. Upon
graduation, scholarship recipients must work for a Federal government agency in
an IA position. The scholarship program helps to address the nation's need for
qualified information technology professionals working in government agencies.
