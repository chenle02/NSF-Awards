Recent work by Dr. Warner has shown, through a series of experimental
manipulations, that the interaction of tradition and resource assessment is a
potent force in mating system determination in a model species, Thalassoma
bifasciatum (a coral reef fish). Mating sites that have been in use for
generations change to new locations only when tradition is broken by removing
and replacing the entire population. Under normal circumstances, site usage is
constrained by tradition. The physical attributes of mating site may change over
time, but the population has little opportunity to reset to any new distribution
of resources because there is an initial liability in attempting to mate at a
nontraditional site. These results are significant because they challenge
current thinking in behavioral ecology: mating systems may not be predictable
from measurements of the current distribution of resources. This work leads to
some predictions about the role of catastrophic disturbance in this mating
system. If population traditions are broken by a natural catastrophe, the mating
system which is reestablished should be correlated with existing measurable
resources. Prior to the occurrence of Hurricane Hugo, Dr. Warner had mapped the
distribution of mating sites on 19 patch reefs in Teague Bay, St. Croix. On five
of these reefs he had also measured the physical characteristics of these sites
as well as other sites that were suitable but were not used. There were many
unused sites that had the same physical characteristics as sites that were used.
If Dr. Warner's published predictions are correct, a new suite of mating sites
will arise after the hurricane, and these will posses physical characteristics
that will clearly distinguish them from other structures on the reef. This is an
unprecedented opportunity to test a hypothesis that referred specifically to the
effects of catastrophic events on mating systems.
