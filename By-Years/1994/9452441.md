9452441 Wikle This project targets the implementation of an undergraduate field
program in the use of global positioning system (GPS) technology.
Instrumentation includes GPS receivers and laptop computers for data logging.
The equipment is also being utilized by geography and forestry majors and
students from other natural resource programs taking courses in Physical
Geography, Computer Cartography, Remote Sensing, Geographic Information Systems,
Field Techniques, Forest Mensuration, and Aerial Photogrammetry. Two main
objectives are stressed, namely introducing GPS field equipment to students
enrolled in a general education geography course and allowing upper division
students to integrate state-of-the-art system technologies. The proposed GPS
field program is also expected to serve as a prototype to test new curricula and
as a model for similar geography programs at other institutions.
