This research project is directed in two major thrust areas (i) processing of
metal alloys and (ii) processing of semiconductor materials. A component
connecting both of these areas is simulation and theory work aimed at predicting
materials properties. The metal processing research employs ion beam mixing,
shock consolidation, mechanical alloying, and synthesis of layered and
metastable materials. The semiconductor processing research employs epitaxial
growth on Si and GaAs, ion implantation, nucleation and growth on new phases
such as amorphous carbon. The use of sophisticated electron microscopy apparatus
is central to the research projects. Better understanding of the influence of
interfaces, surfaces and grain boundaries on materials properties is a primary
goal of this reserach.
