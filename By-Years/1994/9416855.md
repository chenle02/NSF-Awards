9416855 Sag This three-year award will support U.S.-France cooperative research
in linguistics between Stanford University and the University of Paris VII. The
American investigator is Ivan Sag and the French investigators are Anne Abeille
and Daniele Godard. The objective of their research is to develop a description
of the syntax of the French language as a standard reference point for
scientific study and as a basis for the development of French language
processing computer technology. The proposed research on French syntax will be
carried out within a linguistic framework developed by the Stanford University
group. The framework is known as Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG).
Dr. Sag brings to this collaboration his expertise in linguistics and
computational linguistics. This is complemented by the French investigators'
expertise in French language and grammar. As part of a larger international
collaboration, the French project will advance Dr. Sag's effort to test his
model as a standard for a computational grammar and will provide linguists with
a comprehensive description of French grammar. ***
