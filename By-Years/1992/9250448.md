The second-year mathematics sequence is being changed to incorporate the use of
computers into advanced calculus and geometry. A laboratory of NeXT workstations
is being set up for use in teaching and developing both courses. The advanced
calculus component is a joint project between Washington and Lee University and
the University of Michigan and is currently in its second year. The geometry
component is a joint project between the PI and Professor William Goldman of the
University of Maryland and is being developed as part of the Utah Regional
Geometry Institute. Dissemination of the materials developed under this project
will be via the Summer Geometry Institute in Park City, Utah, by distribution to
the member institutions of the RGI and by publication of the advanced calculus
materials.
