The Great Lakes Science Center (GLSC), in collaboration with the Cleveland
Municipal School District, corporations and universities, proposes a three-year
"After School Science Adventures" program. To address the developmental needs of
youth, the program will use multi-level mentoring and a learning cycle approach
to engage participants in learning, doing and presenting science. Science
content will center around six themes: (1) information technology, (2)
environmental science, (3) polymers/materials science, (4) engineering, (5)
biotechnology and (6) biomedical research that are directly relevant to local
scientific research and industry. Each year a team of 20 High School Science
Ambassadors will facilitate science activities for at least 100 middle level
students. Middle level students will participate in a series of eight weekly
sessions for each theme. In year one there will be three themes, and an
additional three themes in years two and three. Science experiments, team
projects, youth mentoring, presentations by research and industry scientists,
and fieldtrips are key program activities. Participants will present science to
their families in family science events throughout the project.
