The purpose of this project is to analyze the impact of the stock market on the
innovative capabilities of high- technology companies that have been central to
the "new economy". The empirical focus will be on equipment suppliers in the
optical networking industry --an industry that integrates the bandwidth
potential of fiber optics with the data communications potential of the
Internet. Through in-depth comparative analysis of the development and
utilization of technology at Cisco Systems, Nortel Networks, Lucent
Technologies, Alcatel, and Sycamore Networks, this project seeks to determine
the impacts of both the changing role of the stock market and the volatility in
stock prices on the accumulation of innovative capabilities in an industry that
is central to the prosperity of the US and global economies.
