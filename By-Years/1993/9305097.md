Foreland basins adjacent to long-lived orogenic belts evolved in response to
sporadic or continued crustal deformation. This evolution is recorded in the
stratigraphic record and reflects the spatial and temporal variation in uplifts,
the development of intrabasinal folds and faults, and basin subsidence. This
study will examine the Late Paleozoic foreland in Nevada by focusing on a
network of long sections along the axis of the basin and the included
unconformities, structures and distinctive stratal packages that record how the
foreland responded to the long-lived tectonism. Results should help delineate
differences in style of orogenic processes along the foreland and through time
and should provide the basis of developing a rigorous stratigraphic approach to
the assessment of the tectonic histories for long-lived foreland basin systems.
