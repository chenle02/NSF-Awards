For over 35 years Dr. Rogers McVaugh has done floristic research on the
vascular plants of southwestern Mexico, in an area centered on the state of
Jalisco and known as Nueva Galicia. For the last 30 years that work has been
supported by the National Science Foundation. McVaugh's research is now bearing
fruit in the form of the Flora Novo-Galiciana, a 17-volume series to be
published at the University of Michigan. Four volumes, treating the four largest
families, have already been published. This project will provide partial support
for publication of the fifth volume, now ready for publication. It will be
designated Volume 15 and will treat the monocot families from Bromeliaceae to
Dioscoreaceae.
