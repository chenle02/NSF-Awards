This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).

The project will enable ten undergraduate students per year to actively
participate in scientific and engineering research throughout the year at the
University of New Mexico (UNM), in the FPGA Mission Assurance Center (FMAC),
which since the submission of the proposal has become the Configurable Space
Microsystems and Applications Center (COSMIAC). The students will be exposed to
projects across a variety of disciplines that range from engineering satellite
systems to analyzing data and conducting scientific research in the space and
atmospheric sciences. Activities include hands-on experience working on the
design, construction, and continued testing and refining of sets of three
broadband tunable VHF (very high frequencies) receivers, one for each of three
CubeSats capable of a) measuring both lightning sferics and anthropogenic
sources of electromagnetic pulses (EMP), b) geo-locating the sources to high
accuracy (less than 1 km), and c) extracting information about the Earth's
ionosphere. Under the supervision and instruction of UNM faculty as well as
scientists from the broader FMAC (now COSMIAC) consortium, which includes the
Air Force Research Laboratory, Los Alamos National Laboratory, and Sandia
National Laboratory, all within close proximity, students will be required to
design the complete spacecraft as well as define how constellation flight will
be controlled, how an unusual power system can be launched and deployed, how
sensors can be developed, analyzed and tested for the main mission, and how
substantial quantities of data can be transmitted through a weight/power limited
link.

The project aims to provide the students comprehensive exposure to nearly all
aspects of conducting a space research project coupled to the collaborative
experience of working side-by-side with fellow students as well as scientists
and engineers, all of which combines together to form a firm foundation on which
to launch space related scientific and technical careers. The project will
recruit students not only from UNM, which is a minority serving institution, but
will also reach out to other near-by schools, including New Mexico Institute of
Mining and Technology and New Mexico State University, all of which have large
minority populations. In addition, the project is making a special effort to
recruit minorities and underrepresented groups to the program.
