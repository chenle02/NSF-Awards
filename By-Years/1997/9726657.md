9726657 Yanch This proposal is on research to develop accelerator-based, fast
neutron brachytherapy for the treatment of tumors. Radiotherapy using neutrons
has been shown to be effective in treating a number of tumor types including
advanced tumors of the brain. However, the use of external beams of neutrons has
also led to unacceptable healthy tissue complications. In this research, damage
to healthy tissue would be avoided by using a very small bachytherapy tube,
which delivers neutrons from a small accelerator coupled to a flexible
positioning device. Using a small accelerator, instead of an external beam of
neutrons, has important advantages since it: (1) eliminates storage and handling
problems since this neutron source can be turned off when not in use, (2)
maintains a constant intensity when in use, and (3) can produce a neutron energy
spectrum that can be somewhat tailed for tumor size, and (4) can deliver therapy
in a much shorter period of time than that of other methods under consideration.
Preliminary studies by the investigator have indicated the feasibility of this
technique, but also indicated a heating problem, which requires active cooling
during use. The current research would then investigate the physical and
engineering feasibility of this therapy approach. The major elements of this
proposed research include: (1) design and testing of a new prototype tube to
enhance heat removal, including full evaluation of cooling failure conditions,
(2) neutron and photon dosimetry in a tissue equivalent phantom over a range of
particle currents and particle energies, including the duel ion chamber method
for mixed field dosimetry at large distances from the source and radiochromic
film dosimetry close to the source, and (3) design of a gantry system and
moveable treatment couch to produce a practical and reliable positioning system
which provides complete freedom for locating the brachytherapy tube at any
orientation. ***
