9353325 Hamadeh This award to the Boston Public Schools is to evaluate and
cultivate the potential for major systemic reform in mathematics and science
education. The study will define how BPS can improve access to and the quality
of mathematics and science education. The two working goals of the program are
to create a mathematics and science profile of BPS and to develop a mathematics
and science leadership team. An advisory board, an executive committee, a
leadership team, technical support team and various working groups will direct
the administration of five tasks in five key areas. Data generated will be used
to ascertain the status of access and quality of mathematics and science
education in Boston. ***
