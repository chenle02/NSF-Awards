It is proposed to augment the Infrared Spatial Interferometer which has been
built and is operating on Mount Wilson so that it can do interferometry on
spectral lines. Since the system uses heterodyne detection, it can provide very
sensitive detection at narrow bandwidths and hence can be conveniently adapted
to spectral work. Prominent molecular spectral lines of gases recently emitted
by stars and in their surrounding dust shells have already been studied by
heterodyne detection in the 10 micron region. It is proposed here to enhance the
ISI so that it can carry out spatial interferometry at high angular resolutions
on these and other spectral lines as well as on continuum radiation, with which
it now works. The work involves installation of two sets of carefully matched IF
filters for the two telescopes, IF switching, and IF chopping between filters.
It will also involve field work in testing the system and its use, so that
techniques can be checked and perfected, and initial results of high quality
obtained. This work can open up a new aspect of spatial interferometry and
provide new, highly specific information on molecular formation and excitation,
as well as distribution of gas densities, temperatures, and accelerations.
