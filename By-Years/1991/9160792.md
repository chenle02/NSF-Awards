Intelligent Tutoring Systems show promise for improving the efficiency of
teaching by tailoring instruction to each student's needs. This research
proposes two innovations over current tutoring methods. The first, is interest
based, i.e., instruction based on the basis of a model of the student's
interest. The second, is the use of multiple intelligent agents to deliver
individualized instruction and engage in collaborative problem solving with the
student. The end use of the research will include commercial games that teach
scientific and mathematical domains.
