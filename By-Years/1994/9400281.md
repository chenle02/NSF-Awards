McDuff 94-00281 The University of Washington requests renewed funding for
shipboard technician activities associated with the research vessel THOMAS
THOMPSON-a 274-foot vessel and the R/V BARNES - a 66 foot vessel. The T.THOMPSON
was constructed by the Navy in 1991. It is owned by the Navy and operated by the
University. In calendar year 1994, the T.THOMPSON will support a total of 153
days of NSF-funded research in the northwestern Pacific and Arabian Sea. The
BARNES will support a total of 47 days of NSF-funded research in the
northwestern U.S. coastal waters. UW technicians will be responsible for
operating and repairing instruments while at sea, maintaining instruments

cruises. Budgets for years 2 and 3 of this grant will be negotiated when ship
schedules for those years are finalized.
