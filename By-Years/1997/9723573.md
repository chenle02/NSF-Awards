9723573 McIntosh Plant mitochondria have two terminal oxidases, cytochrome
oxidase and the alternative oxidase and a choice of pathways for energy flow.
Alternative oxidase is encoded by a small nuclear gene family and appears to
link mitochondrial energy balance and biosynthetic carbon metabolism, especially
under stress condition. The goals of this study are to investigate
nuclear/mitochondrial communication in plants using synthesis and activation of
the alternative oxidase, and to investigate carbon/energy balance function of
the alternative pathway respiration employing transgenic plants. The goal will
be approached using genetic, molecular, biochemical and physiological analysis
of plants in which the alternative oxidase is altered and in in-vitro assays.
