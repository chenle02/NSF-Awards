Individual Antennapedia and Bithorax complex homeobox genes in Drosophila have
the remarkable property of speciying the identity of entire segments of the
larva during development. Current evidence indicates that these genes encode
transcription factors. Although a great deal is known about the structure and
regulation of the two homeobox genes complexes, the next tier of genes,
"downstream" genes, regulated by the homeotics have not been identified. The
PI's laboratory has characterized "enhancer trap" transposon insertions in
Drosophila whose expression of LacZ is now regulated by the homeotic gene
Antennapedia (Antp) in imaginal discs. These newly acquired instances of
regulation by Antp are presumably due to adjacent enhancer sequences. The
isolation and characterization of these sequences which are normally regulated
by Antp will allow for the generation of detailed patterns of expression of
genes normally expressed later in the developemnt of the imaginal discs and
which are under the control of Antp. These studies should aid in understanding
how the regulatory mechaninms for establishing patterns are connected to cell
differentiation as it occurs during morphogenesis.
