9418484 Negussey The project will investigate the causes and mechanisms that
contribute to mudslides and mudboils in the Tully Valley, New York State. Field
investigation will include boreholes in landslide sites and in undisturbed
ground along the limits of the slide, in-situ shear tests and pore pressure
transducers measurements and this information together with existing data will
be used to establish a stratigrahic section for stability analysis. Laboratory
tests on a series of consolidated undrained samples will be conducted to
investigate anisotropy. The results from the field and laboratory tests will be
used to select and verify appropriate soil models, to analyze stability using
limit equilibrium and finite element methods and aiming at identifying both the
landslide mechanisms and the sensitivity of the analysis to key parameters. The
results of this work will provide a better understanding of the landslide
process and the development of mitigation measures. ***
