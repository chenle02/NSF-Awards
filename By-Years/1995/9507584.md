Nontechnical Summary, Nevin J. IBN-9507584 "Resistance to Change, Preference,
and the Law of Effect" One of the oldest principles of psychology is the Law of
Effect, which states that rewards strengthen the behavior that produces them.
However, the relation between the value of a reward and its effectiveness in
strengthening behavior remains unclear. Over the past 20 years, PI has
interpreted the strength of behavior as the resistance of well-learned behavior
to change, and has shown that resistance to change depends directly on the
frequency or amount of reward signaled by a distinctive stimulus situation. At
the same time, methods for measuring reward value, interpreted as preference
between stimulus situations that signal various frequencies or amounts of
reward, have become progressively more precise. Both lines of research have led
to findings that are quite general across species and situations; however, no
research has attempted to measure preference and resistance to change at the
same time, in an individual subject, which is necessary to determine how these
measures are related to each other. The proposed experiments will study
preference and resistance to change in pigeons working for food rewards under a
variety of conditions designed to isolate a mathematical expression relating
them. That relation will be a quantitative statement of the Law of Effect.
