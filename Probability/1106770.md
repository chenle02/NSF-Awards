This research aims to explore the statistical mechanics of the nonlinear
Schrodinger equation (NLS) and other PDE and lattice models arising in physical
and biological systems. Recent work of the PI and others has established the
rigorous connection between the quantum many-body physics of Bose-Einstein
condensation (BEC) and the cubic NLS as its macroscopic model. The PI has also,
together with a collaborator, shown that the thermodynamics of the focusing
cubic discrete NLS are asymptotically exactly solvable in dimensions three and
higher, with a transition to a new, physically concentrated phase of BEC. She
aims to continue research on this and related models, including noisy quantum
systems, the classical Heisenberg model of ferromagnetism, theoretical and
computational quantum many-body systems, and the fractional nonlinear
Schrodinger equation model of electrons with probabilistic long-range
interactions as they move on DNA.

Statistical mechanics is a powerful approach for understanding phenomena whose
behavior emerges from the large-scale interaction of many microscopic particles.
Since statistical mechanics lies in the interface between several fields of
mathematics and theoretical physics, it has the potential for advancing our
knowledge of various physical and biological phenomena and their applications in
science and engineering. One cool physical phenomenon is Bose-Einstein
condensation, a state of matter close to absolute zero in which a gas of quantum
particles coalesces and behaves like a giant quantum particle, with important
applications to interferometry and possibly rogue waves and quantum computing.
Biological phenomena motivate other aspects of this research, including genetic
dynamics and applications to genetic mutations. Another goal is to establish
links with the physics and computational biology communities in order to study
these phenomena in laboratories and draw inspiration for future mathematical
research.
