This project is concerned with determination of the three- dimensional
molecular and crystal structures of biopolymers, primarily polysaccharides,
using x-ray fiber diffraction analysis. Such polymers do not form extensive
crystals that can be analyzed by traditional x-ray crystallography. However,
they can often be prepared as fibers consisting of more-or-less parallel
microcrystals. The structures of the polymers in such fibers can be determined
by supplementing the x-ray diffraction data with stereochemical information, and
optimizing model structures so that diffraction calculated from the model agrees
with that measured, as well as possible. The goals of this project are: (1) To
extend x- ray fiber diffraction technology by improving techniques for data
collection, allowing use of data from more disordered polymer specimens,
improving optimization of model structures and developing measures of accuracy;
and (2) to determine the structures of a variety of polysaccharides of
biological and industrial importance and so identify the intra- and inter-
molecular interactions that are the molecular basis of their important
properties. %%% The significance of this research is that: (1) It will allow
x-ray diffraction analysis of biopolymers to be applied with more precision and
more routinely, and to a wider range of biological polymers and assemblies.
These developments will impact not only its applications to polysaccharides, but
also to nucleic acids, helical viruses and membrane proteins that form
disordered planar arrays. (2) The polysaccharide molecular structures and
interactions determined will help us and others to understand why these
molecules have the properties they do, and that such knowledge will both prompt
and discipline further useful inquiries. Specific information to be expected
includes the molecular basis of the useful viscosity properties of solutions of
bacterial polysaccharides such as xanthan, acetan, wellan, and XM6, and the
plant polysaccharide konjac mannan; and relationships between the molecular
structures and biological functions of a number of polysaccharides that are
important components of mammalian connective tissue and the exoskeleton of
insects and crustaceans, that are antigens to some bacterial pathogens, and that
are important in the process of nitrogen fixation.
