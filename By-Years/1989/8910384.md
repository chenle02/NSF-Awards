The maintenance of high plasmid stability and efficient protein secretion are
important for the enhancement of intracellular and extracellular protein
production in recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A major objective of the
research outlined in this proposal is to study plasmid stability and cloned gene
expression in complex media. With the proper choice of a plasmid, selection for
plasmid-containing cells occurs regardless of the nutrient medium used. A
detailed experimental plan has been described, focusing on the effects of medium
enrichment on cloned gene product synthesis. The results of the research will
indicate the potential of autoselection systems for the production of
heterologous proteins. Another primary emphasis of the proposed work is protein
secretion. Various genetic and environmental factors will be manipulated to
determine their influence on the efficiency of protein secretion. In particular,
the influence of promoter strength and transcription rate, the induction of
protein secretion, and secretion in complex media will be investigated. For both
areas of research, the initial work will be experimental. It is anticipated that
certain avenues of research will be amenable to kinetic modeling.
