Texas State Technical College at Waco is awarding scholarships to academically
talented, but financially disadvantaged, students studying for Associate of
Applied Science (A.A.S.) degrees in the fields of computer science or
engineering technology. The value of each scholarship is $3030 per year and is
awarded in semester increments of $1010 to students enrolled on a full-time
basis. In addition, to the normal academic work and the availability of
traditional tutorial assistance and counseling student services, the scholarship
recipients are receiving training in time and resource management, communication
skills, and interpersonal skills. It is anticipated that competence in these
areas will enhance their attractiveness to employers.
