Convergent evolution provides a unique window into the process of adaptation.
Replicated adaptations can range from morphological similarity to parallel
molecular changes. Convergence at the molecular level may occur through either
structural or regulatory changes and may be constrained by pleiotropic effects.
The proposed research investigates the molecular basis for multiple convergent
floral color adaptations to hawkmoth pollination. The degree of molecular
convergence in the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway will be determined using a
combination of biochemistry, DNA sequencing and gene expression analysis. This
study will determine the extent of molecular convergence and evolutionary
constraint during adaptation, a fundamental process of evolution.

This study will have a direct impact on our understanding of how new adaptations
arise. In a time of global climate change, organisms will be faced with
unprecedented rates of environmental change. Their ability to adapt to these new
environments will be of utmost importance in maintaining biodiversity.
Evolutionary constraints on adaptations could partly determine the fate of many
plant and animal species. A better understanding of the molecular basis for
adaptations may help predict those species that are in peril of extinction and
help guide conservation priorities to avoid extinctions due to global warming.
