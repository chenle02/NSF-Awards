The ATLAST Project will sponsor a series of ten regional workshops during the
summers of 1992 and 1993 on the use of software in teaching linear algebra.
Workshop participants will learn how to use existing commercial linear algebra
software packages and how to effectively incorporate these packages into their
courses. Participants will also be expected to design their own computing
exercises and projects at a level suitable for assignment in an undergraduate
linear algebra class. These exercises will be class tested during the school
year following the workshop, revised if necessary, and then submitted to the
project director for inclusion in a database. The databases from each of the
summer workshops will be edited, printed as manuals, and distributed to the
workshop participants. The project director will select the best exercises from
the manuals for inclusion in a special ATLAST Project book which will be
published by one of the mathematics societies.
