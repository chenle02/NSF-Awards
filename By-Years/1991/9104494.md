Prolactin (PRL) is a hormone which is very important in the regulation of salt
and water balance, and in reproduction and in the stimulation of mammary growth
and function. The pituitary of bony fishes is an attractive system for studying
prolactin (PRL) secretion. Unique among vertebrate animals, teleost PRL cells
are segregated as a nearly homogeneous mass which is easily separated for study
in isolation from other body systems. Also, these PRL cells can be maintained in
their normal cell-cell associations for at least two weeks in culture dishes.
These features facilitate the achievement of the goals of this project which are
to characterize PRL secretory mechanisms using normal (i.e. not cancerous)
tissues. Studies will be directed toward the examination of several peptide and
steroid hormones that may be important regulators of PRL cell function. These
factors will be used to continue the characterization of the mechanisms that
control PRL cells. Companion studies will examine the manner in which the PRL
cell responds to osmotic pressure. These studies will help to clarify how the
secretion of the hormones that control salt and water balance is regulated.//
