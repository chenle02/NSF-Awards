This research concerns the breakup of small diameter jets of liquid.
Experimental research will be conducted on a water jet that has had its surface
heated periodically along its length. The growth of perturbations imposed on the
jet will be measured in order to establish the amplification rate as a function
of wavenumber. Of particular interest is the ability to control the breakup
process through variation in the frequency, amplitude and duty cycle of an
imposed square wave heating cycle.
