This project is concerned with international travel support to a planning
workshop on "Universals n the Lexicon", to be held in Schlos Dagstuhl of
Germany. The objective of this workshop is to examine the intersection of
computational linguistics, computational lexicography, text corpora, knowledge
representation, lexical semantics, and natural language processing. Lexicon
research plays a pivotal role in electronic library, machine translation,
natural language understanding, and knowledge processing. An intensive
discussion among experts in various relevant techniques is essential to the
advance of these fields. This workshop will bring about significant
understandings in both theoretical and practical aspects of lexicon research and
its impact on electronic library, machine translation, natural language
understanding, and knowledge processing.//
