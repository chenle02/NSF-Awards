The National Plant Genome Initiative was launched in FY1998 as a long-term
project to explore the structure and function of plant genomes. Its goals are to
ensure that useful properties of plants can be understood, improved, and
ultimately harnessed to address national needs, including agriculture,
nutrition, energy, environment, and health. A five-year plan was developed to
guide the program during its inauguration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program has
made significant progress to date, and the NPGI must begin to develop objectives
for its next phase. To provide input to this planning process, the National
Research Council will form a study group consisting of experts in genomics,
plant biology, informatics, and other relevant fields of science. The study
group will organize a 3 day workshop to: (1) identify key scientific questions
that might be answered in the next five years; (2) consider the relative
priorities of additional sequencing, functional genomics and proteomics within
the initiative; (3) examine the potential to use bioinformatics and biological
tools that are available or emerging, and; (4) describe the tools,
infrastructure, and human resources that are needed to successfully address key
scientific questions identified by the workshop
participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following the workshop, the study group will
write a report summarizing its assessment of the key scientific directions and
recommending priorities for the plant genome initiative for the next five years.
The report will be published and made available on the web. The report will be
delivered by the end of August 2002.&lt;br/&gt;
