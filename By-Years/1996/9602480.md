There are an estimated 500,000 Alu repetitive DNA elements in the genome
(chromosomes) of humans and other primate species. Most of the repeats have
arisen in the evolutionary past (some 10 to 20 million years ago), others are
still arising at new genomic sites; thus their total number keeps increasing. It
is important to understand the mode of spreading of these Alu elements. The
objective of this proposal is to establish if, and to what extent, Alu repeats
are fixed or transient (polymorphic) in our genome; whether they arise in
reversible or irreversible mechanisms. Polymorphism greatly complicates genetic
analyses by blurring the distinction between meaningful and meaningless changes.
The fixed or polymorphic state of a character is impossible to predict, it has
to be established by analyzing large numbers of individuals. If the mode by
which Alu repeats spread can be established as being irreversible, Alu's can be
viewed as solid landmarks in the evolutionary dynamics of our genome and will
become invaluable tools for phylogenetic analyses.
