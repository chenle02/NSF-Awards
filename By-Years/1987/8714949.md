This project deals with the fabrication of bulk high Tc (> 77K) superconducting
metal oxide composite material that could be formed into sheets, ribbons, and
possible wires. The materials would be random composites consisting of small
metal particles randomly dispersed throughout a host of superconducting oxide.
The specific aim of the research is to develop a composite that retains the
desirable electrical and magnetic properties of the superconducting phase (e.g.,
zero electrical resistance, a high superconducting transition temperature (Tc >
77K) and magnetic screening) but whose mechanical properties are modified to
improve strength and toughness.
