9419521 McCracken This award provides funding for one year under the "Self-
Sufficient Partnership for Research" Program and a project entitled "Studying
Group Support Technology at I/UCRC Centers" to Georgia Institute of
Technology/University of Arizona's Industry/University Cooperative Research
Center for Information Management Research. The Center continues to meet the
renewal criteria of the I/UCRC Program. The Center project will study how a set
of commercial software tools (Group System V) could be used to support decision
making in an I/UCRC. The study will determine the equipment availability at all
I/UCRC universities studying the economics viability of setting up the system in
I/UCRCs and run four implementation tasks at I/UCRCs. The researchers are
eminently qualified to perform the Center's research project. The Program
Manager recommends Georgia Institute of Technology (including the University of
Arizona subcontract) be awarded $100,000 for one year.
