With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Toledo will acquire a
powder X-ray diffractometer. This equipment will enhance research in a number of
areas including studies on a) negative thermal expansion materials; b) thin film
voltaics; c) heterometallic sulfide-bridged clusters as precursors to mixed-
metal sulfide catalysts; d) microcrystalline examination of enzymes structural
changes; and e) analysis of crystalline protein/DNA complexes. The X-ray
diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three
dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and it
provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of the molecule
relative to the neighboring molecules. These studies will have an impact in a
number of areas, especially biochemistry and materials science.
