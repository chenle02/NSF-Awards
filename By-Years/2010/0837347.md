Chemistry(12) Following a careful assessment of the current curriculum, faculty
in the departments of chemistry and biology are developing and implementing
inquiry-based learning experiences for several upper level laboratory courses. A
new laboratory course is being developed for Advanced Biochemistry, which in the
past was only lecture, and revisions are also occurring in Biochemical
Techniques to incorporate inquiry-based exercises into some experiments. The
Advanced Biochemistry laboratory consists of two phases, with the second phase
being student designed research projects. The first phase focuses on acquisition
and application of skills based on the expression and characterization of
chlorophyllase from Triticum asetivum. This project is broadening participation
of underrepresented groups because nearly three-fourths of the biology and
chemistry majors are female and three-fifths are first generation college
students. In addition, the newly developed inquiry-based laboratory experiments
are of interest to faculty teaching biochemistry and molecular biology at
similar institutions.
