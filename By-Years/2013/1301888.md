The investigator will work on several problems in higher dimensional algebraic
geometry, especially moduli theory and singularities. In several projects joint
with Kollár, the PI plans to work on various problems related to the existence
of a coarse moduli space of stable log varieties, an analog of the moduli space
of stable pointed curves. These include the study of rational pairs and thrifty
resolutions and their connections with Du Bois singularities and other
singularities of the minimal model program. In another project, also motivated
by the moduli project, jointly with Patakfalvi the PI will work on proving a
logarithmic version of Kollár's Ampleness Lemma and use it to prove the
projectivity of the moduli space of stable log varieties. The PI will also
continue his work on the refined Viehweg conjecture regarding subvarieties of
moduli stacks of canonically polarized smooth projective varieties. This
conjecture evolved from a landmark conjecture of Shafarevich, and its solution
by Arakelov and Parshin, which played an important role in Faltings' proof of
the Mordell Conjecture. This project is joint work with Kebekus.

This research is in the field of algebraic geometry, one of the oldest parts of
modern mathematics, but one that blossomed to the point where it has solved
problems that have stood for centuries. Originally, and still in its simplest
form it treats figures defined in the plane by polynomials. Today, the field
uses methods not only from algebra, but also from analysis and topology, and
conversely it is extensively used in those fields. Moreover it has proved itself
useful in fields as diverse as physics, theoretical computer science,
cryptography, coding theory and robotics. A central problem in algebraic
geometry is the classification of all geometric objects. In turn, an important
part of classification theory is the theory of moduli. The latter's core idea is
that one does not only want to understand these objects, but also understand the
way they can be deformed. Moduli spaces play a very important role in
theoretical physics. Studying curves on moduli spaces provides information on
how an object is changing in space-time. One of the focuses of this project is
on compact moduli spaces. Those are extensions of moduli spaces in general and
they give additional information about singular deformations, ones that are
essentially different from others.
