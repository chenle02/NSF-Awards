ADVANCE Institutional Transformation (IT) awards focus on transforming an entire
institutional setting to be a more equitable academic environment for women
scientists. Oregon State University (OSU) will create an equitable work
environment for women and others from traditionally underrepresented groups
through a series of new and unique programs. These programs will focus on
educating university faculty and administrators about how gender,
race/ethnicity, and social class combine to disadvantage women in academic
Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). The centerpiece will
be a new program called Difference, Power, and Discrimination (DPD) where
faculty will be educated on how gender-based inequality in the workplace can be
removed through changing our behaviors. Activities aimed at recognizing and
reducing discrimination of women and underrepresented groups in STEM can be used
at other universities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of OREGON STATE ADVANCE is
to transform the institution's climate, structures, and relationships to create
an equitable and just workplace. OREGON STATE ADVANCE will institutionalize
supportive policies and processes and revolutionize understandings,
relationships, and practices by fostering greater comprehension of the roles
difference and power play in social institutions. Progression toward this goal
will be guided by three major objectives: (1) Recruit, retain, and promote more
women STEM faculty across the majority of OSU's Colleges by building upon
established initiatives and implementing new policies and programs that will
lead to a significant increase of women STEM faculty at OSU; (2) Recognize the
importance of gender's intersections with race/ethnicity, social class, and
other axes of oppression in affecting women's lives; (3) Develop OSU's
Difference, Power, and Discrimination (DPD) faculty development program to
provide targeted educational opportunities for STEM faculty and administrators.
Theorists have developed a well-defined understanding of systems of oppression.
OREGON STATE ADVANCE operationalizes these theories within an effort to
transform the institution through changing behavior, relationships, policies,
procedures, and structures. Additionally, researchers have found that "sense-
making" activities further institutional transformation. This project will
examine the impact of utilizing systems of oppression theories as a way of
helping administrators and faculty understand the ways difference, power, and
privilege construct institutional experiences, disadvantaging women in STEM
fields. Additionally, the project assesses the effects of understanding
oppression on institutional transformation and an improved climate for women in
STEM. In very tangible terms, the availability of OREGON STATE ADVANCE
individuals and teams to lead DPD seminars at other institutions and the
provision of summer institutes and online support resources offer an opportunity
for widespread influence for the project. Additionally, the development of a
peer-reviewed online ADVANCE journal will further disseminate ADVANCE findings,
as well as other research on women and other underrepresented groups in STEM.
