This is the third phase of a three-part study of study interdistrict variation
in case processing, sentencing, and organizational culture in the Federal
Criminal Justice System (FCJS). Phase III will consist of a nationwide survey of
all federal judges sitting in federal criminal court, all U.S. Attorneys, Chief
Federal Probation Officers, and Chief Federal Public Defenders, and a random
sample (stratified by circuit and district size) of Assistant U.S. Attorneys,
Federal Public Defenders, private attorneys regularly practicing federal
criminal law, and Federal Probation Officers. Phase III will draw upon the
insights derived from the first two phases of the research to develop a survey
instrument and collect nationwide quantitative data on federal district court
community actors, relationships, practices, and culture. Specifically, the
survey will focus on the following conceptual categories: 1) routine case
processing strategies, 2) interorganizational relations between court community
sponsoring agencies, 3) individual court community actors' characteristics and
attitudes, and 4) court community culture/norms. The PIs will combine these data
with existing USSC sentencing data and Urban Institute case processing data, and
with aggregate contextual data on district characteristics. The PIs will also
make the survey dataset available to other researchers by putting it in the
ICPSR dataset archives.
