A core Facility for intensive computer and molecular graphics is proposed for
the recently expanded research initiative in Molecular Biophysics at Washington
University School of Medicine. This expansion during the past two years had
included: (a) recruitment of six new faculty whose research is on molecular
biophysics of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, (b) construction of new
faculty research laboratories, a new NMR facility and an x-ray structure
facility. The requested instrumentation is a cluster of minisupercomputer
workstations and associated peripherals that will provide optimum
cost/performance characteristics for both the compute-intensive and molecular
graphics needs of the biophysics group comprised of the new and previously-
present faculty plus one or two additional projected recruitments (8-10
laboratories total). Research projects that will be critically dependent on the
new Computational Core facility include: (a) crystallographic refinement on a
number of protein structures being solved with use of the current Xuong-Hamlin
area detector, (b) distance geometry and simulated annealing analysis of NMR
data for protein, nucleic acid and lipid system, (c) computational modeling of
structural and thermodynamic properties of proteins and the development of
improved macromolecular potential energy functions, and (d) modeling and
analysis of the dynamics, energetics and linkages in large systems of
macromolecules, including blood-clotting cascades, protein-DNA complexes and
cytoskeletal systems.
