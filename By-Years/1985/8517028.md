Masonry construction comprises a large portion of building construction in the
U.S. and the world. Reinforced masonry construction use is increasing in
moderate to higher seismic zones because of its apparent features of economy,
fire safety, architectural flexibility, and ease of construction. The present
state of masonry structural analysis and design and materials and construction
technologies does not enable an accurate prediction of building behavior under
lateral loads such as seismic loads. This research project is an experimental
and analytical investigation of the seismic response of concrete plank
diaphragms. Many masonry buildings are constructed with floor slab systems
consisting of concrete planks. The first of two tasks will be full-scale
experimental tests of concrete diaphragm slabs. The second task will integrate
existing diaphragm data with the experimental test data to determine the
behavioral and strength characteristics.
