This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
develop and demonstrate a multidimensional protein/peptide
separation/concentration platform, capable of reducing the range of relative
protein abundances by "balancing" or "leveling" the concentrations of the
protein complement. Such selective enhancement toward low abundance proteins can
drastically reduce the range of relative protein abundances in complex samples
and significantly enhance the dynamic range and sensitivity of conventional mass
spectrometry toward global proteomic studies using small cell populations or
limited tissue samples.

The commercial application of this project is in the area of proteomics. The
development of the proposed bioanalytical methodologies are expected to be
valuable in screening / drug discovery efforts by bio-pharmaceutical companies.
