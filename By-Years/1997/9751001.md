Science illiteracy is prevalent in our student population. Although students
have been exposed to sophisticated technology in their daily lives, they have a
difficult time grasping abstract biological concepts. They also lack the ability
to collect, collate and analyze data. The purpose of this proposal is to enhance
laboratory experiments by creating a virtual laboratory. Software in this
laboratory will allow students to extend laboratory exercises to include
variables not examined in their "hands on" experiments. Computer simulations
will be used to perform experiments requiring quantitative data analysis.
Students will have to "collect" collate and analyze their computer-simulated
data. Students will perform virtual experiments that are not currently included
in the non-majors' biology laboratory because of time constraints or the lack of
necessary equipment. Computers with internet capability and commercially
available software will be used to establish the virtual biology laboratory.
Software designed by faculty to meet our students' specific needs will be
introduced in the future. Internet access will be available for students to
collaborate with other institutions in the design and implementation of three
virtual experiments. This project will influence nearly 2,000 students during
the two year period of this study. The project will increase students'
understanding of biological concepts, increase critical thinking skills and
stimulate the imagination and interest of our students. This project will
increase retention of students enrolled in this course and lead to an increase
in overall science enrollment. Results of this study will be disseminated
through meeting presentations and in appropriate journal articles.
