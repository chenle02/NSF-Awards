We will build upon the latest advances in atomic and optical physics to develop
novel approaches to quantum information processing with neutral atoms. We will
study the feasibility of realizing basic elements of quantum computing
architecture, such as quantum gates and long-lived quantum memory with divalent
atoms held in specially-engineered "magic" optical traps.

The research will be carried out in Nevada, one of the EPSCoR (Experimental
Program to Stimulate Competitive Research) states, underrepresented in the
scientific enterprise. The work will fulfill one of the strategic goals of the
NSF to "broaden participation and enhance diversity in NSF programs."
