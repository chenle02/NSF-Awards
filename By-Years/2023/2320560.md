This proposal aims to acquire a High-Speed Volumetric Particle Tracking
Velocimetric (VTPV) system capable of tracking the three-dimensional position of
multiple particles within a measurement fluid volume, and subsequent calculation
of velocity, or acceleration of the particles. Active research projects that
would benefit from the instrument range from blood pumps to miniature medical
devices to microplastics transport in the environment. The list of active
research projects is expected to grow with new opportunities and collaborations.
The proposed system will improve Rochester Institute of Technologyâ€™s ability to
conduct leading-edge research by enhancing the infrastructure for research and
education. Specifically, planned research and training at Rochester Institute of
Technology and the region includes (1) student training and research, (2) two
new multidisciplinary courses, and (3) training workshops.

The proposed VTPV instrument is comprised of high intensity laser illumination,
a set of digital cameras, and specialized optics that are integrated with
dedicated synchronization hardware and image processing software. Each of the
five projects described has previously benefitted from acquisition of two-
dimensional fluid or particle data with the existing outdated 2D measurement
system. The new data to be acquired by the proposed three-dimensional high-speed
system will increase quantitative understanding of underlying flow physics, and
in some cases, providing the first ever quantitative data relevant for the
application.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
