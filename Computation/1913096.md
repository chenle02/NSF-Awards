This project focuses on developing reliable and efficient computational methods
for solving equations obtained from discretization of elliptic partial
differential equations that arise in engineering and science. The methods are
expected to be of direct use in the fast solution of various problems in
electrostatics and materials engineering and also to have utility in
accelerating computations associated with numerical methods for time dependent
simulations. The project will extend a class of highly stable orthogonal methods
based on sparse banded representations to equations with more complicated
structures than have been considered before in the context of this class of
algorithms. The stability and efficiency of the methods will be analyzed and an
efficient software implementation of all the methods will be developed and
released.

The project involves the development of fast direct algorithms for elliptic
partial differential equations. The methods are based on Givens-weight
techniques that exploit rank structure in order to limit fill-in when computing
a QR or LQ factorization. There are four main components to the project: The
extension of orthogonal Givens-weight algorithms to strongly admissible rank
structures, the development of efficient block operations acting on blocks that
are obtained from discretization of particular subdomains, the analysis of the
methods for numerical stability and complexity, and the development of an
efficient software library implementing the algorithms. The overarching goal is
to bridge a gap between the more flexible classes of methods that have uncertain
numerical stability and the highly stable orthogonal methods that are applicable
only to problems with a restricted weakly admissible rank structure. The
techniques used are expected to lead to algorithms with linear or near-linear
complexity, good practical efficiency, and provable backward stability.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
