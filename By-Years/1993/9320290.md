9320290 CUKER This renewal proposal is to strengthen and expand the linkages
between minority students and careers in the aquatic sciences. It is built
around a three point program: 1. Continuing support for the initial group of
participants, helping them to mature into active aquatic scientists, and
bringing them to higher levels of participation in the American Society for
Limnology and Oceanography (ASLO); 2. Bringing in new participants, emphasizing
a representation of Hispanic, Native American, and Pacific Islanders, as well as
African Americans; 3. Developing a series of innovative linkage activities
centered around annual summer ASLO meetings. ASLO has been a major participant
in this program by providing free memberships for the students and faculties
supported by this program.
