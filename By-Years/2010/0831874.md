Abstract for proposal #0831874 &lt;br/&gt;Energy constraint has persisted as a
fundamental problem in sensor networks, especially when the networks are
required to operate for a long time. Although many solutions have been proposed
to address the problem, their limitations are salient: resource-conservation
schemes can slow down energy consumption but cannot compensate energy depletion;
current environmental resource harvesting schemes have low, unstable efficiency
due to uncontrollable environmental conditions and technological limitations;
incremental deployment may cause environment pollution and may be too costly.
This project leverages the emerging wireless energy charging technology to
address the problem from a brand new perspective. Specifically, a hierarchical
architecture is first proposed to include an energy provision station as the
stable source of energy, a few autonomous mobile energy chargers, and a large
number of sensor nodes. On top of the architecture, schemes are developed to
solve a unique three-tier, long-term, multiple-time and on-line scheduling
problem present in resource replenishment. The architecture and schemes are
evaluated through prototyping and extensive experiments. The project will
potentially transform the current research on energy management in sensor
networks, improve the sensor network performance from both practical and
theoretical aspects, and thus promote the wider application of sensor networks
in structural health monitoring, smart factories, garden/orchid monitoring,
road/traffic monitoring and so on. It will also train a diverse cadre of young
scientists, students and professionals for network research and applications.
