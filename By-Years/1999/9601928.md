9601928 Curran University of Pittsburgh This award from the Academic Research
Infrastructure (ARI) Program will assist the Department of Chemistry at the
University of Pittsburgh to acquire an upgrade of the existing 500 MHz NMR, new
consoles for three existing 300 MHz NMRs and construction of a computer network
for all the NMR computing resources. This equipment will enhance research in a
number of areas including the following: (1) organic synthesis - development of
new synthetic methods and mechanistic organic chemistry; total synthesis of
marine natural products; radical chemistry and synthesis of therapeutically
important target molecules (2) molecular recognition and bioorganic chemistry -
new syntheses of host-guest systems and new molecular complexes and self-
assembling systems; mechanisms of action of vitamins K and E, non-kekule
molecules and free radical ring expansion; investigations of DNA duplexes and
photoacoustic calorimetry (3) inorganic chemistry - conjugation in inorganic
molecules; investigating photochemistry of Mo(V) oxo bridges dimers and (4)
polymer chemistry - studies of polymer surfactants of uncommon architecture;
ring-opening metathesis polymerization and chemical recycling. Nuclear Magnetic
Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists for
the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown
substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to
study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to
state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out
frontier research. The results from these NMR studies are useful in the areas
such as polymers, catalysis, and in biology.
