The Environmental Engineering Laboratory at Cooper Union is being improved for
undergraduate instruction, experiments, and research projects with an upflow
packed-bed bioreactor and other pilot and bench-top units. The bioreactor and
other pilot units are used in conjunction with mutant bacteria cultures to
demonstrate and study their effectiveness and kinetics in treating industrial
and/or toxic wastewaters and sludges. The instruments and equipment are used for
sampling, monitoring, and analyzing various quality parameters in the raw and
treated wastes, as well as studying their biodegradability and/or toxicity. The
Environmental Engineering Laboratory also supports several undergraduate
experimental projects per year, and is used for demonstration and instructional
purposes in several Civil and Chemical Engineering Department courses.
