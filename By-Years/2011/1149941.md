The past decade has witnessed a surge of scientific inquiry on aspects of legal
geography, including work by human geographers and legal scholars as well as
sociologists, criminologists, and anthropologists, among others. This area of
research has historically addressed the spatial and human dynamics surrounding
various legal phenomena, including property, racial segregation and
discrimination, policing practices, prison settings, and various other relevant
aspects of society (urban, home, borders, etc.). The proposed workshop will
advance the study of legal geography by exploring several new perspectives on
spatiality. The present focus engages contemporary spatial theory to expand
conceptions of space to include the domains of meaning, representation,
discourse, and ideology. In this context, the proposed workshop will encourage
collaboration in new areas of socio-legal inquiry, including environmental,
civil rights, immigration, international, punishment, intellectual property, and
labor laws.

The workshop will bring together social and spatial scientists, and legal
scholars, to discuss these new perspectives and to explore diverse
methodological approaches to addressing such issues. The intellectual merit of
this workshop proposal rests on its ability to engage an emerging field of
interdisciplinary social science and the law, and to encourage further social
and spatial science theory that might enhance our understanding of the
development and implementation of law. The workshop will promote the inclusion
of junior scholars in this area, and has great potential for improving the
training and practice of law.
