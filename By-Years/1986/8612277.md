The primary objective of this project is to research the status and trends in
the law of public liability for losses due to natural hazards including
earthquakes, floods, mudflows, and mudfloods, avalanches and other hazards. The
project will build upon past research efforts dealing with individual natural
hazards with emphasis upon updating earlier work, synthesis and analysis. The
project will analyze commonalities and differences between hazards, trends in
the law and possible technological implications of these trends with regard to
prediction and warning systems, building and hazard reduction works (e.g.,
dams), and the design and the permitting of private buildings. A secondary
objective o> the project will be to assess the impact of court decisions upon 20
communities through a questionnaire and a telephone survey. Based upon both the
legal research and survey the study will identify strategies for reducing the
impacts of earthquakes and other natural hazards without generating liability
problems. The project final report will be of use to agencies, engineers,
architects and others designing, constructing or operating loss reduction
programs and to local governments concerned about legal liability issues. The
investigator is qualified to carry out this project which builds on previous
work he has done in the hazard reduction field. An award is recommended.
