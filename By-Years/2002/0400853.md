This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial biology for
FY2004. The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of
protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are
not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides
opportunities for recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in
microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of
established scientists, and to broaden their scientific horizons beyond the
research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These
fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their
research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves
of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign
locations.

The research and training plan is entitled "The effect of environment on
microbial diversity." Diversity is a fundamental property of microbial
populations and important to understanding their ecological role. This research
involves modeling spatial and temporal patterns of microbial diversity to
understand what shapes this diversity. In particular, it investigates the effect
of living in different types of habitats on the diversity and genetic structure
of microbial populations by studying the scaling properties of genealogical
trees of populations and the dynamic behavior of these trees, using both
analytic results and dynamic simulations, and comparing these results with
experimental sequence data in Burkholderia cepacia, a widespread bacterium which
is found in many different ecological niches and is also economically and
epidemiologically important.
