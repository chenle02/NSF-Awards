This project involves research on two topics. The first project is an applied
analysis of a theory of the growing wage premium between skilled and unskilled
workers, with a focus on the interaction of the relative price of unskilled
labor and the relative price of capital equipment. The basic theme in this
project is that unskilled workers and capital equipment are good substitutes,
and that capital equipment and skilled workers are relatively complementary.
This theory suggests that declines in the price of unskilled labor will be tied
to declines in the relative price of capital. A production function that
explicitly distinguishes between capital structures and equipment, and between
skilled and unskilled labor is developed, and the parameters of the production
function are estimated using annual data from the CPS. The production function
is then used to evaluate the extent to which the theory is consistent with
historical variations in the wage premium. Preliminary results suggest that the
rapid decline in the price of equipment, coupled with strong growth in the stock
of capital, has been an important factor in growing wage inequality between
skilled and unskilled labor over the past 30 years. The second topic is the
development of a framework for evaluating dynamic equilibrium models, and the
application of this framework to the analysis of recent models in macroeconomics
and international economics. It is shown that the framework is a flexible and
very useful tool for analyzing dynamic general equilibrium economies, as it is
based on the realistic assumption that all models are misspecified. In addition,
the framework is graphical, allowing the user to assess visually and quickly the
dimensions on which the model performs well, it provides a common set of tools
that can be used by researchers with different objectives and interests, and it
develops new procedures for conducting inference in small samples. Extensions of
the methodology, and applications to substantive economic models are also
undertaken.
