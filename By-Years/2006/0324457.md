This award, under the MPS Internships in Public Science Education Program, will
support a collaboration between the University of Chicago and SciTech Hands-On-
Museum to present science research and basic science to a broad public. The
project will involve students and faculty from the University of Chicago and
scientific and technical staff at SciTech Hands-On-Museum (Aurora, IL). Graduate
students from several disciplines will be trained in and participate in the
presentation of scientific knowledge, especially the conceptual design of museum
exhibits. They will develop and implement projects and exhibits for SciTech.
Ideas for projects will come from research work being performed at Chicago.
Programs at Chicago that will help the students with projects include the
Materials Research Science and Engineering Center, the Center for Cosmological
Physics, the High Energy Physics group and the Computation Institute.
Information about the exhibits and evaluation results will be disseminated via a
web page, presentations to an advisory committee and through national and
international conferences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded by the MPS
Office of Multidisciplinary Activities&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
