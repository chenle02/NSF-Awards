This project applies insights from the theory of growth that have developed over
the last five years. The fundamental challenge taken up by this theory is to
understand the role and determinants of technological change. Four suggestions
for applying and developing the theory are proposed. The first considers the
relative importance of physical capital accumulation and the training of
scientific and engineering talent in determining the rate of growth. The second
considers the issues raised by international trade in a model of growth, with
emphasis on possible "brain drain" type flows of skilled individuals from less
advanced to more advanced countries. The third considers the issue of whether
the different growth experiences of different countries are determined largely
by policy decisions or instead have a large element of chance. The fourth
considers the unique role that military research may play in influencing the
rate and direction of technological change, especially in the United States. It
has been argued that the earlier (1950's-style) growth theory died when it
failed to link up with empirically-oriented macroeconomists. The recent
theoretical work may be saved a similar fate if the empirical study undertaken
by this project enables the scientific investigation of fundamental policy
questions about growth.
