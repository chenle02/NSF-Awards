This project will develop a technique for predicting the energization of solar
wind ions in the Earth's bow shock and the trasport of the energized ions into
the magnetosphere. The project can be divided into 5 objectives: (1) determine
how wolar wind ions are energized at the quasi-parallel bow shock, (2) map the
connection from the quasi-parallel shock to the magnetospheric cusp and the
ionospheric footprint of the cusp, (3) determine how the energized ions are
transported from the shock region into the cusp, (4) determine the impact the
accelerated ions have on the ionosphere as a function of solar wind conditions
and the orientation of the interplanetary magnetic field, and (5) develop a
technique for predicting energetic ions in the cusp based on solar wind
conditions. The project will utilize data from a variety of satellites and will
include a collaboration with Slovak scientist, Dr. K. Kudela, who will help with
the access and interpretation of data from the Interball satellite. Three-
dimensional hybrid simulations will be used to model the shock heating and
transport processes and the model results will be compared with the satellite
data.
