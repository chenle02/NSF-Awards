Many stars form in large clusters containing anywhere from thousands to many
millions of objects. Stars in these clusters are born with a broad range of
masses. Furthermore, the most massive stars evolve quickly, ending their lives
in just a few million years and leaving behind black holes as remnants. The star
clusters themselves, however, can continue to live for many billions of years,
and indeed the globular clusters seen in many galaxies are thought to contain
some of the oldest stars in the Universe. Therefore, many of the star clusters
we see today should contain large numbers of black holes formed a long time ago.
This research will use state-of-the-art supercomputer simulations to study the
formation and evolution of these black holes in a variety of star cluster
environments. It will also leverage innovative hybrid computational techniques,
including General-Purpose computing on Graphics Processing Units
(GPGPU).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of black hole formation and evolution is
important in many areas of physics and&amp;#8232;astronomy, including galaxy
formation and cosmology, the study of quasars and other
active&amp;#8232;galactic nuclei, general relativity and gravitational wave
astronomy. The stellar dynamics supercomputer codes to be developed for this
project are general tools, which will be useful&amp;#8232;for studying many
other problems involving dense star clusters with or without massive
black&amp;#8232;holes. The planned research activities will involve the training
of undergraduate students at Northwestern University, and will likely include
students from under-represented minorities. Graduate students&amp;#8232;will
also receive training and mentoring. Outreach activities are also planned that
will take&amp;#8232;advantage of Dearborn Observatory on the Northwestern campus
in Evanston, as well as the resources of the nearby Adler Planetarium and
Astronomy Museum in Chicago.
