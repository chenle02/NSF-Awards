Project TEAM (Technology, Empowerment, and Mathematics) is a three-year effort
to enhance mathematics learning of elementary and middle school students,
through teacher enhancement, in the Boston Public Schools. TEAM builds on the
successful NSF-funded EMAT (Elementary Mathematics and Technology) Project,
which also was conducted in Boston. The project will complete the preparation of
two mathematics teacher leaders in every elementary school in Boston and will
develop a cadre of middle school mathematics teacher leaders in each of Boston's
middle schools. In each year of the project, a cadre of forty teachers (20
elementary, 20 middle school) will participate in a two-week summer institute,
followed by monthly meetings during the academic year. Leadership teams will be
established within each cadre. Academic year activity includes implementation of
project ideas in participants' classroom, continued inservice each month, and
telecommunications networking among participants. In the second and third years
of the project, participants will conduct inservice activities with Eisenhower
support at the local level. Typical sessions in the previous project were 15
hours long. Existing curriculum material produced in the Boston area will serve
as a basis for teacher adaptation and revision. The project is initiated by the
Boston Public Schools, and involves collaboration with mathematics educators at
Boston University and the University of Massachusetts at Boston. Cost sharing is
provided by the Boston Public Schools as 76% of the NSF award.
