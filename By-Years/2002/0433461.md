This award joins the University of Central Florida as a full university research
site, with the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for e-Design: IT
Enabled Design and Realization of Engineered Products and Systems at the
University of Pittsburgh and University of Massachusetts at Amherst. The joint
research efforts of faculty will form a coalition that seeks to realize the
following objectives: 1) inclusion of a multidisciplinary viewpoint needed to
ensure the development of a new paradigm of excellence in the design of
engineered products and/or systems; 2) realization of conceptual modeling tools
aimed at reducing design cycle time and ensuring maximum achievement of design
goals for human use; 3) realization of an environment for economic and supply
chain optimization design; and 4) establishment of a critical mass of expertise
focused on the development of an e-design modeling and simulation software
platform and virtual prototyping tools.
