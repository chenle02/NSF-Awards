A request is made to fund additional and back-up instrumentation on the R/V
Thomas Thompson, a 274? general purpose Global research vessel and the R/V
Clifford Barnes, a 66? general purpose Coastal vessel. Both vessels are operated
by the University of Washington as part of the University-National Oceanographic
Laboratory System research fleet. The request includes four items listed by
priority:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Meteorological sensor suite for R/V Thompson
&lt;br/&gt;2) Meteorological sensor suite for R/V Barnes &lt;br/&gt;3) 300 Khz
ADCP, hull-mounted on R/V Thompson &lt;br/&gt;4) 150 kHz Lowered-ADCP for use on
either ship, plus battery pack &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts:&lt;br/&gt; The principal impact of the present proposal is under
criterion two, providing infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel
and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic
research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant
research program of NSF). The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-
use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab
access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost
of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.
