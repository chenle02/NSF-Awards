This five-year research project is designed to enhance understanding of how
online professional development environments contribute to teach learning,
changes in classroom practice and changes in student learning in comparison to
face-to-face professional development. Using secondary school teachers learning
to use a reformed-oriented environmental science curriculum (Looking at the
Environment - LATE), groups of teachers will be randomly assigned to one of
three conditions. These are: (1)a traditional face-to-face workshop, (2)self-
guided online professional development, or (3)online professional development
guided by a facilitator and structured as a "short course." The content of the
professional development is held constant over the three conditions and the
online aspect is based on previous research and development activities
(Knowledge Networks On the Web - KNOW). Various measures are used to assess
impact including: (1) teacher backgrounds and beliefs surveys, (2)written tests
of teacher concept knowledge, (3)post-professional development interviews,
(4)classroom observations of teachers enacting the curriculum and (5)student
learning measures based on the curriculum materials.
