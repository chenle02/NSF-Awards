This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial biology for
FY2003. The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of
protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are
not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides
opportunities for recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in
microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of
established scientists, and to broaden their scientific horizons beyond the
research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These
fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their
research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves
of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign
locations.

The research and training plan is entitled "The Relationship Between Microbial
Community and Nutrient Cycling at an Aquifer Contaminated with Landfill Runoff"
Few studies have examined microbial community composition and function at
contaminated sites where natural attenuation is the key remediation method. The
proposed research, to be performed at a landfill-leachate-contaminated aquifer,
will attempt to correlate changes in the plume geochemistry and carbon content
with microbial community structure (DNA) and function (RNA).
