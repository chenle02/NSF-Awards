The proposed I-Corps effort will investigate the potential of dynamic glazing
based on the metal-insulator transitions of vanadium oxides (VO2) as an
alternative to existing technologies. The proposed research effort will seek to
maximize the visible light transmittance of nanostructured VO2 coatings by
combining the coatings with an anti-reflective titanium-oxide layer.
Nanostructured VO2 laminates will be developed and the infrared
transmission/reflection properties will be systematically examined across the
phase transition temperatures. The project plans to identify and prioritize
impediments to technological realization of switchable vanadium oxide
nanomaterials in thermally and electrically responsive fenestration.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Most solar heat gain in buildings occurs via transmission of infrared
radiation through windows, doors, and glazed skylights. In warm climates, solar
heat gain must be mitigated through the use of air-conditioning, which leads to
substantial energy consumption. Current strategies to mitigate solar heat gain
take the form of aesthetically unappealing drapery or static metallic coatings
that are prohibitively expensive while diminishing the use of natural daylight,
thereby leading to increased use of artificial lighting, and, because these
technologies are static across all temperatures, an elimination of the offset in
wintertime heating costs that would otherwise be provided due to solar heat
gain. The dual thermochromic and electrochromic functionality that can be
achieved in nanostructured vanadium oxide thin films will be potentially
transformative for the fenestration, automotive, and consumer glass industries.
Switchable glazing technologies based on the metal-insulator transitions of
vanadium oxides could provide substantial energy savings while permitting better
use of natural lighting. Further development of this technology has the
potential to provide end users with lower recurrent utility costs, increased
comfort, and improved aesthetics while substantially reducing the carbon
footprint of the building.
