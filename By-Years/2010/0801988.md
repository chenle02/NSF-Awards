Abstract: "Geometric Analysis on Complete Manifolds" by Peter Li&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to obtain further understanding of the
underlying geometric and topological structure of an unbounded (infinite)
geometric object (manifold). The techniques being utilized will involve
understanding solutions of some partial differential equations on the manifold
in terms of the curvature and other geometric invariants. On the other hand,
knowledge of the solutions of these partial differential equations will yield
additional information on the geometric and topological structure of the
manifold. This general theme is the essence of this proposal and the development
of various techniques involved in this project will be very useful in future
studies of complete, noncompact manifolds. This line of investigation will yield
direct implications to the theory of partial differential equations governing
the behavior of many physical models and biological models. It is also related
to many engineering problems, such as, liquid crystals, heat transfer, and
imaging.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;In a broader point of view, the proposed project
will yield further understand of a geometric object. The shape of and structures
of geometric objects are important related to many scientific fields. Examples
of these are the structure of black holes and worm holes in physics, the
structure of DNA given by the double helix in biology, the structure of
molecules in chemistry, and behavior of liquid crystal in engineering. This
Principal Investigator will also contribute to the national needs of producing
more mathematicians by involving graduate students and postdoctoral scholars in
his research. Their involvement may be in the form of direct collaborations,
advising, and learning new material through seminars. This process will be an
important component in training the new generation of mathematicians.&lt;br/&gt;
