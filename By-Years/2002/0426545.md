This project will investigate segment-scale structural geometries developed in
Iceland as a means to better understand analogous processes that may be
important in other high-magma budget spreading systems. The particular features
that inspire this project are referred to as flexure zones and are essentially
very large-scale folds developed in the sheet-like lava flow stratigraphy of
Iceland in which lava flows dip inwards toward broadly coeveal magmatic
centers.&lt;br/&gt;
