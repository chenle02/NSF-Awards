This award provides support to The University of Minnesota to continue the
summer program of undergraduate research experiences in the behavioral sciences
established in 1987. The ten-week program will emphasize student participation
in the research activities of faculty affiliated with the Center for Research in
Learning Perception and Cognition. Eleven undergraduates will participate, about
two thirds from smaller liberal arts colleges and universities and one-third
from the University of Minnesota. Students will: (1) assist with their faculty
mentor's research, working as a member of their research team, (2) complete a
research project including a written report and presentation to peers and
participating faculty, and (3) participate in a multidisciplinary seminar. The
program will therefore include opportunities for students to learn specific
research methods, to apply these methods in the context of their own research,
and to examine broad conceptual and methodological issues relating to psychology
and the cognitive sciences. Participation in special social/cultural events as
well as common housing in a University dorm will help foster a strong community
of students. This award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to
attract talented students into careers in science through active undergraduate
research experiences.
