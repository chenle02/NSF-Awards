The principal investigators propose to further advance and develop the theory
and methods for investigations of conformal and holomorphic dynamical systems.
This includes deterministic and random iterations of transcendental entire and
meromorphic functions, graph directed Markov systems on Hilbert spaces and
dimension spectra for finite-dimensional iterated function systems. In
conjunction with the methods of algebraic geometry and differential geometry,
the thermodynamic formalism for rational functions on complex projective spaces
is proposed to be built. Furthermore, the theory of rational semigroups is
proposed to be advanced. The methods laid out are also used to investigate
divergent ergodic averages along squares and higher powers, and the structure of
homeomorphic Bernoulli trial measures on the Cantor space is analyzed. Apart
from ergodic theory and dynamical systems, the proposed research also involves
such areas of mathematics as complex analysis, probability theory, geometric
measure theory, topology, dimension theory, number theory, algebraic geometry
and differential geometry.
