Frank Morgan and his students will study manifolds with density, a
generalization of Riemannian manifolds, long prominent in probability and of
rapidly growing interest in geometry and applications. The density function
weights volume and area equally, unlike a conformal change of metric. Manifolds
with density are the smooth case of Gromov's mm spaces, although we also
consider singularities. The grand goal is to generalize appropriate parts of
Riemannian geometry to manifolds with density. Advances should improve our
understanding of Riemannian geometry; for example, Ricci curvature has many
different generalizations to manifolds with density, which just happen to
coincide for Riemannian manifolds. Isoperimetric problems provide an excellent
entry point. Isoperimetric theorems on Gauss space, the premier example of a
manifold with density, have had applications in probability theory, in
isoperimetric problems in Riemannian geometry, and specifically in Perelman's
work on the Poincaré Conjecture. Methods will include standard and innovative
applications of geometric measure theory, Riemannian geometry, and second
variation. Spaces with singularities are central to theory and applications, and
isoperimetric problems once again provide an excellent entry point. The density
we consider on a an n-dimensional manifold (such as a 2-dimensional surface or a
3-dimensional universe, perhaps with singularities), is the same kind of density
one considers in freshman physics, a weighting that varies from point to point.
Such densities arise naturally throughout mathematics; recent applications
include Brownian motion in physics, stock option pricing, and Perelman's work on
the Poincaré Conjecture. Studying this natural generalization provides new
insights into classical geometry. As one important example, for the classical
geometry of unit density, the _isoperimetric problem_, central to geometry
research since the time of the Ancient Greeks, seeks a region of given volume of
least perimeter; in Euclidean space, the solution is a round ball. On a manifold
with variable density, the isoperimetric problem seeks the region of given
weighted volume of least weighted perimeter. Work in the more general context
provides new results in the classical context. Morgan's undergraduate research
students have solved interesting sample cases and are continuing the work.
Morgan lectures widely at venues ranging from popular forums, high schools, and
summer schools for students and young faculty to university colloquia and
research seminars.
