The myriapod arthropods of the family Eurymerodesmidae will be studied using an
alpha-taxonomic descriptive approach. Collecting is planned in Florida to test
geographic limits. Publication as a single monograph is anticipated, along with
an identification manual and a study of their ancestral-descendant
relationships. The myriapods of the mid-continent are very poorly known, yet
they constitute an important component of the forest leaf- litter assemblage.
The implications of this project rest with the need for a stable nomenclature
and identification criteria for the group, which will provide a sound taxonomic
base for other biological work on the group, especially in forest ecology and
nutrient cycling studies.
