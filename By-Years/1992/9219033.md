This US-Brazil Cooperative Science award will support collaboration of Manfred
Morari, California Institute of Technology; Anthony Skjellum, University of
California Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory; Evaristo Biscaia, Federal
University of Rio de Janeiro; and Argimiro Secchi, Federal University of Rio
Grande do Sul, Brazil. The project aims to make a comparative analysis of
alternatives for dynamic simulation of chemical processes on computers with
parallel architectures and supercomputers. Chemical process simulation is
responsible for many CPU cycles used on mini and mainframe computers. Simulation
models describing industrial processes of realistic complexity translate into
problems of very large dimension, and high-speed simulators are required to make
these simulations feasible. Thus, high-speed computers must be used, and
simulators suitable for these computers must be developed. In this project, the
researchers will consider a range of industrial problems in order to improve the
performance of the developed algorithms and provide more reliable comparisons
with commercial dynamic simulators. The mutual benefits of this project will
accrue from the Brazilian side's expertise in dynamic simulation, and the US
side's computing facilities at Caltech.
