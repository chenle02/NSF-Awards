Cryptography has become an important tool in data protection. Cryptosystems can
be used to solve a large number of the data security problems. While
cryptosystems have been used successfully in protection of messages, the
discovery of many different types of cryptosystems has led to possible solutions
for many other problems in data security that appeared to be either difficult to
solve or were not suitable for "classical" types of cryptosystems. Most of the
recent discoveries of cryptosystems have been in the digital domain. Digitizing
data, however, is not always possible or economical. This research is intended
to study new cryptosystems for protecting analog signals' privacy and
authenticity. Public key analog cryptosystems will also be studied. In view of
the relative scarcity of fast, secure digital public key cryptosystems, such
cryptosystems might also be of interest in digital applications.
