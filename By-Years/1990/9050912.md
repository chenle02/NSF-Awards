The central equipment in the Solid State Laboratory is a scanning tunneling
electron microscope. Exciting developments in the area of scanning
tunneling/atomic force microscopy provide new avenues for the study of solid
state structures. Students in four disciplines: chemistry, physics, biology, and
earth sciences benefit from the use of the laboratory as understanding the
nature of the solid state is a central part of all four disciplines. The grantee
provides funds for this project that are an equal match for the NSF award.
