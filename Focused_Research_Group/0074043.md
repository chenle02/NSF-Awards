The Investigator and his colleagues study new active materials and their
possible use in micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) for biomedical
applications. The research project is motivated by the biomedical revolution
based on the use of emerging materials and emerging mathematical methods of
analysis and simulation for applications to noninvasive surgery and drug
delivery at nanoscale to milliscale. The work concerns the use of small scale
actuators based on smart materials, especially shape-memory and magnetostrictive
materials. They study the growth of tissue on materials and the interactions
with surrounding tissue and biological fluids, as well as novel designs of
actuator systems. They consider remote actuation based on the use of a magnetic
field applied external to the body, and they explore the possible use of MRI.
New active materials --- materials that can change shape under moderate stimuli,
for example --- hold great promise for building MEMS (micro-electro-mechanical
systems) for a variety of applications. Opportunities in biomedical applications
are particularly intriguing; they include noninvasive surgery and drug delivery
at nanoscale to milliscale lengths. This project is aimed at biomedical MEMS
based on the use of new active materials. The investigators study the properties
of active materials, the behaviors of MEMS that could be built with them, and
the interactions between the materials and surrounding biological tissues and
fluids. The work requires new mathematical methods of analysis and simulation.
Investigators focus on the use of small scale actuators based on shape-memory
and emerging ferromagnetic shape-memory materials, energized by a remotely
applied magnetic field. They study the growth of tissue on the materials and
materials interactions with the elastoviscous surrounding tissue, as well as
novel designs of actuator systems based on molecular beam epitaxial growth of
films. The use of MRI for simultaneous imaging and actuation is explored.
