9321824 SMITH This project will provide shipboard scientific support equipment
for the research vessel ALPHA HELIX, an NSF-owned ship operated by the
University of Alaska, Institute of Marine Science, and dedicated to use in
support of ocean science research. The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment
Program provides funds for ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and
safe conduct of ocean science research. This Program provides support for such
items as deck equipment including winch systems for the deployment and retrieval
of scientific instruments, navigational equipment such as radars, gyroscopes and
earth satellite receivers to pin point the location of research sites,
communication equipment including radio transceivers and satellite transceivers
for voice and scientific data communications and other equipment such as
motorized workboats for transporting scientists to and from data retrieval
sites. The Project Director, Thomas D. Smith is fully qualified to direct this
project having had considerable experience in overseeing the acquisition and
installation of shipboard equipment. This project will allow the institution to
replace data wiring, two outboard motors, and a science materials freezer, and
obtain a navigational computer and a radioactivity monitor. ***
