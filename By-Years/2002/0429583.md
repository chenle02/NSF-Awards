Physically-Inspired Modeling for Haptic Rendering&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ming C.
Lin &lt;br/&gt;Department of Computer Science&lt;br/&gt;University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sense of touch is one of the
most important sensory channels &lt;br/&gt;and is used for object
identification, data manipulation and&lt;br/&gt;concept exploration. Therefore,
force feedback via haptic &lt;br/&gt;(touch-enabled) devices offers many
possibilities for enhanced &lt;br/&gt;human-computer interaction. Extending the
frontier of visual &lt;br/&gt;computing, this project proposes to develop
physically-inspired &lt;br/&gt;modeling and simulation techniques for high-
fidelity haptic &lt;br/&gt;display that will augment visual
display.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will be driven by two target
&lt;br/&gt;applications in science and education: nanomanipulation
&lt;br/&gt;and haptic painting. Both applications will also be used&lt;br/&gt;to
enhance science and art education at middle and high schools.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL MERIT: This research is expected to lay the
&lt;br/&gt;scientific foundation for an emerging paradigm of
&lt;br/&gt;physically-based haptic interaction with virtual environments.
&lt;br/&gt;It includes new algorithmic insights, efficient computational
&lt;br/&gt;methodology, and system integration for two challenging
&lt;br/&gt;applications. The underlying representations, algorithms
&lt;br/&gt;and software systems for fast contact computation, interactive
&lt;br/&gt;modeling of flexible objects, multi-level optimization,
&lt;br/&gt;use of programmable graphics hardware, simulation acceleration
&lt;br/&gt;techniques, and VR device augmentation will also offer fundamental
&lt;br/&gt;advances for virtual environments, physically-based modeling, and
&lt;br/&gt;scientific visualization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACT: By
extending the frontier of high-fidelity haptic &lt;br/&gt;rendering, the
proposed research can develop a significant &lt;br/&gt;augmentation to existing
graphical display and scientific &lt;br/&gt;visualization. Furthermore, each
proposed application has &lt;br/&gt;the potential of making a considerable
impact on its own. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
