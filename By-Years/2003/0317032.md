Professor Jason Shear of the University of Texas Austin will work with
Professors Eric Anslyn and Andrew Ellington on a project in bioanalytical
chemistry supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program. The PI
initiated a gated ultra-fast electrophoretic separations method in his previous
award in the CAREER program. The idea is to cage a molecule, activate it
photochemically, do a separation in microseconds and then detect the compounds
using light in a time-of-flight analogy. This project centers on the application
of that method to the problem of protein folding. Novel photochemical triggering
with the help of site-directed mutagenesis to achieve the desired chemistry are
being explored. Two model proteins will be used: cytochrome c and apomyoglobin.
The project combines analytical and physical chemistry, organic synthesis and
molecular biology to develop and evaluate a novel instrument for fast and
sensitive detection of protein folding processes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
research is motivated by the question of how protein sequence specifies
conformation, a major unanswered question in biology. There is thus a great need
for quantitative information about the energetics and dynamics of protein
refolding. The role of misfolded proteins is implicated but not well understood
in a growing number of diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. &lt;br/&gt;
