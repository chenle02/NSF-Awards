Large-scale distributed multicomputer systems, consisting of several thousand
processing elements, are rapidly demonstrating their potential as a low cost
high performance supercomputer. Not only can these system speed-up program
execution, but they also allow significantly larger problems to be addressed. A
wide-spread use of these systems, however, in mission critical as well as
commercial applications, depends on their demonstrated reliability, availability
and scalability. The objective of this research project is to investigate the
reliability, scalability and performability of large-scale distributed systems.
As the number of elements in a system increases, the rate of failure of the
system is expected to increase given a constant technology. Therefore system
reliability and scalability are important considerations in the design of large-
scale systems. The research will focus on two essential issues: the analysis of
network reliability and performability, and the evaluation of techniques that
can exploit the inherent redundancy of these systems. The network reliability
analysis will examine the effects of multiple node and link failures on the
connectivity of the network and on its communication bandwidth, investigating
the probability of occurrence of network disconnection, saturation and
communication bottlenecks. The inherent hardware redundancy of large-scale
systems can be exploited to achieve a higher reliability, albeit, at the cost of
a reduced computing power. The second objective will be to investigate the
achievable performance/reliability tradeoff and system scalability using various
redundancy schemes. The research is essentially analytical in nature but will
rely on simulation techniques whenever an exact analytical evaluation is not
feasible.
