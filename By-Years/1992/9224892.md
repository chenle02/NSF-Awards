The Polar Research Center at the University of Washington will establish a
science management office for the Oceans-Atmosphere Ice Interactions (OAII)
component of the Arctic Systems Science (ARCSS) global change research program.
Initial science planning and management for this activity established initial
plans and priorities for interdisciplinary ocean- and atmosphere-related Arctic
research, and an ARCSS OAII Science Plan was developed. The Science Management
Office (SMO) will support the OAII science steering committee and various
working groups. Based on community input the steering committee formulates
recommendations on research priorities and assists in developing Announcements
of Opportunity for ARCSS research. The steering committee also reviews and
updates annually the OAII science plan and provides recommendations to the
funding agencies. The SMO will organize and conduct workshops that bring
together experts to further define and rank scientific initiates and related
activities. It will also serve as a point of contact for coordinating the
diverse research activities of OAII investigators. Information will be
disseminated from the SMO through newsletters, electronic mail, and other means
to keep the community up to date on program activities, directions, and
opportunities.
