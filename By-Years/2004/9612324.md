This grant will promote the diagnosis and understanding of the behavior of
global climate models in polar regions. The diagnostic tasks will complement
upcoming Arctic field programs (SHEBA, ARM), driven by the need to narrow the
uncertainties in model simulations of climate change. Research will draw upon
daily output of a set of global climate models to (1) assess the Arctic cloud-
radiation-temperature associations in the model simulations, permitting direct
comparisons with results of the field measurements, (2) determine the frequency
and spatial distribution of extreme events in the atmospheric model simulations,
and (3) determine the contribution of surface winds to apparent biases in
simulated evapotranspiration over polar surfaces. In addition, the PI will
compose a review paper synthesizing many recent sea ice sensitivity experiments
with global climate models to identify priorities for improving the treatment of
sea ice in climate models. The research is important because it will increase
understanding of climate processes in polar regions, as well as improve our
ability to simulate these processes with mathematical/physical models.
