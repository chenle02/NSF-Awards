Dr. Luiti's research is on the phenomenlogy of hard processes in nuclei. The
work concentrates on open problems in deep inelastic lepton scattering from
nuclei and heavy quarks production in hardon-nucleurs collisions. High energy
experimental data on nuclei collected in the last decade to present show that
nuclei do not simply behave as a collection of free nucleons, and quark
distributions might be modified in the nuclear environment. New lines of
research have been developing since then, pursuing the idea that by studying the
modifications of hadronic properties and interactions due to the nuclear medium,
one might be able to have an understanding of the hadronic properties and
interactions themselves. Interactive activities include: teaching a graduate
course titled "Hard Processes in Nuclei," organizing a series of seminars with
women speakers in the field of nuclear and particle physics; organize a women's
group in physics and working with the society of Physics Students.
