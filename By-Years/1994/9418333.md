This award is for support for a three year study to use surface exposure age
dating (cosmic ray produced nuclides such as Helium3, Neon-21, Beryllium-10 and
Aluminum-26) to determine the timing of glacial advances and retreats in two
regions of AntarcticaMcMurdo Sound and Shackleton Glacier. A combination of
careful field work and extensive laboratory studies are needed to test this
relatively new dating technique and to answer questions about the glacial
history of the Transantarctic Mountains. The goals of the project are to improve
age determinations of the youngest Ross Sea Drift in McMurdo Sound, to calibrate
production rates of cosmogenic nuclides with new Helium-3 measurements on Argon
dated lava flows and man made targets, to extend the glacial chronology of the
Ross Ice Sheet to other areas and age ranges and to constrain the age of the
controversial Sirius group deposits.
