0412387&lt;br/&gt;Bhattacharya&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is concerned with the
study of the basic photoresponse characteristics of the light-sensitive protein
bacteriorhodopsin (BR) and its application to novel light switches and
modulators using semiconductor-based photonic crystals. Genetic engineering and
chemical modification of BR will be studied, to reduce the fall time in the
protein photoresponse. The protein will be deposited on selected surfaces by
electrophoretic deposition and other techniques. The response times, of ~
picoseconds, will be measured by a novel terahertz radiation detection scheme.
BR-FET-VCSEL monolithically integrated bio-photoreceivers and phototransceiver
arrays will be designed, fabricated and characterized. Utilizing the large
electro-optic effect in BR, its application to novel all-optical light switches
in semiconductor photonic crystals will be demonstrated. &lt;br/&gt;
