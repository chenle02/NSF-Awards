This project will support a workshop for new and future Principal Investigators
(PI's) in the Condensed Matter Physics Program within the NSF Division of
Materials Research. The workshop will be held in Arlington, VA on June 1st and
2nd, 2015. The workshop will provide PI's who have just received their first
award, or are attempting to obtain funding, from the CMP program with valuable
information and advice on the policies, procedures and opportunities available
at the National Science Foundation. The workshop will focus on: - Individual
Investigator Programs in DMR - DMR Centers - DMR Facilities - Other user
facilities - Special DMR programs - NSF Policies and Procedures - The Merit
Review Process - What makes a review effective and helpful - Preparing
highlights - Preparing successful proposals as well as other topics of interest
to new PI's. The workshop will provide ample time for discussion and
opportunities to meet with various DMR program officers
