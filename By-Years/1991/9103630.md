Working with Dr. John Beatty of the University of Minnesota, Dr. Swetlitz is
seeking to delineate the historical factors responsible for the public
controversy between Julian Huxley and Theodosius Dobzhansky regarding the
definition of "fitness" in the early 1960s. This controversy reflected important
social factors shaping the meaning and defense of key concepts in post-World War
II evolutionary biology: efforts by geneticists to distance "fitness" from
eugenic considerations, the rise of population genetics as the central field in
evolutionary biology, and reactions in opposition to both of these developments.
This research will contribute to a number of areas of scholarship within the
history and philosophy of biology including the growing literatures on the
evolutionary synthesis, the relationship between genetics and society, and on
Huxley and Dobzhansky in particular. It will also complement the philosophical
literature by emphasizing the historical contingencies that affect how terms
take on meaning.
