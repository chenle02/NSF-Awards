An integrated, field based project will be carried out to: (a) continuously
monitor subaqueous debris and turbidity flows for temperature, density,
velocity, and travel distance in a reservoir environment; (b) study flow
conversions of debris flows to turbidity currents, specifically by means of
hydraulic jumps, and the role of bottom geometry in such conversions; and (c)
correlate the characteristics of the flow with the nature of the sediment
deposition/erosion processes, the bottom geometry, and other parameters
governing the transport processes. The work will be conducted in conjunction
with a project jointly funded by the U.S. Forest Service, the Los Angeles County
Fire Department, and the L.A. Flood Control District, in which controlled fires,
pollutant and smoke effects, sediment yields, and debris flows emanating from
the burned areas are being studied. The site is the Lodi Canyon and Puddingstone
Diversion Reservoir, located in the San Gabriel Mountains near Los Angeles, that
has long hydrologic and sediment records, detailed geologic and geomorphic data
available, a single sediment input source, a reservoir of manageable size, and
other convenient characteristics and conditions. The results from this work will
help increase the accuracy of predictions of the movement patterns and incidence
of subaqueous debris and turbidity flows; the determination of threshold
conditions; the probable travel distance of such events; and an assessment of
both the ability of subaqueous hydraulic jumps to control the deposition of
sediments; and the possible engineered use of these jumps to control the
location of sediment during major flood events.
