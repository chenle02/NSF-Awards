This project involves the continuation of a long-term ecological study of
Amerindian foragers living in Paraguay. Two anthropologists and their students
from the University of New Mexico will spend fifteen months in the field
collecting data to test a set of hypotheses about group size and mobility; post-
marital residence patterns; the frequency of individual hunting trips; and
divorce rates over time. The data produced will advance our understanding about
Amerindian life and adaptation to the natural environment, will help produce a
full-scale ethnography of this society, and provide an important comparison to
the few other detailed forager ethnographies that are available. This sort of
study is important because foraging societies are disappearing at a rapid rate,
so opportunities for direct observation will not be possible in the near future.
