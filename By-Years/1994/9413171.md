9413171 Gordon In this project, the PI will serve as chief scientist on a
hydrographic line in the Bay of Bengal, from the Ganges delta to near the
equator, designated by the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) as line
I9N. Focus will be on the meridional distributions of properties in the major
basin of the Bay of Bengal. Data will be combined with other data obtained by
the PI under other projects to investigate the effects of the Indonesian
Throughflow on circulation within the Indian Ocean basin in general, and the Bay
of Bengal in particular.
