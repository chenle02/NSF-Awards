9313258 Levon This Small Grant for Exploratory Research will examine a new
method of ordering fullerenes. This is accomplished by having suitable
substituents on the fullerene that favor ordering, or by the use of substituted
rigid polymers with side chains into which the fullerenes fit. These new
composite materials are unknown at this time, and an exploratory examination of
their synthesis, structure, and properties will be carried out by Prof. Kalle
Levon of Polytechnic University in collaboration with Prof. James Tour of the
University of South Carolina. ***
