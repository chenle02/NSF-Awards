Undergraduates at Curry College can become more involved in research through the
purchase of equipment that allows integration of the IBM-compatible PC's with
the existing scientific instrumentation system. The new instrumentation upgrades
the existing system, and extends the speed, range, and versatility of
measurements that can be made. This improvement allows students to perform
sophisticated scientific experiments under computer control and to gain
experience with sophisticated statistical analysis programs. Students, many of
whom have learning disabilities, are becoming involved in research on the
psychophysiology of brain function and the psychophysiology of stress. Students
in Experimental Psychology are becoming involved in semester-long projects that
enrich their understanding of scientific research and improve the quality of
their preparation for advanced studies in psychology. The college will
contribute an amount equal to the award.
