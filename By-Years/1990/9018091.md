Antarctic diving petrels, unlike other surface-feeding seabirds in the
Antarctic, have lost their ability to produce stomach oils to feed their young.
As a result, petrel chicks grow slower and fledge older than other seabird
chicks reared on meals containing a high (20%) percentage of stomach oils. Any
adaptive advantage that stomach oils provide the chicks of these other seabirds
remains unknown. Using cross-fostering experiments, diving petrels rearing
chicks that are normally fed meal with stomach oils and vice versa, Dr. Roby
proposes to investigate how the presence or absence of stomach oils in the meals
fed to seabird chicks influence the growth rates. Specific topics to be
addressed are: (1) gastrointestinal transit rates, (2) lipid assimilation
efficiencies, (3) patterns of lipid storage and catabolism, (4) growth and
development, (5) adult foraging efficiency, and (6) net production efficiency of
the parent/offspring unit. The results will be evaluated to address the
ecological and energetic significance of stomach oils for reproduction in
Antarctic seabirds, as well as the factors responsible for the absence of
stomach oils in diving petrels.
