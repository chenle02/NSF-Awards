This NSF CAREER proposal uses the most modern theoretical and computational
tools to study time-dependent phenomena in atomic systems. The proposed research
focuses on 1) the effect of very intense laser fields to produce multiphoton
ionization in atoms and 2) the theoretical treatment of ultrafast optical pulses
both above and below the optical limit. The PI intends to use the visualization
techniques developed in his research on time-dependent quantum mechanics to make
several areas of classical and quantum physics more attractive and easier to
comprehend by students at both the undergraduate and graduate levels.
