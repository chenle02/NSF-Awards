9320554 Wang Early studies on arms transfers and African coups have not
considered the interaction between the two areas. While arms transfers have
largely been treated as a matter of international affairs, military intervention
in Africa is usually seen as resulting from domestic factors. There exist,
however, both empirical evidence and theoretical justification for the
proposition that international arms shipments and African coups d'etat are
related. This investigation assesses the political effects of arms transfers on
the occurrence of coups in Africa. Utilizing theories of arms transfers and of
the coup d'etat, a causal model is constructed to evaluate the political
consequences of international arms shipments. An event count analysis in
conjunction with conventional regression techniques is employed for statistical
estimation of the effects of arms transfers on African coups. The proposed
research is significant in three aspects. First, it is significant in its
theoretical contribution. Since previous studies have neglected exploring the
linkages between African coups and arms transfers, this investigation fills this
theoretical gap. Second, this research is important in its methodological
contribution as an event count analysis will be employed for statistical
estimation. This is an appropriate techniques for coups analysis but has not
been adopted by any prior investigation. Third, this investigation will expand
the existing data base on African coups, which, in itself, will be a
contribution to the discipline and invite replications of similar research. ***
