Phenomena involving positrons (i.e., the antiparticles of electrons)
are&lt;br/&gt;important in many fields including astrophysics, plasma and atomic
physics, and materials&lt;br/&gt;science. Much progress has been made recently
in these areas through laboratory experiments&lt;br/&gt;that exploit nonneutral
plasma techniques. This proposal describes a program of research
to&lt;br/&gt;create and understand the physics of novel states of single-
component positron plasmas in new&lt;br/&gt;regions of parameter space. These
antimatter plasmas will be used, in turn, for a range of&lt;br/&gt;scientific
and technological applications.&lt;br/&gt;
