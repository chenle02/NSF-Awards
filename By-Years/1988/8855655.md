To address the special needs of our middle schools and junior high schools,
"Explorations in Middle School Science" promises a computer- based program that
will be developed by a highly qualified team of content experts, science
educators, instructional designers, and marketers. Participants will include
practicing scientists; teachers and officers from such professional
organizations as the National Science Teachers Association and the National
Association of Biology Teachers; seven major school districts; the California
State Department of Education; Apple, Tandy, and IBM; and Education Systems
Corporation, a successful developer and marketer of computer software for
schools. And the University of California, Irvine, will be responsible for the
evaluation and teacher training portions of the project. Explorations in Middle
School Science will provide a set of 90 computer lessons in Life, Earth, and
Physical science for Grades 6-9. At the heart of each lesson will be a computer
simulated laboratory to involve students in "doing" science and improving (1)
understanding science concepts by applying critical thinking to solve problems;
(2) skills in scientific processes and communication; and (3) attitudes about
science. These lessons will reflect specific science education objectives in
State guidelines from across the country and realize the full power of computer
technology to reach these objectives. Students will use a number of on-line
tools (notebook, data base manager, calculator) to help them perform the
simulated laboratory experiments, most of which would be too difficult,
dangerous or time consuming to be done in a "live" laboratory. Suggested
extension investigations will lead the students to experience nature first hand,
away from the computer. Explorations in Middle School Science will be modular,
flexible, and well documented. The lessons will be strongly curriculum based,
and run on a networked, managed system of microcomputers with 16 colors, sound,
mouse input, and excellent graphics.
