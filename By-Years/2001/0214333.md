This award is for research that will acquire high-resolution Holocene climate
records for the southwestern USA using isotopic (i.e., oxygen-18 and carbon-13)
and mineralogical (i.e., microprobe studies of strontium and magnesium) analyses
of stalagmites formed in caves in Carlsbad Cavern and other caves of the
Guadalupe Mountains in southeastern New Mexico.

Stalagmites hold the potential for possessing a windfall of high-resolution
records of paleoclimate because of recent advances in dating speleothems (i.e.,
cave deposits that include stalagmites) using thermal ionization mass
spectrometry Uranium-series method. For example, in many cases, banding in
speleothems is sufficiently uniform and distinct to allow frequency analyses to
examine El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) scale variability. In the
southwestern region of the United States, compelling evidence exists that
changes in precipitation are related to changes in El Nino intensity.

The broader impacts of this proposed research center on the development of a new
archive of paleoclimatic data from terrestrial sites. Success in demonstrating
the fidelity of speleothems for recording climatic events will dramatically
improve our understanding of climate.
