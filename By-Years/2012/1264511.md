The hybridization and denaturation transitions between single- and doubled-
stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) will be studied for short oligomers,
between 10 and 25 bases, both in solution and with one strand bound to a surface
to determine how surface immobilization affects this equilibrium and the
interactions between strands. The aspects of this project explore the
differences between surface- and solution-based transitions for systems that are
most pertinent to DNA microarray technology. These aspects include surface
density of DNA molecules, length of the molecule and complementarity of the
sequence. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nontechnical&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will help
better determine the rules governing formation of double stranded DNA complexes.
Formation of such doubled stranded DNA complexes is used in genomics to
understand levels of gene expression and also in medical diagnostics and food
safety analyses.
