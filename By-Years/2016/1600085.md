Interest in Data Science has been increasing at a breathtaking pace, as a result
of the vast amounts of data that are being generated and collected across all
sectors of society and economy. Many Data Science Meetup groups have been
created across the country, each with an active local membership and a vibrant
set of community-driven activities. The objective of this workshop is to connect
the rapidly growing number of participants in these Data Science Meetup groups,
in order to take the best advantage of this wealth of data science talent across
the nation in addressing some of the national priority goals, including the goal
of creating a well-educated Data Science workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
workshop will result in data science meetup groups collaborating with local
governments and non-profits to advance their impact and create data science
solutions to national priority issues, including socioeconomic issues. The
workshop will allow participants to network with their peers, including meetup
organizers, nonprofits, government agencies, in order to create a national data
science network. The meeting organizers have an established track record and
extensive experience working with governments and non-profits on the use of data
science techniques to address social issues, and have created several open
source systems to address education, health, energy, and economic development
problems.
