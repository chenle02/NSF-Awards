Magnetized plasmas, a combination of superheated gas and magnetic fields, are
pervasive in our universe and are responsible for some of the grandest natural
phenomena, such as the aurora. Plasmas are also extensively studied for
engineering and industrial applications, such as space propulsion and
development of future fusion energy reactors. This project aims to improve our
ability to understand and predict the behavior of magnetized plasmas using
simplified models that are both fast and easy to use. In particular, this
investigation will explore methods that combine machine learning techniques that
are revolutionizing many fields, like self-driving cars, with the known physical
laws that govern magnetized plasmas - seeking to leverage the best aspects of
each individual approach.

This project will advance data-driven modeling approaches such as machine
learning by utilizing physics-informed constraints for magnetized plasmas in
three ways: 1) Several emerging data decomposition methods will be applied to
numerical simulations of magnetized plasmas for the first time and assessed for
these systems; 2) Data-driven nonlinear models based on these decompositions
will be tested for modeling magnetized plasmas with significantly increased
speed compared to classical approaches; 3) Methods to optimize the placement of
sensors to diagnose magnetized plasmas will be evaluated to improve the value of
measurements used to both observe plasmas and as the source of information to
build data-driven models. Together these three studies will advance the
effectiveness of low-dimensional, nonlinear, and interpretable data-driven
methods for achieving new physical insight, improved prediction, and robust
control of multi-scale magnetized plasmas.
