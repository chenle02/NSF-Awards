Susquehanna University will purchase an electromagnetic conductivity meter and
data digitizer which will be used to improve instruction in courses in
geohydrology. Students will carry out extended projects in groundwater resource
evaluation and measurements of groundwater contamination. The instrumentation
also will be used in research projects by advanced undergraduates for senior
theses. Susquehanna University will match the NSF grant with an equal amount of
funds.
