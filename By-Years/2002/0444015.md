This award funds a twelve-month planning effort to initiate development and
distribution of a nationally available video series called "Math is Cool" that
inspires students from kindergarten through the undergraduate university level
(grades K-16) to understand and explore the importance and impact of mathematics
on their daily lives. This pilot effort will build on the decades of experience
and success of the principal investigator and the Rice University Center for
Excellence and Equity in Education (CEEE) to develop programs that engage and
excite students from diverse backgrounds. The video series will be designed to
help students learn about basic physics and mathematics; discrete mathematics;
number theory; differential and integral calculus; and differential equations.
