9307851 Zander This is an award to support research on the removal of natural
organic matter from water by use of synthetic membranes. The investigator plans
on studying the physical and chemical factors that affect removal of natural
organic matter from water and factors that influence fouling of membranes used
in water treatment processes. The research involves determination of membrane
electro- osmotic flow characteristics, membrane polymer hydrophobicity, membrane
porosity and pore size and the dependence of the membrane's efficiency on
characteristics of the solution being passed through the membrane including the
potential for fouling. Results of this research are expected to improve our
fundamental understanding of the way in which membranes react to fluids being
processed. This understanding is expected to lead to more efficient engineering
design of membrane processes for removal of pollutants from water.
