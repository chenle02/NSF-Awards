Quantum-mechanical tunneling research has had a profound impact upon our
understanding of traditional superconductors. It has also found substantial
application. We shall develop the processes necessary to fabricate reproducible
tunnel junctions in the high-Tc bismuth oxides and copper oxide. We shall then
use these junctions to explore basic questions regarding the existence of an
energy gap in these materials and the mechanism responsible for the electron
pairing. In addition, these processes can be used to fabricate Josephson
devices.
