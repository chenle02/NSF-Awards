This project is developing and implementing a Biotechnology Program at the
University of Nevada, Reno. We are adapting courses and objectives from
successful Biotechnology Programs at Ferris State University and Northwestern
University. The program is a collaborative effort by the College of Arts and
Sciences and the College of Agriculture, Biotechnology and Natural Resources,
and extends from the University to two local community colleges, local middle
and high schools, and the community at large. The specific goals of the
biotechnology program are: 1) to meet the growing student interest in a
biotechnology career-directed education via development of an intercollegiate
biotechnology degree program, 2) to increase the scientific literacy of a wide
diversity of undergraduate students through the addition of biotechnology into
courses for science and non-science majors, 3) to enhance community interest and
knowledge in the sciences by community outreach, and 4) to enhance economic
development in the state by the creation of a well-trained work force of
biotechnology scientists.
