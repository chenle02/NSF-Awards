This award by the Division of Materials Research to Cornell University is to
develop a coherent structural and electronic understanding of hidden patterns
and symmetries of intermetallic compounds through synthesis, structure
determination, property measurement, and theory. The main focus will be on
complex noble and near noble metal structures. Through this work a new
understanding and relationship among the Samson compounds, the Vernier
structures and quasicrystalline phases will be developed and could unify these
seemly unrelated areas. This project could expand how solid-state chemists,
condensed matter physicists, and materials scientists will consider using X-ray
diffraction and band theory. In addition, these proposed studies may provide
important insights into the structure and electronic characteristics of
quasicrystals.

The project could provide unique opportunities to the students participating in
this program in experimental and theoretical approaches of materials science.
The outreach activities could have tremendous impact on the society with books
and TV series about sciences and chemistry in particular. The "fourth dimension"
is an important and useful concept that could be introduced to general public in
an understandable and meaningful way.
