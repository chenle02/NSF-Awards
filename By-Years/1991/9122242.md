This award will support a summer internship program in probability and
stochastic processes at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in order to
stimulate and encourage the scientific development of capable junior
researchers. The program will provide opportunities for day-to-day interaction
with senior researchers from the University of Wisconsin as well as with senior
visitors. Participants will benefit from access to the major research library
and other research facilities at the University, opportunities to establish
continuing contacts and collaboration with the other participants in the
program, and advice and support in developing long term research programs. This
award will support a summer internship program in probability and stochastic
processes at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in order to stimulate and
