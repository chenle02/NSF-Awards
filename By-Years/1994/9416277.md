9416277 Olson This project is being funded as part of the National Earthquake
Hazards Reduction Program's investigation into the causes and effects of the
January 17, 1994 Northridge earthquake. The earthquake provides a unique
opportunity to evaluate the complete or partial evacuation of hospitals since
several were affected by the event. This project will: ascertain the level of
evacuation preparedness of hospitals in the area; identify the factors that
promoted or inhibited preparedness; identify the types of problems that have
been addressed by hospital earthquake evacuation preparedness efforts and those
problems that need to be considered; and identify costeffective approaches to
improve hospital earthquake evacuation preparedness. Data will be collected
through on-site and telephone interviews. ***
