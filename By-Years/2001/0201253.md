ABSTRACT 0201253 Shang-Ching Cou Wichita State U

Automated geometry reasoning has been a very successful area in the past twenty
years. Highly successful methods for automated geometry theorem proving and
discovering have been introduced since the late 70s. With these methods, one can
not only prove most of the geometry theorems within seconds, but also discover
many new theorems. One may also prove and discover theorems in differential
geometries and mechanics. In the early 90s, methods were developed to generate
human-readable proofs, multiple proofs, and the shortest proofs in geometry.
Methods for automated geometry diagram generation (AGDG) have been developed
recently. The purpose of AGDG is to draw a declaratively described diagram
automatically. Compared to automated theorem proving, AGDG has a wider range of
applications, including intelligent CAD, robotics, linkage design, computer
vision, nanotechnology and chemical molecular modeling, interactive constraint-
based graphic systems, numerically controlled machines, and computer aided
instruction.
