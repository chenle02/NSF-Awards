This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will address two
components required to automate the highly manual work of economic process
control optimization in semiconductor manufacturing. The intelligent Real-time
Economic Sampling (RES) system that can be created with the innovation will
allow sampling to be optimized and adjusted many times per day across multiple
process steps and products. This minimizes a manufacturer?s overall economic
risk of producing bad products by adaptively focusing sampling where it gives
the greatest financial return. The two research objectives are: 1) research
modeling and optimization such that highly optimized sampling solutions for a
whole semiconductor factory can be found in one hour (while using off-the-shelf
affordable PC hardware), and 2) enable the RES system to estimate specialized
yield parameters needed in real-time directly from aggregated inspection and
yield data.

Semiconductor manufacturers today are limited to occasional process control
planning with time-consuming off-line analysis. Engineers also spend time doing
manual ad-hoc adjustments to direct sampling where it is needed, while not
really knowing what other harm they could be doing to the operation. Meanwhile
valuable products are being wasted during out-of-control situations that can be
detected faster if automatic economic sampling could collect data where the
production risk is currently the highest. The RES system would step into a fast
growing segment in the semiconductor industry, spending on process control went
from 10% in 2000 to 19% in 2007 (Source: Dataquest), about $7.4 billion market.
If successful, the RES tool could have a significant impact on the semiconductor
process industry.
