The instruments to be provided through this project, Nikon Alphaphot-KT
microscopes with phase contrast optics, will permit great flexibility in
illumination techniques and usable magnification powers. Phase microscopy
increases contrast in materials with little natural contrast and is useful in
showing cytoplasmic organelles in living or fresh- unstained tissues. These
microscopes also offer darkfield illumination, a technique especially valuable
in the study of single-celled organisms. Polarized light microscopy will permit
analysis of the stratification of cell walls and the location of crystals
present in tissues. Further, the increased clarity, brightness, and resolution
of these microscopes will enhance ordinary brightfield microscopy in the
instruction of plant morphology. This improvement in optical microscopy, through
the updating of scientific instrumentation, is expected to have an immediate
impact on the development of structural botany classes at the University of
Richmond, and to provide long-term curricular enhancement that will enable
students to be better prepared to enter graduate or professional schools. This
project addresses a subspecialty of biology that has suffered from neglect in
undergraduate education.
