Many major mountain systems of the world are in part the result of large scale
compression of the crust in what are termed, fold-and-thrust belts. The style of
formation of such belts is controversial. One school of thought reckons that
they form in a manner similar to deforming snow ahead of a plow ("critical taper
model"), whereas the other advocates formation by the compression of a beam.
This project proposes an experiement to test these two hypotheses using field
relations in the Pyrenees Mountains of Spain. This will be an important
experiment because the method of geometric reconstruction commonly used to model
deformed terranes, especially hydrocarbon-bearing reservoirs, depend in large
part on the assumption of deformational style.
