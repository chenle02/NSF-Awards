The Mississippi Museum of Natural Science proposes to build on its program of
activities that involve children in science and bring them into contact with the
approaches, objects and equipment that scientists use, with each activity
designed to stimulate thinking and heighten interest in science. Cardinal
features of the program are the development of hands-on exhibits, science kits
for classroom use and a studied tie with the children's television program,
"3-2-1 Contact." The goals are to coordinate these activities with hands-on
science activities for students in grades 3-6, and to coordinate classroom
activities with those at the museum, which conducts "3-2-1 Contact Days"
throughout the year when students come to the museum and take part in
experiments, observations and enrichment lessons and actively manipulate museum
objects. The museum now will refine the program components, including
improvement and duplication of the hands-on kits, continuation of the workshops
for elementary teachers and development of new participatory exhibits dealing
with insects and endangered species, and will present them to an expanded
audience. One-third of the children in the state live below the poverty level,
and fifty per cent represent minority populations. As most of these children
lack such out-of-school experiences these informal science activities are
particularly meaningful.
