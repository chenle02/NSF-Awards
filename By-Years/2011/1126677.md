The objective of this program is to develop the first terahertz frequency
(&gt;0.5 THz) on-wafer probe station in the world. The proposed instrument
development plan will assemble a full two-port terahertz frequency vector
network analyzer (VNA) system with frequency extension modules mounted to a
probing platform. The wafer probes, fabricated by the University of Virginia,
will be mounted directly to the frequency extension modules in order to realize
a complete terahertz-frequency on-wafer probe station operating from 500 to 750
GHz.&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit is that the terahertz frequency range has
enormous potential for both scientific discoveries in the areas of radio
astronomy, chemical spectroscopy, and material characterization as well as
applications in atmospheric ozone monitoring, concealed weapons and chemical /
biological hazards detection, and compact-range radar systems. However, a
significant hurdle has been the inability to rapidly characterize circuits and
devices through on-wafer testing. Current test procedures involve time-consuming
development of connectorized prototypes or free-space
measurements.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts are benefiting the wider scientific
and engineering communities by enabling the rapid advances in device technology
required in order to realize terahertz integrated circuits for advanced imaging
systems, stand-off detection of harmful chemicals and explosives and short-range
communication that is far beyond what is now possible. In addition, the
development of a terahertz frequency probe station will provide a tremendous
opportunity for motivating young prospective engineers to enter the field of
engineering by demonstrating the progress that can be made towards critical
applications through an engineering education.
