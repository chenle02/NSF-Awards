The research objective of this award is to develop a methodology to investigate
the deformation and failure mechanisms of the scaled skin of fish for biomimetic
applications. This protective system resists penetration thanks to extremely
tough scales made of a nanostructured mineral/collagen composite material. In
addition, scaled skin is ultra-light, ultra-thin and compliant. The proposed
research will deploy a wide array of experimental and modeling techniques to
investigate this complex system and to pinpoint which structural features are
key to its performance. More specifically, the objectives of the project are (i)
to characterize the microstructure of the fish skin system across several
lengths, (ii) to measure its mechanical properties and assess its deformation
and failure mechanisms, (iii) to develop multiscale continuum damage models for
their failure and (iv) to use these models to establish guidelines for the
biomimetic design of fiber-reinforced composite and scaled-structures. Such a
bio-inspired material will duplicate the key mechanisms found in fish-scales
while using different components. If successful, the results of this research
will find applications in full body personal armor systems, high-performance
protective coating or morphing aircraft skins. A deliverable of this award will
be a computational tool that will guide the design of bio-inspired material,
such that they reproduce the high-performance of biological materials while made
of different building blocks. The methodology will be tested by constructing a
prototype of a synthetic fish-scale structure. This research will be an avenue
to expose undergraduate engineering students to the potential of bio-inspiration
in engineering through undergraduate research experiences. In addition, an
international dimension will be brought to the project through a strong research
collaboration between McGill University (Canada) and CU-Boulder, allowing
students broaden their research experience.
