Surveys of genetic variation in natural populations of marine organisms,
particularly bivalves, have revealed a curious paradox: many genes show a
deficiency of heterozygotes compared to frequencies expected under population
genetic theory, yet at the same time heterozygous individuals appear to enjoy
enhanced growth and survival. The reasons for this situation can only be
understood by controlled laboratory experiments. In this project, over a hundred
families of the coot clam, Mulinia lateralis, will be produced and reared in the
laboratory. By comparing the genotypes of the parents and offspring in each
family for a series of genes, the investigators will be able to determine the
origin(s) of the numerical deficiency and enhanced fitness of heterozygote. One
potential source is spontaneous chromosomal aberrations (aneuploidy) of the same
type that cause a large proportion of birth defects in humans. If this proves to
be the case, marine bivalves could become valuable model systems for the study
of aneuploidy. Alternatively, if the fitness differences are attributable to
biochemical differences in the gene products, this finding will further aid our
understanding of the evolutionary significance of genetic variation in natural
populations.
