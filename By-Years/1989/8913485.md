Dr. Geraldine L. Richmond is supported by a grant from the Physical Chemistry
Program to organize a joint NSF-SERC Workshop on Frontiers in Molecular
Spectroscopy and Dynamics. The workshop will involve thirty of the top young
chemists in this area of research from the United States and Great Britain. The
workshop will be held at Princeton University on June 16-18, 1989. This award
provides travel and subsistance for the U.S. Participants only. At the
recommendation of The Chemistry Division Advisory Panel, NSF and SERC are
sponsoring a number of bilateral U.S.-U.K. workshops for young chemists. This
workshop is in the general area of molecular spectroscopy and dynamics, and will
cover a variety of topics including: spectroscopy of gas phase ions and
molecules; spectroscopy of molecular, ionic, metallic and semiconducting
clusters; reaction dynamics; theoretical aspects of molecular spectroscopy; and
molecular structure of adsorbates at surfaces.
