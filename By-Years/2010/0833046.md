This proposal is a request for support to help cover the costs of registration
for up to 40 US graduate students and postdocs in the particle physics community
to attend the 34th International Conference on High Energy Physics ICHEP08, to
be held July 30 - August 5, 2008 on the University of Pennsylvania campus in
Philadelphia. Princeton University and the University of Pennsylvania will host
the conference. This will be the first time since 1992 in Dallas that this IUPAP
sponsored meeting will be located in the U.S., and the first time in North
America since ICHEP 98 in Vancouver, Canada. A broad worldwide participation of
approximately 1000 physicists is anticipated
