This project will study the lubrication behavior of confined thin films using
non-equilibrium molecular dynamics techniques. In particular, mixtures of
branched and linear alkanes with ester impurities will be studied. The goal is
to understand the effect of the impurities on properties such as the generalized
shear viscosity and hydrodynamic boundary conditions. Complicated long ranged
electrostatic and metal-fluid interactions, plus necessarily large system sizes,
present a significant computational challenge that will require efficient use of
massively parallel computing facilities. Existing algorithms and others
currently under development employ Nose-Hoover chains and external fields to
establish the desired velocity profile at the chosen temperature. Furthermore,
linear response theory can readily be applied to make the connection between
phenomenological properties, such as the Navier-Stokes equation, and molecular
descriptions.
