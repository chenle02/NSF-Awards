The PI requests fund to "Scientifically Speaking: Tips for Preparing and
Delivering Scientific Talks and Using Visual Aids which was first published by
The Oceanography Society in 1995. Over the past nine years, the booklet has
proven to be a valuable resource for scientists preparing oral presentations at
various scientific conferences throughout the world. "Scientifically Speaking"
will be updated to include advice on using advanced presentation technology.
This revised publication will provide specific information on how scientists can
prepare concise, informative presentations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition,
funds are requested to provide partial support for the publication of a special
issue of Oceanography focusing on the contribution of women to ocean science.
While highlighting interesting scientific work, this publication will also serve
as a useful tool to encourage women to consider Ocean Science as a field of
study and career path. &lt;br/&gt;
