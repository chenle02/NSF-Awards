Mr. Curtis Marean, will continue his doctoral dissertation research under the
direction of J.D. Clark. He will complete the analysis of faunal materials
recovered from two groups of sites located near Lukenya Hill and the Central
Rift Valley in Kenya. These sites which date from Late Pleistocene and Holocene
times contain abundant faunal remains in addition to other materials such as
stone tools. Mr. Marean's focus is on the former and he will examine these to
determine species present, the ages at which animals - both wild and domestic -
were killed, and butchering patterns. This will allow him both to reconstruct
changes in environment over time and to determine the responses of prehistoric
peoples to them. The CRV and Lukenya Hill sites document two major external
impacts on indigenous East Africans over the last ca. 20 thousand years. The
first is a major climatic change which occurred at the end of the Pleistocene
and the second, the introduction of domestic animals and likely new cultures
several thousand years ago. Examination of each will provide evidence on how
hunters and gatherers responded to major cultural and environmental
pertubations. The research is important for several reasons. While much
archaeological research has been conducted in East Africa on both earlier and
more recent cultures, from this crucial time period little is known. Secondly
this work will increase our understanding of how simple societies adapt.
Finally, Mr. Marean will train a Kenyan assistant and thus both assist in the
development of science in Kenya and strengthen U.S. - Kenya research ties.
