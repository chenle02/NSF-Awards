The present application is a request for renewal of funding on a two-year
Biological Instrumentation Grant for the construction and testing of a Confocal
Differential Polarization Scanning Microscope. The basic optical and electronic
design and building of this instrument has been completed in our laboratory.
This microscope has already shown its enormous potential as an analytical tool
in the study of complex Biological systems in-situ. Using this instrument, we
have been able, for the first time, to resolve spatially the long-range chiral
domains in which the Light Harvesting Complex II is organized in the chloroplast
grana. We request funding for an additional period of three years to extend the
capabilities of the present instrument to carry out: a) Microspectro-
polarimetric measurements at a given location in the object. Presently, the
microscope can spatially resolve the optical (linear and circular) anisotropy of
the object to within the diffraction limits of the light, at a fixed wavelength
of illumination. The building of the proposed instrumentation will allow us to
locate a microscopic domain of interest in the studies object and to obtain the
Circular Dichroism and linear Dichroism spectra of that localized domain: b)
Luminescence Depolarization Imaging. Using the advantages of confocal epi-
dillumination optics and the extended sensitivity of polarization modulation and
synchronous demodulation, we propose to develop the instrumentation to spatially
resolve the molecular dynamics of luminescence-labelled species. This
instrumentation will be applied first to imaging the rotational dynamics of IgE
receptors in mast cells.
