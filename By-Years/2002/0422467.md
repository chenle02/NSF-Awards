This program provides scholarship awards to students who are enrolled in
programs leading to the Associate Degree in Computer Technology (CT) or
Information Systems Technology (IST). The project is particularly focused on
recruiting current high school students completing an IT pathway or who have
earned a grade of B or higher in one of the IST or CT Running Start (dual
enrollment) courses. Intellectual Merit: The project objectives are (1) to
provide scholarships to academically talented, financially disadvantaged
students; (2) to increase the number of students in IT programs or Project
Running Start courses in high school enrolling directly into associate degree
programs in Computer Science by 50%; (3) to provide support to NEXT STEP
scholars that enable a minimum of 70% to complete first semester math and
English courses with a grade of C or better and persist to achievement of an
associate degree (4) to develop at least ten new internship sites for second
year CSEMS students.

Broader Impacts: The project increases the number of students pursuing career in
information technology and can be used as a benchmark for other institutions
offering similar programs. Support for the success and retention of these
scholars includes new advising models that are being integrated into the college
by the acquisition of a recent Title III grant, and requirement of mathematics
summer remediation if placement tests show there is a need.
