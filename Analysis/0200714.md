The theory of operator spaces has advanced very rapidly during the past ten
years, combining ideas and techniques from Banach space theory and the theory of
C*-algebras. The investigator will concentrate on three aspects of geometry of
operator spaces: examples of operator spaces with few completely bounded maps,
the structure of non-commutative L^p spaces, and various extension properties.
