This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A request is made to fund additional
and back-up instrumentation on the R/V Marcus Langseth, a 235? Global seismic
vessel with general oceanographic operated by Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory
of Columbia University as part of the University-National Oceanographic
Laboratory System research fleet. The award includeds two
items:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; 1) Used Streamer Purchase&lt;br/&gt; 2) Near Field
Source Hydrophones&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The
acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-
funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated
instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and
expanding the base of potential researchers. The additon of this new seismic
will enable R/V Langseth to continue it role as the only academic research
vessel in the world capable of performing 3D seismic surveys.
