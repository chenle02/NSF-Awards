Polar desert ecosystems in the high arctic have not been studied in terms of
their development and function. To provide an understanding of the critical
components controlling development of polar desert ecosystems, Dr. Bliss
proposes to study the microclimate of soils, algal crusts, soil invertebrates
and vascular plants within these systems. It is hypothesized that algal crusts,
especially cyanobacteria, play a central role in soil development and to a
greater extent species diversity and biomass of vascular plants. The overall
influence of biota on soil development will be estimated from carbon dioxide and
carbonate analysis in the soil atmosphere and in solution. To evaluate the
hypothesis that the distribution of vascular plants relates primarily to water
availability throughout the summer, winter snow fall and summer snow melt will
be determined along moisture gradients. It is further believed that the algal
crusts play a central role in maintenance of higher levels of soil moisture.
Because polar deserts are one of the least understood ecosystems in the arctic,
it is critical, in terms of predicted global warming to understand important
components controlling development of polar deserts. Additionally, knowing how
modern systems develop may provide an analog to development of systems following
continental ice retreat.
