The goal of this project is to extend the theoretical and methodological
construct of noticing to develop the concept of reciprocal noticing, a process
by which teacher and student noticing are shared. The researcher argues that
through reciprocal noticing the classroom can become the space for more
equitable mathematics learning, particularly for language learners. Thus, the
focus of the project is on developing the concept of reciprocal noticing as a
way to support better interactions between teachers and Latino/a students in
elementary mathematics classrooms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project uses a
transformative teaching experiment methodology and is guided by the initial
conjectures that to make mathematics classrooms intellectually attractive
places, Latino/a students and teachers need to learn to develop common resources
for teaching and learning mathematics, and that reciprocal noticing as a process
supports teachers and students in developing these common resources for teaching
and learning mathematics. The project design centers around two research
questions:How do teachers and Latino/a students tune to each other's
mathematical ideas and explicitly indicate to one another how their ideas are
important for discourse that promotes mathematical reasoning in classrooms
characterized by reciprocal noticing? What patterns emerge across four
classrooms when teachers and Latino/a students engage in reciprocal
noticing?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The concept of reciprocal noticing can
significantly enhance emerging research in mathematics education about the
importance of teacher noticing. Further, this revised concept of noticing can
transform mathematics classroom to better support English Language
Learners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will incorporate project findings and
videos into methods courses for preservice elementary teachers.
