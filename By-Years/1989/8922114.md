The history of sea level is one of the most important paleoclimatic and
paleoceanographic parameters. Knowledge of this variable constrains the history
of ice sheet growth and decay, and its relationship to climate forcing. Likewise
the history of CO2 in the atmosphere is also critical to our understanding of
climate. This proposal requests support to address both of these issues. This
project will use samples recovered from the coral reef terraces of Santo Island,
Vanuatu, in order to obtain a high-resolution record of sea level history and
initial 14C/12C ratios for the last 30,000 years. The samples result from
collaboration of the PIs with an ongoing project of drilling on Santo Island led
by scientists from ORSTROM in New Caledonia. The costs of the drilling are
provided by ORSTROM. The research proposed here is important because it will
help to constrain the history of sea level during the last deglaciation and it
will further refine our 14C chronology during this interval.
