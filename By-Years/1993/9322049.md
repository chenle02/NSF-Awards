9322049 Shuler This Research Experiences for Undergraduates project at the
School of Chemical Engineering at Cornell University will involve students in
such diverse areas as biotechnology, materials processing, energy conservation,
and environmental management. The undergraduate experience will emphasize
intellectual independence, initiative, the ability to work in teams, and
effective communication skills, attributes that are difficult to teach in formal
classroom instruction alone. ***
