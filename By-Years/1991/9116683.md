Fischer The basic goal of this research is to develop general analysis and
design methods for multidimensional filter bank signal decompositions, featuring
non-rectangular spectral partitions, and to integrate such methods with novel
source coding techniques to produce a family of effective and efficient image
and video coders. The work focuses on the following four tasks: 1. design
exact/near-exact reconstruction multidimensional multirate filter banks for a
variety of non-rectangular spectral partitions; 2. develop a theory for the
subband coding gain and coder performance of multidimensional multirate filter
bank source coders, emphasizing the filter banks developed in 1; 3. develop a
theory for the influence of perceptual weighting functions in subband coding
systems; and 4. determine a theory for the performance of linear prediction in a
multirate filter bank signal decomposition, with emphasis on the source coding
application. Fixed, forward adaptive, and backward adaptive prediction are being
considered.
