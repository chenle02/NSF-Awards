The Capitol Region Information Technology Professional Development (PRODEV)
project uses an innovative 2000 hour internship program to prepare workers and
prospective workers to meet the needs of the region's growing information
technology (IT) industry. Lansing Community College, in partnership with the
local information technology industry group (LINC), is providing an information
technology apprenticeship initiative that enables information technology
students to get the industry-based technical experiences that puts them on a
fast-track to become the experienced skilled employees that local employers
urgently need. PRODEV is aligned with the recommendation of Capital Area
Michigan Works Information Technology Advisory Committee from April 2007.

Recent reports predict that the IT industry in the Capital Region area needs to
add nearly 1,300 jobs (14% growth) in the next 5 years, resulting is a severe
shortage of high-skilled IT workers, especially those with at least associate
degrees plus practical training. PRODEV meets those needs by proving registered
IT students with apprenticeship opportunities that give them a degree and 2000
hours of practical experience.
