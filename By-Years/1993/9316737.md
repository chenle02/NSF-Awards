9316737 Spanswick The long term goal of the project is to evaluate the transport
and metabolic steps in the seed portion of the partitioning pathway by
estimating their flux control coefficients. This will provide a quantitative
assessment of their limitation to the overall flux. Peas will be used as a model
system. In this first stage of the project, a steady state 13CO2 labeling system
will be constructed for use with a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
spectrometer. In addition an NMR probe capable of detecting 13C and 1H
resonances will be modified to permit insertion from the top of the NMR machine,
to accomodate a developing pea fruit and to perform imaging of 1H associated
with sugar molecules using a double pulse technique. The main objective is to
achieve a functioning system that combines steady state labeling with non-
destructive detection of 13C in the developig fruit by NMR. ***
