9361656 Pei There is growing interest in commercializing conducting polymers as
new conductive materials and very recently for use as the active layer in light-
emitting diodes, making new processable conducting polymers highly desirable. We
propose the synthesis of a novel water-soluble and self-dopable conducting
polymer poly (2-hydroxparaphenylene, sodium salt) (II). Charge delocalization in
this polymer from the side-group oxygen anion into the conjugated polymer main
chain is expected to occur, leading to an intrinsically conductive polymer
without doping. This will be the first example of processable and tractable
n-type conducting polymers. It is expected that this polymer will show strong
fluorescence which, combined with its intrinsic conductivity, will lead to a
high electoluminescent quantum-efficiency for light-emitting diodes.
