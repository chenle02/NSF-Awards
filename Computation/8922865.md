This research project focuses on the development of improved techniques for
solving the acoustic and elastic wave equations. The work has applications to
seismic exploration, nondestructive testing, sonar interpretation, and other
fields. The immediate aim is to enhance numerical methods for the so-called
forward problem, in which initial-boundary data and material properties are
assumed known. However, the research has the ultimate objective of using
accurate forward solvers in an iterative fashion to attack the inverse problem,
in which one seeks estimates of material properties (wave velocities) given
observed responses of the medium to seismic waves. The project represents a
continuation of earlier research at Wyoming, in which codes were developed for
solving the acoustic and elastic wave equations in three space dimensions. The
project addresses several numerical approaches. Among these are the
representation of interfaces between strata having different wave velocities,
the construction of spatial grids that will yield accurate discretizations in
highly heterogeneous media, the design of efficient time-stepping schemes and
associated numerical linear algebra, and the adaptation of numerical procedures
to parallel- and vector architecture machines. Another important element of the
project is the continued development of object-oriented graphics software to aid
in the visualization of large-scale model results.
