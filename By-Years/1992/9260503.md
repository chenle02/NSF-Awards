This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project has as its
objective the design of a multimedia mathematics learning environment for grades
K-8. The software system envisioned would be complementary to a new math
textbook series from Addison-Wesley that follows the new National Council of
Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) math standards for the reform of mathematics
teaching and learning. The software would provide interactive simulations
embedded in problem-solving and open- ended exploratory contexts and would
enable the encouragement of theme-based projects, investigations, and hands-on
mathematics.
