Dynamic scaling behavior in models of aggregation and clustering. Numerous
complex systems exhibit clumping behaviors that are observed to scale in well-
defined ways that are rather poorly explained by current theory. The plan is to
study dynamic scaling limits in coagulation models that (a) are fundamentally
related to branching processes and genealogy, (b) describe phase separation,
mixing continuous growth and clustering, (c) model interstellar smoke, and (d)
relate to repair mechanisms in chromosomes. A key goal is to develop
renormalization-group ideas that strengthen methods previously used to study
scaling-symmetric systems. Following the remarkable recent discovery of Menon
concerning complete integrability for random shock clustering in scalar
conservation laws, work will try to identify and understand important families
of solutions, and extend the theory to handle more general models of ballistic
aggregation.

Existence and stability theory for solitary waves in fluids and lattices.
Solitary waves are one of the earliest and most prominent kinds of coherent
structures to be studied in nonlinear science. Recent work has provided a proof
of linear stability for solitary water waves of small amplitude, and has opened
up new avenues for investigation. Stability is explained using spatially
weighted norms that measure the scattering of infinitesimal perturbations away
from the nonlinear wave. The proposed work is directed toward issues for which
the use of weighted norms promises to produce progress, especially: i) existence
of solitary wave fronts in periodic media, including multi-dimensional particle
lattices and localized water waves with periodic bathymetry; and ii) stability
of multidimensional soliton fronts for the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili model of
three-dimensional water waves.
