0245296&lt;br/&gt;Walden&lt;br/&gt;This award to Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution in Massachusetts provides shared-use instrumentation to assist in
the scientific outfitting of a new coastal research vessel. Specifically, this
award will provide a 300 kHz acoustic current profiler, a conductivity-
temperature-depth (CTD) instrument, meteorological and surface ocean sensors for
underway data acquisition, a vessel attitude and heading system, an echosounder,
a dive compressor, a precision clock, and a shipboard computer network for data
acquisition. These systems will be of substantial advantage to marine scientists
using the coastal research vessel in their research during 2004 and future
years.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
