This project addresses two of the grand challenges of the next decade: green
wireless communication systems and spectrum efficiency, through a collaborative
research and education plan utilizing optimization theory, and involving
researchers from the U.S. and Finland. This project considers energy efficiency
for cognitive radio networks and introduces a novel optimization-based
methodology. It builds on existing results to establish a new focus on green
cognitive networking. The way in which energy is consumed in cognitive networks
provides unique opportunities for exploiting the cognitive process to save
energy and for using energy reduction techniques to modify and improve the
performance of cognitive networks. A unique feature of this project is the
introduction of an optimization-based methodology for establishing and attaining
ultimate performance limits. In this project, PIs develop energy performance
bounds that yield insights for design of general networks, derive optimal
tradeoffs between fundamental performance criteria, use optimization
formulations for establishing and achieving ultimate performance limits, and
design protocols that are optimal in the presence of temporal cognitive systems
evolution. Research results of this work will be widely promulgated through the
usual means of publication and dissemination and will have significant impact on
energy efficiency of spectrum-efficient wireless systems.
