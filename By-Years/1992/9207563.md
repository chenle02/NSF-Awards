This award represents a Minority Research Planning Grant. The principal
investigator will use the grant period to prepare a competitive proposal to
assess the fidelity of satellite measurements of heat, momentum, and tracer
transport across the tropopause (between the troposphere and stratosphere). The
support will allow the principal investigator to adapt previously developed
modeling codes which were used for a similar assessment of the middle atmosphere
(upper stratosphere and mesosphere) which was done as part of her doctoral
research. The results of a research project on this topic could provide valuable
insights into how to improve the four dimensional data assimilation for global
circulation models.
