In this project, the fundamental issue of dynamic bandwidth provisioning
services is investigated. The goal is to gain a better understanding of the
theoretical aspects of multi-domain routing and to develop novel techniques that
will substantially improve the performance of multi-domain networks. The
proposed solutions will assist in the successful deployment of computer services
across multi-domain networks. In particular, this project will develop novel
algorithms for QoS-guaranteed routing. The goal is to evaluate those algorithms
through use of multiple kinds of GENI resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
obtained results will be expected to generate a strong interest in the network
community at large for QoS-guaranteed routing in multi-domain networks. They
will also generate significant impacts on computer network research through a
better understanding of the theoretical issues of multi-domain routing for the
design of future Internet architectures.
