Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and muon spin rotation (muSR) techniques will
be used to study electronic structure, magnetism, and superconductivity in
strongly correlated electron metals and alloys. The sensitivity of NMR and muSR
to magnetism on the atomic scale makes these techniques ideal tools to probe
local effects of strong electron correlation. Particular attention will be paid
to the crucial role of structural disorder in the non-Fermi-liquid (NFL)
behavior of many heavy-fermion systems. NMR and muSR spectra and spin-lattice
relaxation rates will probe inhomogeneous paramagnetism and glassy low-frequency
spin fluctuations in UCu5-xPdx and other NFL systems. 27Al NMR and muSR spectra
relaxation rates in Ce1-xLaxAl system will be examined for evidence whether, as
recently claimed, these alloys exhibit an anisotropic Kondo effect. A thorough
examination of superconductivity and magnetism will be carried out in the newly-
discovered class of CenTIn3n+2 heavy-fermion materials, which exhibit a wide
variety of anomalous magnetic and superconducting behavior. Other projects
include muSR studies of cuprate and maganite transition metal oxides, and
quantum critical behavior in MnSi under pressure. Graduate students in this
program will be bell prepared for research/teaching careers in both basic and
applied areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding effects of correlations
between electrons on magnetism and conduction in solids remains an important
unsolved problem in condensed matter physics, with practical consequences for
technology in several areas of materials science. This research uses magnetic
resonance techniques as probes of correlated-electron behavior at the atomic
level. In magnetic resonance, the magnetism of 'spin probes' (e. g. nuclei as
nuclear magnetic resonance) is used to 'spy' on the local magnetic environment
of the probes, which observe but do not seriously perturb their surroundings.
This work will lead to better understanding of the behavior of the so-called
heavy-electron metals, in which electrons behave as if they were hundreds or
even thousands of times more massive than free electrons. It will be carried out
in collaboration with researchers at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, and
with research trips abroad (Leiden University, ETH Zurich, TU Munich, TRIUMF,
Vancouver, and Paul Scherrer Institute, Switzerland). Graduate students in this
program will there for gain valuable insight into research at the national and
international level, and will be well prepared for research/teaching careers in
both basic and applied condensed matter physics and materials
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
