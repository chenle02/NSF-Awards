Declamination is one of the most common failure modes of composite materials. It
occurrence may be due to either imperfections in the production process or the
effect of external factors during the operational life of the composite
laminates, e.g. impact by foreign objects. The presence of declamination can
reduce the buckling load of the composite leading to global structural failure
at loads below the design level. This Small Grant for Exploratory Research
(SGER) deals with the development of two computational approaches to solve the
moving boundary problem, i.e. the dynamics of the growth of a thin strip
declamination in a thick based laminate. The governing equation is a nonlinear
integro-differential equation where the unknown length of delaminated strip
appears not only in the boundary- condition but also in the equation of motion.
