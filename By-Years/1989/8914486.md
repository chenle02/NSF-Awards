The objective of this research is to advance the understanding of the
fundamental and device properties of multi-quantum-well and superlattice
structures fabricated from layers of mercury- telluride and cadmium-telluride.
One will measure the optical absorption and photoluminescence under conditions
of high hydrostatic pressure produced in diamond anvil cells. The changes in the
intrinsic band structures of both HgTe and CdTe under pressure are well
understood and thus large changes in the optical properties of the quantum wells
and superlattices are anticipated and the results will permit a critical
confrontation of theoretical predictions of the MQW and SL structures and the
experimental results. The MQW and SL HgTe/CdTe samples will be provided by Prof.
J. F. Schetzina of North Carolina State Univeristy. These are state-of-the-art
molecular beam epitaxy grown samples which are well characterized by structural,
electrical and optical measurements at ambient pressure.
