Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will focus on the physics of
the heavy "beauty" and "top" quarks, on the decays of "elementary" particles
containing the beauty quark, and on ways to study the nature of the observed
asymmetry between matter and antimatter. These are among the most timely topics
in elementary particle physics - work on them is centrally important to progress
in the field.
