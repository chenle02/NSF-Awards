0842127&lt;br/&gt;Chizmadia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks
funding of ~$163K to upgrade and enhance the capabilities of an older SX-50
electron probe currently at UPRG. Specifically, the PIs intend to upgrade the
computer system with newer, serviceable software (Probe for Windows), purchase a
new energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) detection and electronics system,
obtain and install a PC1 diffraction crystal for light element analyses, and
procure such laboratory supplies to keep the instrument up and running
effectively. The University will maintain the service contract on the existing
instrument and has adequate support facilities. Research applications would
include chondrite probe analyses to elucidate the geologic makeup and history of
inner planets and asteroids, probe analysis of amoeboid olivine inclusions
(AOIs) in carbonaceous and other chondrites as a proxy for hydrothermal
alteration, understanding island arc magmas through zircon geochemistry,
understanding early Earth geology through detrital zircon analysis, refine
relationships between mafic xenoliths and their host granitoids, understanding
batholiths associated with island arcs, dolomite trace element geochemistry,
limestone age estimates based on strontium isotopes, beach rock lithification,
and Sr/Ca ratios as paleotemperature proxies. The instrument is the only one of
its kind in the Caribbean region. It will support 115-130 students in a
pedagogical role during each school year. Over the next several years the PIs
will incorporate usage and training into an upper level geology course. The
upgraded probe will also be used in student research projects at both
undergraduate and graduate levels. As a truly regional instrument, the probe
will represent a unique resource for the region and support an institution
attended almost exclusively by students from an under-represented population.
