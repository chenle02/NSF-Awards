Photo-induced immobilization will be used for the preparation of thin pin-hole
free chromatographic surfaces whose silanol sites are inactivated for use in
high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). To demonstrate this chemical
platform technology, surfaces will be prepared and chromatographically evaluated
using both small and large molecules as standard probes. With judicious
selection of monomers, new biofriendly (low non-specific binding) stationary
phases can be prepared, allowing selectivity to be influenced by incremental
changes in the character and chemical composition of the separation surface.
Because the chemical platform is not dependent on specific attachment
chemistries, any surface may be employed thereby utilizing certain intrinsic
properties beneficial to a specific separation process. Successful completion of
Phases I and II will provide the technical foundation for the commercialization
of separation products developed and produced by photo-induced crosslinked
polymerization not limited to any particular surface type.
