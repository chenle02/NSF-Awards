Abstract Studies which examine social mobilility across two generations often
find relatively small fluctuations in the amounts of mobility experienced by
parents and their grown children. Among nations, by contrast, there are often
substantial differences in rates and amounts of mobility. One possible
explanation for both of these patterns is that mobility rates are tied to stages
of economic development. Because development levels do not ordinarily change
during short intervals of time, rates of mobility between generations tend
merely to undergo relatively minor fluctuations. However, because there are
substantial variations in economic development among nations, cross- national
rates of social mobility are also quite variable.. Contemporary surveys can not
directly test the mobility- development thesis, even if they ask respondents'
recollections, because they can not collect data over a sufficently long period
of time. In recent years, however, sociologists and social historians have put
together a number of data sets on mobility in the United States during the
nineteenth and early twentieth century. They cover a sufficient period of time
to permit the investigator to examine long term trends. (The birth cohorts in
the disaggregated data range from l776 to l952.) The analysis involves re-coding
the occupational placements of respondents into the same categories so that
mobility can be measured in comparable occupational terms in all of the data
sets. In addition to examining the mobility-development thesis, the data sets
permit analysis of both racial and regional differences in mobility in the
United States during this 150 year period.
