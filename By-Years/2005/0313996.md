Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zare&lt;br/&gt;MPS-
0313996&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER)
award supports research into the applicability of the newly emerging technique
of Cavity Ring-Down Spectroscopy - based sensors as probes for biomolecules in
the condensed phase, with particular emphasis on potential bioterrorism agents.
Four developmental strategies will be pursued to bring the extraordinary
sensitivity of Cavity Ring-Down Spectroscopy (CRDS) to biosensor technology.
Each has its own potential advantages for implementation, selectivity, and
sensitivity. The first approach is the use of a cell whose entrance and exit
windows are at Brewster's angle to minimize absorption losses when inserted
inside an optical cavity. The purpose of this device is to miniaturize the
detector so that very small volumes of liquid can be analyzed. Such a device has
particular promise when coupled to microseparations, such as capillary
electrophoresis or lab on a chip. The second approach is the use of an optical
cavity in which the light makes optical contact with the surroundings by means
of an evanescent wave. This device is sensitive to absorption changes at the
surface where the optical contact is made. It has the advantage of keeping the
light on the inside so that it is immune to questions of turbidity in the medium
in contact with the surface. The third approach is the use of surface plasmon
resonance (SPR) coupled to CRDS. It is also sensitive to the liquid-surface
interface and its value will depend on the ease with which analyte-sensitive
probe molecules can be coupled to the metal (gold or silver) surface used in
SPR. The fourth approach is the direct contact of the liquid with the two
mirrors that constitute the optical cavity. This approach is by far the simplest
to implement, and an assessment will be made of what limits its operations,
particularly in regard to analyte selectivity. This research could well provide
the basis for broad and important applications in the detection and
quantification of biomolecules. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This activity is jointly

Mathematical and Physical Sciences and by the Instrumentation and Instrument
Development Program in the Division of Biological Infrastructure in the
