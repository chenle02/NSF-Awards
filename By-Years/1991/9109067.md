Research Planning Grants are one-time awards designed to help increase the
number of new women investigators participating in NSF research programs, and to
facilitate preliminary studies and other activities related to the development
of competitive NSF research proposals. The project will investigate the
extension of reliable broadcast concepts to partitionable data communication
networks. Protocols that can tolerate network partitioning are becoming
increasingly important as more applications are being run across wide-area
networks in which failures may cause partitioning. Even with local area
networks, the use of taps and bridges may introduce points of possible failure
which can lead to partitioning. The objective of this project is to determine if
the reliable broadcast approach which has proven to be efficient and useful for
non- partitionable local area networks can be adapted to handle partitioning
with a reasonable amount of additional processing and communication overhead.
