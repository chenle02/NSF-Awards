This project is exploring the use of crowd-sourcing, or citizen science, to
produce a large database of analyzed human manipulation video. Every human is an
expert on human manipulation. Harnessing this expertise has the potential to
radically transform our knowledge of manipulation. A large analyzed video
database directly serves several important goals of robotics, including
autonomous robotic manipulation and recognition of human behavior. This new
approach is in its earliest stages. The project goals are to explore the new
approach, identify problems, assess the value, refine the vision, and formulate
plans. Activities include development of pilot interfaces, testing different
approaches to user training, and developing approaches to the filtering and
aggregation of results. The ultimate impact will be a broader scientific
understanding of human manipulation, and a large dataset to support research in
robotic manipulation and human behavior recognition. Results will be
disseminated through publication of discoveries related to human manipulation,
open access to the database, and open access to the crowd-sourcing interface and
related software.
