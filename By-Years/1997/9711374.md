The idea of executing a transactional system under a lower isolation level than
perfect Serializable isolation was introduced in a 1977 paper by IBM
researchers, and implemented in IBM's DB2. It is now offered by most commercial
DBMS systems supporting multi-user applications. Lower isolation levels permit
more transactional threads to simultaneously execute an application, so
processor resources are more effectively utilized. The tradeoff is that in
perfect isolation, no update performed by one application thread can have any
effect on data read and updated by an independent transactional thread; in lower
isolation levels this is no longer the case. The intent is to use lower
isolation levels only for "safe" applications, where the application code will
not use isolation weaknesses to arrive at erroneous results. But the database
field has no general method for deciding what applications are "safe". The
ultimate goal of this project is to develop a method for evaluating large
transactional application systems to determine what errors can arise at
different isolation levels in common commercial use. This process of evaluation
is to be known as Isolation Testing, and provides a list of all isolation
problems that can occur in the workload. It is then possible to make modest
changes in the database and application design to eliminate these errors and
gain the advantage of a lower isolation level. Isolation Testing has the
potential to make many of the largest commercial applications (e.g., banking,
airline reservations) more efficient in their use of computer resources.
