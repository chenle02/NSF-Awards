9415480 Rauch This research will develop a theoretical model of bureaucratic
institutions. The project is based on the idea that the creation of salaried
professional bureaucrats changes the way government functions, because it
changes the incentive mechanisms facing bureaucrats. Governments which have this
kind of bureauractic structure tend to take a longer view of the benefits from
public expenditures decisions. This means that they will tend at the margin to
allocate a greater proportion of government resources to infrastructure projects
that have a more distant payoff. The theoretical model is developed in which
city government is modelled in a principal-agent framework. The principal is the
elected official and the agents are the civil servants. Then the model is
extended to bureaucratic institutions in less developed countries, in which it
can be shown that merit-based promotion policies tend to reduce corruption and
enhance the efficiency of government. The models are tested using data for U.S.
cities in the early part of this century that experienced a wave of muinicipal
reform. Next the theory is put to a more direct test to ascertain whether less-
developed countries with merit-based promotion systems will exhibit higher
growth rates, all else equal, than those that do not. Data on growth rates of
the less-developed countries are used. This project is of significant interest
because it attempts to link bureauratic structure with efficiency in the
provision of governmental goods and services. The results from the study promise
to give us an understanding of the relationship between bureaucratic performance
and economic growth.
