0926762&lt;br/&gt;Shearer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). Granted funds
will support upgrade of compute facilities at the Institute for Geophysics and
Planetary Physics (IGPP) at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Upgrades
will include purchase of multiple new MacPro desktop computers with massive
random access memory, two XServe servers and an XServe 16 TB RAID disk array.
The enhance compute capacity will benefit a large number of of faculty at IGPP
for NSF funded studies ranging from electromagnetic exploration for mantle melts
and oceanic crustal fluids, to seismologic imaging of continental rifting
processes to space geodetic studies of crustal and cryosphere dynamics. Broader
impacts include the tradition IGPP excellence in graduate student mentorship and
the large base of NSF supported scientists with IGPP that will benefit from the
requested upgrade. Requested upgrades include Macintosh compute platforms (a
U.S. company).&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
