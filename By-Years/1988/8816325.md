Signal recognition particle (SRP), a ribonucleoprotein composed of six protein
subunits and one molecule of 7SL RNA, is the first element of the specialized
machinery which recognizes proteins destined for export from eukaryotic cells
via the secretory pathway. Based on in vitro experiments, it has been postulated
that, upon emergence of the signal sequence from the ribosome, SRP binds and
arrests translation. When the complex arrives at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
membrane, SRP interacts with a specific receptor, dissociates, and translation
of the protein resumes accompanied by vectorial translocation into the ER lumen.
By exploiting the unique advantages of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces
pombe, we will genetically and biochemically dissect secretory protein
targeting, focusing first on the essential 7SL component of SRP. Random
mutagenesis of the cloned gene followed by transformation and screening for
conditional or partial secretory defects will identify nucleotides which are
critical for function in vivo. Conserved sequences and structures will be
determined by comparison of 7SL homologs from divergent organisms, allowing
generation of specific models for its mode of action which will be tested by
site- directed mutagenesis of the S. pombe gene. Suppressor selection will
identify other components which interact with 7SL RNA, minimally the fission
yeast SRP proteins; other likely targets include the SRP receptor and ribosomal
proteins. Concurrent with the genetic experiments, a homologous in vitro system
will be developed to study SRP function; it will also be useful for
biochemically characterizing defects in the mutants. These studies will provide
insight into the mechanism by which cell sort proteins, the salient features of
which are conserved between fission yeast and humans.
