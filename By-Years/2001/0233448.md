With National Science Foundation support, Drs. William Kretzschmar and Sonja
Lanehart will conduct a linguistic survey research in the two most populous
counties of the Atlanta metropolitan are. The survey will include equal numbers
of African American and non-African American subjects in a one-hour interview
format. This study of Atlanta speech is the first in many years, and it occurs
in an urban area whose population has changed radically over the years. The
encoded interviews will be added to the Linguistic Atlas Website and so be
broadly accessible. &lt;br/&gt;
