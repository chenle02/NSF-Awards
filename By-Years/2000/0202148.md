DMS-0202148&lt;br/&gt;Paul Kirk&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI proposes to study
computations and applications of&lt;br/&gt;spectral invariants,
in&lt;br/&gt;particular the eta-invariant of generalized Dirac operators,
to&lt;br/&gt;problems in geometric topology and geometry. The focus will be
to&lt;br/&gt;use analytic and differential geometric machinery to study
spectral&lt;br/&gt;flow, the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer rho-invariant, and
the&lt;br/&gt;$SU(3)$-gauge theoretic Casson invariant. The main goal is to
&lt;br/&gt;develop usable cut-and-paste machinery for spectral invariants
using&lt;br/&gt;the theory of boundary-value problems for Dirac
operators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI's work in pure mathematics has
as its goal the solution and&lt;br/&gt;clarification of geometric problems in 3
dimensions. The setting of&lt;br/&gt;3 dimensions on the one hand is familiar to
all of us since the &lt;br/&gt;universe we live in is 3-dimensional. But
geometric problems in this &lt;br/&gt;area turn out to be very difficult for the
odd reason that in such &lt;br/&gt;low dimensions there is "not enough room to
move." The PI's approach &lt;br/&gt;to the area is to combine traditional 3
dimensional techniques with&lt;br/&gt;methods from other mathematical
disciplines such as differential &lt;br/&gt;geometry and analysis.&lt;br/&gt;
