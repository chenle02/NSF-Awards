In this project, Dimension Technologies Inc. (DTI) proposes to investigate
issues related to a color version of the high resolution illumination scheme
being investigated under the current NSF program number ISI-9161185, titled
"Demonstration of a Method of Creating a Very High Resolution Autosteroscopic
Flat Panel Display." The work will involve research into a field-sequential
color illumination technique for liquid crystal displays that promises to allow
the creation of ultrahigh resolution two-dimensional or autostereoscopic three-
dimensional images DTI has augmented its staff with experts in the fields of
color and psychophysics for purposes of this research. We believe the technique
proposed has features that overcome some of the problems and limitations
associated with previous field-sequential color illumination schemes, while
simultaneously allowing the creation of images that have greater resolution than
that provided by the LCD pixels themselves. If Phase 1 is research is
successful, it would lead to the development of a prototype display that would
use low cost LCD's yet be capable of very high resolution. We are convinced this
would broad appeal in the display industry which perpetually seeks higher
resolution and improved manufacturing yields at lower costs.
