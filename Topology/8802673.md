A Seifert manifold is a topological space with a bundle-like structure; that
is, it has a parameter space and over every point in the parameter space, there
sits another space called "a fiber." The fibers vary slightly from point to
point in the parameter space. Spaces of this class occur naturally in many
different branches of mathematics, for example, topology, differential geometry
and algebraic geometry, as well as in physics (crystallographic groups). The
investigator will study the geometry and topology of these spaces as well as
their symmetries. The problems to be studied vary from general questions
concerning the geometric structures of these spaces to specific problems
connected with the existence of symmetric and asymmetric Seifert manifolds. This
will greatly enhance our knowledge of this important class of spaces, their
intrinsic and extrinsic geometry, structure and properties. The broad spectrum
of techniques and methods which will be employed in this research include
methods of algebraic and geometric topology, differential geometry, Lie group
theory and group cohomology.
