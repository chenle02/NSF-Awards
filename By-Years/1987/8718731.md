Dr. Lomax proposes a feasibility study of a simple but powerful approach to
isolating the indole-3-acetic acid uptake symport. This involves photoaffinity
labeling of the protein in purified plant plasma membranes with a tritiated
azido-IAA analog, 3H-5N3IAA. The azido auxin after exposure to UV light in the
presence of plasma vesicles will provide a covalent label which will allow
identification of the protein during subsequent solubilization and purification
by HPLC and SDS-PAGE. The pilot studies will establish: 1. the optimal
conditions for the binding of 3H-5N3IAA to phase-purified plasma membrane
vesicles, 2. the affinity of 3H-5N3IAA for the uptake carrier, 3. the ability of
covalent binding of the azido auxin to block IAA transport by the uptake
symport, and 4. the specificity of the azido IAA for the carrier in the presence
of excess IAA, other auxin analogs, and auxin transport inhibitors. Taken
together, the results of these studies should indicate if only the uptake
symport or also other IAA-binding proteins (such as the efflux carrier) are
labeled and whether or not the photoaffinity method will be appropriate for
isolation of the auxin uptake carrier. %%% Very little is known about the
mechanisms of action of plant hormones. The hormone auxin is essential to the
control of plant development. This hormone is transported into the plant cells
by a specific protein transport carrier. The aim of this proposal is to identify
and isolate this transport protein in order that its structure and function can
be studied.
