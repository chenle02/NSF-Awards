This research includes two projects to study the influence of chromosome
structure on chromosome behavior and gene expression in Drosophila. The first
project focuses on the pal and K81 proteins which are required to stably
maintain paternal chromosomes during embryogenesis. To analyze their mechanism
of action, their subcellular localization is being followed during
spermatogenesis and embryogenesis, using hybrid proteins generated by fusions
with the fluorescent GFP marker. Methods to mark sperm DNA will be developed to
track paternal chromosome behavior in K81 mutant backgrounds. For the second
project, the organization of a large chromosomal domain is being studied through
the structural analysis of a genetically well characterized region of
heterochromatin. Molecular mapping and selected cloning of sequences within this
heterochromatic region should allow specific DNA sequences to be correlated with
the functional properties of heterochromatin. Interactive activities include:
teaching a graduate course, informal interactions with faculty and students, and
organizing a workshop for graduate students and postdocs that focus on issues
that affect their training and career choices. The workshops are intended to
stimulated productive discussions and offer practical solutions to problems
young scientists may encounter at different stages of their careers.
