This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the membrane-mimetic
studies of Professor Fendler at Syracuse University. The studies focus on the
preparation and characterization of metallic and semiconducting nanoparticles
and films in aqueous solutions, in surfactant vesicles, under aqueous
monolayers, and at air-water interfaces. Studies will also be conducted on the
transfer of the nanoparticles and films onto solid substrates as well as on the
incorporation between headgroups of Langmuir-Blodgett films. The different
systems will be characterized in and ex situ by a variety of physico-chemical
techniques amongst which atomic force microscopy. In this project Dr. Fendler
will conduct membrane- mimetic studies aimed at the preparation and
characterization of metallic, magnetic, and semiconducting nanoparticles and
films in aqueous media and vesicles. These investigations will provide the much
needed and necessary information for the development of a "wet colloid-chemical"
approach to the construction of advanced materials.
