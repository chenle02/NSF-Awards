This award supports a workshop entitled, "Genomic Perspectives of Soybean
Biology ". The goals of this meeting are to:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A. Assess the
biological rationales for soybean genomic research.&lt;br/&gt;B. Assess the
status of soybean genomic resources.&lt;br/&gt;C. Recommend key technology and
genomic approaches for achieving priority goals in soybean biological
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will likely occur in late October in
St. Louis, MO. A total of 25 scientists&lt;br/&gt;will be invited to
participate. These will represent experts in soybean genomics, genetics,
physiology, phylogeny and breeding. In addition, a number of distinguished
scientists will be invited who normally do not work with soybean but can provide
expertise in genomic technologies, comparative genomics, bioinformatics, plant
development and the genomic status of other legume species. A meeting report
will be generated at the close of the workshop, which will be subsequently
submitted for publication in Plant Physiology and distributed widely through
email and web resources. Additional follow-up meetings are envisioned to further
disseminate the results of the workshop to a broader,
including&lt;br/&gt;international, audience.&lt;br/&gt;
