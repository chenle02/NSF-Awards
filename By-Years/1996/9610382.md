DMI-9610382 White Warpage is the manifestation of residual stresses in composite
structures. For the automotive industry warpage leads to problems with the fit
and finish of body panel components. Dimensional accuracy is critical when
mating two body panels together at the joints. Extreme surface tolerances are
also critical in order to produce panels with smooth, glossy finishes. Residual
stresses will also ultimately lead to reduction in durability. Strength issues
associated with durability will become more important as composites are
gradually incorporated into the primary load bearing components of the car. This
research project is focused on process-induced residual stresses in composite
parts and their effect on the dimensional stability of the manufactured
component. The fundamental objectives of the proposal are: (1) to develop a
fundamental, mechanics-based understanding of the factors that control
dimensional accuracy and residual stresses in polymer-matrix composite parts;
(2) to create analytical and computational tools that will allow engineers to
predict the final dimensions and stresses in composite parts, and to anticipate
the effect of processing variables; and (3) to combine these analytical and
numerical tools with recent developments in optimization techniques to achieve
optimal manufacturing processes that minimize warpage and residual stress. This
collaborative research project addresses fundamental issues on the understanding
of factors that control dimensional accuracy and residual stresses in polymer-
matrix parts. The research project has a balance between theory and experiment,
and will provide valuable findings for the composite manufacturing industry.
