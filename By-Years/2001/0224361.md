Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) are not yet reliable and efficient
enough for electrical and mechanical power demands in Microsystems. Ball bearing
mechanisms are expected to increase long-term reliability and efficiency in
micro-machines through minimizing friction and wear, and to provide robustness
and stability for moving parts while avoiding fabrication complexities.
Therefore, "micro-ball bearing technology" is expected to have a pivotal impact
on micro-machinery applications such as micro-generators, micro-pumps, and
micro-coolers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our research program investigates the use of
micro-ball bearing technology for MEMS and micro-machinery applications. This
goal is addressed by developing a MEMS-based electrostatically actuated micro-
motor integrated with silicon micromachined bearings which house stainless-steel
micro-balls as support mechanism between rotor and stator. The micro-motor is
based on a novel scheme as a 6-phase, bottom-drive linear variable-capacitance
micro-motor supported on micro-ball bearings. The proposed research activity
focuses on (1) design, modeling, and dynamic simulation to realize an optimized
structure and geometry for the device, (2) technology development to improve
precision fabrication in conventional processing methods while minimizing
stress-inducing processes and carefully characterizing each unit step, and (3)
long-term reliability study to investigate (i) the operation of the electrical
components, such as the electrical rotor and stator under controlled
environment, and (ii) the dynamic behavior of the micro-ball bearings and their
effect on the performance of the device. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational
objectives in this program are based on an interactive learning environment
structured to incorporate research objectives into both undergraduate and
graduate level courses in MEMS and Microsystems at the University of
Maryland.&lt;br/&gt;
