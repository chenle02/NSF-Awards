Professor Stanley Angel of the University of South Carolina is supported by the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry program in a collaboration with Dr. A.
DeGiacomo of the University of Bari, Italy. Through experiments and theory, the
team is studying the mechanism of an atomic analytical method, laser-induced
breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS), in order to improve LIBS as a technique capable
of analyzing solids without sample preparation. Particularly, a dual pulse
sequence has resulted in 100-fold enhanced LIBS, but the mechanism for the
enhancement, larger plasma volume, lower continuum background and increased
electron temperature are not known. Systematic studies will be conducted to test
the hypothesis that the effects are due to plasma re-heating and pre-ionization
above the sample. For example, the team will attempt to duplicate dual-pulse
results by creating a pre-ionized region using glow discharge. Four elements,
Al, Fe, Cu and Cr, in three sample matrices (glass, steel and pure metals) will
be studied as model systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Applications include
environmental, health, forensic, geological and industrial analysis. The work
will enable students to interact with international scientists as well as staff
at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. &lt;br/&gt;
