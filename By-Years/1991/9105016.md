Capillary Zone Electrophoresis (CZE) is probably the simplest and perhaps the
most universally useful mode of High Performance Capillary Electrophoresis
(HPCE), which combines the strengths of both conventional electrophoresis in
resolving power and High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) in the ease
and speed of analysis. A fundamental problem in CZE is to directly control the
zeta potential at the aqueous/capillary interface. Director control of the zeta
potential is essential for manipulating the electroosmotic flow inside the
capillary and the adsorption of macromolecules onto the capillary wall. An
instrumentation method involving the use of an additional electric field from
outside the capillary for controlling the zeta potential is therefore proposed
in this study. The fundamentals of this approach will be studied both
experimentally and theoretically with the proposed capacitor model. Significant
improvements of separation efficiency and resolution of protein mixtures and DNA
fragments for both qualitative and quantitative applications will then be
demonstrated and achieved.
