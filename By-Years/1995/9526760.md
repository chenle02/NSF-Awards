Abstract ATM-9526760 Perry J. Samson University of Michigan UNIDATA: Blue Skies
UNIDATA Equipment Funds will purchase a UNIX-based server to provide Internet
Data Distribution (IDD) services. The present server acts as the primary server
for the Blue Skies Project. This project is sponsored by NSF/EHR and focuses on
delivering data and software tools to the K-12 educational community.It was
anticipated that Blue-Skies related load on the IDD server will triple and
required a dedicated server.
