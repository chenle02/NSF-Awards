This project investigates the effects of a severe arctic storm on community
structure and evolution of the mussel, Mytilus califonianus . The storm
descended on the Pacific Northwest in late December 1990 and resulted in
atypical freezing weather in the intertidal zone inhabited by the mussels. Such
events probably occur about once in every twenty five years although there is
some evidence of an increase. The mussels were severely affected by the freeze,
and large mortalities were observed. However, mortality appears to be
non.random. Mussels with other organisms living on and with them, such as
barnacles and algae, did not die as often as mussels without associated
organisms. This project will document mortality through field collections, and
carry out genetic analysis (by the technique of electrophoresis) of survivors
and of dead individuals. The results will determine whether genetic and
phenotypic changes in the mussel populations will accompany community wide
changes, and hence whether evolutionary changes will occur.
