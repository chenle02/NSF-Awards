Myeloperoxidase is one member of a family of homologous mammalian peroxidases (a
class of heme proteins) for which no previous X-ray crystallographic structural
studies have been reported. This enzyme occurs in the mammalian neutrophil,
where it catalyses the hydrogen peroxide mediated oxidation of chloride ion to
hypochlorite, an effective anti-bacterial chlorinating agent. An electron
density map of canine myeloperoxidase has been determined at 3 A resolution and
preliminary interpretation of this map has included identification of the
histidine proximal ligand to the heme iron. This project is concerned with
further interpretation and refinement of the electron density map to determine
the complete courses of the 4 polypeptide chains comprising an entire
myeloperoxidase molecule. High resolution structural studies of human
myeloperoxidase, using molecular replacement methods will be carried out to
determine conformational details of the active site. The goal is to determine
the catalytic mechanism for this enzyme and other related members of the same
gene family.
