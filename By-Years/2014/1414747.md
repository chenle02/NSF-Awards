The ability to separate and analyze a specific compound from a mixture enables
scientists to make crucial discoveries that advance their science. Separations
of compounds are used in all chemical and biological sciences, as well as
engineering. One important technique for these separations is Electrokinetic
Chromatography (EKC). This is an analytical technique that provides fast
separations of minute amounts of sample through the use of an electric potential
across a solution. This specific research will synthesize new materials that
provide unique separation properties and improved performance within EKC. This
research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Emily Hilder, an eminent
scientist in the field of separation science at the Australian Center for
Research on Separation Science (ACROSS). As one of the premier centers for
separation science research in the world, ACROSS provides the infrastructure
needed to demonstrate the performance of latex nanoparticles (NP), the solid
substructure within the EKC separation column. This collaborative work will
provide a critical step in bringing advances in EKC to the separations
community.

This work will utilize advanced CE-ESI-MS instrumentation at ACROSS to achieve
the high detection sensitivity required, and to demonstrate ESI interface
compatibility. The NP PSPs performance will be characterized with Linear
Solvation Energy Relationship (LSER) models to understand the effects of NP
structure on selectivity and mobility. The LSER data will provide a fundamental
understanding of the effects of NP size and chemistry on methylene selectivity
and retention factors. This will provide the data needed to guide the
engineering of NP PSPs for specific applications. In addition, the PSPs will be
used in current research applications to illustrate NP PSP applicability to
cutting edge challenges that are not addressed by existing separations
technology. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Australian
Academy of Science.
