Recent developments in electronics, such as the introduction of relatively low
cost power switching devices and readily applicable microprocessors, are
resulting in the widespread adoption of power electronic converters and
controllers. Consequently the emphasis of electrical energy conversion education
must adapt to reflect these changes. This project proposes to introduce
contemporary display and recording techniques to undergraduate classes. For
subjective exposure to the phenomena of voltages and currents with high harmonic
content, current probes which respond faithfully to signals from dc to high
frequency are required, together with appropriate oscilloscopes for display,
capture and storage. Measurements of true r.m.s. values now require special
meters which respond correctly to non-sinusoidal ac and distorted dc components.
Finally, transducers based on Hall-effect devices are needed for measurements to
determine true power and power factor. It is the aim of this project to provide
undergraduates with hands-on experience in this rapidly changing and highly
important area.
