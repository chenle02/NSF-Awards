Carbon-carbon composites tend to be weak, since they contain cracks and pores,
and oxidize rapidly at elevated temperatures. This research project uses a
variation of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) to produce an oxidation resistant
layer. The method involves maintaining the inital composite in a thermal
gradient while time varying the constitution of the reacting gas in such a way
as to periodically gasify the pores near the surface while simultaneously
depositing carbon on the internal cavities. A similar technique will be used to
produce graded surface coatings of mixed oxides and carbides from Si, Hf, Zr,
and Ta. Carbon fiber reinforced carbon matrix composites are attractive
materials for high strength, light weight structural applications.
Characteristics such as high heat of ablation, good thermal shrink resistance
and chemical inertness result in a material that offers high performance in
extreme thermal and chemical environments (e.g., disk brakes, space structures,
jet engine parts, medical protheses, chemical plants, and heat exchangers).
Carbon-carbon composites tend to be weak due to the presence of pores and
cracks, and oxidize rapidly at elevated temperature. This project will address
some of the weakness of this material by a novel processing technique.
