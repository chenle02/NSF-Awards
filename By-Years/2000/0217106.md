0217106&lt;br/&gt;Yang&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is to develop
advanced analytical and numerical modeling techniques for understanding,
analyzing, and predicting combustion dynamics in gas-turbine engines for
propulsion and power-generation applications by international cooperative
research with Hankuk Aviation Univertsity in Korea. The expected results would
provide a general framework about various phenomena of combustion dynamics and
the models could also serve as a backbone for implementing active control
schemes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
