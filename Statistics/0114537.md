This award provides funds to partially support the participation of up to eight
Ph.D. students at the SRCOS/ASA Summer Research Conference in Statistics, to be
held June 3-6, 2001, in St. Augustine, FL. This relatively small conference will
have about 50 to 60 participants, mostly from the 14-state SRCOS (Southern
Regional Council on Statistics) region. The format of the meeting, with a
detailed background of the presented research at the beginning of each talk,
provides junior researchers and Ph.D. students with a great entry point into the
various areas of research. Areas of emphasis for this year's meeting are
statistics education (including distance education), outlier detection, and
Markov chain Monte Carlo methods in generalized linear mixed models. The meeting
facilitates interaction between junior and senior researchers, and junior
researchers are encouraged to present their research either in the form of a
talk or a poster session.
