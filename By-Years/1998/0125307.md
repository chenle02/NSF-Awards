The process of rifting of continents to produce oceanic lithosphere is a first
order phenomenon on Earth. Unfortunately, most rifted margins are buried by
thick accumulations of sedimentary rock, hindering direct observation of the
structures which formed during rifting. This project will address several
significant questions about oblique rifting with a multi-disciplinary study of
the Salton Trough in southern California. This region is undergoing active
extension and right-lateral strike-slip faulting related to opening of the Gulf
of California and the San Andreas fault. Exposures of bedrock are excellent and
there is an opportunity to examine a plate margin caught in the process of
forming. A combination of geological, sedimentological, geophysical, and
geochronological methods will be brought to bear to study the partitioning of
strain between strike-slip and normal faults and the accompanying
sedimnetological response to each.
