Blood vessels play a critical role in supplying tissues with nutrients and gases
while removing wastes. In the brain, blood vessels play an additional role in
protecting nerve tissue from fluctuations of constituents that may occur
elsewhere in the body. How blood vessels in the brain play this dual role is the
subject of the research covered in the present proposal. The work proposed here
focuses on the blood vessels in amphibians and reptiles. These animals have a
unique arrangement of vessels in the brain and it is proposed that the
arrangement itself plays an important role in how the vessels work.
Understanding how these unique vascular systems work will allow the PI to
understnd the advantages and limitations to other vascular arrangements.
