Regular Equipment Grant to purchase a computer workstation to be used in
intensive computing for new research in microelectronics. The acquisition of
improved computing capability is needed for calculations that presently take
hours or do not run on the computers available to the faculty principal
investigators and their graduate students. Calculations include (1) modeling of
plasma etching of semiconductors (2) design and analysis of optical waveguides
and (3) analysis of microwave and millimeter wave structures by the method of
moments.
