This project is devoted to study of tensor categories, which are abstract
mathematical objects expressing an intuitive notion of symmetry in precise
mathematical language. These objects naturally appear in various areas of
mathematics. In addition, tensor categories are relevant to some areas of
physics, such as condensed matter physics, where some special types of tensor
categories are used to describe anyons -- quasi-particles that are governed by
statistics different from bosonic or fermionic type. Tensor categories also
appear in theoretical computer science as a framework for topological quantum
computation, one potential framework for design of a quantum computer.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of this project is to advance knowledge about
tensor categories. The project addresses the following areas: development of
general theory with an eye on specific classification theorems; applications of
general theory of tensor categories to other areas of mathematics; and search
for new interesting examples of tensor categories. More specifically, the work
includes the following projects: study of semisimple tensor categories with
specific Grothendieck rings; study of possible actions (or, equivalently, of
module categories) of well-known tensor categories constructed via the Wess-
Zumino-Witten model; study of symmetric tensor categories in positive
characteristic; search for new examples of tensor categories using theory of
Kazhdan-Lusztig cells and Soergel bimodules; and search for applications of
tensor categories in the theory of vertex algebras and finite W-algebras.
