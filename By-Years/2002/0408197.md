DISSERTATION RESEARCH: &lt;br/&gt;Neuropeptide modulation of auditory and
lateral line systems in coral reef fishes&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Principal
Investigator: Timothy C. Tricas, Doctoral Student: Karen P.
Maruska&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neuron cell bodies that produce the neuropeptide
hormones gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and arginine vasotocin (AVT) are
regionally distributed in the vertebrate brain and known to be important
regulators of reproductive development and behavior. However, the extensive
projections of axons throughout the brain indicate additional functions not
directly related to pituitary hormone release and reproduction. The sensory
neuromodulation hypothesis proposes that these peptides affect sensory
processing of sexual stimuli and integrate sensory input with motor activities
related to social behaviors, but few studies have directly tested this
hypothesis. This project will test the sensory neuromodulation hypothesis using
the Hawaiian sergeant major fish, a common benthic-spawning reef species. Social
behaviors and the related acoustic stimuli produced by males and females during
reproduction will be characterized, and the importance of their auditory and
lateral line senses in these natural behaviors determined. Neurophysiological
and microinjection experiments will then directly test the effects of GnRH and
AVT on the sensitivity and processing of these stimuli in the central nervous
system. This integrative study will present the first test of the sensory
neuromodulation hypothesis in the auditory and lateral line sensory systems of
fishes, and provide critical information for determining the function of
neuropeptide modulation of hair-cell based sensory mechanisms in vertebrates.
Undergraduates will be trained in behavior and neurobiology research techniques,
and secondary school students from outreach programs will be involved to
encourage their pursuit of careers in science.&lt;br/&gt;
