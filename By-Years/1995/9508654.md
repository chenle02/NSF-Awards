CTS-9508654 Ydstie Carnegie Mellon The objective of this research is to develop
design theory for a singularity free multivariable adaptive controller. This
will be done by combining adaptive control theory with non-convex optimization,
an approach which represents a departure from current design philosophies based
on convexification, switching logic and/or persistent excitation. Fast
adaptation based on second order information and nonlinear programming should
improve the convergence rate. Matched control and estimation objectives will be
applied so that optimal steady state performance can be achieved. The
optimization based algorithm will be based on theory and have few ad hoc tuning
parameters. The new concepts in this research are the "centered parameter",
which gives optimal performance of a parameterized control system, the use of
non-convex optimization to solve singularity problems and the use of adaptive
filters to match design and optimization objectives. The theory will apply to a
broad class of certainty equivalence adaptive control algorithms including H
infinity, LQG and predictive control. The PIs will work on implementation of
adaptive control to large scale industrial processes. Experiments show that it
is in multivariable applications that adaptive control shows greatest potential
giving improvement in process operation.
