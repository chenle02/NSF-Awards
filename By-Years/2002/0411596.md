USA-Sweden Collaborative Workshop in Algebraic Combinatorics

The Mittag-Leffler Institute in Djursholm, Sweden, will devote the spring of
2005 to a special program entitled "Algebraic Combinatorics." On the occasion of
this program, we propose to organize a collaborative research experience for
young researchers from Sweden and the US. We request funds to support the
participation of six young researchers from the US for two to three months each
in this collaborative workshop. This workshop will provide a unique opportunity
for these young mathematicians to develop collaborations with their counterparts
from Sweden, as well as with leaders in the field from Scandanavia, Western
Europe, and Asia. In the long term the workshop will increase the potential for
these young mathematicians to become leading researchers in algebraic
combinatorics and related areas.

The theme of the program will be the interaction between combinatorics and such
other branches of mathematics as algebra, geometry, and topology. At least 28 of
the world's leading researchers in algebraic combinatorics have agreed to
participate in the program for at least one month each. Topics that will be
investigated during the program include classical enumerative combinatorics
(e.g., the Mills-Robbins-Rumsey conjectures, statistics on finite and affine
Coxeter groups), convex polytopes (boundary structure, flag f-vectors,
diameters, Charney-Davis conjecture, applications to computational algebra,
minimal triangulations), and connections with algebra (outgrowths of the n!
conjecture, Schubert and Grothendieck polynomials, ribbon tableaux).
