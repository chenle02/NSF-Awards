This project is disseminating the process of interactive Internet-Based Teaching
and Learning in Mathematics, specifically differential geometry, multivariable
calculus, and linear algebra, to a large number of diverse institutions. The
project is making the benefits of this approach broadly available through a
series of summer projects and activities at national meetings. Further, the
project is ensuring that the approach is more adaptable and scalable for use in
courses for mathematics majors, for science students, for liberal arts
mathematics, and for teacher training programs.

The interactive aspect of the approach encompasses three elements: 1) teachers
and students interact with geometric phenomena both for classroom presentations
and students exploration; 2) students do their homework and exams online and
receive timely comments from instructors; and 3) students are able to read the
responses of their classmates and instructors as they engage directly in
discussion or group work over the web. Tutorials are available to make it easy
for students without a sophisticated computer background to upload scanned
drawings and to include images and links in their communications. Interactive
illustrations are possible with the use of the Geometer's Sketchpad.

Workshops to disseminate the approach are being conducted in conjunction with
the summer MathFests of the MAA with additional meetings at the January Joint
Mathematical Meetings. Assessment of the effectiveness of the approach is being
conducted by a professional and encompasses an extensive content analysis
component.
