The Solomon Sea is a small ocean basin 1000 km north of the Great Barrier Reef
of northeast Australia that is gradually disappearing as the Papuan Peninsula of
eastern New Guinea collides with the New Britain island arc. This oblique
collision has been completed along its western extremity and has resulted in the
fold and trust belt on the island of New Guinea. Drs. Silver and Reed will to
conduct a 32-day survey of the Solomon Sea to study the structural and
sedimentologic processes involved in this collision process, the features of
which are a contemporary analog to the Laramide orogeny that formed the eastern
Rocky Mountains. 23 days of seafloor imaging will be conducted with SeaMarcII;
these data will be supplemented by simultaneous collection of single channel
airgun profiles, 3.5 KHz echosounding records, magnetics and gravity. 7 days
will be devoted to collecting piston cores, and during 2 additional days, bottom
photographs will be collected. Participants from the Geological Survey of Papua
New Guinea and the Australian National University will join the cruise and
conduct subsequent analyses. The entire data set will make possible the
comparison to structures and sedimentation observed onshore in the fold and
thrust belt of New Guinea, and provide better understanding of orogenic
processes.
