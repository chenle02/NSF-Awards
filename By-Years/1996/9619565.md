In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division
Sandra Greer of the Department of Chemical Engineering of the University of
Maryland- College Park will continue her research on the nature of the phase
transitions of polymers and equilibrium reversible polymerization, in which the
monomers undergo a reversible chemical reaction to form polymers. In this
project microscopic and macroscopic experimental methods will be used to study
the energy changes, the structural changes, and the details of the approach to
equilibrium near the critical point. The microscopic studies will use neutron
scattering to investigate the structure of the solutions and the motion of the
polymers in them. The macroscopic studies will include measurements of
equilibrium properties such as density, heat capacity, phase diagrams, kinetic
rate constants and transport properties such as viscosity. These studies in
reversible polymerization are of relevance for understanding the mechanism of
polymer formation in systems of technological and biological interest.
