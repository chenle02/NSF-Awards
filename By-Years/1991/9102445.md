This proposal to the Upper Atmosphere Facilities program of the Atmospheric
Sciences Division provides fora continuation of the baseline program of
incoherent scatter radar observations and analysis activities at the Millstone
Hill Observatory. As this program provides the principal support for hardware
systems, computers, scientific analyses, and user support services at the
Millstone Hill Observatory, a wide range of necessary activities is proposed .
The operational program and research plan proposed emphasize multi-station and
cooperative experiments and their analyses. Full participation in World Day
coordinated activities and preparation of data for the CEDAR data base at NCAR
are included. Radar operations and analysis in support of the CEDAR program are
not funded separately by the CEDAR program and are included in this proposal.
Basic maintenance of the Millstone Hill UHF radar and FPI optical systems for
scientific programs is included as is support for the on-site computer and data
analysis facility.//
