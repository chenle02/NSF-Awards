Description: This project supports research to be conducted by an Indian team
led by Dr.Lali Chatterjee of the Physics Dept. of Jadavpur University in
Calcutta and a team led by Dr. Thornton Murphy of Fermi National Accelerator
Laboratory. The Indian scientists will participate on Fermilab Experiments 782
and 802. In E782, a study of muon interactions in a bubble chamber, two
scientists from India, Drs. Chatterjee and Gosh will participate with several
U.S. and foreign institutions. In E802, a study of muon interactions in
emulsion, the Jadavpur team has been approved by Fermilab as the sole
investigator. The visits by the Indian scientists to Fermilab will cover three
phases: planning the emulsion exposure, exposing the stack, and establishing
bubble chamber scanning criteria and efficiencies to assure consistency of film
scanning in Calcutta. Scope: This project represents a strong collaborative
effort in experiments that require efforts and inputs from scientists from
several countries utilizing major U.S. facilities and unique experimental
opportunities. The collaboration will be beneficial to both the U.S. and the
Indian scientists.
