9414218 Norton ABSTRACT This program is a manufacturing workforce retraining
activity involving Weber State University in a highly integrated partnership
with Utah Valley State College, Salt Lake Community College, and the Ogden/Weber
and Mountainlands Advanced Technology Centers. The objective is to provide
proactive outreach, assistance, and interaction with small manufacturers and to
develop short courses and delivery systems targeting personnel in defense-
related and manufacturing industries in the inter mountain region of Utah,
Idaho, and Wyoming. It uses distance and interactive learning to overcome
geographic dispersion of students and industries in the region. Using the
broadcast receiver from the University of Utah in an instructional TV
partnership, this project seeks to improve information infrastructure for
greater access to manufacturing knowledge. The State of Utah has committed to
build the computer trunk line to strengthen the necessary linkages among
industry, academe, and regional authorities. ***
