9501848 Sober Research will be carried out in photo-production of mesons using
the CLAS detector at the CEBAF electron accelerator, and in low energy electron
scattering at the Darmstadt linear accelerator in Germany. The former data, to
be obtained using circularly polarized photons and with polarized targets, will
be used to test the Gerasimov-Drell-Hearn sum rule which relates to the spin
structure of the nucleon. This is one of the high priority subjects within
contemporary nuclear physics. In connection with this work, development of the
CEBAF photon tagger will be carried out. Additional studies of strangeness
photoproduction will be carried out in conjunction with other members of the
CEBAF CLAS collaboration. The low energy electron scattering will be carried out
at the newly-established, low- energy, 180 degree electron scattering facility.
That work will focus on determining magnetic transition strength in light- and
medium-weight nuclei. These data will be used to test nuclear structure
calculations. Development, construction, and utilization of major state-of-the-
art equipment is integral to this activity. Education of graduate students is a
strong component in every aspect of this grant. ***
