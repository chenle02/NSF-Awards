This project will analyze how coevolution between plants and insects shapes the
web of interactions among species in contrasting ecosystems. This project will
address one of the current major challenges in biology, which is how and why the
same groups of species interact in different ways in different ecosystems. The
specific goal is to understand how groups of interacting species diverge
genetically and ecologically as they coevolve and expand their geographic ranges
into new environments. The study will use interactions between a group of common
plant species in western North America and a group of insect species that are
the major herbivores and pollinators of those plants. DNA sequencing and related
molecular methods will be used to evaluate how populations of these interacting
species are genetically connected across ecosystems. The second part of the work
will combine field observations of the use of flowers by the different insect
species with measurements of floral morphology to assess whether the traits of
these interacting plants and animals differ geographically. This will provide a
test of the geographic mosaic theory of coevolution, which predicts that the
strength of matching of floral trait to insect species varies with the presence
of competing species of both the plant and insect. The third part of the work
will use laboratory experiments to quantify the mechanisms by which natural
selection shapes floral traits differently in the different ecosystems.

Collectively, these genetic and ecological studies will contribute to a broader
understanding of how the web of life is organized spatially across ecosystems,
and whether there are predictable patterns in how networks of interacting
species change under different environmental conditions. A deeper understanding
of the organization of species networks is crucial to predicting the
consequences of climate change, and to conserving and restoring the biological
integrity of ecosystems. This award will also support the training of graduate
and undergraduate students and a postdoctoral fellow in interdisciplinary
research at the interface of ecology and evolution.
