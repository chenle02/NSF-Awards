Paulay 9322387 The massive earthquake that shook the Pacific island of Guam on
August 8, 1993, offers an unprecedented opportunity for studying the effects of
tectonic forces on coral community composition. The great variation observed in
damage intensity among sites point to a variety of factors being important in
influencing the susceptibility of reefs to earthquake damage. In this study,
scientists will describe the effects of the earthquake on the reefs surrounding
Guam, and evaluate how location, shelter, colony growth form, and reef
topography affected that severity of damage. ***
