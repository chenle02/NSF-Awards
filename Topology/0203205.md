The proposed work is centered on K(1)-local homotopy theory and its applications
to algebraic K-theory. One goal of the project is to compute the mod 2 homology
of the general linear group of a number ring. A broader objective is a
systematic study of K(1)-local homotopy theory from the perspective of Iwasawa
theory, with a view toward applications to the algebraic K-theory spectra of
number rings.

One of the most striking features of modern mathematics is its essential unity.
Time and again one finds that seemingly unrelated branches of the subject
interact in unexpected ways. The interaction of of algebraic topology and number
theory is a noteworthy example of this phenomenon. Number theory began as a
"discrete" subject, then turned analytic in the 19th century and increasingly
geometric in the 20th. In the last thirty years or so, algebraic topology (the
study of properties of geometric objects, such as curves and surfaces, that
remain invariant under deformation) has entered more and more into number-
theoretic questions. The proposed work will explore further the remarkable
connections between these two subjects, by analyzing the topology of certain
geometric objects that can be associated to classical number-theoretic data.
