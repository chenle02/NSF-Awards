9722070 Fink The 1997 FASEB Summer Research Conference on Amyloid and Protein
Assembly Processes will be held at Copper Mountain, Colorado from July 13-18,
1997. This conference should provide an increased awareness of protein
deposition as a process that is not only biologically relevant but also exhibits
significant molecular structure and specificity. The focus is on protein
aggregation and other manifestations of protein-protein interactions, e.g.,
domain swapping. A main thrust of the conference is on folding and aggregation
of polypeptide backbones using state of the art methodology. The conference will
be attended by a maximum of 160 participants. The topics are mainly fundamental
in nature. This meeting will bring together biologists familiar with the biology
of protein aggregation and assembly processes in order to understand the
molecular biology and biophysical basis of these phenomena. The format of the
FASEB Summer Research Conferences is ideal for stimulating cross-fertilization
in developing areas of research.
