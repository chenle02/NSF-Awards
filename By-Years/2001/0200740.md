The PI studies several problems about triangulations of
(lattice)&lt;br/&gt;polytopes which are motivated by connections to other fields
of&lt;br/&gt;mathematics:&lt;br/&gt;The reconstruction problem is concerned with
the relation of a&lt;br/&gt;polytope and its graph, which is of interest for
linear &lt;br/&gt;optimization. Algebraic applications are concerned with
polytopes &lt;br/&gt;whose vertices have all integral coordinates. The existence
&lt;br/&gt;problem of unimodular triangulations and its variations has
&lt;br/&gt;implications to computational algebra, algebraic geometry, and
&lt;br/&gt;physical string theory. The methods used are mainly discrete
&lt;br/&gt;geometric or combinatorial, with some ideas borrowed from
&lt;br/&gt;topology and differential geometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Convex
polytopes are fascinating objects that have intrigued not &lt;br/&gt;only
mathematicians since the ancient Greeks. The Platonic &lt;br/&gt;solids --- the
tetrahedron, the cube, the octahedron, the &lt;br/&gt;dodecahedron, and the
icosahedron --- are the most prominent and &lt;br/&gt;most mystified examples.
Since George Dantzig's simplex method, &lt;br/&gt;linear optimization has been a
driving force behind polytope &lt;br/&gt;theory, and it certainly is one of the
most successful &lt;br/&gt;applications of mathematics to the `real world'. In
the mean time, &lt;br/&gt;polytope theory found many more applications within
mathematics, &lt;br/&gt;and beyond. Besides linear and integer programming,
there are &lt;br/&gt;optimization, CAD, visualization, and even theoretical
physics,&lt;br/&gt;just to name a few.&lt;br/&gt;
