This award will provide participant support for US graduate students to
participate in the 2014 International School for Cosmic Ray Astrophysics to be
held on July 4-11, 2014 in Erice, Sicily, Italy. The theme of the Course this
year is "Exploring the High Energy Universe." Topics of discussion will be the
new experiments, new experimental results and the new understanding of them. The
course will emphasize the multi-messenger approach to astrophysics, a cross-
disciplinary effort that combines observations of electromagnetic radiation,
measurements involving neutrinos, and measurements of other high-energy
particles. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The school has a particular focus on early
career scientists and graduate students. Therefore, the School is important in
the education of such young scientists not only because of the lectures they
listen to, but also because during the School they directly communicate with the
more experienced scientists who are the lecturers. In addition, the
international character of the School fosters the global interaction of these
young scientists in this fundamentally global research endeavor.
