Homogeneous varieties, in particular, ordinary and isotropic Grassmannians, are
central objects of study in algebraic geometry, representation theory, and
combinatorics. The investigator proposes to develop positive algorithms for
computing the structure constants of the cohomology of isotropic Grassmannians
and isotropic flag varieties. In recent years, similar positive algorithms have
led to the solutions of many important problems for Type A Grassmannians,
including the saturation conjecture and the reality of Schubert calculus. The
investigator will also study the effective cones of the moduli space of curves
and stable maps. The moduli spaces of curves are among the most studied objects
in mathematics. Their cones of effective divisors are important invariants,
intimately tied to problems such as the Schottky problem, the Kodaira dimension
of the moduli space of curves, and the existence of modular forms. Recently,
understanding the effective cone of moduli spaces has received new impetus
following the seminal work of Hacon, McKernan, and their collaborators on the
Minimal Model Program (MMP). The investigator proposes to run MMP on moduli
spaces such as the Kontsevich moduli spaces of genus zero stable maps or Hilbert
scheme of points on the projective plane. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Systems of
polynomial equations occur in many facets of life ranging from evolutionary
biology to physics and from cryptography to computer science. Algebraic geometry
studies geometric properties of solutions of polynomial systems. The solutions
that have many symmetries are especially interesting and important. For example,
a sphere is a perfectly symmetric space in the sense that any point can be
rotated to any other point. The investigator studies the number of solutions to
polynomial systems involving such perfectly symmetric spaces called homogeneous
varieties. The investigator also calculates more subtle geometric invariants of
systems of polynomial equations such as how the behavior of the space of
solutions changes under perturbations of the system.
