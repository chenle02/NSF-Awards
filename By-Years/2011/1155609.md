Intellectual Merit: The PIs will use the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica)
in Pamlico Sound, North Carolina, as a model system and will attempt to optimize
the design of networks of no-take reserves as a strategy for maintaining
metapopulations of this commercially harvested species. The project specifically
recognizes that network persistence depends on (1) the potential for growth,
survival, and reproduction within reserves, and (2) the potential to distribute
offspring among reserves. Thus, demographic processes within reserves and
settling areas play important roles, along with variability of physical
transport. The PIs plan to: (1) test and refine 3D bio-physical models of
connectivity due to oyster larval transport in a shallow, wind-dominated system;
(2) test, refine, and apply technology to detect natal origins of larvae using
geochemical tags in larval shell; and (3) integrate regional connectivity and
demographic rates to model metapopulation dynamics.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This study will produce new tools and
test and refine others used for studying larval connectivity, a fundamentally
important process in the maintenance of natural populations, and thus in
biological conservation and resource management. The tools include a
hydrodynamic modeling tool coupled with an open-source particle tracking model
that will be available on-line with computer code and user guide. The project
will use integrated modeling approaches to evaluate the design of reserve
networks: results will be directly useful to improving oyster and ecosystem-
based management in Pamlico Sound, and the methods will inform approaches to
network design in other locations. There is extensive education and outreach in
the form of training undergraduate and graduate students, mentoring post-docs,
and providing hands-on research opportunities for high school students and their
teachers.
