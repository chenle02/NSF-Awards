Atomic and Molecular Physics (ITAMP) at the Harvard/Smithsonian. The ITAMP is
the focal point for group activities in theoretical atomic and molecular physics
in the US. The funds support a long and short term visitor program,
postdoctorals, graduate students and topical workshops on various sugjects of
interest to the atomic and molecular physics community. ITAMP activities have
been instrumental in the revitalization of atomic and molecular theory in this
country. ***
