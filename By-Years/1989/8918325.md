Functional constraints in a manufactured assembly assure the proper relative
movement of interconnected parts. Recent results in kinematics show that the
Clifford Algebra of projective three space provides a convenient representation
of these functional constraints as quadratic algebraic surfaces. A Clifford
Algebra is a vector space with a product operation that contains information
about the metric properties of the underlying space. In the case of three
dimensions the Clifford Algebra also represents the group of spatial rigid
displacements. In this research the investigator will derive the manifolds for
six spatial functional constraints, show how this theory represents the planar
mating of two "peg-in-hole" constraints as the intersection of hyperboloids. The
goal of the research is to generalize these results to a formalism that
prescribes geometrically the bounds of relative spatial position and orientation
of two parts. This geometric prescription will facilitate assembly verification
and tolerance verification.
