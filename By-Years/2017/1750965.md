Software has been changing our lives for many decades, but despite the advances
in programming language design, how we write programs has not changed much:
programmers keep repeating similar mistakes, writing similar programs, and
fixing similar bugs. Program synthesis, the art of automatically generating
programs that meet user intents, promises to increase the productivity of
programmers and end-users of computing devices by automating tedious, error-
prone, and time-consuming tasks. Despite the practical successes of program
synthesis, we still do not have systematic frameworks to synthesize programs
that are good according to certain metrics-e.g., produce programs of a
reasonable size or with good running time-and to understand when synthesis can
result in such good programs. This project investigates the problem of
performing program synthesis in the presence of quantitative objectives while
providing quantitative guarantees on the results and on the performance of the
synthesis algorithms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates new formal
methods such as weighted grammars and weighted logics, to specify quantitative
objectives on the syntax, semantics, and probabilistic outcomes of the
synthesized programs, as well as new synthesis algorithms for solving problems
expressible in such formalisms. The proposed work will lead to more predictable,
accurate, and robust synthesis algorithms, which will be integrated widely used
synthesis applications such as tools for personalized education, network
synthesis, programming by examples, and automated program repair. The
investigator will organize a series of lectures about the impact of program
synthesis on the labor force and will lead several diversity and outreach
efforts to undergraduates, women, under-represented minorities, and non-
traditional students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
