9311915 Kumar The primary focus of this research is to understand the
practically important question of the miscibility of polymeric systems from a
molecular view point. An argument is made that the bulk thermodynamics of
polymeric systems are poorly understood at this time since they are strongly
dependent on local aspects, such as chain structure, stiffness and packing,
which are not captured accurately by coarse-grained polymeric theories.
Consequently, computer simulation on realistic chain models would represent an
accurate technique to capture the effects of local structure and unpacking on
thermodynamics properties. In addition to PVT equation of state properties,
which can be obtained through standard computer simulation methods, newly
proposed techniques will be used to enumerate the thermodynamic properties,
especially the phase behavior, of these systems. In parallel the effect of film
thickness on the phase separation in ultrathin polymer blends films will be
studied. It is emphasized that a good understanding of this fundamentally
important physical phenomenon is predicated on understanding, not only the
surface behavior of polymeric systems, but also the bulk thermodynamics. This
issue has already been studied in some detail from a theoretical viewpoint and
experimental investigations are currently in progress. Finally, a good
understanding of this situation also requires knowledge of the steric penalty
associated with confining molecules near surfaces, and these aspects will be
examined through a study of the alignment of liquid crystalline molecules in the
vicinity of flat surfaces. ***
