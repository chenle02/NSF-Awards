An interdisciplinary team of anthropologists, engineers, computer scientists,
public health &lt;br/&gt;scholars, and organizational theorists, will conduct an
exploratory study of creating a &lt;br/&gt;multi-agent simulation model for
planning and evaluating disaster response in complex &lt;br/&gt;urban settings.
The research team will use data collected at disaster scenarios and
&lt;br/&gt;exercises to develop small-scale models of the coordination of
multiple agencies and &lt;br/&gt;jurisdictions in the Detroit Metropolitan Area.
These models will provide a proof-of-&lt;br/&gt;concept for an innovative
concept - multi-agent modeling with cultural algorithms - to &lt;br/&gt;be used
in both training and evaluation of coordination of first responders. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Upon successful completion of the feasibility study and funds
permitting, the research team will scale up and &lt;br/&gt;extend these models
to build the MAJOR (Multiple Agency and Jurisdiction Organized
&lt;br/&gt;Response) Disaster Model. This model will be developed in close
cooperation with &lt;br/&gt;municipal police, firefighter, and emergency medical
service personnel. &lt;br/&gt;
