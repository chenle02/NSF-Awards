This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a new
technique for the growth of carbon nitride thin films. The technique is based on
the reaction of high velocity (3 to 8 km/s) carbon/nitrogen atom beams with
surfaces. Carbon nitride is predicted to be a material with tribological and
electronic applications and hence significant effort has been devoted to its
synthesis. These efforts have met with limited success. A recent advance is the
synthesis using a dual atomic beam source of a pure C2N phase having diamond-
like carbon properties. This research will explore single atomic beam synthesis
at energies between 1 and 10 eV. This energy range can lead to higher reactivity
without amorphorization and can be commercially applied. In Phase I, an atomic
beam containing carbon and nitrogen atoms will be generated, characterized and
used to deposit thin films on silicon substrates. The thin films will be
analyzed for composition and bonding. The deposition of films with extended
solid bonding and high nitrogen content will verify the growth technique. The
development of a technique for carbon nitride thin film growth can have
tribological and possibly electronic applications. The developed atom technique
can also be used for the growth of other technologically important nitride
materials.
