9725717 Davis Strain partitioning at convergent margins is a common feature of
orogens, yet the various models put forward to explain and predict strain
partitioning frequently disagree in their predictions. Part of the difficulty
stems from the fact that analog models are mostly well coupled to the base
beneath them, while analytical models frequently assume rheologies and decoupled
behavior not generally found in laboratory analog models. This project will
address this mismatch by attempting to adapt analytical models for testing in an
experimental apparatus and by making laboratory models that have boundary
conditions as close as possible to the simple ones required for analytical tract
ability. By parallel laboratory and theoretical modeling, it is intended to
establish a theoretical understanding of how kinematics, rheology, and plate
geometry affect strain partitioning in laboratory models. Results will be a
logical step towards using models as tools in interpreting geologic, seismic,
and geodetic data that bear upon the physics of strain partitioning at
convergent margins.
