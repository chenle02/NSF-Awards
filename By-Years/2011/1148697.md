The shift to an ever-increasing number of processing cores--within a single
socket in consumer devices and across multiple sockets in servers--has brought
interconnects to the forefront of the challenges facing the computing industry.
While evidence suggests that alternatives to conventional metal interconnects
will be needed to meet future performance demands and power constraints,
research in these areas has been largely limited in scope to specific areas of
the computing stack, and little progress has been made across problem sub-
domains. Thus, there is a dire need for holistic research efforts spanning the
stack from physics to systems, and that produce prototypes and development tools
that are of much greater sophistication than exist today in order to enable
commercial adoption.

The Workshop on Emerging Technologies for Interconnects will bring together key
researchers, industry developers, and program managers in order to define an
agenda for the research and commercial adoption of emerging interconnect
technologies. Presentations and discussions on the "state of the state-of-the-
art" of emerging technologies for interconnects will be followed by break-out
sessions and discussions. These sessions will identify and articulate the key
research challenges, and potentially most promising solutions/directions, and
chart the recommended larger-scale national strategy and research agenda. The
broader impact will be the elimination of the key
