Common wheat, Triticum aestivum, is globally one of the most important crops.
The development of new high-yielding wheat varieties resistant to pests and
diseases and tolerant of environmental stresses is therefore an exceedingly
important objective. The availability of genetic markers for efficient selection
is high on the priority list of most wheat breeders. Examples of genetic markers
include variable (polymorphic) genes or anonymous DNA segments that can be
easily genotyped. The most widespread polymorphisms are substitutions of single-
nucleotides in DNA, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). Numerous high-
throughput strategies for the detection of SNPs in DNA have been developed
making SNPs the markers of choice in many breeding
situations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a project funded by the NSF Plant Genome
Research program, over 7,000 wheat expressed sequence tags (ESTs) have been
developed and mapped. ESTs are partial nucleotide sequences of gene transcripts
(DBI-9975989; PI: Qualset). Although ESTs are a valuable resource for basic
genetic and evolutionary research, their utility for breeding is limited by
laborious and expensive polymorphism detection techniques. In this project, we
will use these ESTs in a systematic search for SNPs in wheat genes. Our target
is to discover 1,800 SNPs and make their location in wheat chromosomes and tools
for their detection available in publicly accessible
databases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Common wheat is an allohexapolyploid species
that originated by interspecific hybridization of three diploid species. We will
employ some of the resources developed in this project for preliminary studies
on the structure of genetic variation in wheat and the extent to which wheat
diploid ancestors contributed to it. We will also examine the influence of
recombination gradients along wheat chromosomes on the distribution of genetic
variation along wheat chromosomes and the effects of recombination on shaping
genetic variation in wheat and other species. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project data
and materials will be made available through the Gramene database
(http://www.gramene.org). &lt;br/&gt;
