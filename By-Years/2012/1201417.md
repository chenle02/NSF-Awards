The PI studies mathematical problems motivated by quantum mechanics and wave
propagation. His central interest is the study of scattering resonances. These
appear in many guises: as poles of Green functions, zeros of zeta functions or
modes of decay and oscillation of waves, and the setting of their study ranges
from geometry and automorphic forms, to microelectromechanical systems in
engineering. The PI searches unifying themes and investigates specific cases.
Special recent focus has been chaotic scattering and the relation between
objects in thermodynamic formalism and the distribution of quantum resonances.

Waves encountered in experimental and theoretical studies have rates of
oscillations and rates of decay. These two properties can be described by a
single complex number with the real part corresponding to the rate of
oscillations, and the imaginary part, to the rate of decay. In turn, these
numbers appear as zeros of natural mathematical objects. In quantum mechanics,
particles are described by wave functions, and waves with decay correspond to
unstable particles. Classical/quantum correspondence suggests some subtle
interplay between "classical" properties of the system and properties of waves.
The PI investigates this in many settings, in particular when chaotic behaviour
is present on the classical level.
