ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: CTS-0209928&lt;br/&gt;Principal
Investigator: Heindel, Theodore&lt;br/&gt;Affiliation: Iowa State
University&lt;br/&gt;Title: GOALI - Gas Holdup in Flocculating
Slurries&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The effect of fiber geometry and mass fraction on
gas holdup in gas-liquid-fiber slurries will be investigated by the PI at Iowa
State University and the PI at Kimberly-Clark Corporation. The most direct
application of the results is to fiber de-inking and fiber bleaching in fiber
floatation columns used in many pulp and paper producing companies. Previous
results from independent investigation of the PIs have shown interesting
behavior when fiber is added to a gas-liquid column. The gas holdup in the
slurry can be significantly different with the presence of fiber. The proposal
study will investigate the various aspects of this problem including the effect
of fiber entanglement on gas holdup.&lt;br/&gt;
