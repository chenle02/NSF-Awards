The principal investigator plans to work on three problems. The first is to find
relationships between the topology of a real algebraic variety and its complex
geometry, more precisely its Kodaira dimension. The ultimate is to prove that a
topologicaly complicated (for intance hyperbolic) threefold can be represented
only by a variety of maximal Kodaira dimension. The second project is to do a
systematic investigation of the connections between hyperbolic differential
equations and real algebraic geometry. Many instances of this have been noted in
the past, but no systematic theory was ever developed. The third project is the
study of arithmetic properties of rationally connected varieties, especially the
existence of rational points and curves over fields which are not algebraically
closed. It is quite likely that geometry governs these questions over local
fields, while the problems over global fields are more arithmetic in nature.

Hyperbolic differential equations describe processes that change with time. For
instance the heating up of a furnace, the flow of water through a turbine and
the spreading of bacteria in a medium can all be described, more or less
accurately, by hyperbolic differential equations. These differential equations
and their solutions are rather complicated, both theoretically and
computationally. It has been noticed that many questions about these
differential equations can be approached through simple algebraic manipulations.
It is the principal investigator's plan to put these diverse observations into a
general conceptual framework. The principal investigator expects that this will
lead to several new applications in the theory of hyperbolic differential
equations. Conversely, relating the abstract algebraic machinery to physical
phenomena in a new way should also provide insights to the behaviour of
algebraic systems.
