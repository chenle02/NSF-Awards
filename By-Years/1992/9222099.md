Steroid and peptide hormones have a major impact on the behavior of mammals.
While it is believed that many of the behavioral effects of hormones result from
their action on the central nervous system, how hormones change brain function
to influence behavior is not well understand. Dr. Albers, who has previously
received support from the National Science Foundation, will continue his work on
steroid-peptide-transmitter interactions, a general problem of substantial
interest in neurobiology. Sophisticated anatomical and biochemical techniques
are used to examine a sexually dimorphic communicative behavior which has proven
to be an excellent model system. Specifically, Dr. Albers will focus on three
different brain sites where it is believed that vasopressin, a neuropeptide,
interacts with the gonadal steroid hormones testosterone and estradiol to
regulate communicative behavior. He will determine whether the gonadal steroids
influence the behavior by changing the amount of vasopressin that can be
released at these brain sites or by changing its sensitivity at a particular
brain site. Moreover, Dr. Albers will explore the interconnections of the three
brain regions implicated in the control of this behavior and thus, provide new
information about their neural circuitry. He will also investigate whether
social factors that influence the expression of this communicative behavior do
so by altering the activity of vasopressin in the brain. Finally, a carefully
designed set of pharmacological studies will be carried out to determine how the
noradrenergic transmitter system is involved in coordinating the expression of
this communicative and other behaviors. The results from these studies will make
an important contribution to our understanding of the basic mechanisms
underlying the relationship between the nervous and endocrine systems in the
regulation of behavior.
