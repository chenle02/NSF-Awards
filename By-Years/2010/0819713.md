Each of us was once a single cell no bigger than the period at the end of this
sentence; it is incredible that we have developed into adults with all the
correct tissues and organs. To understand the development of the germline, an
essential tissue for the continuity of the species, the Bennett laboratory
studies P granules, germline-specific RNA and protein aggregates in the soil
nematode (round worm) Caenorhabditis elegans. The Bennett group discovered GLH
(germline RNA helicase) proteins are P granule components; recently they found
GLH-1 interacts with Dicer (DCR-1) in C. elegans; this interaction was
discovered both by genetics, with mutants missing either protein, and by
biochemistry. Dicer is an enzyme that processes and activates microRNAs, small
RNAs recently shown necessary for normal plant and animal development. This
project consists of three Aims: to determine 1. how GLH-1 and DCR-1 are
interdependent, 2. what RNAs the GLH/DCR complex binds and 3. how GLH-1/4
contribute to the identity of the C. elegans gonad, which can change from a
single to a bifurcated tube when the glh-4 gene is missing, with glh-1 loss by
RNA interference, or with loss of two microRNAs predicted to bind and regulate
glh-1. Therefore, the laboratory will investigate this change in tissue
morphology associated with GLH-1/GLH-4 loss. Success in these Aims may provide a
molecular understanding of how the germline is specified and how tissues take
form. This project will support the education of three MU PhD students; all
three are women. It also funds a collaborative project with Central Michigan
University, a primarily undergraduate institution. Dr. Bennett trains young
scientists in her laboratory and throughout the US, including teaching C.
elegans genetics to high school AP Biology students and organizing two-day Young
Faculty Boot Camps that precede the Society for Developmental Biology national
meetings.
