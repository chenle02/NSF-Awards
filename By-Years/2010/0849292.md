One of the fundamental problems in computer vision is to make a machine
automatically recognize an object in a query image based on previously seen
examples. This problem becomes particularly difficult when the machine is trying
to recognize an object among several with rather similar appearances, and the
object is partially occluded or disguised. This is often the case with human
face recognition. This project aims to explore new mathematical tools from
sparse representation in signal processing, by casting robust face recognition
as a (sparse) error correction problem. Recently, sparse error correction based
on minimizing the 1-norm has seen great success in signal processing. This
project will investigate its potential in image-based object recognition despite
occlusion or corruption, especially for human faces. Preliminary experimental
results have shown good promise of this new approach. In its one-year span, this
project aims to study the special geometric and statistical models and problems
associated with human face recognition and hopes to develop even more robust and
scalable face recognition algorithms. To verify the results, a prototype face
recognition system will be developed, with an emphasis on theoretical and
algorithmic progress. All the results will be available at a public website:
