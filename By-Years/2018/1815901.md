This project will develop new foundations for three fundamental problem areas.
All three problem areas, matching, markets, and matching markets have deep and
rich algorithmic theories. All three have found numerous applications; for
instance, applications of matching markets go all the way from assigning interns
to hospitals, to assigning query keywords to advertisers in the multi-billion
dollar online ads markets of search engine companies. The investigator has made
foundational contributions to all three problem areas in the past, and has
identified several new problems for this project. At the same time the
investigator, who recently moved to the University of California, Irvine, has
the mandate of helping propel its Theory Group to the next level. Towards this
end, he will be recruiting a postdoc and high quality graduate students to
increase the level and quality of research activity and will help revamp
graduate and undergrad theory courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On matching, the
investigator recently solved a thirty-plus-year-old open problem by giving a
fast parallel (NC) algorithm for finding a perfect matching in planar graphs,
and has identified a number of important follow-up problems. Following up on his
work giving complementary pivot equilibrium algorithms for several market
models, he plans to analyze the smoothed complexity of this algorithm. Recent
work of the investigator on the stable matching problem has yielded new
structural results about relationships between the lattices of stable matchings
of two "nearby" instances. This should help in developing efficient algorithms
for finding solutions that are robust to errors introduced in the
input.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
