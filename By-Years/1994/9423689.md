9423689 Zucker Professor Zucker will study locally symmetric spaces via methods
of algebraic geometry. In particular he wants to study the relationship between
various Hodge structures and cohomology of a locally symmetric variety. He will
also study extensions of intersection cohomology to a class of real analytic
varieties with a view to proving a version of the decomposition theorem. This is
research in the field of algebraic geometry. Algebraic geometry is one of the
oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had a revolutionary
flowering in the past quarter- century. In its origin, it treated figures that
could be defined in the plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials.
Nowadays the field makes use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis
and topology, and conversely is finding application in those fields as well as
in physics, theoretical computer science, and robotics. ***
