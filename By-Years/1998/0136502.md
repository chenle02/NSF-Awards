Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Conquest hybrid disk/memory file system takes
a new approach to&lt;br/&gt;filesystem design by storing most information in
RAM, devoting disk&lt;br/&gt;only to large files. Preliminary results have shown
great benefits&lt;br/&gt;from the Conquest approach, despite the fact that the
on-disk portion&lt;br/&gt;of the file system has yet not been optimized. In this
research, we&lt;br/&gt;will investigate the optimal method of storing those
large disk-based&lt;br/&gt;files. After reviewing prior research in disk layout,
we will design&lt;br/&gt;and implement a layout that is optimized for storing
large files in an&lt;br/&gt;environment that is free of metadata and small
files. We will also&lt;br/&gt;develop a "cleaner" that will dynamically adjust
the arrangement of&lt;br/&gt;on-disk data to optimize the performance of disk
access. Finally, we&lt;br/&gt;will take measurements to quantify the
improvements brought by the new&lt;br/&gt;approach.&lt;br/&gt;
