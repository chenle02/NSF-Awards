This project by Anthony Czarnik of Ohio State University is within the Organic
Dynamics Program, and will investigate the rate of organic reactions based on
proximity effects. Model chemical systems will be designed so that reactants and
catalysts will be brought together by stable chemical bonds which may later be
broken through known, reversible chemical reactions. This work will lead to
increased knowledge about the way molecules recognize one another. Work will be
continued on the development of catalytic systems based on reversible covalent
bond formation that will mediate synthetic conversions of alpha,beta-unsaturated
carbonyl compounds. In this context, work will continue on the Diels-Alder
approach to enzyme models and enzyme mimics. Methods to remove the degree of
freedom between ligand and functional groups in cycloadducts will be
investigated using bridged imidazole-anthracenes and tetraazaanthracene adducts,
as well as the adducts with 2,5-bis(TMEDA)furan. The reverse Michael addition
reaction will also be explored as a basis for catalytic cycles operating at much
lower temperatures than the cycloaddition processes. Metal complexes based on
the "proton- sponge" structure (N,N,N'-trimethyl-1,8-diaminonaphthalene) will be
evaluated as Michael donors and as part of activated Michael adducts. An
analysis of the metal-catalyzed retro Michael reaction is also planned.
