In an attempt to relate the properties of atomic nuclei to the underlying
dynamics of the quarks and gluons (quantum chromo-dynamics), the use of
effective field theory is known to be highly useful. Our proposed research
concentrates on the further development of nuclear effective field theory and
its applications. Our study not only deepens the understanding of nuclear-hadron
interactions but also have important ramifications for astrophysics and for the
search for physics beyond the standard model. In particular, our investigations
have strong bearing upon the on-going and future neutrino experiments meant to
reveal the non-standard-physics aspects of the neutrinos
