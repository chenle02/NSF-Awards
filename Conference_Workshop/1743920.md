This National Science Foundation award supports a 5-day CBMS conference on "The
Solution of Problems in Multiply-Connected Domains," at the University of
California Irvine, Irvine, CA, June 18-22, 2018. Broadly, this conference is
based around the use of methods from complex analysis to solve problems that
arise in water waves, fluid flow and nuclear physics. The conference features
the principal speaker, Professor Darren Crowdy of Imperial College London. He is
a leading expert on the applications of complex analysis. Prof. Crowdy will
deliver 10 lectures and produce a monograph to be published in the CBMS series,
providing an important reference for mathematicians and engineers. This award
will sponsor a diverse group of additional speakers and attendees from both
Southern California and the the remainder of the United States. The chosen dates
follow the SIAM meeting on Nonlinear Waves and Coherent Structures which will be
held in nearby Anaheim, CA, June 11-14, 2018. This activity increases the
research activity within Southern California.

Advanced topics in complex analysis are being studied from a computational point
of view with increased depth. Important examples are the numerical computation
of conformal mappings, computing with compact Riemann surfaces using a variety
of methods and the numerical solution of Riemann-Hilbert problems. These topics
are important for a large array of (applied) mathematical areas such as
integrable partial differential equations, random matrix theory, special
functions, etc. These themselves lead to a variety of science and engineering
applications. Very recently, in multi-phase physics the so-called Laplacian
growth problem has been realized to have an underlying integrable structure
linking it to the Toda and Whitham integrable hierarchies. The principal speaker
has been very much a part of these developments in the last 20 years. Prof.
Crowdy has pioneered a new constructive framework for solving problems in
multiply connected planar domains which has led to a panoply of new results in
the applied sciences. One of the most visible examples of Prof. Crowdy's work is
his extension of the famous Schwarz-Christoffel formula from 1860 to multiply
connected domains. The conference website is located at:
