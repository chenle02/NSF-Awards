The emerging field of resource-bounded reasoning is concerned with the
development, composition, and meta-level control of flexible computational
methods that allow small quantities of resources, such as time, memory, or
information, to be traded for gains in the value of computed results. A better
understanding of these techniques is essential for the construction of useful
intelligent systems for automated planning, diagnosis, decision making, and
control. There are two primary components to this research project. One is the
development of resource-bounded techniques for automated information gathering
from a network of heterogeneous, dynamic information sources. The approach
extends the classical theory of information value by formalizing the effect of
such factors as information reliability, retrieval costs, real-time operation,
and uncertainty. A second and closely related activity improves current planning
technology by constructing planning systems that can operate in real-time under
uncertainty and under variable computational constraints.
