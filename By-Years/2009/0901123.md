This proposal supports the research in algebraic geometry of Professor Uli
Walther of Purdue University. The main focus of this proposal is the study of
singularities. To a singularity (defined by the vanishing of a set of
polynomials) one may attach several invariants; these may be of discrete type
(such as the number of branches of a curve meeting in a point) or of continuous
nature (such as the space of all vector fields tangent to the singularity). If
one considers a family of singularities, such invariants behave in interesting
ways: on one side, at special members of the family they "jump" (i.e., get
larger in some sense), while on the other side, near typical members of the
family, they deform according to so-called "hypergeometric" differential
equations. One component of this project investigates, using homological and
combinatorial methods, jumps and solutions of the hypergeometric differential
equations. The other part of the proposal is concerned with the study of
specific invariants of singularities derived through either calculus (the Gauss
--Manin connection and Bernstein--Sato polynomial), counting techniques (the
Igusa zeta function), or deformations (cohomology of the Milnor fiber), and
their interplay.

This research falls into the broad category of algebraic geometry, one of the
most variegated areas of today's mathematics. Fundamentally, algebraic geometry
is the study of geometric objects described by algebraic data through artful
manipulation of the input data using an incredibly wide array of mathematical
tools. Because of its diversity, algebraic geometry permeates such different
branches of science as robotics, cosmology, and computer encryption. The origins
of algebraic geometry can be traced to the works of Euclid and Pythagoras. In
its modern form, the focus of algebraic geometry is on singularities. These
include cusps, foldings, and self-intersections, and are generally comprised of
points that are unusual when compared to their neighbors.
