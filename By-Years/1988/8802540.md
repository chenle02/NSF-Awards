This research has two components. The first one will bring about gravitational
radiation search with resonant bar detector over a bandwidth of many hundreds of
Hertz. The multi-mode detectors are also expected to have better sensitivity or
lesser mechanical quality factor and temperature requirements. Development of
laser instrumentation to sense these detector responses to gravitational
radiation will permit operation at sensitivity levels where the search for
gravitational radiation is expected to contribute significantly to our
understanding of the universe.
