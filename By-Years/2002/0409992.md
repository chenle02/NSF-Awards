This two-year award supports US-European cooperative research activities on
policies for research and innovation involving Susan Cozzens of the Georgia
Institute of Technology and Philippe Laredo of the Ecole Nationale des Ponts et
Chaussees (ENPC) in Paris, France. The PI and US colleagues will participate in
activities of a European Union Network of Excellence, "Science and Technology in
the Knowledge-Based Society," called PRIME. Their participation is expected to
lead to collaborative research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PRIME's research areas
include: changing research regimes in science and technology; the growing
importance of regions and small and medium-sized enterprises; fostering
knowledge circulation; changing public sector research systems; rethinking the
public "engine" to innovation in Europe; and integrating multiple actors in
policy-making. Participation in and collaboration with the European network is
expected to strengthen US science and technology policy research through the
development of new ideas and tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
