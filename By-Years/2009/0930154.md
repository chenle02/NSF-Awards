&lt;br/&gt;Most of our Nation?s systems have as components operating systems
that are replete with vulnerabilities despite the best efforts of the designers
to discover and fix the vulnerabilities. Building on the accomplishments of the
research community, industry is attempting to create new hardware structures
that can help improve security. Particularly noteworthy of these is the Trusted
Platform Module (TPM) chip developed by the Trusted Computing Group (TCG), a
large industry consortium that involves over 100 members. Now, many delivered
processors contain TPM chips, with the goal being to provide a place to store
keys, protect storage, provide code isolation attestation about the code running
on a system ? all functions that can improve security.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the hardware provides extremely useful and
powerful security properties, researchers have been slow at adopting these
techniques towards the design of secure systems. One reason is that users are
not familiar with this new technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To remedy this
situation, the PIs ran a one-week workshop in which the developers of the TPM
technology and users who have made effective use of it provided tutorial
material and hands-on experiences for the workshop?s participants which included
students, faculty, and potential industry users.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
ultimate goal of the workshop was to define a research program for the next
decade focused around hardware support for security. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The
funds requested would be used to reimburse the expenses of graduate and
undergraduate students participating in the workshop, which took place June
8-12, 2009 in Pittsburgh. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
