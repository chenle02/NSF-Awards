A new plasma activated sintering (PAS) process for consolidation of a variety
of ceramic, intermetallic, and electronic materials will be investigated with a
focus on the potential for developing a PAS manufacturing technology
encompassing materials processing issues, system control, process automation,
and technology transfer to US industry. The research is an interdisciplinary
effort involving materials processing, manufacturing and automation. Specific
research on PAS processing of Nb-Al and NiAl intermetallics and AIN rapid
consolidation will be performed to create the scientific and engineering
foundation of this new and powerful processing method and to develop optimal
process control parameters. Based on the fundamental understanding of the
mechanism of PAS consolidation, a process model will be developed. The
evaluation of process parameters will be performed using modern microstructural
analysis techniques (to determine phase formation, grain size, and grain
boundary structure) in conjunction with density and mechanical properties
measurements. Architectures and functions relevant to an advanced PAS technology
for the future will also be designed as part of the research in anticipation of
the potential for intelligent manufacturing by the PAS process and eventual
transfer of this promising technology to US industry.
