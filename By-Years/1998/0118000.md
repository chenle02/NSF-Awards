This exploratory research focuses on time sensitive data and field research
related to the Gujarat, India Earthquake of 26 January 2001. The severity of
this earthquake and the magnitude of the losses in lives and property render it
an important case study in seismic risk mitigation. The research will focus on
how different types of information technology are used in mobilizing disater
response and the extent to which each increases or decreases the efficiency in
inter-organizational response to disaster. The broader implications of this
research are the foundations it lays for developing and practically implementing
sound models of mitigation and inter-organizational learning to contain the cost
of natural disasters in both lives and property. The results of this research
will be used to develop a preliminary decision support model, which links
knowledge to action at the first line of response - the community. The proposed
field research will be carried out within an interdisciplinary, international
reconnaissance team, organized by the Western Seismic Safety Institute and the
Earthquakes in Megacities Initiative involving researchers from different
disciplines and nations. Thus another outcome of the research will be an
expanded global network of hazards researchers. Three different types of data
will be collected: 1) interviews with public, private, and nonprofit
organizations will yield information on the types of information technologies
use during the hazard response; how well those technologies met their needs; and
areas of improvement will be identified; 2) Global Positioning Systems (GPS)
data will be collected to locate major disaster sites to identify primary
locations and types of information infrastructures that were used to mobilize
the response; and 3) documentary data will be collected regarding the disaster
operations process. Based on these data, a map of information flows between the
organizations will be generated. The GPS data will be used to develop a GIS map.
A final report will be generated and submitted to the NSF.
