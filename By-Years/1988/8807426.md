This research project is aimed at developing and analyzing algorithms for
supporting high-level parallel programming models. Graph embeddings have been
successfully employed to compare different parallel architectures and to map
parallel computations into parallel networks. One component of the project is
directed towards developing new techniques for graph embeddings. A second
component aims to develop and analyze efficient load-balancing algorithms for
supporting control-level parallelism at run time. A third component is directed
toward evaluating the expressive power of different programming models. The
final component is the design of the Fluent machine, a massively parallel system
which supports a very high-level instruction set efficiently. The research
emphasizes algorithms and embedding techniques that can be rigorously proved
efficient.
