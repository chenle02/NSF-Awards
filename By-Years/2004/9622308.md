9622308 Tommelein The main objective of this research is to develop a
methodology and computer tools for field engineers to manage the flow of
materials and equipment on site, in order to raise the overall productivity of
the construction process. Planning the temporary storage layout and handling of
materials greatly affects a project's overall productivity. It therefore
critically determines the contractor's profitability and thus his
competitiveness in the global market place. The advent of new technologies
(including wireless electronic data exchange, laser-based spatial positioning
systems, and palmtop computers aka). Personal Digital Assistants or PDAs
combined with new management philosophies (including just-in-time vs. just-in-
case and lean production) open up a wide range of possibilities to improve the
construction materials management process. Accordingly, this research plans to
investigate their applicability and test how they can be used to achieve the
greatest improvements.
