9360985 Weiland The increasing complexity of flexible manufacturing systems
(FMSs) are pushing the human operator to his limits, especially in cognitive
related tasks. It is therefore of particular importance to develop techniques
that allow the computer to help the human to extend these limits. An important
class of such enabling technologies is an interactive man machine interface
(IMMI), which intelligently supports the human to find, process, and act on the
rich information avaioable. This research will focus on an innovative approach
to building an IMMI for advanced manufacturing systems, based on an innovative
cognitive modeling methodology called COGNET (COGnition as a NEtwork for Tasks)
and a corresponding software implementation technique call BATON (Blackboard
Architecture for Task Oriented Networks). Together, COGNET and BATON allow us to
build a powerful computational model of the operator and embed this model in the
MMI software, thereby providing an essential ingredient in an IMMI for future
FMSs. During the Phase I effort, the researchers will evaluate the applicability
of the COGNET/BATON methodlogy to advanced manufacturing systems,
identifycandidate functions and development platforms for the IMMI, produce a
Phase II development plan, and build a rapid interface prototype of the IMMI
concept.
