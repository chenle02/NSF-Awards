The objective of this proposal is to formulate a two dimensional stochastic
estuarine hydrodynamic model, incorporating probabilistic factors that describe
the estuarine system's boundary and initial conditions, parameter fields and
forcing functions. The research will involve analysis of parameter and
uncertainty on the solution of the hydrodynamic equations, use of several
solution algorithms for the stochastic prediction problem, Monte Carlo method
quasilinearization allied with perturbation and operator analysis and the direct
solution of the stochastic differential equations that characterize behavior of
the estuarine system. The solution algorithms will be used to generate the
probability density functions and/or moments describing water elevations and
flow rates in the estuarine system. During the final phase of the project,
solution algorithms will be used for the stochastic prediction of water levels
in the Redwood Creek estuary in northern California. The results of the
investigation are expected to provide baseline information regarding how
parameter and forcing function uncertainty affects the output variances of water
elevations, and solution algorithms for predicting variations in estuarine water
quality that is affected by pollutants from industrial, municipal and
agricultural sources.
