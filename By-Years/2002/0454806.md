In this award, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Prof. Alec M. Wodtke of the University of California - Santa
Barbara and his post-doctoral and graduate research students will investigate
electron ejection from metal surfaces when they are bombarded with vibrationally
excited molecules. The goal of these experiments is to develop a better
understanding of the ways in which molecules and surfaces interact. The work may
help scientists to develop better models for heterogeneous catalysis - an
industrially and economically important process. Besides the broader scientific
impacts of the proposed studies, the young scientists working on this project
will gain expertise in a number of sophisticated scientific techniques,
including laser spectroscopy, ultrahigh vacuum and molecular beam methods.
