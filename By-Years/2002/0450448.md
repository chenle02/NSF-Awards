This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop
a plate washer capable of washing very high-density plates, such as 1536 well
plates, for ELISA and high-throughput screening assays. Currently, there are
automated plate washers for 96 and 384 well plates, but there are none available
for plates with ultra-high density. This is because currently available washer
technology, employing a nozzle system, cannot be made reliable enough to allow
dispense and aspirate nozzles to properly reach within each of the many, very
small wells, and because the thin nozzles needed can get easily clogged using
many standard buffers. In contrast, the proposed system uses a steady stream or
sheet of solution, making the system less likely to clog.

The commercial application of this project will be to allow use of high-
throughput screening assays by industrial and academic researchers involved in
genomics and drug discovery research. The proposed technology will enable
additional use of fluorescent chemical compounds, that typically require a wash
step to remove interfering substances, for screening.
