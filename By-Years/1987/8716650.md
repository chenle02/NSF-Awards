This is a proposal to further explore, building on preliminary encouraging
results, the possibilities of using preconditioned HPLC (high-performance liquid
chromatography) columns for protein separations. The column will be
preconditioned by saturating it with specific proteins which are bound
irreversibly to the packaging material. The bound protein is actually a new
coating material, which can exhibit separation properties different from those
of commercial coatings. It is expected that the results of the present
investigation will perfect the techniques of protein separation and will lead to
a major advance in this important biochemically related area.
