The problem of improving school students' mathematical understanding is too
complex to approach from any one research perspective. Learning, teaching, and
curriculum influence each other in significant ways. The proposed project will
extend a current research effort in order to investigate the development of
students' algebraic reasoning in grades 5 through 7 as they are taught for three
years from a curriculum infused with instruction emphasizing quantitative
reasoning. The project's first year will be devoted to assessing 5th-grade
students' concepts of quantity and quantitative operations, developing cognitive
objectives of instruction and materials to support experimental instruction
aimed at achieving those objectives, developing evaluation instruments and
aligning them with experimental instruction, and instructing classroom teachers
on the objectives of teaching for quantitative reasoning. The subsequential
three years will focus on effects of instruction on student' quantitative and
algebraic reasoning and effects of teachers' participation on their knowledge of
mathematical content and pedagogy. Experimental instruction will incorporate
advanced software and materials developed for research on teaching and learning
quantitative reasoning by use of multiple, linked representational systems. The
proposed study should have a significant impact on research on mathematics
learning, research on mathematics teaching, and research on curriculum
development.
