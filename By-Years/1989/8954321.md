A Short Course on Dinosaurs is being offered at the 1989 Annual Meeting of the
Geological Society of America. Fifteen experts on various aspects of the Age of
Dinosaurs are presenting a cohesive summary of new research in the evolution,
origin, phylogeny, adaptations, environments, and extinctions of dinosaurs and
some of the plants and animals with which they lived. The Short Course is
designed for non-specialists in dinosaurs to provide broad coverage and
attention to new ideas and findings. Special emphasis is being given to how to
set up and teach a course on dinosaurs to undergraduate students. Courses on
dinosaurs have already proven to be great motivating tools that stimulate
students to learn more about earth and life sciences. Dinosaurs can also be used
as a vehicle to communicate ideas on subjects as diverse as molecular biology
and geophysics. Short Course notes prepared from the lectures are being
distributed at cost. NSF is funding the travel costs for the speakers with the
balance of the costs covered by sponsoring societies.
