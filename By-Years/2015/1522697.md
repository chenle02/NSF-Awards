Large-scale eigenvalue computation is a long-standing problem in computational
mathematics and computational science and engineering. It is frequently
encountered as a critical kernel in simulations and data analysis. Significant
progress has been made both in general-purpose eigensolvers and also in
specialized eigensolvers that exploit underlying particular mathematical
properties and data structure. However, new needs and challenges continue to
emerge from science and engineering applications. This project involves the
development of advanced mathematical analysis and robust, efficient algorithms
for two emerging classes of eigenvalue problems: sparse plus low rank linear
eigenvalue problems and eigenvalue problems with eigenvalue nonlinearity. In
addition, this project has broader impacts in training graduate students in
interdisciplinary research. While much of the work involves significant
technical expertise, other areas can be successfully understood and tackled by
advanced undergraduates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The computational stability,
efficiency and reliability of the new solvers for the two classes of eigenvalue
problems will be greatly enhanced by skillful exploitation of underlying
mathematical properties and matrix structure. In particular, for the eigenvalue
problems with eigenvalue nonlinearity, new solver will combine rational
approximations of nonlinearity for high accuracy, trimmed linearizations for low
dimensionality, and compact representations of the projection subspace bases for
memory-saving and communication efficiency. The outcomes of this project will be
the publication of new theory and algorithms and open-source software.
