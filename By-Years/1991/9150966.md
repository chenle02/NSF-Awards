Davison College is purchasing a 300 MHz Fourier transform nuclear magnetic
resonance (FT-NMR) spectrometer. Students are using the instrument in
introductory organic chemistry to identify unknown compounds. Advanced students
build upon their NMR background from organic chemistry to explore theoretical
relationships, acquire and interpret the NMR spectra of more
