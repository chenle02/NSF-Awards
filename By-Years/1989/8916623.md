This award supports cooperative research in biophysics to be conducted by David
Jameson of the University of Hawaii and Juan Brunet of the Catholic University
of Valparaiso, Chile. This work will continue research in fluorescent
spectroscopic studies of the hemeprotein, horseradish peroxidase. It will
elucidate the dynamics of the protein matrix near the heme binding site,
particularly relaxation processes. An effort will be made to show the functional
significance of protein molecular motions to enzyme catalysis and the energetics
of ligand binding. Peroxidases catalyze the oxidation of various organic and
inorganic compounds and are thus an attractive model for protein dynamic
studies. This work continues a successful and productive collaboration between
Dr. Jameson who is expert in fluorescence spectroscopy, instrumentation and
theory of fluorescence and Dr. Brunet, a well-trained physical chemist who has
funding for a new fluorometer, partly as a result of the collaboration. This and
the training that graduate students are receiving in Chile illustrate the
advantages of the Science in Developing Countries program.
