RNA polymerase goes through three phases -- initiation, elongation, and
termination -- as it performs a round of promoter-specified transcription. The
ability of the enzyme to undergo the initiation-elongation transition, called
promoter escape, is an important factor in determining the efficiency of
initiation. During this transition, RNA polymerase forms highly stressed and
short-lived intermediates called initial transcribing complexes that may or may
not surmount the conformational changes that accompany the promoter escape
transition. The inability to negotiate this transition results in the synthesis
of abortive RNA and reduces the synthesis of full-length transcripts. The
efficiency of escape at E. coli promoters is governed by sequence signals
embedded in the promoter -- the consensus promoter elements entice the binding
of RNA polymerase to form catalytically active complexes, while the initial
transcribed sequence (ITS) modulates the promoter escape process of the bound
enzyme. This research aims to elucidate the mechanism(s) by which the initial
transcribed sequence affects promoter escape, by investigating the escape
properties of a wide variety of mutant ITS promoters through quantitative in
vitro transcription reactions, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and
footprinting analysis, using wild type and mutant RNA polymerases with important
accessory factors. Intellectually, the merit of this project will lead to a
thorough biochemical characterization of the initial transcribing complexes and
shed light on the mechanistic steps involved in promoter escape. This activity
will reap a broad impact in the training of undergraduate students, especially
women, preparing them for research participation in a scientific career.
