This award supports a novel experiment designed to measure the absolute mass
scale of the electron neutrino. Though the existence of neutrino mass is now
firmly established experimentally, the mass scale itself remains unknown. The
new technique supported by this award relies on the detection and measurement of
coherent radiation created from the cyclotron motion of electrons in strong
magnetic fields. Since the frequency of the emitted cyclotron radiation depends
inversely on the particle's Lorentz boost, detection and measurement of the
coherent radiation is tantamount to measuring the kinetic energy of the
electron. One immediate application of this new technique is in the measurement
of the endpoint spectrum from tritium beta decay, which is directly sensitive to
the absolute mass scale of neutrinos.

Broader Impact: Knowledge of neutrino masses has a broad impact to the
scientific community, particularly in the fields of nuclear and particle
physics, as well as cosmology. The broad appeal and novelty of this technique
are expected to engage undergraduate students. The technique explored in this
proposal also has potential applications in national security, specifically, in
monitoring for nuclear non-proliferation.
