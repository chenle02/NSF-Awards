The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) project is to improve electronics cooling systems. Data and
telecommunications centers consume 200 TWhr/yr of energy and produce about 30
million tons of carbon dioxide, with nearly half of these numbers attributable
to cooling. The electronics cooling market exceeds $10 billion/year with an 8%
compound annual growth rate. The technologies developed here will significantly
reduce those numbers, with significant environmental and financial impact, with
improved hardware and software. This will benefit many sectors including next-
generation 5G-wireless communications, high-performance computing, the Internet
of Things, cryptocurrency, and national security. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop two complementary technologies for
efficient thermal management of electronics. It will add compliancy to the
structurally-rigid vapor chambers used for cooling, e.g., multicore processors
where vapor chambers thermally couple a single heat sink to the different
processor cores. This project will develop a mass production process of
compliant vapor chambers accommodating novel forms of capillary wicks integrated
with compliant diaphragms. Secondly, the project will develop a heat sink
optimization platform for electronics hardware, coupling hardware-in-the-loop
(HIL) with a multi-variable optimization (MVO) algorithm. Consequently, it will
be the first system to measure the flow field as the heat sinks are reconfigured
in real-time during the HIL-informed optimization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
