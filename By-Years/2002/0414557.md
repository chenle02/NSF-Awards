A new interface to traditional monographs, introducing structure,
summaries,&lt;br/&gt;and personalized indexes, is being built. This enables
students to search&lt;br/&gt;and use digital libraries more effectively. The
interface should be useful&lt;br/&gt;in the context of the Million Book Project
which will provide one million&lt;br/&gt;out of copyright books in digital form,
the equivalent of a major research&lt;br/&gt;library. Key ingredients in this
interface are selection of relevant&lt;br/&gt;phrases, automatic summarization,
and the ability to search and summarize&lt;br/&gt;in the context of a particular
information need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The impact of this work includes access
to the enormous contents of our&lt;br/&gt;older libraries, improving our ability
to use monographic material in&lt;br/&gt;online teaching, and greater
understanding of how students learn by&lt;br/&gt;reading. In addition, we will
employ the technology for teaching in our&lt;br/&gt;university, helping educate
our students in communication and library&lt;br/&gt;studies.&lt;br/&gt;
