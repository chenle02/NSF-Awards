Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) carries genetic information and is one of the
essential components of life. Recently, DNA has been explored as engineering
tools to construct complex nanostructures. It is now possible to create highly
ordered, programmable DNA structures from designs created on a computer, which
may not be manufactured otherwise. However, the mechanical properties of self-
assembled DNA structures are largely unknown and they are different from those
of individual DNA molecules. This award supports fundamental research to
elucidate the mechanics of DNA nanostructures. A better understanding of the
nanomechanics will lay a strong foundation to design structurally robust
materials or dynamic DNA devices which may be used in a wide range of
engineering applications. This research combines two distinct areas in mechanics
of materials and structural DNA nanotechnology. This interdisciplinary program
will help broaden participation of underrepresented groups in research and
advance the public understanding of programmable biomolecular materials.

DNA origami is a powerful approach of designing and constructing programmable
structures of complex geometry with nanometer-scale precision. However, our
ability to understand and predict their mechanical properties is lacking, which
is one of the major limitations that prevent widespread applications of
synthetic DNA-based assembly as engineering tools. The research team will
perform experiments to characterize elastic, bending, and torsional rigidity of
various DNA origami structures. The focus will be to elucidate the structure-
mechanical property relationship. A physics-based model will be developed to
describe the mechanisms and the sources of structural flexibility and rigidity.
Ultimately, this research will establish general principles to understand and
predict the mechanical properties of DNA nanostructures.
