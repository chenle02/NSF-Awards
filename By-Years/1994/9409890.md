9409890 Han The objective of this program is to develop an improved data
interpretation algorithm for the synthetic aperture imaging technique. A
composite scheme for retrieving the host medium property is integrated into the
coherent focusing algorithm for buried object imaging. The final goal is to
establish a general yet reliable microwave imaging system that can be used for
inspecting targets embedded in stratified random media. Applications to ground-
penetrating operations and nondestructive evaluation of civil engineering
structures are addressed. Under this system, data carrying information on the
property of the host medium and that of embedded targets will be acquired
concurrently but processed separately. A two-stage date processing scheme is
designed to achieve this purpose. First, the distinction between the spatial
spectra of signals produced by localized targets and that by stratified
structures will be used as the mechanism for isolating the signal from the host
medium. Then, the extracted information on the host material will be used in the
imaging algorithm to provide the correct phase compensation for signals from the
targets. The following studies are included: (i) surface echo isolation, (ii)
subsurface profile inversion, (iii) model application to signal and noise
prediction, (iv) development of imaging algorithm, (v) construction of target
detection scheme, and (vi) experiments. ***
