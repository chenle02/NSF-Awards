Intense X-ray sources have been used in geophysical research pods to determine
strata formation density, lithology, and porosity. The scattering of v-rays from
137 Cs or 60 Co sources with decay activities of up to several Ci have been used
extensively in borehole logging. A non-radioactive photon source is highly
desirable since it reduces the radiological handling risk and the risk of down
hole loss. North Star Research has conceived a novel compact electrostatic
accelerator that is capable of approaching 1 MV/cm in high voltage generator
diameter thereby reducing the size and mass of the system inserted into the well
site. Preliminary experiments have demonstrated the utility of this electron
accelerator in larger sizes. This 'Nested High Voltage Generator' will be useful
for both low energy (<300 e V) v,v elemental composition and high energy (300
keV - 1MeV) v-ray Compton scattering measurements of density. The nested high
voltage generator approach is generates a continuous X-ray stream which
simplifies detector calibration when compared to pulsed accelerators. This
source will facilitate higher resolution measurements of the strata structure.
