This research will establish the long-term trends, variations, and extremes of
regional climate by examining variations in annual growth rings of old-aged
trees in Mongolia and China dating back to 800 A.D. Mongolia and the surrounding
region are the center of the Asian High, the most extreme atmospheric pressure
center of the Northern Hemisphere and a strong influence on winter atmospheric
circulation. The goal of the research is to understand climate trends that
impact global weather patterns. The effects of changing climate may be severe on
Mongolia and changes in the Asian High can have effects far beyond the immediate
region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tree-ring samples, obtained nondestructively,
will be used to develop calendar-dated, annual to millennial-length records of
climate variations. Long records are essential because recorded information
(approximately 50 years) does not reveal the full range of variability and
trends in climate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sampling sites are high in mountains or
at the edge of dry grasslands where the trees are stressed by climate. Such
tree-rings record the effects of warm and cold years in the mountains and wet
and dry years near the grasslands. The resulting records will yield valuable
information about temperature trends, severe winters, droughts, floods, and
other climatic variations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is conducted in
cooperation with Mongolian Universities, institutions, and government agencies.
A Tree-Ring Laboratory has been organized at the National University and
seminars and workshops are planned to teach and train students and scientists
for cooperative and independent research.&lt;br/&gt;
