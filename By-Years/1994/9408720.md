Partial funding are provided for acquisition of an Ion Beam Analytical Facility.
This unique facility will be sited at Case Western Reserve University and will
be part of the Ohio MatNet consortium of universities. Work stations connected
to the facility over Internet will be located at Bowling Green State University,
the University of Cincinnati, and Ohio State University. The instrument will
initially service about twenty faculty at the four universities. Ultimately, it
will provide a user-oriented facility for materials researchers at the 14 Ohio
universities, at the two Federal laboratories in Ohio (NASA Lewis Research
Center and Wright Patterson Air Force Base), and to industrial researchers.
Access will initially be focussed on, but not restricted to, users in Ohio. The
Facility also is anticipated to serve as a major resource for materials research
throughout the Midwest region. The instrument will be primarily used for
Rutherford Backscattering Spectroscopy, Nuclear Reaction Analysis, and Particle-
Induced X-ray Emission Spectroscopy; channeling, elastic recoil detection, and
resonance scattering analysis, will also be available. Applications include a
variety of thin film analyses and quantitative analysis of hydrogen and other
light elements, and analysis of low levels of metallic impurities in metals,
semiconductors, and device structures.
