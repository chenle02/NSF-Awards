This NSF Scalable Parallelism in the Extreme (SPX) workshop provides an
opportunity for SPX principal investigators as well as other researchers in the
areas of parallel and distributed computing to discuss the latest advances,
demonstrate technical accomplishments, and inform NSF of important and
groundbreaking future research directions in these areas. The technical program,
while taking stock of recent results, will include breakout sessions to discuss
research directions that address critical concerns in the design and
implementation of extremely scalable parallel and distributed systems. The
broader impacts include broadening participants' perspectives and providing a
venue to form new collaborations. Furthermore, a post-workshop report describing
the most important and promising research directions will be made available to
the broader research community, to inspire research in those
directions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
