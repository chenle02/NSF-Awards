Jon A. Wellner will carry out research on empirical processes, bootstrap methods
in statistics, semiparametric models, and inverse problems and nonstandard
asymptotics. The research will involve limit theory for infinite - dimensional M
- estimates and related bootstrap methods, preservation theorems for uniform
Donsker classes of functions, uniform in $~P~$ bootstrap limit theorems,
estimation of monotone and convex functions, convergence of iterative convex
minorant algorithms, and the behavior of global functionals in models with
interval censoring. Applications include bivariate models with covariates,
regression models under interval censoring, and studies of nonparametric maximum
likelihood estimators. Jon A. Wellner will carry out research in statistics. The
research will involve large sample limit theory for new estimators in problems
with large (infinite - dimensional) parameter spaces.
