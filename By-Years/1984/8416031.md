Work is undertaken which will relate the mechanical properties, thermal
conductivities, and gas permeability of ultradrawn thermoplastics to the
deformation processes which occur in their production. The purpose is to prepare
polymer fibers and sheets with strengths much higher than presently available.
The properties will be evaluated after deformation from uniaxial and planer
extensional flows. Processing variables will include the deformation ratio,
rate, and draw temperature. Tests will be conducted on semicrystalline
thermoplastics in the polyolefin, polyester, polyether, and nylon families. The
research plan involves three stages: preparation of a premorphology for
deformation, the crystalline state deformation processes, and characterization
of the initial and drawn morphologies.
