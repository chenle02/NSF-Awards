0405779 Pitman The project will continue an ongoing study of deep connections
between the theory of combinatorial structures on a large finite set, such as
trees, forests, mappings, and partitions, and the theory of Brownian motion and
related processes such as Brownian excursion, Brownian bridge, and processes
with independent increments. Specific topics to be studied include regenerative
composition structures, processes of fragmentation and coagulation, tree-valued
stochastic processes, asymptotics of uniform random spanning trees, and the
distribution of homogeneous functionals of Brownian motion. Results of the
project are expected to include new models for random partitions and partition-
valued processes, particularly processes of fragmentation and coagulation, which
may be of value in the numerous fields where such processes have been applied
before, including physics, astronomy, genetics, and ecology.
