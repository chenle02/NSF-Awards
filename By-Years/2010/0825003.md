This effort will support approximately 50 women from US institutions to attend
a research summit with 50 international participants to be held in 2009 in
Europe. The objective of the summit is to develop new methods to enable
meaningful and sustained research exchanges among American and international
female engineering faculty, graduate students, and post doctoral fellows and to
identify common issues faced by females pursuing careers in engineering that
could benefit from a global strategy. The summit is designed to bring experts
together to discuss recent research findings in the three thematic areas of
energy systems, micro/nanotechnology and simulation based engineering. The
meeting will expose participants to best practices in engaging in international
research collaborations and will foster the initiation of research
collaborations and the building of sustained relationships among the female
participants. A summit application survey and an interview protocol will be used
to better understand what is needed for female engineers to engage in
international research collaborations..

This effort will explore a number of factors that may limit the advancement of
female engineers engaged in research. It will provide a clear, visible pathway
for females to pursue international collaborations and identify methods of
securing funding for international collaborations from federal agencies,
international sources. It will also generate a database of female faculty who
are interested in conducting international research and identify common issues
faced by females pursuing careers in engineering such as, inclusiveness in
research endeavors, female?]friendly environments, family leave policies,
?gdual-career couple?h issues.
