9522726 Lee An integrated analytical and experimental study is planned to
examine a new nondestructive testing capability for carbon fiber cement
composites (CFCC) based on recent experimental observations that electrical
responses such as the electrical emission or the change in the bulk electrical
resistivity can be related to the flaw generation and growth in some materials.
Carbon micro-fibers are added to concrete to increase the bulk conductivity of
the concrete by forming an intricate network of fibers as an electrical "tag" as
well as to improve the structural performance. The primary objective of the
proposed study s two-fold: (1) to better understand and explain the fundamental
mechanisms associated with the electrical fracto-emission and bulk resistivity
change in CFCC, and (2) to establish and validate the experimental data and
underlying theoretical basis for the nondestructive testing capability which
needs to be responsive to the unique structural characteristics of CFCC.
