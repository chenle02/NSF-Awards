This first-year Presidential Young Investigator Award will support Dr.
Aloimonos' work in active vision and navigational reasoning. His principle goal
is to build robotic systems with robust, real-time visual capabilities for
accomplishing specific navigational tasks such as moving object detection by a
moving observer, object tracking, and obstacle avoidance. Dr. Aloimonos also
intends to continue his research in robust scene analysis, visual learning,
parallel computation, path planning, and other related topics.
