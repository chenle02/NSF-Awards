Housing is a scarce and valued resource particularly in the urban
agglomerations of less developed countries. This study will examine access to
housing and the quality of neighborhoods in which people live in a large Chinese
city, Tianjin. Chinese cities have developed over the last forty years within a
state socialist framework where an egalitarian ideology was promoted, and
organized systems of housing and service allocation were based on public rather
than private investments. The central research questions guiding this study is
what inequalities in housing and urban infrastructure survive in such a system,
and what are the factors associated with more favorable outcomes, that is better
housing and better neighborhoods. This study will provide important insights
into the bases of inequality characteristic of a state socialist economic
system. It also provides a crucial baseline for future studies on the impact on
the transition to a market economy which is beginning in China.
