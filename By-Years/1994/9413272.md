9413272 Vahdani The Guam earthquake of August 1993, Richter magnitude 8.1,
caused soil liquefaction and lateral spreading near the shorelines of the
island, about 40 miles north of the epicenter. Liquefaction and lateral
spreading occurred in several areas, including filled areas in downtown Agena
and the Apra Harbor, where the port facilities for commercial containers and the
U.S. Naval Station are located. The objective of this program is to collect
settlement and lateral movement data in all areas that experienced significant
soil liquefaction. This appears to be the first time that soil liquefaction and
lateral spreading have been observed at sites underlain by coral sand.
Liquefaction-related data at these sites is especially relevant to seismic
hazard studies at other sites underlain by coral sand. ***
