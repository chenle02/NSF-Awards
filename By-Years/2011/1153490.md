This scholarship project from Oregon State University is recruiting 16
academically talented and financially needy students into Water Resource Science
and Engineering. Recruitment efforts focus on underrepresented minorities and
first-generation college attendees and therefore diversify the STEM workforce
educated in water resources. The program is to transition students into graduate
degree programs and ultimately into the STEM workforce. The funding is being
used to enhance the experience of students and ensure their success. The program
provides mentoring (peer and professional), cohort building and annual retreats
to the students. Partnership with potential employers facilitates graduate
placement in the workforce.
