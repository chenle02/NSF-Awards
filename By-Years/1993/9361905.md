9361905 Leung This research will develop the architecture for an interoperable
recursive database server (IRDS). The server will communicate with clients based
on DAL, an industrial standard on data access language supporting heterogeneous
database environments. Recursive views defined with powerful logic rules are
supported. Queries on recursive views will be automatically translated into
equivalent database operations on the base relations. The translation is based
on pre-complied information obtained from the analysis of the structure of the
recursion during view definition. A toolkit and a prototype will be developed as
a feasibility study. There are not many databases in existence today which
contain the type of features described in this proposal. Therefore such features
will embelish the performance of database systems.
