Innovation: Curious - (C)enter for (U)ndergraduate Education and (R)esearch:
(I)ntegration Thr(OU)gh Performance and Vi(S) ualization This CISE Educational
Innovation award supports the integration of research into the undergraduate
curriculum through the themes of performance evaluation and measurement and
visualization by developing software, assignments and instructional support.
Some undergraduate students will assist with development of the project and all
students will benefit from the integration of both established and cutting-edge
research into a traditional curriculum. Over a three year period,
undergraduates, graduate students and faculty from the Department of Computer
Science will develop these materials primarily in the summers and integrate them
into the courses during the academic year. In the second year, faculty and
undergraduates from Western Carolina University, Appalachian State University,
University of North Carolina Ashville, North Carolina Central University and
East Carolina University will join in the development of materials and the
integration of materials into courses at their institutions. All materials are
being made available on the World Wide Web.
