Subglass relaxation processes, resulting from molecular motions in otherwise
glassy solids, occur commonly in amorphous polymers and in the amorphous
fraction of semicrystalline ones. They have been presumed to be due to localized
conformational motions decoupled from the longer range segmental motions
associated with the glass transition. In appropriate circumstances, both
reorientation of flexible side groups and local conformational mobility in the
main chain have been proposed as mechanisms. However there is little direct
evidence that these notions are correct. The present research will take
advantage of dielectric relaxation data recently collected on systems
deliberately chosen to be good model systems for side group relaxation and of
recent progress made in the atomistic simulation of the packing and properties
of bulk amorphous systems in developing a detailed molecular model for subglass
relaxation due to flexible side group motion. Motions of pendant ester groups
will be modelled in a bulk multi-chain environment. Similar modelling will be
carried out for a relaxation of the local main chain type, the gamma relaxation
in polyethylene. Previously suggested local motions will be modelled in an
atomistic bulk environment and other localized motions will be sought as well.
In other research, advantage will be taken of the ability to make dielectric
measurements over a broader frequency or time range to experimentally
investigate the shapes of a number of types of relaxation processes and to
assess the ability of various phenomenological equations to represent the
shapes. Since an important part of the research involves numerically intensive
computing, efforts will also be made in the area of improved simulation
techniques.
