In this award the principal investigator will study a new class of inverse
problems called inverse nodal problems. The motivation for this study is the
question concerning how much one can say about a vibrating membrane if one knows
the nodal lines. The nodal lines are the curves along which the eigenfunctions
of the membrane vanish. In one dimension the nodal lines are points (nodes).
Nodes are of interest in engineering applications because they represent the
optimal locations for the support of a mast or placement of a bearing on a
shaft, while nodal lines enter into the analysis of flaws in holographic plates.
What can you say about a vibrating string if you know the nodes or a vibrating
membrane if you know the nodal lines? Nodal lines are the fixed curves or points
on the standing waves generated during the vibration. This is an example of an
inverse problem: one attempts to determine an object or process from the data it
produces. Such inverse problems have important engineering applications and the
principal investigator will employ analytical and numerical methods to study the
discontinuous problems and the uniqueness of the density.
