&lt;br/&gt;Geoscience Education Research to Enhance Effective Professional
Development for In-Service Teachers: New Research Opportunities in the San Diego
Region&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due to increased demand for Geosciences in schools,
there is a surge in the demand for geoscience professional development workshops
for both pre- service and in-service teachers. One of the largest professional
development programs in California is run by the K-12 Alliance, a multi-agency
collaborative organization. The PI and his research group are participating as
content facilitators and researchers in this program and are assessing portions
of the project including immediate impacts on classroom practice. This project
supports students who will perform some of these assessment activities to
conduct research on the impact and effectiveness of a new field-based, inquiry-
driven unit on sedimentary rocks, depositional environments and change through
time using a well exposed sequence of Eocene through Pleistocene rocks at Torrey
Pines State Park. All participants undergo pre- and post-test summative
evaluation, and selected participants will be interviewed before and after the
field experience, and tracked to measure the impact of the field exercise on
classroom practice over the coming school year. &lt;br/&gt;
