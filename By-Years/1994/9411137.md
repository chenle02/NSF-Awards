The larvae of tent caterpillars display a diversity of lifestyles, ranging from
solitary individuals to simple aggregations to highly integrated societies.
There are six Malacosoma species in North American as well as five European
species. Social complexity in this group is defined in terms of interaction and
communication between group members, and is thought to be correlated with
patterns of host plant utilization and foraging. The diversity of social forms
in this genus provides a model system for the elucidation of ecological
correlates to the evolution of sociality, as well as of the ways in which
sociality may influence host plant use. Phylogenetic relationships among species
of the social tent caterpillar genus Malacosoma (Lepidoptera: Lasiocampidae)
will be assessed through application of cladisitic methods to gene sequence data
to investigate patterns of social-behavioral evolution in this group. Some tent
caterpillars are economic pests and better knowledge of the group-living
characteristics of this group is of important economic interest to homeowners
and farmers.
