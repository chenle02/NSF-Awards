The unique preservation and abundance of Ediacaran-type fossils in the Upper
Precambrian at Mistaken Point, southeast Newfoundland, provide an ideal test of
the hypothesis that the soft-bodied Vendozoa represent a non-metazoan branch of
early evolution. Of particular interest is the unusual "spindle-shaped fossils"
at this locality. The availability of literally hundreds of fossil impressions
will allow a complete study of the anatomy, life history and morphogenesis of
this organism in terms of constructional morphology. A key aspect of our project
is the integratation of methods from paleoichnology, structural geology,
sedimentary geochemistry, sedimentology and micropaleontology to restore and
analyze the paleobiology and benthic environment of this Vendozoan fauna.
Silicon casts will allow us to develop representative museum collections at Yale
and Tubingen universities, thus preserving the important paleontological value
of the Mistaken Point locality.
