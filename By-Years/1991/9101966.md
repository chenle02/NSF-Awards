Bhattacharya This research is on: 1. hierarchical fault simulation in coarse-
grain MIMD parallel computers or distributed systems; and 2. parallel test
generation on MIMD parallel machines with and without shared memory. An
investigation of two-dimensional circuit partitioning leading to two-
dimensional, loosely-coupled, pipeline-like information flow in a distributed
memory parallel computer, and partitioning of circuits employing partial scan
design methodologies is being explored. Formal methods to analyze the
computational complexity of the resultant parallel algorithms are being
formulated. Implementations are being tested using industrial size benchmark
circuits. A BDD-based approach is being taken for test generation. This has
advantages in generating tests for large combinational circuits and sequential
circuits. Algorithms are being explored for machines with shared memory, and for
distributed-memory MIMD machines. Also being investigated are the generalization
of BDD's to multi-valued decision diagrams, and the use of BDD-based test
generation in a hierarchical design framework.
