Abstract This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act
of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).

This Major Research Instrumentation-Recovery and Reinvestment (MRI-R2) award
funds the development of a multipoint, dual color fluorescence fluctuation
spectroscopy (FFS) at Harvard University. The instrumentation enables new
research on the spatial regulation of protein behaviors in cells and developing
organisms, and high throughput studies of protein dynamics and interactions in
vivo. This work will have a large impact on a number of areas in biology,
including cell biology, developmental biology, and systems biology. The
development effort serves as a focal point for interdisciplinary research that
includes elements of biology, engineering, and physics. The development effort
and the corresponding research activities will enable and help physical
scientist address biologically relevant questions, while encouraging biologists
to adopt more quantitative approaches. Undergraduates, graduate students and
postdoctoral fellows will be intimately involved in the instrumentation effort,
and thus will receive a solid education in developing quantitative experimental
techniques in an interdisciplinary setting. Undergraduates and graduate students
who visit as part of courses or summer programs will have the opportunity to see
optics, statistical physics and biology taught through the use of cutting-edge
technology. A high school teacher will also work on the project, to explore ways
of involving high school students, particularly those from underrepresented
groups. The development effort will be reported in scientific journals and
publicized on a website. Once constructed, the instrument will be readily
available to researchers, and new user will be recruited by the development team
and an on-line sign up.
