9623638 Simpson Graduate student Todd Barkman, with direction from adviser
Beryl Simpson at the University of Texas, is studying an interesting problem in
plant evolution and distribution in Southeast Asia. The focus of the project is
the orchid genus Dendrochilum and the 20-30 species of subsection Eurybrachium
that occur mostly on the large island of Borneo, with many on Mt. Kinabalu
alone. Field collections will augment herbarium materials to enable detailed
morphological study of vegetative and floral characters; field work capitalizes
on the floristic inventory activities of Prof. John Beaman and his Malaysian and
Indonesian colleagues. In addition, molecular (DNA) analyses of nuclear and
chloroplast genes will add new data for measuring mutational differences between
the species and for inferring phylogenetic relationships. Related groups on the
islands of Sumatra, Java, and Sulawesi, and in the Philippines and Malaysia will
also be studied for phylogenetic comparisons. A robust phylogeny of the species
will test two competing hypotheses for the origin of these epiphytic orchids.
One hypothesis claims adaptive radiation on Borneo from a single ancestral
introduction; the second hypothesis claims multiple introductions from different
islands around Borneo. %%% The integration of traditional morphological
characters with new molecular data from DNA sequencing promises a more reliable
taxonomy of plants and the robust inference of phylogenetic (genealogical)
relationships among species. With this phylogeny in place, patterns of
historical biogeography (migration, adaptive radiations, speciation) can be
analyzed. Barkman and Simpson's study of Dendrochilum orchids is one further
example of this rejuvenated plant systematics. ***
