City College - CUNY proposes the establishment of a Center for the Analysis of
Structures and Interfaces. Investigators at the Center will study the optical
spectroscopy of semiconductors and adsorbates and the time-dependent analysis of
interactive phenomena between surfaces. Results from these studies will impact
surface and materials science, solar cell development, photocatalytic systems,
and optoelectronics. In addition, the Center will develop strategies to
strengthen partnerships with industry and other major research institutions and
help motivate minority students to consider careers in science and engineering.
This project meets the major goal of the Minority Research Centers of Excellence
(MRCE) program: to increase the minority presence in science and engineering by
making substantial resources available to upgrade the research capabilities of
the most research productive minority institutions. The project will at the same
time enable this institution to use research as a tool to increase the
effectiveness of related science and engineering activities for minority groups
in its region. The Center will accomplish this primarily by providing
opportunities for faculty and students at City College and assisting other
nearby institutions with sizable minority student enrollments to engage in
meritorious research that leads to publications in refereed journals.
