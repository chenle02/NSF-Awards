The major priorities of the workshop are to prepare experienced faculty from
Historically Black Colleges and Universities to teach successful undergraduate
courses in demography and population studies and to prepare such individuals to
introduce modules on demography into existing courses. Participants for this
seminar will include sociology, economics, and geography faculty members with
interest in teaching undergraduate demography courses. The seminar will prepare
and enhance the faculty participants for teaching demography courses by updating
their theoretical and empirical knowledge, introducing them the educational
software, and developing appropriate syllabi to include materials for the
course.
