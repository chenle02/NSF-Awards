The research objective of this project is to develop new mathematical models and
solution methodologies to study the design of optimal treatment plans for type 2
diabetes. The research will begin by investigating models for the management of
cardiovascular risk using common drug treatment options such as cholesterol and
blood pressure lowering medication. Algorithmic methods will be developed for
computing optimal and approximate (near optimal) treatment guidelines in the
presence of uncertainty about a patient's future health status. The models will
consider multiple perspectives including a patient's quality adjusted lifespan,
the costs of treatment, and the cost of diabetes related complications to the
health system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;According to the American Diabetes
Association, there are more than 20 million children and adults in the United
States who have diabetes. Of the affected population, approximately 90 percent
have type 2 diabetes. Currently, several risk models exist to predict the
probability of complications related to type 2 diabetes, including
cardiovascular complications such as heart attack and stroke; however, there has
been limited investigation of how to use these models to make optimal treatment
decisions. This project seeks to bridge this gap by furthering the basic
knowledge of how to optimally treat type 2 diabetes over the course of a
patient's lifetime. It is anticipated that discoveries from this research
project will be transferrable to the treatment of other diseases.
