Seven Undergraduate students will be recruited nationally to participate in
astronomical research in Flagstaff, Arizona in the summer of 1991.
Representatives from Northern Arizona University, the Lowell Observatory, the
Astrogeology branch of the United States Geological Survey (U.S.G.S.) and
members of the National Undergraduate Research Observatory (NURO) will all
participate in this program. Five specific research projects tailored for
undergraduates will encompass research in stellar, extragalactic, and planetary
astronomy.
