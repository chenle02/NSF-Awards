The research will focus on a novel approach to two types of complex systems:
disordered quantum conductors and classical dynamical systems with many degrees
of freedom. The unifying themes for this work are two: (1) Both types of systems
will exhibit fluctuation behavior characteristic of the well-known random matrix
ensembles of Wigner and Dyson, and (2) Both types of systmes will exhibit
universal finite-size scaling behavior of the type familiar from critical
phenomena. Recent work has shown the connection between universal conductance
fluctuations in normal metals and random matrix theory. Random matrix theory
provides a new theoretical approach to quantum transport theory. For classical
dynamical sytems, the application of these concepts are quite novel and may have
far-reaching implications.
