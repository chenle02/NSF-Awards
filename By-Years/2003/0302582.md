This project will analyze data taken from the MeV Auroral X-ray Imaging and
Spectroscopy (MAXIS) 2000 long-duration balloon campaign. The balloon was
launched from McMurdo, Antarctica. It detected two types of high-energy
(relativistic) particle precipitation, (1) MeV precipitation events and (2)
microbursts. The analysis will examine the sources and particle energization
mechanisms responsible for these two different types of events. The
observational data will be put into context by comparing the observations with
different models of the processes by which particles are energized and then
scattered into the loss-cone so that they are observed as precipitating
particles. In addition to the purely scientific aspects of the research, the
project will enhance education by including undergraduates in the research
program and the Dartmouth College Women in Science Project (WISP) will help
enhance diversity in space science.
