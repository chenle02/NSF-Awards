This project aims to improve instruction in neurobiology through the purchase of
electrophysiological instruments, such as preamplifiers, stimulus isolation
units, micromanipulators and storage oscilloscopes. The equipment will be used
in new exercises designed for the neurobiology laboratory course, including: 1)
the compound action potential and sensory coding in cockroach giant axons; 2)
the synaptic physiology of an insect neuromuscular junction; 3) intracellular
physiology and single-cell labelling in the Helisoma buccal ganglion; and 4) the
manipulation of cell membrane potential in muscle cells. Its additional use by
students involved in Honors and independent research projects will broaden the
opportunities for undergraduate research.
