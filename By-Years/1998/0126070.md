In real world learning situations, a wide variety of contextual cues become
associated with gradually formed common sense knowledge. In contrast, school
learning often emphasizes abstract symbolic manipulations, which can lead to
students' difficulties in applying their knowledge to real world examples. To
help students make intuitive sense of physics, it is necessary to address
sensory stimuli that are explicitly or implicitly associated with students'
common sense knowledge from experience. To do this, it is important to
understand what contextual cues are involved in learning and how they affect the
learning process.

For selected topics in introductory physics, we will conduct systematic
qualitative studies to identify and investigate specific context cues that
affect students' learning; we will develop methods to measure, evaluate and
represent the involvement of context cues in different stages of learning; we
will also develop physics activities in virtual environments to investigate
experimentally how low-level sensory cues such as haptic feedback affect
learning and how such cues may be addressed in instruction.

The resulting insights into the interplay between context and learning, and
integration of contextual and sensory information into virtual environments will
broaden the horizon of active engagement teaching methods and inform the
development of teaching technologies.
