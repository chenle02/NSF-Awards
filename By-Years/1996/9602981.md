Experimental studies of the electromagnetic and weak currents in hadrons and
hadronic matter are proposed for the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator
Facility (TJNAF). A major emphasis is placed on measurements of parity violation
in the scattering of polarized electrons from nucleons and light nuclei, data
which will provide new insights into the flavor content of these systems.
Measurements at several laboratories of the electromagnetic structure functions
of the nucleon are also proposed. A detector fabrication laboratory will be
instrumented through support provided by the office of Multidisciplinary
Activities (OMA), as part of an enabling initiative for enhanced intrumentation
development and procurement.
