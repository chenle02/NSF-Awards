This research is directed towards providing a solution to a particular problem
involving the manufacture of laminated composite materials. A critical problem
in this labor intensive and expensive process is the inspection of ply edges to
determine whether they have been placed within tolerance. A machine vision
system to automate this inspection process has been developed in an earlier
phase of this research. The current research effort seeks to improve the
accuracy, adaptability and speed of this system by the use of neural network
techniques. The proposed image processing system will use a highly regular
architecture that integrates neural network modules in layers, thus
significantly increasing the learning speeds for the neural networks.
