0323232&lt;br/&gt;Findley&lt;br/&gt;This 3-year award to University of Miami's
Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences (RSMAS) provides support
for technical services during NSF-funded programs on R/V Seward Johnson (SJ), a
204' research vessel, R/V Seward Johnson II (SJII), a 168' research vessel, and
R/V Walton Smith (WS), a 96' coastal research vessel. All three vessels are
operated as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System
(UNOLS) research fleet. Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution (HBOI) owns and
operates SJ and SJII, and RSMAS owns and operates WS. RSMAS will provide two
shipboard technicians on each cruise of SJ and SJII, and one technician on WS,
to support seagoing research projects and to maintain, calibrate and provide for
qualified users items from their pool of shared-use research instrumentation.
