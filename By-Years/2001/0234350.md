Despite an abundance of research on gender bias, no prior work has examined the
relationships among gender bias in evaluations, organizational mobility and
final levels of organizational attainment. The aim of this project is to fill
this gap in the literature by assessing four models of the processes by which
gender bias could lead to the exclusion of women in senior levels of
organizations. Computer simulation methods will be used to examine the impact of
gender bias in performance evaluations on women's organizational
mobility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By understanding how different models of mobility
and other related organizational factors mediate the bias-to-exclusion
relationship, policy-makers and organizational leaders will be better able to
recognize the impact of gender bias, understand the organizational practices
that lead to the exclusion of women, and develop research-based interventions to
broaden the participation of women in the most senior ranks of management.
Because gender segregation is the result of many small decisions, the cumulative
impact of gender bias can be difficult to see. In this regard, a computer
simulation is an excellent tool for classroom use, helping to clarify the real-
world impact of gender bias and enabling students to manipulate organizational
parameters so as to observe (in real-time) the resulting effects on women's
organizational mobility. The computer simulation can also be used to demonstrate
(and counter) people's tendency to dismiss the effects of very small amounts of
gender bias.&lt;br/&gt;
