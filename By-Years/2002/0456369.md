0456369&lt;br/&gt;Harrington&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Mary E. Harrington, Smith
College, along with her counterparts, Dr. Diego Golombek, Universidad Nacional
de Quilmes, and Dr. Mario Guido, University of Cordoba, are organizing a
workshop on Chronobiology, to be held in Buenos Aires, Argentina, October 25 -
28. The goals of this activity are to identify common research priorities for
collaboration in the field, and to introduce students to current research
questions and technologies. Their workshop will precede the 8th Latin American
Symposium on Chronobiology and will take advantage of this large gathering of
the world experts in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This satellite workshop
will lay the groundwork as an introduction to the field, directed primarily at
students who are new to the topic. This is an opportunity for students to
network among the senior researchers in this exciting new field of science. This
is a relatively new field of research (circadian biology) and it impacts a broad
range of biological systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
