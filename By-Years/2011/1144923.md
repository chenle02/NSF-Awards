Much of the world's land is now used for agriculture and the interactions
between agricultural and natural systems is increasingly important to sustaining
both. For example, natural systems provide organisms that pollinate and control
pests on crops, and farms can support a diversity of native species that co-
exist with agriculture. However, this mutual benefit depends strongly on how
farms are managed: highly intensive agriculture may not be sustainable, whereas
less intensive methods may, in the long run, yield more. Coffee farms are a
model system in which to study how farms can be managed to be ecologically
sustainable, and this project will support a synthesis of two decades of study
by two of the world?s leading researchers on biodiversity, ecosystem function,
and complex interactions between organisms in coffee plantations in Central
America. The main scientific result will be a book on the agroecology of coffee
aimed at students and also informative to more senior scientists and
managers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this project for improving
agriculture and maintaining the environment are manifest. The researchers will
further enhance these impacts by posting illustrated guides on a website for
easy access, and collaborating with a Mexican colleague to produce educational,
interactive, simulation models to help farmers, students, and other stake
holders to understand agroecosystems using coffee plantations as a model.
