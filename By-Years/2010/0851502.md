The Division of Chemistry supports this REU site at Washington State University
(WSU), in Pullman WA, for the summers of 2009-2011. The Program Director is Dr.
James A. Brozik and will be assisted by Ms. Lori Bruce during the 9.5-week
program. This REU site emphasizes the more quantitative aspects of biological
chemistry and chemistry related to biological systems. This REU site provides
students the opportunity to (1) obtain a hands-on research experience working on
an individual project that utilizes state-of-the-art physical and chemical
characterization tools to quantitatively address biologically relevant problems,
(2) formally and informally learn about the strong connections between chemistry
and biology, (3) be a part of a truly collaborative research effort (by being a
member of a dynamic, active research group), and (4) experience a new school and
/ or research environment in a different part of the country. Through
participation in WSU's Office of Undergraduate Education (OUE), participants
benefit from: (1) co-located housing for all REU and internally funded summer
undergraduate research programs, (2) participation in coordinated group
activities on campus and the surrounding area, (3) can take advantage of
workshops on Library Skills, Intellectual Property, and Poster Presentation
Skills, and (4) participation in an end of the summer poster symposium
highlighting research from the Science and Engineering summer programs from
across the campus (40+ student posters). In this way, the students are exposed
to new colleagues from diverse fields of study in Science and Engineering and
are totally immersed within a larger community of student-scholars with similar
goals but diverse interests. Being a part of a larger community can lead to a
richer more positive summer experience.
