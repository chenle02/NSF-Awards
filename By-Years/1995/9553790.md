The Oklahoma Teacher Education Collaborative (O-TEC), a consortium composed of
K-12 schools, two-year, and four-year institutions from across the state,
proposes a program that addresses concerns in the teacher preparation system
from recruitment, through pre-service training, into early years of teaching. A
series of Summer Academies, in which potential teachers work under the direction
of classroom teachers to present model lessons in science and mathematics, will
recruit talented youth and particularly focus on underserved populations. Entry
points at two-year institutions of higher education will be strengthened by
development of appropriate courses and formulation of a curriculum for para-
teachers. O-TEC institutions will revise their general education courses in
science and mathematics to meet the needs of pre-service teachers. Engineering
faculty will also participate in development of general education offerings
appropriate for teachers. Instruction in professional education will have a
field orientation and use cooperating teachers who are confident and
accomplished in hands-on methods. To address retention and professional growth
during early years of teaching, O-TEC will train experienced teachers and
building administrators to provide support in science and mathematics teaching
through state entry-year committees. A summer in-service program will bring new
teachers together after their first year to share experiences and respond to
concerns about content and pedagogy. O-TEC will sponsor sessions for entry-year
teachers at meetings of the Oklahoma science (OSTA) and mathematics (OCTM)
associations to encourage professional participation. O-TEC institutions will
also provide consulting for entry-year teachers who experience difficulty and
will provide equipment load to new teachers. Use of technology will be a
component of all activities, and several modes of evaluation will provide
feedback for guidance.
