This project consists of two parts. The first part is concerned with linear and
nonlinear mathematical problems in solid mechanics. Specifically, we shall study
foundations problems in the elastostatic theory of thin and slender bodies,
optimal control problems involving viscoelastic bodies, and stress concentration
problems in finite strain and materially nonlinear thin elastic bodies and
shells. The second part deals with the development of new perturbation
techniques for weakly nonlinear wave propagation problems. Specifically we shall
study problems for which the linearized hyperbolic equations do not split up
into individual unidirectional modes, and cases where the linearized problem is
unstable even though the nonlinear problem has stable solutions. We shall also
extend multiple scale perturbation techniques to problems with more than two
dependent variables (as in nonisentropic flow) and to higher space dimensions as
in two-dimensional shallow water flow and acoustics.
