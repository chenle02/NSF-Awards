Dr. Anthony Fratiello and other members of the Department of Chemistry and
Biochemistry of the California State University at Los Angeles are being
supported to continue a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in
chemistry. For the period 1995-97, ten undergraduate students will spend ten
weeks each summer actively engaged in research projects selected from the fields
of inorganic, organic, and physical chemistry and biochemistry. This REU site is
targeted to minority students enrolled in community colleges. The site has an
excellent record in stimulating community college students to pursue the
bachelor's degree.
