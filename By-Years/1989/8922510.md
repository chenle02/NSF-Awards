The Computer Science Department of the University of Colorado will continue to
develop the infrastructure created with their prior CER award by upgrading
workstations, adding X terminals, and acquiring new shared-memory and
distributed memory multiprocessors. This will enable researchers in the
department to continue their significant investigations in the areas of
scientific computation, connectionist systems, and software systems. The
research in scientific computation has three components: language and tools,
numerical algorithms, and applications, which all have a heavy emphasis on
parallel computation. Parallel computation is also emphasized by the
connectionist researchers, who are making interesting applications of
connectionism and are collaborating with the scientific computation researchers
in developing sophisticated optimization algorithms. The software systems
research has a broad scope, including projects in user interfaces, databases,
programming environments, distributed systems, and languages and semantics. The
systems researchers provide a basic source of systems expertise and tools for
the other research areas, as well as engaging in fundamental systems
investigations.
