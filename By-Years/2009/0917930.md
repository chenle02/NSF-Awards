Stroud Water Research Center (SWRC) will partner with Longwood Gardens (LG) to
develop educational materials that help visitors understand the links between
the hydrologic and carbon cycles. The goal is to demonstrate how landscape
aesthetics can influence land-use decisions, and to offer carbon-neutral methods
the public and others can employ to reduce the impact of storm runoff. The
intended audience is primarily adults among the 800,000 annual visitors to the
Gardens who are landowners as well as professionals such as engineers, regional
planners, landscape architects, developers and municipal officials. This project
will also communicate research to public audiences through SWRC and LG websites.
