Cowie, Antoinette 96-17216 Dr. Cowie will determine the deuterium-to-hydrogen
ratio in chemically unevolved systems, the evolution of structure in the
intergalactic medium, the evolution with redshift of the cosmic microwave
background temperature and the invariance of dimensionless physical constants --
all as fundamental tests of cosmological models. The studies will be based on
ultra-high signal-to- noise measurements of a large sample of distant quasars
using the high resolution spectrograph on the Keck 10-m telescope.
