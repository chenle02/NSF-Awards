This REU site award provides support for eight undergraduate researchers in
mathematics working under the supervision of several faculty advisors. Areas of
possible research include dynamical systems, stochastic processes, and
combinatorics. The program will run for eight weeks. Students will participate
in two seminar series and will each give a presentation. At the end of the
program, the students will prepare their work for inclusion in a proceedings and
for possible publication.
