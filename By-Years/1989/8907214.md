Modern solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy offers the
chemist one of the most powerful tools available for the study of the physical
and chemical properties of materials. Fundamental knowledge of structure and
dynamics of materials as diverse as biopolymers, resins, coals, and liquid
crystals is accessible by solid-state NMR techniques. Solid-state NMR studies
often complement those carried out using solution NMR and X-ray analysis. Access
to solid-state NMR is rapidly becoming essential to chemists carrying out
frontier research. This award from the Chemical Instrumentation Program will
help the Department of Chemistry of the University of California, San Diego, to
construct a high-field NMR spectrometer suitable for carrying out solid-state
NMR studies. The areas of chemical research that will be enhanced by the
acquisition include the following. 1) Studies of spin relaxation and molecular
motion in solids 2) Ligand and solvate dynamics of solid-state transition metal
complexes.
