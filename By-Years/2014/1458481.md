The "Encouraging Interdisciplinary Learning in Science, Math, and Computing"
project at the College of Saint Scholastica will advance STEM knowledge and
understanding by piloting strategies to engage and support students at a private
liberal arts college, with an emphasis on recruiting female, first-generation,
and other underrepresented groups. Scholarships and targeted activities will
help a cohort of academically talented students with demonstrated financial need
achieve aspirations for STEM careers or graduate school, while also boosting the
STEM workforce. The project's interdisciplinary focus will familiarize students
with the dynamic nature of research and employment in STEM disciplines.

Project objectives include: 1) Increasing the recruitment of talented,
financially needy students in STEM majors, with special encouragement to groups
underrepresented in STEM; 2) Encouraging S-STEM Scholars to pursue undergraduate
research experiences or internships; 3) Achieve 90% degree attainment in STEM
fields among participants, through forming a strong peer group engaged in STEM
mentoring, career preparation, and academic support activities; 4) Achieve 80%
placement in STEM graduate programs or careers, with a focus on meeting regional
and national workforce needs. The project will employ a broad base of research-
proven methods to engage female and other underrepresented students, including:
intrusive advising, pedagogy to reduce stereotype threat, promoting a growth
mindset and active learning, peer mentoring, workshops, field trips,
internships, and research experiences. Lessons learned and effective practices
that emerge from the program evaluation data will be disseminated to the
education community and help enlarge the knowledge base regarding attributes and
practices of successful scholarship programs of this type.
