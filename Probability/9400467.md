Zhang The project concentrates on percolation, a mathematical model has
applications to a variety of areas, such as physics, biology, computer science,
and geology. A percolation process typically depends on one or more parameters.
There may be a dramatic change in physical properties depending on whether a
parameter is above or below a critical value. For example, suppose we immerse a
large porous solid in a bucket of water. Clearly, how water penetrates the solid
depends on the size of the pores. A simple mathematical model of such a process
is defined by considering the pores to be distributed in some lattice, and to be
open or closed with probabilities p or 1-p. There is a critical threshold, p(c),
for the probability at which the behavior changes abruptly. Below the threshold
the water penetration is only superficial and above it the penetration is
infinitely deep. Of special interest is behavior near the critical threshold.
One of the most challenging problems is to show that the probability of infinite
penetration behaves like a power of |p-p(c)| if p is near p(c). This research
will focus on mathematically rigorous exact solutions for the percolation
process. The project concentrates on percolation, a mathematical model has
