Meinen&lt;br/&gt;0136355&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monthly mean data from 1993 thru
1999 will be used to determine whether the spatio-temporal variability of fields
of warm water volume and sea surface height estimated from satellite altimetry
in the tropical/subtropical Pacific are correlated. The pathways of warm water
variability will be determined, since it is not clear that the mean Subtropical
Cells and the variations about the mean follow the same pathways. &lt;br/&gt;
