The goal of the research is to contribute an improvement in the quality of
scientific data collected from human informants. The technique involved permits
the simultaneous analysis of the competence of individuals to provide
information and the accuracy of that information taken collectively. The problem
which this research addresses is commonly encountered in many areas of social
and behavioral science; namely, how to measure the knowledge and abilities of
informants when there are no predetermined "correct" answers to questions or
when the correct answers are not known by the researcher in advance. For
example, anthropologists have to deal with the problem in studying little- known
cultures or in making cross-cultural comparisons. Linguists must cope with it in
studying the syntax of exotic languages. Sociologists deal with it in performing
research on attitudes. Social psychologists come across it in studying the
reported behavior of deviant groups, and the problem also arises in studies
involving the pooling of expert opinion for purposes of forecasting or policy
analysis. The work to be carried out under the recommended grant will complete
the program of research supported by two previous grants; specifically,
perfection of the coherent set of mathematical models derived from consensus
theory, unification of consensus methodology with latent structure analysis, and
extension of the methodology to psychophysics, to such scaling situations as are
found in utility measurement, for example, and to other areas of application
such as the assessment of personal risk in decision making experiments.
