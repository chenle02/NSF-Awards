9614267 Zoback The PI proposes to analyze data from the 9 km KTB borehole to
better understand the relationships among depth, lithology, the contemporary in
situ stress field, and the mobility of crustal fluids. The work will investigate
tectonic controls on permeability and permeability anisotropy through a crustal
section that approaches the depth of the brittle-ductile transition. The project
will include measurements of the distribution and orientation of faults and
fractures penetrated by both the main KTB borehole and the KTB pilot hole
(drilled to 9 and 4 km, respectively), a study of their hydrologic properties
through comparison with fracture-related thermal and flow anomalies, and finally
an attempt to relate the relatively permeable fractures with the current stress
field. By documenting systematic relationships between fracture orientation and
hydrologic properties, the PI expects to provide a framework for interpretation
of hydraulic properties to 9100 m. ***
