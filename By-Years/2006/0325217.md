Organizations operating in critical environments, such as hospitals and security
agencies, have evolved into team-based, quasi-decentralized structures. Safety,
efficiency, and quality performance in these organizations depend on the ability
of the organization to support large scale collaboration-real time coordination
across teams, tasks, and resources in a dynamic and risk-prone environment. This
research begins to tackle problems of coordination in large-scale collaboration
through field research in a trauma center, technology development of mobile
devices for real time coordination, and laboratory studies to understand
coordination across teams, people, and resources. The research aims to develop a
theory of trajectory management and management tools in large-scale
collaboration and practical solutions to cross-team coordination. Researchers
from University of Maryland Medical School, Carnegie Mellon University, and
University of Arizona will collaborate on this research. This project will
improve theory in organization science, increase understanding of how to exploit
new information technology in critical environments, and improve coordination in
hospitals and other vital organizations.
