Recent Observational Studies have shown that the tropical atmosphere is very
nearly neutral, rather than unstable, to moist convection. But virtually all
representations of cumulus convection used in general circulation models permit
large instability to build up and to be released episodically, resulting in
spurious atmospheric wave modes. These may adversely affect climate simulations
by such models. The PI will develop a representation of moist convection that
does not allow instability to accumulate and test this against conventional
schemes in the context of a simple numerical model of the equatorial atmosphere,
with emphasis on the effects of these representations on long-period
oscillations in the atmosphere. This research may improve climate simulations
and projections.
