Theoretical research will be conducted on high temperature superconductors
(copper oxides). This work is motivated by the close proximity, at low doping
concentrations of oxygen, of the superconducting phase to the antiferromagnetic
phase. Our recently developed semiclassical expansion of a model in this regime
allows for a controlled study of the slightly doped antiferromagnet. The
comparison for these single hole results to numerical simulations and
experiments is encouraging. The many hole problem has not been studied and the
proposed projects will clarify the effects of finite doping on the magnetic
order and on the evolution from an antiferromagnetic insulator to a high
temperature superconductor. %%% This project will theoretically study one model
for high temperature superconductors and its behavior before becoming
superconducting. Thus, the effect of oxygen doping on the magnetic properties
prior to becoming superconducting and the influence of doping on
superconductivity will be studied. This problem is one of the foremost ones in
condensed matter physics and materials science.
