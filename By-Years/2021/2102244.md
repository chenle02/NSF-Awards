With the support of the Chemical Catalysis Program in the Division of Chemistry,
Alexander Miller of the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill will study the
ability of simple ions to control the outcomes of catalytic organic
transformations. Well-defined catalysts will be prepared and tested for their
ability to alter their structure and function upon addition of ions. In
addition, the project will provide a platform for training a diverse group of
students in chemical synthesis, thermodynamic and kinetic mechanistic analysis,
and catalyst development. Such cation-controlled catalysis will likely provide
access to specific alkene isomers that are valuable in the fragrance,
pharmaceutical, and commodity chemical industries, but are currently difficult
to obtain. The project will impact the broader chemistry community through a
web-based resource, namely the “Safety Net”, that assembles standard operating
procedures from chemistry research laboratories for broad dissemination to
improve the culture of safety. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this research, Dr.
Alexander Miller and his research team at the University of North Carolina-
Chapel Hill will study how cation–macrocycle interactions can be harnessed to
control the selectivity of catalytic transformations involving alkenes.
Macrocycle-containing “pincer-crown ether” ligands will provide versatile
platforms, when appended to catalytically active metal centers, for
understanding how non-covalent interactions influence catalyst structure and
reactivity. A particular focus will be on the development of strategies to
control catalyst selectivity based on either substrate–catalyst or ion–catalyst
interactions. The approach to these studies is to pair catalysis studies with
detailed thermodynamic and kinetic mechanistic examinations to elucidate the
design principles of ion-controlled catalysis. These adaptable “responsive
catalysts” will allow for the exploration of new concepts in non-covalently
controlled catalysis. The research will provide foundational knowledge for
improved catalyst design and development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
