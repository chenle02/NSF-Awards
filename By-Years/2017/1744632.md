This is the first of a newly created metabolic engineering (ME) workshop series
sponsored by the International Metabolic Engineering Society, entitled Metabolic
Engineering Summit 2017, to be held in Beijing, China. This international
conference will bring together established researchers, young investigators,
private sector scientists and engineers as well as graduate students to assess
the present and chart the future of the rapidly developing field of metabolic
engineering. To encourage interaction and further discussions, the entire
meeting is held in a single-track format, with most meals taken together and
with multiple social hours and poster sessions (typically presented by students,
postdocs, or junior faculty/scientists). The theme of the MES workshop is termed
"Metabolic Engineering in the era of Synthetic Biology". This conference is
designed to achieve several NSF missions, including; enhancing collaboration
with international communities, integrating the engineering sciences with the
life sciences, encouraging research and development in multidisciplinary areas,
and educating the next generation of young scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
elements of the meeting will include a plenary address from Gregory
Stephanopoulos (MIT, USA, scientific talks from leaders in the field, held in
plenary format (no concurrent sessions), and poster sessions, with an emphasis
on participation from graduate students, postdocs, and young investigators, held
in the evenings. Session topics will include: Production of natural products
using ME; Advancing a bio-economy using ME; ME as an enabling technology for
driving innovation; and Using ME to address challenges of biorefineries.
