This award will provide support for US participants, especially
women,&lt;br/&gt;graduate students, postdocs, and junior faculty, to attend
the&lt;br/&gt;twenty-third and twenty-fourth international conferences
entitled&lt;br/&gt;Formal Power Series and Algebraic Combinatorics (FPSAC), to
be held,&lt;br/&gt;respectively, in Reykjavik, Iceland, and Nagoya, Japan.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The continuing success of the annual FPSAC conferences
stems in part&lt;br/&gt;from their considerable interdisciplinary breadth --
linking leading&lt;br/&gt;researchers in combinatorial mathematics with strong
researchers in&lt;br/&gt;allied fields drawn from pure and applied mathematics,
theoretical&lt;br/&gt;computer science, physics, and biology. The span of this
conference&lt;br/&gt;series is unique among international conferences with an
emphasis on&lt;br/&gt;combinatorial mathematics. The principal topics featured
during the&lt;br/&gt;FPSAC 2011 and 2012 conferences will be algebraic,
geometric, and&lt;br/&gt;enumerative combinatorics. The emphasis will be on
applications in&lt;br/&gt;physics, biology, and computer science and on
relations to other areas&lt;br/&gt;of mathematics such as algebraic geometry,
commutative algebra,&lt;br/&gt;K-theory, geometric group theory, representation
theory, and&lt;br/&gt;symplectic geometry.
