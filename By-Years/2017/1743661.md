The principal investigator will evaluate diffuse correlation spectroscopy as a
noninvasive optical method for monitoring real-time changes in cerebral blood
flow, in order to better inform medical interventions in the event of
neurological injury or disease. The proposed research will partner researchers,
faculty and postdocs at the New York Medical College, the University of
Colorado, the University of Pennsylvania, and the FDA. The proposal includes a
well-designed mentoring plan to be implemented by the PI. The plan includes
tracking progress through Individual Development Plans; informal discussions to
assess satisfaction with the mentoring program' and tracking progress toward
career goals.

This project will provide information on the types of changes that can be
interrogated using the low-resolution diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS)
technique. Direct comparison to a high resolution technique will provide
necessary information on sensitivity and specificity for DCS. The use of
stimulated changes during monitoring will provide the types of necessary detail
on the populations of blood vessels that can be assessed. Cerebral blood flow
can be used to inform medical interventions in cases of neurological injury or
disease.
