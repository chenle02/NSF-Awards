Millard H. Alexander of The University of Maryland at College Park and Paul J.
Dagdigian of Johns Hopkins University are supported by the Experimental Physical
Chemistry Program to continue their collaborative studies of the dynamics of
nonreactive collisions involving diatomic free radicals, with an emphasis on
electronically nonadiabatic processes. They will study weakly bound complexes of
the radicals and the predissociation of these complexes in order to gain further
information on the underlying potential energy surfaces. The theoretical effort
involves development and application of new methods for elucidating the
mechanism of molecular collisions and photodissociation, ab initio calculation
of the potential energy surfaces and nonadiabatic coupling matrix elements, and
full quantum calculations of cross sections and rate constants and the
determination of bend-stretch levels of weakly-bound complexes. The experimental
effort involves the determination of state-to-state inelastic cross sections for
energy transfer processes and the spectroscopy and dynamics of rare gas-diatomic
van der Waals complexes. The dominant theme of their research is the influence
of electronic angular momentum and/or spin on inelastic energy transfer and
photodissociation. During a collision, or during the breakup of a molecule, the
internal electronic angular momenta will couple with the motion of the nuclei
and hence influence product branching ratios and inelastic propensities.
Therefore, a thorough understanding of this coupling mechanism should ultimately
lead to a better understanding of how to optimize the desired products in
chemical reactions.
