Project Abstract SES Proposal 0135445 Philosophical Significance of Symmetries
in Mechanics Gordon Belot, New York University

This philosophy of physics project studies from a unified perspective three
prominent problems in philosophy of physics-the question of relationalism about
space and motion, the question of the nature and significance of gauge freedom,
and the question of the content and implications of the principle of general
covariance. The author intends, by setting these questions in the context of the
mathematical theory of symmetry and reduction within geometric mechanics, to
make possible sharp construals and investigations of conceptual and
interpretative questions. He also hopes that treating these questions together
within single framework allows for a fruitful delineation of the analogies and
disanalogies in play at the technical level, as an aid towards making progress
at the interpretative level. The intended result of the project is a book
treating these topics.
