This project is purchasing laboratory equipment (HPLC, GC-MS) and four 486 PC
computers for the first course of a new integrated laboratory sequence.
Laboratory experiments are organized around themes that relate mathematical
concepts to chemistry through data analysis and focus on the analysis of natural
products with modern separation and spectroscopic methods. MathCad is used
extensively in the course, as is the Vemier Lab Interface, a user-friendly
computer interface for collecting and displaying data in real time. The
laboratory experiments are conducted in a "workshop" environment, where students
take a more active part in experimental design and data analysis. The
experiments that utilize the new equipment take place in a five- week integrated
laboratory project at the end of the course. The project involves the
separation, purification, and analysis by HPLC and GC-MS of some of the active
components of the ginger root.
