This grant supports the formation of a study committee by the Computer Science
and Technology Board (CSTB) of the National Academy of Sciences/National
Research Council to investigate the academic environment for experimental
computer scientists. Specifically CSTB hopes to "determine the scope and scale
of the difficulties of the country's doctorate granting computer science
departments in evaluating the work of faculty whose work is predominately
focussed on building functional systems for external users." The committee will
assess the problem, identify successful models and develop recommendations, and
finally prepare a report on its findings.
