There is a growing demand for instrumentation that can detect, in-situ, very
low concentrations of organic chemical contaminants in water. The increased
monitoring requirements and lowered detection limits being imposed by the
Environmental Protection Agency, as well and many states, are rapidly making
existing detection instrumental obsolete. Real-time monitoring of parts-per-
billion (ppb) concentrations of aromatic hydrocarbons in groundwater is a
difficult task. In the laboratory, accurate measurement of very low
concentrations of dissolved organics has required the development of powerful
analytical tools. EPA approved methods use gas chromatography to accomplish
these separations. However, the sensitive techniques employed are expensive and
not suited to on- site monitoring of organic contaminants in groundwater. One of
the most exciting recent analytical approaches is a blend of fiber optic and
electrode technologies into what are called "optrodes". Cape Cod Associates will
investgate the feasibility of developing an innovative optrode device for the
detection, identification, and quantification of trace levels of chemical
contaminants in water. This fiber optic-based instrument will have a rapid
response detector that can measure contaminant concentrations in parts per
billion. Potential applications for this device would include: detection of
pollutants in groundwater landfill plumes, detection of chemicals in cooling
water systems as well as hazardous waste site monitoring, and general water
quality assessment. Cape Cod Associates has been involved in highly innovative
environmental, polymer, and materials research for numerous federal and state
agencies. It is likely to continue to make significant contributions in its
chosen area of R&D.
