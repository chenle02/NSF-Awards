In this project funded by the Chemical Catalysis program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor Melanie Sanford of The University of Michigan focuses on the
development of new catalysts that can ultimately be used for the synthesis of
pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals via more efficient, direct, and
environmentally friendly processes. To meet this challenge, the project will
establish a more detailed scientific understanding of the challenging steps of
the catalysis processes. In addition, new catalysts based on less toxic and
earth abundant elements will be explored and developed. In addition, an outreach
program led by Professor Sanford (UM FEMMES, Females Excelling More in
Mathematics, Engineering, and Science) exposes middle school girls from Ann
Arbor and surrounding communities to hands-on science activities. The broader
impacts of this work include potential societal benefits from the discovery of
more efficient catalysts and catalysts derived from less toxic, earth abundant
metals. This project serves as a training ground for undergraduate and graduate
students for careers at the interface of catalysis, inorganic and organic
chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research focuses on detailed mechanistic
studies of the challenging steps of the catalytic cycle, primarily alkyl-
heteroatom bond-forming reductive elimination processes. Ligands will be
designed to stabilize the reacting metal centers (high valent Pd, Ni, and Cu
complexes) in order to investigate the scope, mechanism, and stereochemical
outcomes of these processes. &lt;br/&gt;
