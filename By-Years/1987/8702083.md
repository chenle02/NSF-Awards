Research in the Area of Turbomachinery/Jet Engine Aerodynamics and
Computational Fluid Dynamics This award recommendation is made under the
U.S.-Industrialized Countries Program for the Exchange of Scientists and
Engineers, 1987/1988 Competition. The program is designed to enable U.S.
scientists and engineers to conduct long-term research at research institutions
in the industrialized countries of Western Europe as well as Japan, Australia
and New Zealand. Exchange awards provide opportunities for the conduct of joint
research and the utilization of unique or complementary facilities, expertise
and experimental conditions in foreign countries. Awards are selected on the
basis of scientific criteria relevant to his/her field of science, the
prospective potential of the applicants for professional growth, as well as
criteria relevant to the furthering of international cooperation in science and
engineering. The program is particularly directed to scientists and engineers
who are embarking on their research careers. This research project addresses
research related to the measurement and computation of three-dimensional viscous
flow in supersonic and transonic turbomachinery rotors, a study of rotor/stator
interaction in high speed turbomachines, and flow field using a laser transit
anemometer as well as other higher response probes. The computation will involve
the solution of a set of eleven partial differential equations governing the
flow field in this device. The project is under the direction of Professor
Budugur Lakshminarayana, Department of Aerospace Engineering, The Pennsylvania
State University, University Park, PA 16802, U.S.A., and Professor H. E. Gallus,
Director, Institut fuer Strahlantriebe und Turboarbeitsmaschinen, Rhein-
Westfalische Technische Hochschule, Templergraben 55, 5100 Aachen, Federal
Republic of Germany. This award recommendation provides funds to cover, as
appropriate, international travel, local travel abroad, stipend, dependents
allowance, if applicable, language training, if required, and a flat
administrative allowance of $250 for the U.S. home institution.
