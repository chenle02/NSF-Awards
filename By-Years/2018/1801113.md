Fewer than 40% of students who intend to major in STEM complete a STEM degree,
and more than two-thirds of students pursuing STEM associate degrees do not
complete their STEM programs within four years. One barrier faced by prospective
STEM majors is the failure to successfully complete the mathematics
requirements. To address the mathematics barrier that impedes students'
persistence and success in STEM associate degree technician programs, Lehigh
Carbon Community College (LCCC) will redesign Intermediate Algebra and College
Algebra to answer the question students continually ask: "Why do I need
math?"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mathematics faculty will work with an advisory
committee of faculty and industry professionals from various engineering,
technology, computing, and science fields to develop real-world applications
that mimic those encountered in industry. Through multi-disciplinary,
collaborative, and discovery-based learning, the students will increase their
awareness of the relevance of algebra to STEM disciplines. It is expected that
the revised mathematics courses will support an increase in the percentage of
STEM students successfully passing algebra courses, and increase fall-to-fall
retention in targeted STEM technician programs. The project has the potential to
positively affect the teaching of algebra beyond LCCC. A professional
development program will provide workshops for LCCC's full-time, part-time, and
adjunct faculty and faculty at other colleges in the region and for secondary
instructors who teach dual enrollment college algebra for high school students
seeking college credit. Participants will receive kits of instructional
materials to take back to their classrooms. A project website will be created to
share the course materials and project results, and materials developed will be
archived with ATE Central.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
