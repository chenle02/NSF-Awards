This award supports the research in combinatorics of Professor Jeffry Kahn of
Rutgers University. Dr. Kahn will be conducting investigations in the following
topics: the properties of hypergraphs (collections of finite sets); the problem
of giving a good estimate of the probability that a random square matrix of
order n, in which all entries are zero or 1, should be singular; and Chvatal's
conjecture on intersecting families in ideals in finite Boolean algebras. This
research falls in the broad category of combinatorics, which is one of the most
active fields in today's mathematics. Fundamentally, combinatorics represents a
systematization of the very first of all mathematical activities, counting. In
its modern development, however, combinatorics has gone beyond just counting to
make use of a wide variety of advanced mathematical techniques, and although its
roots go back several centuries, the field has had an explosive development in
the past few decades because of its importance in communications and information
technology.
