The objective of this proposal is to develop advanced computational approaches
to develop a fundamental and detailed understanding of multiphase fluids in
confined nanopores, especially in carbon nanotubes. If successful, the results
of this research should potentially clarify what are some of the issues
associated with the usage of CNTs as nano-pores in such critical applications as
desalination, hydrogen storage, DNA transport, and CO2 sequestration.
