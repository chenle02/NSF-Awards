This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses the need for
advanced packaging techniques in optoelectronic (OE) product manufacturing. The
limitations in communication and computation today arise from the use of
centralized, serial architectures. The future in communication and computation
networks is to move away from systems which are centralized and serial to ones
that are distributed and parallel. Using electrical signals for high-bandwidth
parallel I/O and processors suffers from several limitations: (1) expense and
bulk of shield cables; (2) high attenuation; (3) crosstalk; (4) timing skew; and
(5) ground loops. Consequently, the demand is for full access to optical
bandwidths for parallel optical and hybrid processors and parallel fiber links.
Currently, one barrier to the development of optoelectronic (OE) components and
systems is the cost. Packaging comprises 40-50% of the OE component cost. Today,
custom packaging is the rule and not the exception for OE components. The need
for flexible, standardized, low-cost packaging techniques is tremendous.
Photonics Research Incorporated proposes to develop advanced packaging
techniques for OE components and systems.
