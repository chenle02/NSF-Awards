This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in mantle
geochemistry between Gordon Brown and Jonathan Stebbins of Stanford University
and George Calas and Francis Taulelle of the University of Paris VI and VII
respectively. They will study silicate liquids at high temperatures and
pressures and trace elements in silicate minerals. Drs. Brown and Calas bring to
this collaboration their innovative methods in synchrotron based X-ray
absorption. This is complemented by Stebbins and Taulelle's work in high
temperature and pressure NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) spectroscopy. The
project will benefit from access to advanced facilities at Stanford and in
Paris. The project will provide new information on the bonding of silicate
liquids (melts) under simulated upper mantle conditions and the structural role
of transition metals in silicate minerals. The results will advance our
understanding of the structure- property relationships of these silicate liquids
at high temperatures and pressures. Detailed knowledge of the structure-property
relationships of these liquids and the melting phase, will be vital for
understanding the dynamic processes, structure and compositional zoning within
the Earth and other planets.
