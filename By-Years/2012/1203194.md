This is an interdisciplinary research project that focuses on collaborative,
cross-cultural research into Indigenous knowledge systems via mathematics. The
research team is made up of indigenous and non-indigenous researchers who will
study the infusion of mathematics in Indigenous Knowledge systems (IKS) and
studies how these mathematical knowledge systems are embedded and encoded into
everyday activities. The central hypothesis of this project is that "...embedded
in traditional indigenous knowledge systems--within their worldview, their way
of knowing, and their way of doing...are elegant solutions that are
mathematically rich." (from star navigation, to patterns for clothing to
building a kayak...) The project will take place in three different arctic
cultural, linguistic, and geographical regions: Yup'ik (Alaska), Sami (Norway
and Sweden) and Koryak (Kamchatka) with a comparative site in Yap (a Federated
State in Micronesia) as a control group. The project aims to do more than just
document the ethnomathematics; the project will contextualize this kind of
knowledge in broader cultural epistemologies and will also examine the
indigenous pedagogies by which people learn the activities and the embedded
mathematics. In addition to exploring mathematic conceptualizations the project
will also record the language of mathematics, which is endangered among all of
these groups and an aspect of language that is rarely captured by linguists
working with endangered languages. Perhaps most importantly, it has the
potential to add to human knowledge about how everyday problems and tasks are
solved without using Western instrumentation; if similar mathematically-oriented
processes are used across project sites this may well suggest will universal
concepts rather than culturally particularlistic ones. Hence, this project has
the potential to establish an alternative learning trajectory based on IKS for
the teaching of mathematics in indigenous and non indigenous contexts.
