This award supports continued development of the Antarctic Multibeam Bathymetry
and geophysical data Synthesis (AMBS). The AMBS is a web-accessible database for
the Southern Ocean and Antarctica, whose primary focus is compilation of
multibeam bathymetry data collected by the US Antarctic Program's research ship,
the R/V Palmer. The data are useful to a variety of Antarctic research
activities and represent an important legacy of exploration. The database
presently contains 80% of the Palmer's data. A map browser, GeoMapApp, has also
been developed to visually explore the dataset, generate custom maps, and
download user-defined digital elevation models as well as multibeam ping files.
This award supports acquisition of new content including multibeam, seismic,
radar and gravity data; deployment of a portable version of GeoMapApp for use on
the Palmer while at sea; and enhanced connectivity with complementary data and
metadata efforts, such as the Antarctic Master Directory and databases for deep-
sea sediment cores. &lt;br/&gt;
