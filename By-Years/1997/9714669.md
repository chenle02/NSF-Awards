Seven portable magnetometers, used for CEDAR investigations of electrodynamics
in the low-latitude ionosphere, are performing experiments with chained or
clustered sensors. Investigators hope to gain knowledge of large day-to-day
variability found in equatorial electrojet, Sq current system, Appleton
ionization anomaly, and equatorial spread F. Previously hampered in
investigations of low-latitude electrodynamics, researchers are filling the
lower-altitude data gap by combining ground-based sensors, including an
ionosonde, a backscatter radar, and a chain of magnetometers. The magnetometers
estimate the overhead current as a function of magnetic dip latitude. Then,
these estimates convert to those of drift velocity, latitudinal variation in
drift velocity converts into electric-field variation with altitude over the dip
equator, and the magnetometer measurements provide time-continuous data along a
magnetic meridian with spatial coverage in both hemispheres. Beyond these
studies, the magnetometers will also be deployed under other CEDAR and Space
Weather projects.
