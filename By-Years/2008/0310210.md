This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY2003.
The goal of the fellowship is to increase the participation of minority
scientists at the postdoctoral level and to prepare them for positions of
scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the
fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training and research of the
highest quality to recent doctoral recipients. It is expected that Fellows
supported through these fellowships will play important roles in training of the
future workforce.

The research and training plan is entitled "Cloning and characterization of
ramosa2, a gene that controls inflorescence development in maize." Ramosa2 is a
gene that controls inflorescence development in maize. It will be cloned by
transposon tagging or positional cloning and its expression studied using in
situ hibridization. A comparison with similar genes from maize and other grasses
will provide clues into the mechanism of evolution of ramosa2-related genes and
their effect on plant morphology.
