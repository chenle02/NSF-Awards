9726427 Mindell Birds are important to humans for food, for recreation, as
indicators of environmental health, and as experimental models in applied and
basic research. Despite their importance, their genealogical (evolutionary)
relationships remain poorly known, restricting our ability to understand the
evolutionary processes giving rise to the molecular, morphological and
behavioral differences among orders of birds. One of the reasons for our limited
knowledge of avian ordinal relationships is their apparent rapid
diversification, with most species arising during a relatively short time-span.
Resolving genealogy for rapid radiations of species such as this requires large
sets of characters for numerous species, and no such data sets are currently
available. In this research, David Mindell and Michael Sorenson will infer the
genealogical relationships among 134 birds, including representatives of all
commonly recognized avian orders, using 5,000 base pairs of mitochondrial DNA
sequence from 3 protein-coding genes, 1 ribosomal gene, and 9 transfer RNA genes
for each species. They will assess potential causes for differences among birds
in rates of DNA sequence evolution and determine how improved knowledge of these
causes may improve the efficiency and accuracy of the process of geneaology
estimation , and will attempt to estimate the ages of various orders and
lineages of birds.
