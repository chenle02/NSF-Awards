9602884 C. Austen Angell "Transitions in Bulk and Mesoscopic Liquids" This award
will provide partial support for three months of a six month visit to the
University of Sydney, Australia, by Professor C. Austen Angell of the Department
of Physics, Arizona State University. Professor Angell will conduct
collaborative research with Professors P. Harrowell and G. Warr on current
aspects of the dynamics and thermodynamics of the glass transition, or
polyamorphism glassy and liquid systems, and of the relation of such
polyamorphism to major structural transitions in mesoscopic systems such as
protein and RNA folding transitions. Angell's interest in glass transition
phenomenology will be combined with Harrowell's theoretical expertise in kinetic
Ising models, and the consequent microscopic origins of liquid fragility, and
Warr's experience in microemulsion structure and stability, to improve current
understanding of glasses and polyamorphism in glasses and biopolymers. The
investigators will 1) use control of system size at constant chemical potential
to see system size effects, in particular in systems with dimensions comparable
to those attributed to microheterogeneities which now seem to appear near the
glass temperature; 2) perform theoretical studies based on a facilitated spin
microheterogeneous model to determine the conditions necessary to produce the
smeared-out, glass- liquid transformation characteristic of hydrated protein
systems; 3) undertake multi-step calorimetric studies of protein refolding
kinetics to assess the relevance of nucleation and growth kinetics to the first
order complex systems transition; and 4) utilize microemulsion techniques to
examine effects of confinement on folding kinetics and to explore single
molecule observation strategies.
