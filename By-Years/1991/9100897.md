Professor Thomas E. Bitterwolf and other members of the Chemistry Department at
the University of Idaho are being supported to conduct a Research Experiences
for Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry. For the period 1991-93, eight
undergraduate students will spend eight weeks each summer actively engaged in a
variety of research projects. Example projects include photochemistry of
dinuclear organometallic complexes at low temperatures, investigation of calcium
channel blockers, and characterization of polymer additives. Students will
prepare a full journal-style report on the results of their research.
