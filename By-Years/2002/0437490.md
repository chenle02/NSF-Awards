This is a U.S.-Polish collaborative research project on novel types of porous
materials with narrow pore size distributions that are in the 10-20 angstrom
range. The principal investigators are Abraham Clearfield from Texas A&amp;M
University and Jerzy Zon from Wroclaw University of Technology.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Porous materials have a variety of uses in separating
molecules based upon size, have extensive use in catalysis, sensors, drug
delivery, ion exchange and nanoscience. Among the best examples are zeolites,
used extensively for most of these purposes but best known as improving the
yield of gasoline and home heating oil in petroleum cracking. A disadvantage is
that their useful cavities are small, less than 1 nanometer or one millionth of
an inch. A decade ago a new family of inorganic porous materials was discovered
with narrow distribution of pores in the 2 - 15 nm range and many potential
uses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project in materials research research fulfills
the program objectives of bringing together leading experts in the U.S. and
Central/Eastern Europe to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in
areas of strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of equality,
reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.
