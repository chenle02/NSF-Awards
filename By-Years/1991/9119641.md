This grant is to support a two day symposium on "Natural and Adaptive Immune
Mechanisms in Insects" at the 1991 Annual Meeting of the American Society of
Zoologists. The symposium will be subdivided into three major sections: cell
mediuated immunity in insects; humoral mediators of insect immunity; and
suppressive agents of insect immunity. This will be the first time that both the
inductive and suppressive sides of insect immunity will be discussed in a common
forum in such a comprehensive manner. The contributors to the symposium are
either established investigators with prominent reputations in their respective
fields, or young investigators who show great promise for the future. The major
goal of the symposium is to bring together investigators who are sutdying
different aspects of insect immunity, and provide them with a unique opportunity
to exchange ideas that will lead to new interpretations of existing data and the
development of new collaborations and approaches fo the future study of insect
immunity.
