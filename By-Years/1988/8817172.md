The importance of marine microbial communities in the cycling of carbon and
nutrients in pelagic ecosystems has only recently been realized. However, the
flux of genetic information through these same communities remains largely
unknown. This research examines the capability of marine bacteria to transfer
genetic information by the process of transformation- -the uptake and expression
of genetic information encoded in extracellular DNA. There are two specific
objectives: 1) to investigate transformation of endogenous marine microbial
assemblages by exogenous transforming DNA; and 2) to determine the likelihood of
transformation occurring in various marine environments and to compare these
with the mechanisms of gene transfer in terrestrial bacteria. These studies
should provide a more comprehensive picture of the transformation process in the
marine environment, and a better understanding of the flux of genes through
marine microbial communities.
