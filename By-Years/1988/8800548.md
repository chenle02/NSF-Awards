The PI will integrate the picosecond photoconductors directly onto the
microelectronic devices made from semiconductor quantum wells and superlattices.
This is a collaboration with the Army Electronics Technology and Device
Laboratory (ETDL) to develop efficient picosecond photoconductors on MBE
materials and to devise on-chip picosecond measurement techniques for high speed
electronic devices. This is a request for renewal support of a grant originally
awarded by the "expedited awards for novel research" program.
