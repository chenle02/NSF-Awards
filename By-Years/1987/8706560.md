Work is proposed in three areas of experimental atomic physics. 1) Continuation
of research on the structure of Rydberg atoms in a strong magnetic field.
Recently developed apparatus has increased the spectral resolution in this area
by a factor of one hundred, opening the way to the new study of the structure of
atoms in a very strong field regime, and of the transition to chaos in a quantum
system. 2) Continuation of research on the remeasurement of the Rydberg constant
in hydrogen by millimeter wave transitions in Rydberg states, with a design goal
for accuracy of 1 part in 1011. 3) Exploratory work on laser spectroscopy of
hydrogen in the micro Kelvin regime, with the goal of studying the properties of
hydrogen at low temperatures, and carrying out high resolution spectroscopy.
