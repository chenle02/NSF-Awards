0947771&lt;br/&gt;Kofinas&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this
exploratory research is to synthesize and process polymer thin films capable of
recognizing a variety of bacterial pathogens. Such flexible polymers could be
applied as an insert on food packaging products, or as a swab in a hospital
setting which, upon recognition of pathogens such as Escherichia coli, Listeria,
Salmonella, Campylobacter, Legionella, undergo a color change providing
manufacturers, consumers, and healthcare workers with a facile method for
identifying contamination. The proposed polymer thin films consist of a layered
structure which changes thickness upon recognition of small molecules,
"autoinducers", that bacteria secrete to communicate with each other. The
thickness change results in a color change which can be visually observed.
Sensors based on such block copolymer films will be unique in their ability to
selectively recognize bacterial signaling molecules without the need for
additional dyes or ligands. This will result in a radically different approach
for sensor fabrication, resulting in low-cost sensors for quality monitoring and
preservation of a large number of food products. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
education activities to be undertaken in this work are designed to educate and
train a next-generation engineers that embrace diversity as a strength. We have
several initiatives planned including specific programs that assist in
undergraduate and graduate education, graduate student mentoring, and training
of high school students from schools in minority-rich communities.
