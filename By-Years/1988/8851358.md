Experiments involving the analytical chemistry of materials (with special
emphasis on polymers) and surfaces are being introduced in the senior
Instrumental Anaylsis course using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.
Diffuse reflectance and photoacoustic detection is being used to illustrate the
analysis of opaque samples such as polymer fibers, coal, soil, and minerals. The
analytical characterization of surface species on polymer or metal surfaces is
being illustrated using specular reflectance and attenuated total reflectance.
Such experiments are illustrating the power of modern spectroscopic techniques
as applied to complex, heterogeneous systems and are exposing the students to
problems of a very practical "real world" nature. The basics of computer
controlled instrumentation is also being stressed. The experiments are using
spectral substraction and normalization software routines, as well as the
spectral libraries for the analysis of polymer mixtures. The grantee is matching
the award from non-Federal sources.
