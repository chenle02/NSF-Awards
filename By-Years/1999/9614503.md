ABSTRACT OPP-9614503 MAYEWSKI, PAUL UNIVERSITY OF NEW HAMPSHIRE This project
will support the Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2 (GISP2) Science Management Office
(SMO) and Science Steering Committee (SSC). The SMO will support the activities
of the GISP2 SSC (e.g. workshops, planning meetings, and coordination with
international science projects), publish a newsletter, promote correspondence of
GISP2 results at national meetings and between PIs, facilitate logistical
arrangements, and promote integration of GISP2 activities with other components
of the Arctic System Science (ARCSS) Program. The SSC will conduct planning
meetings for future ice coring research projects, appoint working groups to
conduct workshops for development of science plans for new initiatives, and
provide the ARCSS Program with an assessment on priorities for ice coring type
global change initiatives/projects in the Arctic that are developed through the
workshops.
