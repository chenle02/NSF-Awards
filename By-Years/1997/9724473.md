Karr 9724473 This proposal describes a shared confocal microscopy facility at
the University of Chicago that will open new lines of research for a broad range
of scientists. To meet the immediate and anticipated demands of the user base,
the proposed facility will include two stand-alone systems, a Zeiss LSM confocal
systems have complementary strengths, but both are capable of producing high-
resolution confocal images and are suitable for either fixed or living
specimens. Visualization of datasets will be accomplished using Macintosh
PowerPC and Silicon Graphics computers and associated software for image
analysis and display. Because biological imaging and visualization is still very
much a "hands on" enterprise and remains for the most part quite technical, the
proposed facility is designed to provide a "user friendly" environment to made
the technology accessible to individual investigators, their trainees and
students. To this end, the facility will be a staffed by an FTE whose mission
will be to train and assist researchers who wish to utilize the capabilities of
these powerful machines.
