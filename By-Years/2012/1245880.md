The project is one crucial building block in a comprehensive strategy to create
a highly functional cyberinfrastructure for researchers at the University of
Florida (UF) and their collaborators in the state, the nation, and the world.
Supporting collaborations means moving large amounts of data or providing
interactive access to data and processing capability from remote locations. The
University of Florida and its partner institutions in SSERCA (Sunshine State
Education and Research Computing Alliance) are creating a collaborative
framework on top of the Florida Lambda Rail (FLR) for geographically dispersed
research teams to easily transfer data between institutions, analyze the same
data shared via file systems mounted at their respective high-performance
computing resources, and share data with colleagues across the world, with
appropriate authentication and authorization as needed.

The award funds the acquisition of a switch capable of transmitting at the rate
of 100 Gbps to connect the UF campus research network to the FLR regional
network and to the newly built 100 GigE Internet2 network. Some of the ongoing
collaborative projects that will benefit directly from this high bandwidth
capacity are the following: 1) The Compact Muon Solenoid experiment at the Large
Hadron Collider, searching for the Higgs boson. 2) The Agricultural Model
Intercomparison and Improvement Project enhances the capability to accurately
model both long-term climate evolution and crop growth to allow decision makers
to prepare for ever changing weather patterns. 3) The Integrated Digitized
Biocollections is a project to create the infrastructure for a national resource
providing a searchable collection of data.
