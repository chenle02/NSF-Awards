*** Fetterman Excepting for sundials and a few other analog devices, to time is
to count. This is because the counting of events- -even random events--can yield
very accurate estimates of time. It is not surprising, therefore, that major
theories of timing by biological systems posit timers that work by accumulating
(counting) events generated by some kind of biological pacemaker. Dr. J. Gregor
Fetterman, in collaboration with Dr. Peter R. Killeen, of Arizona State
University, is examining how variation (error) in the pacemaker and in the
accumulator contribute to timing by such clock-accumulator systems-- the
pacemaker and the counter. They are exploiting the intimate relation of timing
to counting by studying parallel experimental tasks in each domain. They search
for invariances in the system under a variety of tasks that require temporal
perception and discrimination. They will embed these findings in a general model
of clock- counter error. Because of the key role of timing in all types of
behavior, the results of this research will contribute importantly to our
understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of behavior. ***
