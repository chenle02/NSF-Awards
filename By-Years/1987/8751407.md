The WGBH Educational Foundation and the NOVA production team will produce an
hour-long special program in the NOVA series on the remarkable scientific
response to Supernova 1987A, the most significant supernova to be observed since
1604. Responding rapidly to this unique opportunity, they will capture the
spirit of science in formation, through video and audio interviews with many of
the involved research scientists in their laboratories and observatories around
the world during the critical time period when there are as many questions as
answers about the event. They will continue to cover the scientific response
into the summer and early fall, including scientific meetings that are expected
to provide clarification and explanation of the supernova's behavior. They are
responding with insight and speed to a rare opportunity, and will match National
Science Foundation funds with $300,000 of their own production funds to produce
this program. NSF support will be used to insure that the coverage land
treatment of the event will be substantive and accurate, and rich enough in
detail to illustrate the processes of scientific discovery, research
cooperation, and debate and dialogue that leads to understanding. The resulting
program will be seen by the more than 12 million viewers of the NOVA series, as
well as by tens of thousands of classrooms in high schools and colleges.
Educational materials will be produced to accompany the program. An award of
$50,000 for FY87 is recommended.
