One of the most exciting discoveries in marine geology in the last decade is
the active hydrothermal systems at mid-ocean ridges where massive thermal
springs are flowing out of the ocean floor. Scientists are now attempting to
learn more about the details of these systems - what chemical reactions occur
within these systems and what volumes of water are involved and for what
duration. To learn the answers to these questions, the Ocean Drilling Program
has set a high priority on drilling these systems. Von Herzen and Cann will
design equipment to measure physical parameters (temperature, pressure, flow
velocity, electrical conductivity) and obtain fluid samples in holes drilled in
hydrothermal upflow zones of the sea floor.
