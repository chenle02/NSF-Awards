The research to be undertaken includes: ultrastructural studies of solid
polymers and polymer composites including dislocations, disclinations, and grain
boundaries; thermodynamics and kinetics of phase transitions; the organization
of macromolecules near surfaces and interfaces; molecular mechanisms of plastic
deformation; and morphology of synthetic poly(peptides).
