This research project investigates the tight integration of program generation
facilities into typed languages. Present program generation technology can be
classified as either integrated with the language environment, as are macros in
Lisp, or external to the language, as are yacc and lex for C. Within language-
integrated generators, the taxonomy can be further refined into tightly-
integrated generators, exemplified by reflective systems, and loosely-integrated
generators, such as macro preprocessors. Tight integration of generators into
typed languages gives rise to a number of problems to which solutions must be
found. However, the benefits of increased expressiveness, efficiency,
productivity, reusability, reliability, and quality makes research into solving
these problems worthwhile. If the project is successful, it will provide a
clearer semantics to a reflective ML-like language tailored for building
generator systems, illustrate how such a reflective language can be restricted
to maintain the invariants of strong typing, design a meta-programming system to
prevent variable capture or design hiding, and build a programming environment
where generated code can be seamlessly integrated with code produced in more
traditional ways.
