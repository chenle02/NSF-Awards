This exploratory psycholinguistic research will focus on the developing
production system in 3- to 8-year-old children with an emphasis on relative
clauses; it also includes comparisons with adults. Previous research shows that
children as young as 3 correctly encode relative clauses, but production of
different types of relative clauses reveals variation in children's control of
associated production processes. Two experiments will be used to consider how
planning processes contribute to that variation. Experiment 1 will use a
production task in which the participant describes for a blindfolded
experimenter a toy that was used in a story. Utterances will be digitally
recorded, transcribed, and then analyzed to see where production difficulties --
errors, pauses, and repairs -- occur. These production difficulties may reflect
underlying planning efforts. Experiment 2 will develop a new method for
eliciting relative clauses, combining a priming task for adults with an
elicitation task for children. Participants will observe narrated and animated
stories on a computer and then answer questions.

This research has implications for models of language production, through its
explorations of how a developing performance system interacts with the knowledge
that the system operates on. It will also enable language acquisitionists to
better distinguish the effects of this dynamic system from effects of
grammatical and lexical knowledge. This has implications across domains of
cognitive development, where research often relies on children's speech.
Children's speech is also crucial in many applied ways, for example, in the
court system, in resolving interpersonal conflict, and school readiness. Better
understanding of the multiple and interacting influences on early production is
therefore important. Finally, the project will provide research opportunities
for undergraduates in Maine and build the research capacity of the University of
Southern Maine.
