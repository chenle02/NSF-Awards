This project is to upgrade and enhance the current IC laboratory course for both
undergraduates and graduate students. The university and several industrial
sponsors have provided support for the current laboratory in the form of
personnel and donated equipment. All the equipment required to fabricate metal
gate CMOS circuits is available; however, the industry technology has migrated
from metal-gate to silicon- gate CMOS technology. The equipment to be acquired
through this funding will allow the transition to this new technology and is
currently not available as donated items, but essential for the planned upgrade.
