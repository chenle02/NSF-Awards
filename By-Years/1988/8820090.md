The interaction between surface evaporation/evapotranspiration and atmospheric
boundary layer processes constitutes a research area of considerable interest
and need for both atmospheric and water management disciplines. For example, the
World Climate Research Program emphasizes the urgency of extensive observational
work in this area and it is recognized that such information is an important
next step in improving climate models. One of the most carefully conducted field
programs ever attempted to study surface moisture fluxes in complex terrain,
known as the Hydrological and Atmospheric Pilot Experiment (HAPEX), was
completed in the Spring and Summer of 1986. The Principal Investigator
participated in the planning and execution of this experiment. The field phase
of the HAPEX was very successful and the Principal Investigator will continue
his analysis of this rich data set. Aircraft and surface-based mesonetwork data
will be used to examine the contributions of various physical mechanisms (e.g.
free and forced thermals, shear modified convection, cloud controlled
turbulence, surface inhomogeneity and local circulation) to boundary layer
fluxes. Different contributions to the flux will be related to such factors as
the background synoptic conditions and overall atmospheric stability.
