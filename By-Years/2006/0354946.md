This project focuses on the study of polarized electron collisions with chiral,
or handed molecules, simple diatomic molecules, and heavy noble gas atoms. The
experiments address physics questions about the dynamics of electron-molecule
and electron-atom scattering, particularly with regard to electron-spin-
dependent effects and the collisional distribution of angular momentum. They
also provide important information for applications requiring knowledge of
electron-molecule and electron-atom scattering cross sections and the modeling
of plasma processes. Improved sources of polarized electrons will also be
developed. One of the goals of this work is to provide both research and
industrial laboratories with turnkey polarized beams for use in, e.g., magnetic
materials analysis. Broader impacts involve education of graduate, undergraduate
and high school students as well as recruitment of under-represented groups and
outreach to the community.
