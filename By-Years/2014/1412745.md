This award is to probe the internal structures and magnetic properties of
ultracool dwarfs (UCDs) using precise timing of radio flares observed with the
Arecibo radio telescope. UCDs are unusual objects which straddle the star-planet
boundary. This group includes the lowest mass stars and brown dwarfs, and UCDs
have temperatures ranging from about 1600-2700 K. Like many gas-giant planets
and brown dwarfs, these relatively cool objects are thought to have dust clouds,
and may generate magnetic fields through a rotating, convecting and electrically
conducting fluid (also known as a 'magnetic dynamo'). Short-term periodic
outbursts are observed at radio wavelengths, and in some cases their period
decreases over time, sometimes very abruptly. The PI plans to analyze data
showing these abrupt decreases in order to test models about the objects?
interior structure, and also may be applicable to brown dwarfs and giant gas
planets modeling. The PI plans to involve undergraduate female and
underrepresented minority students, and provide them with well-structured
opportunities to gain experience with plasma physics, astrophysics,
observational techniques, advanced data analysis and instrumentation.

The planned radio detection of the UCDs provides a direct means to measure the
field strength, topology and stability of low mass stars. Preliminary work by
the PI shows that flaring period of two UCDs have been steadily decreasing, and
that phase jumps have been observed a few months apart. After each jump, the
period shortens significantly. This work will test whether it can be explained
by differential rotation of the stars, in a manner analogous to sunspots in
other main sequence stars.
