This award supports the PI, Dr. Charlotte Elster, a post doctoral student, and a
graduate student from the Ohio University in a collaboration with Walter Gl`ckle
of the Department of Theoretical Physics at the Ruhr University in Bochum. The
collaboration will study the properties of very light nuclei (2H, 3He, 4He) and
the reaction mechanism for elastic scattering and break-up reactions at
intermediate energies (100 MeV and higher). The theoretical formulation is based
on a scheme that describes scattering in systems containing small numbers of
nucleons. The numerical realization and an internal check of convergence with
respect to higher order terms will also be undertaken. The results of the
collaboration should provide interesting insights into the reaction mechanism or
light nuclei collisions and lay firm ground to test various physical
assumptions, such as the application of free nucleon-nucleon forces in these
reactions and the properties of ground- state wave functions of light nuclei.
