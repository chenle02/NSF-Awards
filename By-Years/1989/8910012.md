The objectives of this project are: a) to build an analytical model to predict
the damping capacity of a lap joint system consisting of composite adherends and
a viscoelastic adhesive, and b) to carry out a systematic experimental study to
verify the analytical predictions and to establish a data base on the damping
capacity of various adhesively bonded structural joints. The proposed analytical
model is an extension of a previous model formulated by the investigator to
include adherends made of composite materials. The model will aid a designer to
predict the system damping capacity of any single lap bonded joint system. The
experimental activity involves testing several lap joint systems to compare
experimental results with theoretical predictions. Next, the above experiments
will be repeated on other types of bonded systems such as double-lap and butt
jointed systems. The experimental data base for different configurations will
also enable the designer to choose the right configuration from the damping
point of view.//
