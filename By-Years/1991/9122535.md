At a recent Microelectronics and Information Processing Systems (MIPS) Advisory
Committee meeting, it was recommended that a Signal Processing Workshop be held
to meet several goals. The Division Director of MIPS pointed out to the Advisory
Committee that NSF needed help from the research community in developing both a
short term and a long term vision for the area of signal processing. The short
term vision would identify promising areas of research having high pay-offs in
terms of research results and industrial relevances. The long term vision would
examine general trends in signal processing, and determine if investments should
be made in these areas. This proposal is designed to address the above needs. A
side benefit will be to introduce the new Circuits and Signal Processing Program
Director to key people in a broad range of areas of signal processing.
