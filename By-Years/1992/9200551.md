This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
Program, will apply helium diffraction and reactive molecular beam scattering
techniques to the study of the defect oxide surface. This combination of
structural and reaction probes will provide detailed information about the
relationship between the nature and structure of defects on oxide surfaces and
their reaction properties. Initial stages of metallization on these model oxide
surfaces will also be probed, providing a clearer understanding of the growth of
metal films on insulating substrates. The information provided by this work will
add significantly to our understanding of metal-support interactions in
catalysis and electronic device manufacture, and to the understanding of the
reactivity of these complex oxide surfaces. %%% The structure and reactivity of
the surfaces of oxides is a relatively unexplored area of surface science, with
major implications for the understanding of a variety of surface mediated
processes. This research project will extend the use of very surface sensitive
atomic and molecular beam scattering probes to the study of the oxide surface.
The information gained from this work will help to develop the relationship
between structure and reactivity on these technologically important surfaces.
