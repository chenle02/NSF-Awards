This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will build and test a
lithium cell that will be integrated with an all-solid-state modulator to
produce an efficient, 13.5 nm, EUV source, for next generation, sub-70 nm,
lithography. To date, a reliable, long-lived, lithium-based discharge cell has
not been developed, despite the considerable advantages such a development would
engender. These advantages are: (1) lithium will be four times as efficient as
xenon; (2) increased efficiency will greatly alleviate waste heat removal; (3) a
thin coating of liquid lithium will protect discharge electrodes and result in
longer-lived electrodes and; (4) lithium heat pipes which can very effectively
remove heat from the electrodes can be easily incorporated into the design. This
project aims to complete a design of a lithium cell that will be fabricated and
tested in Phase II.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EUV sources have a significant market
in the semiconductor industry for next generation lithography with annual sales
of $200 million, starting in CY 2006. The estimate is based on the market for
excimer lasers used in current generation DUV lithography. &lt;br/&gt;
