Symposium on dynamic failure and thin-film
mechanics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The California Institute of Technology
requests funding for a symposium&lt;br/&gt;on "Dynamic Failure" and "Thin Film
Mechanics," to be held January&lt;br/&gt;16th-18th, 2003. This symposium will
assess the state-of-the-art in&lt;br/&gt;research issues in these fields and
their impact on engineering&lt;br/&gt;applications. The symposium will feature
25 invited speakers who are&lt;br/&gt;established and emerging leaders in
Mechanics, Materials Science and&lt;br/&gt;Engineering, Mathematics, Applied
Physics, Bioengineering, and&lt;br/&gt;Geomechanics and will include minorities
and women from academia,&lt;br/&gt;industry and research laboratories.
Presentations will occur in 5-6&lt;br/&gt;sessions, none in parallel, to
facilitate close interaction of&lt;br/&gt;participants. The meeting will
culminate in a panel discussion to&lt;br/&gt;summarize the state-of-the-art in
the field and identify research&lt;br/&gt;opportunities. The presentations and
discussion summaries will be&lt;br/&gt;collected in a bound volume of the
Journal of the Mechanics and Physics&lt;br/&gt;of Solids (JMPS). JMPS editors
have also allocated 375 pages in the&lt;br/&gt;journal for material from this
symposium. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
