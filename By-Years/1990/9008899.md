The object of this research is to conduct femtosecond measurements in bulk InGaP
to gain experience of subpicosecond measurement techniques to obtain preliminary
results for the preparation of a proposal to study the dynamics of carriers in
InGaP based multiple quantum wells at atmospheric and high pressure. A model
will be developed to evaluate the effect of pressure on the relaxation of
carriers in the InGaP based multiple quantum wells. The study of the
subpicosecond dynamics of semiconductors at high pressure is an area that has so
far not been explored and likely to contribute important information on these
materials. A detailed proposal will be submitted to NSF Research Initiation
Award Program at the completion of the proposed preliminary studies.
