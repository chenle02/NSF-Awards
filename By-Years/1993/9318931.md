9318931 Tombrello The damage left by MeV ions in electronic materials is
important in many respects. The ability to perform materials modifications such
as deep implantations into III- V semiconductors, and to remove residual crystal
damage without disturbing the electronic modification and compositional mixing
that were the intent of the ion bombardment depends in an essential way on
knowledge of the processes that created the damage and the resulting character
of the irradiated material. The proposed research focuses on these basic issues.
Our approach is to produce ion damage in crystalline samples of electronic
materials (insulators, compound semiconductors, highTc superconductors, and a
few special metals) and to study the damage distributions by a variety of
techniques; for example, the use of channeling RBS to deduce the track radii and
damage distributions. We have developed a model of the track-damage process that
shows considerable promise; some of the initial observations will test this
model's validity. %%% The properties of electronic materials can be modified in
controlled ways by bombarding them with high energy(MeV) ions. In some cases
this irradiation is used to implant foreign atoms deep in the material to tailor
its local electronic properties. In other cases the damage itself may cause
beneficial changes, for example, improving the current- carrying capacity of
superconductors. This research project expects to increase our basic
understanding of the damage produced by such bombardments so that we can design,
and more efficiently realize desired modifications of electronic materials for
gaining improvements in the general performance of advanced devices and
integrated circuits used in computing, information processing, and tele
communications. ***
