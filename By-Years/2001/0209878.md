Digital Government: Workshop on Election Systems Standards

This workshop is a logical successor to a Presidentially-mandated workshop on
on-line voting, held in October 2000. The extremely close national election in
November of 2000 elicited great interest in the voting process within the
research community.

An outgrowth of that interest was a joint effort by Cal Tech and MIT to develop
a prototype voting system, in the process surfacing many technical, legal, and
social issues. This proposed workshop will build on that joint effort, to
examine current voting systems standards, and develop possible research topics
related to those standards.
