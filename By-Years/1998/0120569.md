This project will intercompare three techniques that focus on air-sea gas
exchange of dimethyl sulfide (DMS) to help evaluate the utility and accuracy of
flux measurements in the field. Accurate measurements of DMS flux are important
in estimating the oceanic source of reduced sulfur to the atmosphere and
calculating the uptake of CO2 by the oceans. This research is important for
climate change research since DMS can lead to sulfate aerosols that in turn can
lead to cloud formation. The P.I. will use a gradient flux in-situ method to
measure DMS flux and compare their results with several eddy correlation methods
being used by other researchers from a highly instrumented platform in the North
Sea off the Netherlands.
