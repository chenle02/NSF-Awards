Non-technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award from the Division of
Materials Research to Buffalo State College supports experimental research on a
new class of materials which exhibit ferroelectric and ferromagnetic behavior.
The principal investigator and undergraduate students prepare thin films using
an electron-beam deposition method and study the thin film growth parameters to
improve the quality and the physical properties of the materials. The research
focuses on improving the quality of thin films and understanding the role of
lattice strains and external stimuli on the physical properties of multiferroic
thin films. The project support 6 to 9 summer research students with a
substantial fraction of students coming from underrepresented minorities (24%)
and women (60%). The research provides the students with a valuable research
experience that they would not otherwise gain in the classroom
setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award from the Division of Materials Research supports experimental research on
the multiferroic RFe2O4 (R = Y, Dy to Lu) family of compounds with geometrically
frustrated structures. The project studies the role of the growth conditions,
lattice strains, annealing, oxygen stoichiometry, and impurities on the physical
and multiferroic properties of polycrystalline and epitaxial RFe2O4 thin films
deposited by a reactive electron-beam deposition method. The principal
investigator and undergraduate students at Buffalo State College investigate the
optical and dielectric properties, spin-charge-lattice couplings, and structure-
property relationship in the RFe2O4 thin films using optical and dielectric
spectroscopy. The objective is to offer new insight into the magnetoelectric
coupling of RFe2O4. In particular, the research focuses on improving the quality
of thin films and understanding the role of lattice strains and external stimuli
on the physical properties of multiferroic thin films. The results will be
important to advancing the multiferroic thin film research. The project supports
6 to 9 summer research students with a substantial fraction of students coming
from underrepresented minorities and women. The research provides the students
with a valuable research experience and will also prepare them for jobs and the
graduate studies.
