9412383 Huang This research will further explore the rich and potentially
fruitful interplay between number theory and algebraic geometry to investigate
computational problems in number theory, with emphasis on: discrete logarithms
over various groups, which is a fundamental problem of cryptographic
significance; polynomial congruences modulo primes, including the univariate and
multivariate cases; and finding small nonresidues in finite fields; develop
efficient algorithms for computing with curves over finite fields, with emphasis
on fundamental arithmetical problems on curves which are important for
applications in computational number theory, cryptography and coding theory;
apply the results obtained to public-key cryptography, coding theory, and other
areas as well. ***
