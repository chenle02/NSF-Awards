The investigator plans to study three classes of problems: first, the perturbed
Gelfand problem and its related ones from Combustion theory. The emphasis will
be on the complete description of the exact number solutions of these nonlinear
elliptic partial differential equations and the understanding of more complex
combustion models; second, the investigator wants to pursue a better
understanding of the classical Lotka-Volterra models with diffusion. These
models, though deceptively simple-looking, involve tremendous mathematical
difficulty. The investigator has been trying to introduce new ideas and develop
new methods to solve some open problems in this field; The third class of
problem that the investigator will study is the cross-diffusion system, which is
a strongly-coupled nonlinear parabolic system. The investigator, in a series of
joint work with Wei-Ming Ni, has introduced powerful new methods that can yield
very detailed information about the steady-states of these systems. The
investigator plans to study the global time existence of this cross-diffusion
system, along with the stability of various steady-states. The investigator
hopes that the work on this cross-diffusion system can be instrumental in
understanding general strongly-coupled reaction-diffusion systems.

Mathematical problems from biology and combustion theory are not only
mathematically challenging, but also practically important. To be illustrative,
let us consider the following ecological problem: suppose that two different
species originally live in two separate regions and both of them can survive.
Now if we connect these two regions and let these two species be mixed together
in the new region. Besides the existing competitions among the same species,
there appears the new competition between two different species. A basic
questions is: how can these two species manage coexistence under such new
situation? If assuming that these two species are moving randomly, then the
problem can be modeled by the classical Lotka-Volterra model, and this model is
covered by the second class of problems which the investigator proposes to
study. On the other hand, when two species are competing for resources to
survive, it is not very reasonable to just add diffusion to the model since
individuals are not moving around randomly. Instead, they are moving to places
to their advantage, e.g., species prefer places with less population pressures
created by competitors. Based on this second assumption, some biologists
proposed the cross-diffusion system, i.e., the third class of problems which the
investigator will pursue. The investigator hopes that such mathematical work not
only yields interesting mathematical results, but also strengthens the
understanding of real world phenomena in various branches of science.
