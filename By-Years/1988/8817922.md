This research project explores the theory of structural phase transformations
in solids, emphasizing the formation of ordered intermetallic precipitates
developed by decomposition reactions. Three separate phenomena are studied
theoretically, the chemical ordering reactions that lead to intermetallic
phases; elastic interactions that determine the initial shape of precipitates,
and coarsening that leads to the final precipitate distribution. Extensive
computer simulation of microstructural evolution guides the development of the
analytic theory.
