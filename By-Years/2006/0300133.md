H.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Motivic
cohomology and arithmetic geometry&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
investigator is working on two projects.&lt;br/&gt;On the one hand, he tries to
extend his results on&lt;br/&gt;Weil-etale cohomology and special values of zeta
functions&lt;br/&gt;from smooth projective varieties over finite
fields&lt;br/&gt;to general varieties over finite fields, and to
varieties&lt;br/&gt;over local fields. The other project is the
examination&lt;br/&gt;of properties of the de Rham-Witt complex and
topological&lt;br/&gt;cyclic homology of smooth varieties over
complete&lt;br/&gt;discrete valuation rings. Topological trace homology
TR&lt;br/&gt;has a Frobenius operator, a Galois action and a
filtration&lt;br/&gt;analog to Fontaine's functor. The investigator
wants&lt;br/&gt;to exploit this structure to construct etale and crystalline
&lt;br/&gt;cohomology, and to apply this to arithmetic
problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;In arithmetic algebraic geometry,
&lt;br/&gt;solutions of polynomial equations are studied. &lt;br/&gt;Even though
this field is more than two thousand years old,&lt;br/&gt;it turned out recently
that there is a variety of applications &lt;br/&gt;to cryptography. One method
to study a solution set of polynomials&lt;br/&gt;is to associate invariants
called cohomology and zeta functions&lt;br/&gt;to it, and then study those
invariants instead.&lt;br/&gt;Since the invariants are defined in very different
ways, finding&lt;br/&gt;relationships between them allows to translate knowledge
on&lt;br/&gt;one into knowledge on the other. The investigator
studies&lt;br/&gt;the relationship between zeta functions and a new
cohomology,&lt;br/&gt;called Weil-etale cohomology, on the one hand, and a
new&lt;br/&gt;invariant called topological cyclic homology on the other
hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
