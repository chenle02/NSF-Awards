This National Science Foundation award provides partial support for the 51st
Spring Topology and Dynamical Systems Conference (STDC) to be held at New Jersey
City University, in Jersey City, NJ, March 8-11, 2017. The primary purpose of
this previously supported conference series, and in particular of the proposed
conference, is to bring together researchers across subfields of Topology, and
across generations, to share the latest developments in Topology and related
fields. Conferences in this series have been a venue for announcement of
numerous landmark results in Topology. The organizing committee will ensure the
representation of graduate students, young researchers, women, and researchers
from underrepresented groups. All sessions will host a mix of talks by
established specialists on one hand and graduate students and early career
mathematicians on the other. Talks will be centered on recent advances and
techniques, and the future of the discipline. In keeping with tradition,
conference proceedings will be published by the peer-reviewed journal Topology
Proceedings. Additionally invited talks will be video recorded and shared
online. This way, the latest developments in Topology will be broadly
shared.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will consist of six special
sessions: Continuum Theory (dedicated to Sam B. Nadler), Dynamical Systems
(dedicated to Jim Rogers), Set-Theoretic Topology, Geometric Group Theory,
Geometric Topology, and Topology and Computer Science. There will also be a
workshop on Topology and Computer Science geared primarily towards graduate
students. The Mary Ellen Rudin Young Researcher Award winner will be formally
announced at the conference, and the recipient will be a plenary speaker. More
