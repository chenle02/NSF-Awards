This research will develop algorithms which estimate and control the error in
numerical approximations of initial/boundary-value problems in nonlinear path-
dependent continua. The research will focus on the development and
implementation of adaptive finite- element methods for the analysis of strain
localization and failure in viscoplastic solids. Specific applications will be
implemented for the case of porous ductile solids under conditions which include
the generation of new surfaces due to local material failure by void
coalescence. The development of such adaptive finite-element models could have a
major impact on the numerical simulation of many phenomena which include
progressive failure through localization of plastic flow such as the ballistic
impact, the perforation and penetration of solids, crashworthiness, metal
forming and manufacturing processes.
