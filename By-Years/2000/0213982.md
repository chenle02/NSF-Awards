This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result in an
innovative, technologically advanced, imaging system-with the potential of
counting of individual photons. The imaging system will be a compact avalanche-
gain, charge-coupled device, and digital camera. The innovation will offer high
photo-response from the deep ultraviolet to the near infrared in very Low Light
Level, as well as photonic light conditions. In addition, the Photon Counting
Camera will present solid-state reliability without typical intensifier imaging
tube limitations, such as, image burn-in and blooming. A possible research,
military, law enforcement, or "home land security" application for the Photon
Counting Camera will be "black-on-black" detection that is when faint objects
are difficult to discriminate from the background.

This far-reaching technology will also be beneficial for many non-military
applications, such as astronomy, bio- and chemical-luminescence, microscopy, and
beam imaging. Furthermore, the innovation will offer significant cost savings
and enhance multi-spectral imaging performance, compared to conventional
intensifier imaging systems. In short, the Photon Counting Camera will have the
most impact where MHz readout speeds (real-time or TV speeds) and lowest
possible noise are required.
