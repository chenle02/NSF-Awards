Cretaceous (Campanian) depositional sequences in the Mesaverde escarpment of
the southern Big Horn Basin (Wyoming) appear to have been deposited at 100,000
year intervals. Studies of several sections suggest that despite their high
frequency nature, the sequences contain elements of sequence architecture,
including transgressive surfaces (ravinements), flooding surfaces, thin
onlapping (transgressive) deposits, and downlapping (regressive) deposits. This
hypothesis will be investigated by 1) collecting field data, 2) constraining
numerical simulations against the field data, and 3) returning to the field to
check model predictions against the field evidence. In step 1, strata
thicknesses and grain sizes in these sequences will be measured along a series
of 30 meter sections along shore-normal and shore-parallel transects. In step 2,
the data will be used to modify and extend existing numerical models for facies
and sequence formation. Existing techniques for 1-D forward modeling of stratal
successions will be extended. Depositional systems (lithofacies assemblages)
will be simulated in 2 dimensions by "chaining" 1-D synthetic stratigraphic
columns. Cyclic sedimentation ("parasequence stacking") will be simulated by
varying basin parameters such as water depth and sedimentation rate. In step 3,
predictions of the models will be compared against further field studies.
