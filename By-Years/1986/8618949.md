The capability to remove heat dissipated in integrated circuitry is a highly
critical factor in the successful design and operation of the next generation of
general propose mainframe computers. It is virtually a certainty that some sort
ofliquid immersion-cooling scheme will be adopted. However, there are many
candidate schemes, and it is still open as to which scheme will be used. The
present proposal is aimed at providing information about one such scheme--the
impingement of multiple jets, with the heat transfer being removed by boiling.
The expectation is that the experimental results will be fully sufficient is
adopted.
