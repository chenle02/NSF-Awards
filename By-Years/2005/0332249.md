This proposal is to support a workshop to elicit technical and policy
assumptions, determine the state-of-the-art in radio hardware and software
technologies, and identify what the fundamental and practical limits of future
technological alternatives are - both in short term and long term. The result of
the workshop will be a report covering the topics considered and recommendations
of actions for NSF and the research community.
