This award supports the research of Professor N. Bergeron to work in
combinatorics. He intends to investigate descent algebras of finite Coxeter
groups with a view to results about cyclic homology, Schubert polynomials with a
view to proving Stanley's conjecture and graded modules of harmonic polynomials
to see how they are related to the Macdonald polynomials. The research is in the
general area of combinatorics. Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods
to study how discrete collections of objects can be organized. And, so it is
extremely important to modern communications, for example the design of large
networks as in telephone systems and the design of algorithms in computer
science.
