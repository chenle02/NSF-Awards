Taphonomic alteration of foraminifera from Quaternary siliciclastic deposits in
the northern Gulf of California will be quantified through field and laboratory
studies of test resistance to abrasion, dissolution, bioerosion, and transport.
The close juxtaposition of Holocene and Pleistocene deposits will allow the
evaluation of those processes involved in the transformation from living
foraminiferal biotas through near-surface sediment assemblages to preserved
fossil assemblages. The benefits from such an approach include: 1) The
identification of test morphotypes which predominate within assemblages
accumulating under particular environmental regimes. 2) Testing of the
preservability of taphonomic signatures. 3) When combined with data on the
relative abundances of living species and test production rates, the
determination of the relative contributions of population dynamics and
taphonomic processes to the formation of sediment assemblages. 4)The
determination of test characteristics which confer resistance to destruction has
important evolutionary implications and should lead to the better understanding
of the morphological constraints on inhabiting particular environments. The
above information will be integrated with that obtained previously from Holocene
carbonate environments at Jamaica, resulting in the development of broadly
encompassing taphofacies models for microfossil assemblages. As these models are
based upon test morphotypes, rather than particular species, they should be
applicable to numerous environments and time intervals.
