9453664 Navarro The El Paso Urban Systemic Initiative (EPUSI) has as its core a
vision that seeks to provide the mathematics and science fundamentals which will
permit all students to participate fully in a technological society and enable a
significantly greater number of El Paso's students to pursue careers in
mathematics, science, engineering, and technology. EPUSI will unite the three
school districts, El Paso Independent, Ysleta and Socorro, that serve over 85%
of all of the children in the El Paso region, in the development and
implementation of a standards-based, K-12 science, mathematics and technology
curriculum appropriate to meet the needs of El Paso's culturally-diverse,
bilingual student population. The curriculum will be developed by teams of
curriculum supervisors, teachers and science and mathematics professionals.
Through joint effort, the districts will provide teacher enhancement, implement
technology to support the new curriculum, align policies and redirect their
resources to support EPUSI. The Initiative will be managed by El Paso
Collaborative for Academic Excellence in concert with the three school
districts. Science and mathematics professionals from the University of Texas El
Paso (UTEP) will help design the curriculum and provide school level coaching,
mentoring and other support. Programs developed by the Comprehensive Regional
Center for Minorities UTEP, will be incorporated within the EPUSI.
