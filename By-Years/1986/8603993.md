This research will evaluate prestrain effects on constitutive equations for
plastic flow behavior of materials. This research investigation determines the
effects of dynamic compressive pre-strain on the subsequent plastic flow
behavior of metals. Experimental studies will be carried out in two fcc metals
(6061-T6 aluminum, a fairly rate insensitive materials, and annealed OFHC
copper, a rate sensitive materials) to understand the micro-structural changes
that are associated with dynamic compressive pre-strain by means of plate impact
and split Hopkinson bar (SHB) experiments. The results will be coupled to a
state variable based constitutive model for describing the observed plastic flow
behaviors in these two materials.
