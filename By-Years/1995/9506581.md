9506581 Karato The PI will perform mechanical property experiments on minerals
that exist in the transition zone and lower mantle of Earth, and analogues of
those materials. He will study the strengths of lower mantle and transition zone
minerals using their relative strengths as generated from the non-hydrostatic
stress state in high pressure apparatus, and from a further study of analogue
materials that have similar structures to the real minerals at lower pressures.
He will also investigate the effects of grain size reduction on rheology with
application to grain fining due to phase transitions within slabs at depth in
the Earth. ****
