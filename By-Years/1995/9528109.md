ABSTRACT 9528109 Wells A request has been made for funds to help defray
registration charges and transportation costs for seven leading US combustion
researchers who will give invited talks at a Symposium On The Formation And
Control Of Combustion Generated Pollution. This symposium is part of the 1995
International Chemical Congress of Pacific Basin Societies to be held on 17-22
December 1995 in Honolulu, Hawaii. The aim this conference is to bring together
experts from the Pacific Basin Countries to discuss many of the issues arising
from combustion generated pollution. Specific sessions will deal with: (1)
Fundamentals of pollution generation and destruction, (2) Laboratory and field
measurements and (3) Novel control strategies.
