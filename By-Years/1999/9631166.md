9631166 Gallagher A number of chemical reactions occur in cells affected by the
loss of oxygen and by reoxygenation which occurs upon resumption of blood flow.
One by-product of these cellular reactions is the formation of a highly reactive
form of oxygen, known as an oxygen free radical. Oxygen free radicals produce
alterations in DNA, the genetic material, which may affect the ability of cells
to carry out their normal biological functions. Since a single change in DNA
structure may be harmful, it is not surprising that a diverse array of
mechanisms for repairing DNA evolved at the cellular level. The experiments
outlined in this proposal are designed to examine an enzyme, redoxyendonuclease,
that repairs oxidative damage to DNA. The levels of this enzyme will be
quantified in the oxygen-deprived (ischemic) kidney and the reoxygenated
reperfused) rat kidney and compared to the levels of this protein in the
undamaged tissue. Specifically, the tissue will be examined for 1) the level of
the oxidative DNA repair enzyme activity; 2) the cellular repair of oxidized DNA
damage; and 3) the levels of specific oxidized DNA base damages formed during
the ischemic or reoxygenanon event. Results from these experiments will provide
new insights into the regulation of the cellular mechanisms that repair
oxidative DNA damage and the ability of tissues to withstand conditions of
oxidant stress.
