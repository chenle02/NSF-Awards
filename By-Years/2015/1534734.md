Non-technical abstract: At the heart of electronic devices lies silicon, a
semiconductor material that can be made pure enough for high performance and is
amenable to mass production. While such circuitry is continually improving,
silicon is unable to exhibit quantum phenomena required for complete solutions
in weather prediction, genomics, and secure encryption. A new class of
materials, the so-called topological insulators, holds the promise to realize
such phenomena and revolutionize computing. Topological insulators are, in
theory, non-metallic in the interior of the material but behave like a metal at
the surface. In addition, the quantum character of these metallic electrons can
be switched, which is the basic information processing function. While known
topological insulators demonstrate the metallic surface state, these materials
have not been made pure enough for incorporating into electronic devices.
Specifically, they are not yet insulating in the interior. This project will
seek to find new topological insulators and to engineer them to levels of purity
needed for an insulating interior and satisfy the performance demands of
electronic circuits. The project will impact the electronics industry as well as
train graduates skilled in the computational and experimental techniques of this
new class of materials.

Technical abstract: The goal of the project is to create topological insulator
materials that are pure enough in the bulk to exhibit true insulating behavior.
Topological insulators are found among high-Z atom containing semiconductors
with band gaps small enough that the spin-orbit coupling related to the large
Z-number can invert the conduction and valence band. These materials must also
possess spatial inversion symmetry for the relevant orbitals. The project will
explore candidate materials classes among pseudo-binary and pyrochlore-related
structures containing heavy metals such as Ir, Re, and Os. Materials synthesis
by solid state chemistry techniques will be guided by simulations based on
density functional theory. Promising candidate materials will be synthesized in
single crystal form by appropriate methods including vapor transport, zone
refinement, and growth from flux. Crystalline specimens will be studied with
angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy and conventional charge transport
techniques. Prototype transistor devices will be fabricated on a smaller subset
of these systems. The results at each measurement stage will be fed back to the
theory and synthesis efforts.
