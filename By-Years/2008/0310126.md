0310126&lt;br/&gt;Hole&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to
establish the existence or absence of mafic-ultramafic roots to batholiths and
whether such roots can reconcile the fundamentally basaltic nature of mantle
magmatism with the intermediate average composition of the crust. Two hypotheses
are considered: 1) that the dense ultramafic residue founders into the mantle
leaving the intermediate crustal compositions above, or 2) the residue exists
below the Moho and is seismologically indistinct from mantle peridotite. The PIs
will use a combination of petrology, geochemistry and geochronology on the
plutons of the Central Coast Range Batholith to track changes in source, depth
of origin through time and seismic and gravity data to image the present state
of the lithosphere. The Central Coast Range Batholith (CCRB) in British Columbia
is a very good location for this study. It is a very large batholith which is
relatively young and has not had a protracted tectonic history. It's rugged
topography gives access to depth profiles of 20 to 25
km.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
