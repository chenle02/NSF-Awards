The focus of this research is the development of enantioselective carbon-carbon
bond forming reactions involving Ni-catalyzed hydrocyanation, hydroformylation
and hydrovinylation. Systematic steric and electronic ligand tuning will lead to
the development of improved catalysts for the production of compounds compounds
with interesting biological properties as well as polymer intermediates. With
this new award, the Synthetic Organic program is supporting the research of Dr.
T.V. Rajanbabu of the Department of Chemistry at Ohio State University.
Professor RajanBabu will focus his work on developing catalytic carbon-carbon
bond making reactions. Hydrocyanation, hydroformylation and hydrvinylation
processes will be examined. The methodology allows for the catalytic,
stereoselective incorporation of inexpensive carbon and hydrogen sources into
the production of important chemical intermediates.
