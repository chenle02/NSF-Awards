Significant resources are devoted to R&D on robotics across industry and
government agencies. This project aims to (1) understand how the efforts can be
coordinated to optimize the impact of such efforts, (2) build educational
resources where best practice is used across all institutions in the US to
ensure access to the best human capital, and t(3) study best practice for
transition of results for exploitation. Finally, resources are provided to
disseminate information about the impact of robotics to a broad community.

A national robotics initiative is launched for the creation of basic
technologies that grow the economy, secure healthcare for future generations and
provide support to first responders. It is essential from a societal perspective
that the use of such resources is optimized to maximize the impact in terms of
economic growth, job creation and provide services to the citizen. The
organization of a Robotics-VO provides the required infrastructure support and
coordination to ensure effective use of resources.
