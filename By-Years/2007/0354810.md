The PIs have requested a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) as the
first stage in the development of an adaptive sampling algorithms tool which
would enable an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to determine the best
locations, routes, and times to collect scientific data. The PIs believe that
adaptive sampling algorithms have the potential to enable rapid, high fidelity
mapping and tracking of chemical and biological plumes, fronts, small scale
circulation phenomena, and other oceanographic features of scientific interest.
The key feature of these algorithms is that sampling strategies are determined
by autonomous vehicles based on data collected in real-time and without human
intervention. In contrast to the current state of the art, in which AUVs run
pre-programmed routes through areas of potential interest, adaptive sampling has
the potential to dramatically increase the quality of collected data and to
significantly decrease the time and expense required to collected it.
