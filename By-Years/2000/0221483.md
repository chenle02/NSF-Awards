This dissertation investigates the rapid expansion of the casino industry in
the United States and South Africa. These cases differ in industry regulation
and competitive structure: competitive, privatized casinos in South Africa, and
monopolistic, regulated ones in California. While both casinos were legitimated
through their potential to develop indigenous peoples, different conceptions of
development by casino supporters have led to different structures and
regulation. The research will investigate the consequences of these different
origins and structures with ethnographic fieldwork at both sites. Three issues
will be central: financial relations between the corporations and indigenous
peoples, management-worker relations, and marketing strategies with consumers.
