Smith In response to an Announcement of Opportunity for the Global Learning and
Observations to Benefit the Environment Program (GLOBE) this project is designed
to meet the GLOBE goals and objectives of linking scientists and schoolchildren
in a global information network with the ultimate goal of better understanding
the Earth's environment and changes that take place within it. Many of the GLOBE
student measurements will be spatially correlated with geographic information
such as that derived from satellite imagery, aerial photography, and other
terrestrial maps. Therefor accurate position determination of the measurement
sites is required. The GLOBE program will use positions derived from the Global
Positioning System (GPS), which has great accuracy ( to within less than 100
meters) employing portable receivers presently costing well under $ 1000. This
proposal to GLOBE PHASE II is concerned with the GPS needs of GLOBE. GPS
receivers and associated equipment will be defined, procured, and bundled into
kits with documentation for loan to participating schools. The Principal
Investigator (P.I.) and assisting graduate and undergraduate students will help
plan the education program and generate teaching materials. The P.I. will
participate in the teacher training workshops.
