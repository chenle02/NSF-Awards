This project will examine a subset of existing questions in the General Social
Survey module designed to measure the "cultural authority of science," that is,
public perceptions about the credibility, certainty, and political utility of
scientific knowledge, and the trustworthiness and disinterestedness of
scientists and engineers. The research will examine a subset of GSS questions
and assess the validity and reliability of present wording. The goal is to
better understand what respondents are actually thinking when they hear these
questions and what thought-processes lead up to their answers. The research
methods include cognitive interviewing, a small-scale telephone survey, and
behavior coding. Although time-series analyses depend upon consistency of
wording in future iterations of the GSS module, the research may discover that
respondents are confused or misled by extant wording of some questions and that
the understanding of public attitudes toward S&amp;E in general would be
improved by rewriting certain questions. As a result of this work, sociologists
of science and policy analysts will have greater confidence as they undertake
scholarly analysis of data provided by the GSS science module.
