The 1980s saw the first sustained and systematic studies of agricultural
research ethics in the U.S. These studies have been successful in delimiting the
normative dimensions of the field, establishing that concerns for productivity,
tradeoffs, constraints, and sustainability are defining characteristics. Some
empirical work has been done, in case studies, interviews and surveys, to
delineate determinants and outcomes of research choices. This project will break
new ground by integrating an assessment of the normative critiques with an
analysis of ways working agricultural scientists might incorporate lessons from
those critiques into the planning and administration of their ongoing research
activities. A group of eight faculty, five from agricultural sciences,
engineering and administration and three from social science and philosophy,
comprise the core research team. This group will meet weekly or biweekly during
the course of the project at background study sessions where papers and topics
relevant to the research agenda will be discussed. It will analyse and contrast
alternative values for agricultural research by conducting a series of four
workshops with commissioned papers from agricultural and social scientists and
scholars in the humanities, focusing on ethical dimensions of research goals and
choices. After comment and revision, final papers from the workshops will be
gathered for publication in a volume edited by the principal investigators. To
identify lessons for the planning and administration of research, the core group
will develop cases and analyse their goals and value implications in monthly
reporting sessions at which agricultural scientists will take the lead in
discussing on-going research activities. Other interested faculty are expected
to attend many of the group sessions. The results of these analyses will be
prepared for publication in appropriate agriculture journals as well as journals
directed to the science and technology studies community. Two graduate research
assistants will assist in developing and leading group sessions, keeping
substantive records of the meetings as well as the workshop discussions, and in
developing annotated bibliographies for the field. This complex project is of
intrinsic and practical importance. The investigators and team members are
uniquely qualified and very well positioned to undertake the research;
institutional support is very good and the institutional setting increases the
likelihood that results will have impact. The project is designed well and plans
for the dissemination of results are good. It is likely that follow-on efforts
will continue after the period of this award. The Cooperative States Research
Service of the Department of Agriculture is helping to support this project.
