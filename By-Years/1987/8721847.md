This research seeks to develop microeconomic foundations for a real (that is,
non-monetary) theory of employment variability in the business sector of market-
type economies. The focus is on lay-offs under conditions of post-hire employee
immobility, so that a worker values the protection of a "contract" when
attaching himself to a firm. The first part of the research agenda tries to
establish in a series of models a contractionary effect on employment resulting
from shocks to the real interest rate or to the marginal efficiency of
investment, that, in the two-sector models utilized, drive down capital goods'
demand price in real terms (measured in terms of consumer goods). The second
part of the research aims to show a contractionary employment effect from
technological (or other) shocks generating a pause or slowdown of productivity--
thus a permanent setback to the "schedule" on which productivity advances. The
problem, then, is to develop models of the optimal contract between employee and
firm that will imply the hypothesized increase of unemployment (layoffs) from
the above shocks-- preferrably a model that will imply the layoffs to be
involuntary. To this end the projects will develop an incentive- compatible
contract model that under-insures against layoffs and generates excess layoffs
in adverse states. The last step is to work out explicitly the post-shock paths
of employment when layoffs are thus determined. If successful, this new research
on non-monetary models would offer an important supplement to the monetary
theory of slumps constructed by Keynes and successors which do not account very
well for "long swings" in employment and economic activity.
