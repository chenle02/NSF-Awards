The University of Wisconsin Madison is awarded a grant to develop an online
assessment tool to gauge student learning gains from a research experience. The
tool will measure gains in four areas: (1) Thinking and working like a
scientist; (2) Personal gains related to research work; (3) Skills; and (4)
Attitudes and behaviors as a researcher. Both the student and his/her mentor can
provide an assessment of the student gains. The tool will allow student data to
be aggregated so that an analysis of outcomes and impacts can be made across
student academic standing, demographics, length of experience, type of
institution, field of discipline, and others. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the
student assessment tool can be used by all disciplines in STEM, initial use is
expected to be made by students engaged in the Research Experience for
Undergraduates (REU) Sites programs managed by the Directorates for Biological
Sciences (BIO) and Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS). The NSF REU Sites
program contributes to the nation's efforts to build and sustain a scientific
research workforce by engaging undergraduates in research, especially those from
schools with limited opportunities for research and students from
underrepresented groups. Creation of this tool will allow various NSF-funded REU
programs conducted at institutions across the US to gauge student experiences in
order to improve student learning. It also allows REU Program Directors to use a
uniform set of core questions while also having the ability to ask program-
specific questions. The tool will directly support REU program directors'
efforts to rigorously evaluate their programs and assess student learning. Data
collected from the tool will be made available to researchers studying the
impact of undergraduate research learning experiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award is supported by the Directorates for Biological Sciences (BIO), Education
and Human Resources (EHR), and Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS).
