The Lewis and Clark line which extends from northern Idaho to southwestern
Montana separates a number of large-scale tectonic features of several ages. The
origin and development of the Lewis and Clark line are complex and poorly
understood. This project will attempt to unravel the multiple-phase tectonic
evolution of the Lewis and Clark line by mapping, kinematic analysis and
thermochronology. The results are expected to enhance our knowledge of the Lewis
and Clark line and its role in the develop- ment of the North American
Cordillera.
