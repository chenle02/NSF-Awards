The overall goal of this research program is to characterize the radiative
forcings of tropospheric sulfate and carbonaceous aerosols and to quantify the
climatic impact of these forcings. To address this goal, a three-dimensional
interactive aerosol-climate model based on the Community Climate System Model
(CCSM) of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) will be developed
and improved. Besides the original CCSM, this model includes (1) an aerosol
model that describes atmospheric evolution of multiple size sections (modes) of
sulfate and carbonaceous aerosols as well as their mixtures influenced by
transport, scavenging, and conversions; and (2) a prognostic size-dependent
radiative effect of aerosols and associated influence on climate dynamics and
physics as well as land surface properties.

Modeled results with this interactive model, including tropospheric
concentrations and radiative properties of aerosols, are expected to be
evaluated using observations and high-resolution regional model results, and
then used to quantify the direct and indirect radiative forcings of various
modeled aerosol components. The key dynamic and physical processes, and the most
significant uncertainties in determining the tropospheric aerosol burden, are to
be identified. This will be addressed by launching a large number of sensitivity
runs with different model settings, formulas, initial profiles, or emission
projections that are based on various pollution control strategies at different
geographical locations.

Broader Impacts: This project will produce several important byproducts
including training a postdoctoral research fellow and providing students as well
as fellow researchers an educational and research tool to study aerosol-climate
interactions and related issues. The subject treated also is relevant to issues
of climate change and will benefit environmental management and policy decision-
making.
