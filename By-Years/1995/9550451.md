9507639 Meystre The effects of the long range atomic interactions on optically
driven atoms is studied theoretically using a mean field approximation. This
results in an effective, non-linear equation which is solved numerically using
modern computational techniques. this regime, which is termed nonlinear atom
optics, suggests that it should be possible to observe atomic solitons, atomic
wave mixing and atomic phase conjugation in ultra-cold atom collisions. Even
more intriguing is the possibility of observing a coherent atomic beam generator
which would be the rough equivalent in atom optics of a laser. ***
