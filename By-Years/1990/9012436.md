The resolution of structure and function within pelagic food webs requires the
use of appropriate techniques and equipment. Gelatinous zooplankton are targeted
in this proposal as they represent a poorly studied but ecologically important
fauna throughout the oceanic water column. Due to their delicate nature, the
metabolism of most soft-bodied zooplankton can only be investigated in their
natural environment and it is hypothesized that in situ measurements of oxygen
consumption will lead to reduced errors associated with animal handling,
pressure and temperature changes, and light shock. Data obtained in situ will be
used to quantify the contribution of gelatinous zooplankton to the energetics of
midwater communities. Furthermore, comparisons of this information with similar
metabolic data on crustaceans and fishes will provide an important counterpoint
and permit a better understanding of selective pressures in the deep sea.
