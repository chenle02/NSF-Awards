9310389 Shreeve Professors Shreeve and Kirchmeier of the University of Idaho
will investigate the synthesis of fluorophosphazenes with support from the
Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program. Although
synthetic phosphazene chemistry has been a fertile area of research for many
years, the fluorophosphazenes have been relatively untouched. Shreeve and
Kirchmeier will prepare cyclophosphazenes as well as polyphosphazenes with
fluorine atoms attached both to the skeletal atoms as well as to substituent
groups such as fluoroalkoxides, fluorophenoxides, and fluoroalkyls. Many of the
syntheses will take advantage of fluoro-organosilanes as reagents to introduce
the fluoro-groups into the phosphazenes. It is anticipated that the
phosphazenes, already a promising class of compounds, will display improved
properties in their fluorinated forms. %%% There is a class of inorganic
compounds, called the phosphazenes, which are similar to organic compounds in
the sense that they are constructed around a skeleton of linked atoms; however,
instead of carbon atoms the skeleton is made of alternating phosphorus and
nitrogen atoms. Phosphazenes can be prepared both as discrete molecules and as
polymers, and they are finding certain commercial applications. Just as Teflon
is related to simple organic compounds through the replacement of hydrogen with
fluorine atoms, in the present research project a series of fluorine-substituted
phosphazenes will be prepared. The basic chemistry of these compounds will be
explored, but it is anticipated that they will display improved properties
relative to their unfluorinated relatives. ***
