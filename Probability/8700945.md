The investigator will study optimal and robust experimental designs. The first
set of problems deal with optimally estimating the effects of treatments and
comparing test treatments with a standard treatment. The second problem of
robust designs will involve nearest neighbour analysis. The main benefit of the
nearest neighbour analysis is to obtain unbiased estimates of treatment effects
even when unknown trends are present. This research will construct designs which
are efficient under nearest neighbour analysis. "Clustering" as an alternative
to nearest neighbour methods will be explored also.
