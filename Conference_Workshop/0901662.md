This award is for partial funding US participation in an International
Conference on Several Complex Variables, Complex Geometry and Partial
Differential Equations to take place in Wuhan University, China, during the
period of July 6-10, 2009. The main topics of the conference will be on the
algebraic, analytic and geometric methods in Several Complex Variables which are
among the most vital areas in pure mathematics. These areas also have profound
connections with many other branches of mathematics such as classical analysis
and dynamics, algebraic geometry, partial differential equations, differential
geometry, modern theoretical physics, symplectic geometry, etc. The conference
intends to provide opportunities for easy exchange of ideas and recent
developments among experts. More importantly, it will give PhD students and
junior scholars the opportunity to meet leading mathematicians in their areas of
interest. This will help them to be familiar with unsolved problems and new
research directions, and thus promote their future career development.

The funds will be used to partially support 10 plenary speakers from the US and
11 students and young investigators.
