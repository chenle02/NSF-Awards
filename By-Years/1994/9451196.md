9451196 Kapteyn Washington State University will introduce computer data
acquisition into its scientific electronics laboratory course. This course is
required of physics majors and is also popular with students from other academic
departments who need to know how to use electronics in their work. Currently,
the laboratory teaches basic analog electronics, operational amplifiers, digital
electronics, and analog to digital interfacing. However, the equipment now used
for the course is not current, and methods of computer data acquisition and
control need to be taught in order to prepare students for the way experimental
physics is now done. As well as its use in teaching computer techniques, the
equipment will be used as a diagnostic tool which the students can use to
elucidate aspects of circuit behavior. This will allow the students to have a
better understanding of how the lecture and laboratory parts of the course
relate to each other. Each station will be equipped with a Macintosh computer,
LABVIEW data acquisition software, and a computer-controlled multimeter, digital
oscilloscope, and function generator.
