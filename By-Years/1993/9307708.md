9305582 Tomsovic Recent elegant experiments in mesoscopic, atomic and other
systems are probing the deep connections between the quantum mechanical and
classical mechanical worlds. The theory bridging the two worlds is the realm of
semiclassical approximations for which many long-standing, fundamental problems
remain unresolved. Although the bulk of the work on semiclassical mechanics has
been concentrated in the energy domain, often the direct interest is in the time
evolution of a system. Until very recently only very rudimentary time dependent
semiclassical techniques existed. This work will focus on extending new, more
powerful semiclassical propagation methods (which we developed) to apply to
higher dimensions (which is important for physical applications), simplifying
the problems arising from chaotic motion, investigating the leading corrections,
and adapting the method to apply to stationary quantum mechanical problems. ! G
