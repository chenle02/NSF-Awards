9733700 Barton A major national science education goal is to promote scientific
literacy for all Americans. Egalitarian in theory, this idea of science for all
has proven difficult to actualize among all students in all schools. It has been
documented that children living in urban poverty experience schooling as right:
Teachers dominate classroom activity, students are passive, and learning is
defined through rote memorization. This kind of rigid education in science has
resulted in students who view science as a set of facts to be memorized that has
no connection or relevance to their personal lives. It has also produced
students who do not see or understand the interrelated nature of science and
society, and who cannot use their skills and conceptual understandings to make
personal decisions or to engage knowledgeably in debate abut scientific matters.
This is scientific matters. This significant given that 20% of all children
attend school in urban poverty.
