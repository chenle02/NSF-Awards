This award will provide funding for the next three iterations of the long-
standing Wasatch Topology Conference, which will be held in October of 2023 at
the University of Utah, and August of 2024 and 2025 in Park City, Utah. Each
conference will be held over 2-3 days, and will include research talks by
leading mathematicians in geometry, topology, and dynamics. The conferences will
cover a broad range of topics, include a diverse list of speakers and
participants, and highlight the work of early career mathematicians. The Wasatch
Topology Conference will advance knowledge in the field by providing a venue for
the transfer of knowledge from experts to a wider audience. Research
opportunities are also created through interactions between all conference
participants and graduate students via their lightning talks.

Conference topics include low dimensional topology, geometric topology,
dynamics, and geometric group theory, and within these areas, cover the broadest
range of subjects. There is a concerted effort on the organizers' part in
recruiting mathematicians to discuss their research related to significant and
groundbreaking results. These conferences will serve as a venue to highlight new
and hot topics in the research areas. In addition, the organizers are fully
committed to diversity and inclusion in the selection of speakers and
participants. and are deeply committed to the future recruitment of individuals
marginalized along different axes including, but not limited to, race, gender,
age, disability status, and socioeconomic status. A diverse pool of speaker-
participants and participants will help to continue to foster diversity and
inclusion within this subfield of mathematics and help to retain early career
mathematicians marginalized along similar and other axes. The website for the
Wasatch Topology Conference is https://www.math.utah.edu/wtc/.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
