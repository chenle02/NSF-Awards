A major challenge facing designers for digital signal processing (DSP) systems
is the rapidly increasing complexity of deriving sufficiently efficient and
predictable software implementations. In consumer-oriented application domains
such as wireless communications and PC multimedia, extremely competitive time-
to- market pressure together with the continually escalating complexity of
applications and processor architectures require companies to sustain enormous
human resource expenditures for software development. Similarly, in very high
performance applications such as radar signal processing, it remains a
significant challenge to partition programs and manage interprocessor
communication in a manner that effectively exploits large-scale multiprocessor
computer systems. Over the past several years, it has become widely recognized
that dataflow is an attractive programming model for computer-aided DSP system
design tools. This project is investigating algorithms that automatically or
interactively map high-level, dataflow programs for DSP into efficient software
implementations. Specifically, this research is exploring (1) a thorough
integration of dataflow programming and imperative programming formats, and an
efficient integration of techniques for compiling dataflow with the existing
techniques for compiling imperative languages; (2) the development of automatic
and interactive software tools for mapping dataflow models into implementations
on multiprocessor architectures, with emphasis on efficiently managing the
interactions between scheduling, interprocessor communication, and
synchronization; and (3) the development of algorithms for compiling dataflow
computations models into uniprocessor implementations in such a way that program
and data memory requirements, invocation overhead of individual subprograms, and
latency are optimized.
