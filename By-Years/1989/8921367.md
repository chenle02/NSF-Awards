There have been several observations of weak flare-like events on the sun,
generically termed "microflares." Such phenomena are theoretically interesting
for several reasons. This grant will examine the distribution functions of flare
occurrence, using several time series that reflect different aspects of flare
physics. One tool will be the use of model time series generated by Monte Carlo
simulation. The objectives will be to relate "microflare" phenomena observed
during MAX 91 to the distribution functions of events in the normal range, and
to draw inferences about use of weak non- thermal events as elements of coronal
heating. Observations from the solar maximum period are better for microflare
studies because of the generally higher activity levels.
