In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry
Program of the Chemistry Division, Kenneth J. Shea of the University of
California, Irvine will develop new green chemistries for the production of
hydrocarbon macromolecules from single carbon atom, renewable feedstocks (C1).
The approach is to separate and study the mechanisms of the individual steps in
the polymerization (initiation, propagation (early, middle and late stage),
termination); to prepare reaction intermediates and measure their stabilities;
and to prepare compounds necessary to enable and study the formation of stable
polyethylene latexes. The broader impacts involve training undergraduate and
graduate students in fundamental polymer chemistry, broadly disseminating
research results via publications and presentations at conferences,
participating in outreach activities through the UC Irvine Environment
Institute, and the potential societal impacts of manufacturing hydrocarbon
compounds and materials from renewable resources. Students will also work with
industrial partners to explore large-scale applications of this chemistry for
producing useful materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plastics are long chain
organic molecules and are found in many facets of everyday life, including food
packaging, structural materials for automotive and aerospace transportation, and
lightweight electronic devices. At present, plastics are derived predominantly
from petroleum based resources. This research will provide fundamental chemical
knowledge that could be used to develop efficient, economical and practical
methods for the production of plastics and waxes from abundant and sustainable
carbon sources.
