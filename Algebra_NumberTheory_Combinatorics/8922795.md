This award supports the research in algebraic geometry of Professor Steven P.
Diaz of Syracuse University. Among the objects of study in Dr. Diaz's project
are the Chow groups of the moduli space of curves of a given genus, and also
Chow groups of related objects such as Hurwitz schemes. This is research in the
field of algebraic geometry, one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but
one which has had a revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century. In its
origin, it treated figures that could be defined in the plane by the simplest
equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays the field makes use of methods not only
from algebra, but from analysis and topology, and conversely is finding
application in those fields as well as in physics, theoretical computer science,
and robotics.
