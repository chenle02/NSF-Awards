Humans are extremely adept at learning new skills by watching and imitating
others. Attempts to endow robots with a similar ability have failed to
generalize beyond specific tasks, partly because the focus has been on following
the trajectory of an action demonstrated by an expert.

The current project investigates a new interdisciplinary approach to imitation
learning that is inspired by how humans learn via goal-based imitation. The
project's specific objectives include: (1) a new method for imitation based on
inferring the underlying goals of human actions rather than following
trajectories: actions are executed based on sequences of inferred goals and
successfully executed action sequences are cached as higher level goals, leading
to hierarchical goal-based imitation; (2) a new approach based on hierarchical
Bayesian models (HBMs) is proposed for generalization across objects and tasks,
and (3) developmental studies of goal-based imitation learning are proposed for
testing predictions of the project?s models in imitation learning experiments
with children.

The project represents one of the first efforts to develop rigorous
probabilistic models of goal-based imitation learning based on insights from
human learning. The results are expected to pave the way for a new generation of
machines that can interact fluently with humans, learn new skills from human
teachers, and cooperatively solve problems with human partners. The project also
provides graduate and undergraduate students with multidisciplinary training in
computer science and cognitive science, with K-12 outreach activities aimed at
encouraging students from underrepresented groups to pursue careers in science
and engineering.
