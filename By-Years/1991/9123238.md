Local polymer dynamics in solution will be investigated using Nuclear Magnetic
Resonance (NMR) relaxation measurements, time- resolved optical experiments, and
computer simulations. NMR measurements will be used to investigate the nonlinear
dependence of local polymer motions upon the solvent viscosity in dilute
solution. These results will be combined with solvent rotation measurements to
test a new hypothesis about the origin of the solvent modification effect first
noted in viscoelastic studies. Both optical and NMR experiments will be used to
systematically explore the microscopic friction of polymer solutions on varying
length scales. Computer simulations will provide new insights into the
fundamental nature of local polymer dynamics. The cooperative motion of
torsional angles, atomic positions , and other degrees of freedom will be
examined. The simulations can be critically tested by the NMR measurements.
Together these studies will allow the investigators to address the relationship
between molecular structure and local dynamics, the interaction of solvent and
polymer motions, and the connection between local and global polymer motions.
This research deals with a fundamental investigation of dynamic properties of
polymer molecules that are different from those found in molecules of other
materials. Hence, the research is fundamental, but of potential significance in
technology, (i.e., for viscosity and rubber elasticity).
