PI: Sneden&lt;br/&gt;AST-0307495&lt;br/&gt;University of Texas,
Austin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Sneden will carry out spectroscopic studies that
explore the early chemical evolution of the Milky Way galaxy. His program
focuses on the most metal-deficient stars of the Galaxy, those whose chemical
abundances can yield the most insight into both the formation and evolution of
the Galaxy and the details of stellar nucleosynthesis and evolution. A large
program of high resolution spectroscopy of key samples of low metallicity thick
disk and halo populations will allow a comparison of the chemical composition of
halo stars with those of similar metallicity now proposed to be associated with
the thick disk, an expansion of the number of extremely metal-poor stars that
have well-determined detailed abundance distributions, and the creation of a
statistically meaningful sample of abundances in binary blue metal-poor stars.
He will also carry out abundance analyses of several outer halo globular
clusters, a population that has not been studied as thoroughly as the more
nearby clusters. In this work, he will explore the use of Fabry-Perot imaging
for very large samples of cluster abundance studies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many
of his activities will have broad impact. He will continue his collaboration
with the atomic physics group at the University of Wisconsin to combine lab and
solar abundance studies of selected elements. He will continue to develop and to
make available to the community his widely used software and linelist data. He
will participate in a series of seminar for secondary school teachers,
particularly in leading them in workshops at the McDonald Observatory.&lt;br/&gt
