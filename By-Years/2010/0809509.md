The Analytical and Surface Chemistry (ASC) program of the Division of Chemistry
will support the research program of Prof. Andrew Hilier of Iowa State
University. Prof. Hilier's research program focuses on the development of highly
sensitive surface plasmon spectroscopic methods for quantitative studies of
adsorption of analytes to surfaces. Prof. Hilier and his students will perform
detailed experimental and modeling studies to better understand and optimize the
conditions needed to facilitate maximum enhancement of light transmission
through metal-coated gratings. The proposed studies will be directly applicable
to the development of a greatly improved surface plasmon spectroscopic
technique. The study will provide an excellent educational opportunity for
graduate students and postdoctoral trainees to carry out a spectroscopic method
development project wit the potential to revolutionize the field of surface
plasmon spectroscopy.
