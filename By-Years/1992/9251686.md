The goal of this project is to improve the hands-on laboratory experiences of
students in courses in social, developmental and clinical psychology at Hobart
and William Smith Colleges by establishing a human observation laboratory suite.
The new laboratory is equipped with video equipment for remote observation of
human subjects. Employing a biotelemetry system, the physiological monitoring
equipment unobtrusively records indices of emotion (e.g., heart rate) and
transmits this information to the observation room. Two computer workstations in
the laboratory are used for a variety of tasks: coding videotaped observations;
acquiring and transforming physiological data; integrating data from videotaped
observations with physiological data; and statistical analysis. The equipment
will allow students to learn a variety of techniques in each of these modalities
as they address substantive issues in separate areas of the discipline.
