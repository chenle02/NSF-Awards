The purpose of this integrated cross media project is to build public knowledge
and curiosity about energy science and policy, to encourage audience confidence
in its abilities to understand energy related science, and to stimulate exchange
between community-based experts. The deliverables include five hour-long radio
programs focusing on the interconnected nature of waterways, climate systems,
and energy sources; a digital journalism and social network site focusing on
energy topics; partner-driven outreach with universities and local public radio
stations; and a training workshop for ethnic media partners. The project targets
public radio listeners, ethnic media readers, local urban and rural communities,
and Internet users. Partner organizations include New American Media, a
consortium of ethnic media producers, the University of Texas at Austin (which
will provide content expertise as well as outreach assistance), local public
radio stations, and scientific organizations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intended
impacts on the general audience include building their knowledge and interest in
energy science and policy, and influencing their confidence in understanding
energy science, technology and engineering, as well as empowering them to voice
their opinions in energy policy discussions and to make changes in their lives
that will support a sustainable energy future. It is estimated that five million
people will access the radio programs and web content over the sustained life of
the project. Professional audience impacts include building science journalism
capacity and reciprocal relationships between general and ethnic news media, as
well as stimulating exchange between subject experts (e.g., water engineers and
geoscientists) and community experts (e.g., community organizers and backyard
gardeners) who can inform energy reporting and open new areas of discussion in
the energy debate. The evaluation plan uses both quantitative and qualitative
data collection and quasi-experimental designs to examine the impact of this
project on both public and professional audiences.
