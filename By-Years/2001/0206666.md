Abstract CTS-0206666

It is proposed to carry out experimental study to understand the processes of
drop deformation, breakup, and coalescence in flows of highly viscous or
viscoelastic liquids. More specifically, the role of high MW surfactant known as
the compatibilizer on these processes will be examined. Experiments will be
carried out in miniaturized computer controlled four-roll mills developed and
constructed by the PI during the previous Grant period. Motions and deformations
of small drops 10-100 microns in diameter will be observed and recorded by a
microvideo system.
