This project will produce an historical ethnography of electric grid
provision,&lt;br/&gt;use, and maintenance in Senegal. The focus will be on the
shift from state-managed&lt;br/&gt;electric grids to local electric grids built
by entrepreneurs. The co-PI will explore the role&lt;br/&gt;and attitudes of a
range of actors in this socio-technological system, from
politicians,&lt;br/&gt;engineers, and utility professionals to energy
entrepreneurs-- transnational traders who&lt;br/&gt;have entered the energy
market by leveraging the trade networks they or their
families&lt;br/&gt;participated in before liberalization. Participant
observation and interviews will also be&lt;br/&gt;done with household
consumers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will result in a
dissertation, journal articles, and a book which should be of value to policy
makers and development communities engaged in energy infrastructure and market
issues, sustainable development.
