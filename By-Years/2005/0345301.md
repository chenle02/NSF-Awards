The situation that may be the most detrimental to verbal communication is when a
speech signal is embedded in a background of other, interfering speech, such as
crowd noise or echoes of the target speech in a reverberant room. It is also
known that speech understanding in such a "cocktail-party" situation is
especially difficult for elderly individuals, even for those with relatively
good hearing. Over the last 25 years, data collected by experimental
psychologists, audiologists, and neuroscientists have unveiled some important
characteristics of the process of separating speech sources, as well of its
dysfunction, and developed models to explain and predict human performance in
"cocktail-party" settings. Motivated by the same data, and by the fact that
human listening performance under such difficult conditions has its limits,
information scientists have become increasingly interested in finding
computational solutions to speech separation. The last 10-15 years have
generated an unprecedented rush toward the development of diverse computational
schemes aimed at automatic separation of speech sources by filtering out
unwanted speech and enhancing the target. Nevertheless, to the onlooker of this
work there appears to be no general solution to this problem. Because the facts,
models, and schemes are dispersed over different scientific fields and in
specific sub-areas, it is likely that for any solution to bear fruit requires a
concerted effort among scientists from these various disciplines.

The objective of this multidisciplinary, international workshop is to bring
together an invited panel of around twenty scientist-experts whose work
represents the cutting edge of speech separation within their particular
discipline. Over a two-day period, these experts will present their own and
discuss each other's research, in addition to taking part in general discussions
in which the current status and future trends of speech separation research will
be examined. The workshop will also produce a report containing all
presentations, as well as highlights of the discussions.
