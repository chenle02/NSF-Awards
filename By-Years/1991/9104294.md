Two drill cores were successfully recovered from the Neogene of the Great
Bahama Banks carbonate platform. Funding is provided for the analytical work to
test the model of sea.level fluctuations as seen on seismic profiles and examine
the record of burial digenesis and chemistry of modern subsurface fluids. The
results of the study will lead to the resolution of important controversy
surrounding the behavior of carbonate platforms during sea.level change.
