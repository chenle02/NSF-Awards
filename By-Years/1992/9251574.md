This project is for the development of an undergraduate laboratory in fluid
mechanics to support the Mechanical Engineering Program. The grant provides the
financial resources in order to purchase the following equipment: (1) wind
tunnels with manometer packages, probe packages and accessories to investigate
Bernoulli's equation, and laminar and turbulent boundary layers; (2) NACA0020
airfoil sections with nineteen pressure taps to investigate the stalling angle
of airfoils; (3) hydraulic benches and accessories to be used to analyze venturi
meters, flows through several different orifices, the impact of water jets; (4)
piping systems with several different pipes and valves to calculate the energy
losses present in such systems; (5) Reynolds number apparatuses to visualize
laminar, transition, and turbulent flows; and (6) open water channels with
accessories to investigate the hydraulic jump, flows over straight and vee notch
weirs, and visualize flows around simple geometrical objects. The laboratory
will be an integral part of the MECE 3315 Fluid Mechanics course which is
required for all mechanical engineering majors. The laboratory illustrates the
concepts covered in class. Its main emphasis and effort is placed on gaining
information from the experiments, experiencing the trials and tribulations of
experimentation and not simply demonstrating physical principles.
