In our solar system, Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs) are among the most distant
objects from the sun. Recently, astronomers have proposed the existence of a
distant, unseen planet, popularly known as Planet 9. Two pieces of evidence
support this proposal. First, the orbital characteristics of about a half-dozen
of the most distant KBOs are very similar. Second, the orbits of these KBOs are
spaced in location so that they appear to be influenced by the presence of a
much larger body. This research will combine both theoretical, orbital dynamics
studies of these highly-irregular orbital characteristics with orbit fitting and
uncertainty estimation of the telescopic data on these KBOs. The results will
lead to a much better assessment of the evidence for Planet 9, and narrow the
present location of Planet 9 in the sky. This support the mission of the NSF by
promoting our understanding of the solar system structure. The investigators
will add the results of their research to university courses and public
lectures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will elucidate the dynamics of
orbital resonances over the full range of orbital eccentricities with the
anticipation of discovery and understanding of novel phase-space structures and
dynamical mechanisms, including the resonant coupling between eccentricity and
inclination in the high-eccentricity regime. The orbit-fitting will improve
knowledge of the orbital parameters of the most distant known KBOs, and will
also allow for higher fidelity estimates of proximity (or lack thereof) to
orbital resonances with Neptune and/or Planet 9. The observational bias analysis
is important to assess the statistical significance of the apparent orbital
clustering of the distant KBOs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
