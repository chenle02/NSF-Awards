The principal investigator will continue his study of the geometry of the Yang-
Mills moduli space. This will include an analysis of the semiclassical measure
on moduli space with fermions added, and Donaldson invariants in terms of
differential forms. He will also investigate a general approach to establishing
the existence of non-minimal Yang-Mills fields on 4- manifolds with symmetry. In
the early 1980s S.K.Donaldson showed the intimate connection between solutions
of the Yang-Mills equations and differentiable structures on four-dimensional
space. This discovery meant that two four-dimensional space-times could be
topologically the same (have the same shape) but be differentiably distinct. No
experiments have been devised to discover which of these differentiable
structures describes our space-time. The principal investigator will continue
his analysis of the ramifications of Donaldson's discoveries.
