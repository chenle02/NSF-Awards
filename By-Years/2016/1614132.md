The increasing frequency and magnitude of harmful algal blooms (HABs) is a
global problem, exacerbated by rising temperatures and cultural eutrophication,
and is most severe in regions experiencing rapid urbanization and agricultural
development. The Taihu basin, China, is a poster child of this type of region
and frequently experiences severe HABs, often dominated by the neurotoxin
producing cyanobacteria of the genera Microcystis. While the overall duration
and size of a bloom is limited by the supply of nitrogen and phosphorus, there
is growing evidence that carbon (C) availability may also limit growth in some
cases. The proposed research is a collaborative project with Prof. Guangwei Zhu
(Nanjing Institute of Geography and Limnology) investigating the potential for C
limitation, the role it may play in phytoplankton ecology, and possible
implications for global C cycling. A diverse suite of tools, including stable
isotopes, diagnostic photopigments, and other biogeochemical indicators will be
used to better constrain the aforementioned processes. The proposed research
will advance our understanding of the Taihu system, one that is a model for
other heavily impacted ecosystems worldwide. HABs, like those common to Taihu,
are complex events with diverse biogeochemical drivers and the potential for
numerous environmental feedbacks, many of which are poorly understood. Results
from this study will help determine the degree to which one of these drivers, C
limitation, may affect the bloom size and dominance of potentially toxic HAB
species in this environmentally and economically vital lake.

Inorganic C fixation during dense phytoplankton blooms can reach extremely high
rates, removing dissolved CO2 faster than can be supplied by air-sea exchange
and respiration. Species capable of assimilating inorganic C as bicarbonate
(H2CO3) such as the toxin-producing Microcystis will therefore be at a
competitive advantage when CO2 becomes limiting. In the proposed research, ?√ù13C
of phytoplankton will be used as an indicator of C sources and acquisition
strategies, while an analysis of photopigments by HPLC will be used to
investigate the effects of C availability on phytoplankton ecology during the
progression of a bloom in the hypereutrophic lake Taihu, China.
