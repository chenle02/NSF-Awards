9225116 Aydin The objective of this research is to investigate the radar
scattering properties of ice phase hydrometeors in order to better understand
and interpret centimeter and millimeter wave polarimetric radar measurements of
clouds and precipitation. This will be accomplished through electromagnetic
scattering computations and comparisons with experimental measurements. The
polarimetric scattering properties of ice crystals such as plates, columns,
bullets, needles and dendrites will be evaluated at millimeter wave frequencies
for use in discriminating ice crystal habits and estimating their ice mass
content with radar. Similar evaluations will be performed for scattering from
graupel and hail at centimeter wave frequencies for radar detection and
quantitative estimation of hail parameters such as hailfall rate, liquid water
in hailfall and hailstone size. ***
