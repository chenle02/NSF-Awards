Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a non-degradative technique
used to determine the positions and mutual interactions of atoms in molecules.
Chemistry departments depend on NMR instrumentation for the enhancement of
front-line research in a number of areas of chemistry and for utilization in
undergraduate instruction. This award from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation
Program will help the Department of Chemistry of Eastern Illinois to aquire a
multi-nuclear high field NMR spectrometer. The acquisition will strengthen the
training of chemistry undergraduates in this RUI institution and will enhance
research efforts in the following areas of chemistry: 1) Synthesis of fused
butyrolactones via dyotropic rearrangement 2) Maceral specific chemical
characterization of Illinois coal 3) Unidentate bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane
complexes as chelating agents 4) Intervalence charge transfer across iron-sulfur
bridges.
