Between 1984 and 2001, the share of non-elderly adults receiving cash benefits
under the Social Security Disability Insurance program (DI) in the US rose by 60
percent to 5.3 million beneficiaries. As a result, total outlays under DI
exceeded $65 billion in 2002, comprising almost 3.4% of the U.S. federal budget.
This research empirically investigates the extent to which social interactions
affect participation in disability programs such as DI using a unique Norwegian
data set. Social interaction effects could help explain the wide variation in DI
participation across regions and over time. The magnitude of such effects is
critically important for predicting the impact of DI policy and economic shocks
on DI participation rates.

Social interaction effects refer to the impact that the behavior of one
individual has on the behavior of another. In the context of DI, this
interdependence could, for example, arise because of social norms. Social norms
against DI utilization can reduce participation rates by imposing a utility cost
or stigma on recipients. As DI use increases among one's peers, this stigma is
expected to decline, thereby increasing the propensity to apply for DI benefits
for members of high-utilization peer groups.

Identifying social interaction effects in observational data is notoriously
difficult due to suspicions of omitted variable bias. This problem will be
addressed using a rich 11-year panel dataset containing disability participation
records for every person in Norway. A novel instrumental variable (IV) strategy
will be employed, using previous years peer groups layoffs as an instrument for
changes in-group participation rates. The intuition behind this approach is that
f social interaction effects exist, peer groups disproportionately hit by
layoffs should exhibit a relative increase in disability applications even among
members who were not themselves laid off. The results of this research could
provide important insights into the formulation of social safety net programs in
the US.
