College&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: CT-ISG: Dartmouth Trace Sanitization
Framework&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Project Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Computer-
network research advances more quickly when researchers are able to analyze the
activity of live computer networks. Because it is difficult to collect traffic
traces from production computer networks, it is critical for the network-
research community to share traces. Researchers who capture network traces and
wish to share them, of course, must properly "sanitize" the trace to remove
sensitive information. Sanitization always involves a challenging trade-off
between sanitization effectiveness (providing anonymity for network users and
secrecy for network operational information) and research usefulness (since only
the information retained can be used by the researcher). This project aims to
increase network-trace sharing by making it safer and easier to sanitize network
traces. To this end, the project will develop and release NetSANI (Network Trace
Sanitization and ANonymization Infrastructure), a flexible and extensible suite
of software tools for sanitizing network traces, based on user-specified
sanitization goals and user-specified research goals. The tools will be verified
on extensive traces collected at Dartmouth College, and evaluated by providing
early releases to external collaborators who will test the tools on their
traces. The NetSANI project will have broad academic and practical impact: (a)
better tools will enable and encourage more network-trace sharing, which helps
the research community do better research, (b) better access to network traces
will help companies develop better network products, and (c) better
anonymization methods will protect network users' privacy. The outreach efforts
will help spur the research community into defining norms and best practices for
trace sanitization. Finally, the project will involve graduate and undergraduate
students in research and incorporate research results in courses. &lt;br/&gt;
