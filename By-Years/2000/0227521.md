The PRIME: Promoting Reflective Inquiry in Mathematics Education partnership
includes Black Hills State University, Technology and Innovations in Education
(TIE) of the Black Hills Special Services Cooperative, and the Rapid City School
District aimed at improving achievement in mathematics for all students in Rapid
City Schools with a particular goal of reducing the achievement gap between
Native American and non-Native American students. The project seeks to improve
the professional capacity and sustain the quality of preK-12 inservice teachers
of mathematics in Rapid City School District and student teachers of mathematics
from Black Hills State University in order to provide effective, inquiry-based
mathematics instruction. Objectives include reducing the number of high school
students taking non-college preparatory mathematics, increasing the number of
students taking upper level mathematics, and increasing student performance on
college entrance exams. The project provides 100 hours of professional
development in a combination of content-based workshops at the district level
and building-based activities involving modeling of effective lessons, peer
mentoring, and coaching, and lesson study. Mathematics education and discipline
faculty from Black Hills State University are involved with district-wide
professional development activities. A cadre of building-based Mathematics Lead
Teachers convene building based learning teams comprised of mathematics
teachers, mathematics student teachers from Black Hills State University, school
counselors, and building administrators to identify key issues in mathematics
curriculum and instruction.
