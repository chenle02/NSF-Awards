Mathematical Sciences 21&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PRofessional Enhancement
Program (PREP) offers 50 workshops enabling at least 1,000 mathematical science
faculty to respond to rapid and significant developments that impact
undergraduate mathematics. PREP provides extended support for adaptation and
implementation of curricular materials and pedagogical strategies that have been
shown to be effective in improving the teaching and learning of undergraduate
mathematics. Themes for the PREP workshops include inquiry-based learning;
distance learning; service learning; redesign of the undergraduate program in
mathematics; interdisciplinary studies, especially mathematics and life
sciences, mathematics and the environment, and financial and actuarial
mathematics; preparation of future teachers; and how best to serve the next
generation of college students, especially those who have already studied
calculus in high school. PREP workshops extend over time with preparatory,
intensive, and on-going components that make extensive use of the latest
technologies.
