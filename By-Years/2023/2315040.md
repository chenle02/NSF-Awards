Experimental researchers in the social and behavioral sciences often interact
with the public in two traditionally distinct capacities. In the act of doing
science, they elicit participant responses in experimental studies to create
knowledge and test hypotheses. At the same time, many researchers use their own
knowledge and expertise to engage and educate the public about topics of public
concern related to their science. In this project researchers explore the ways
in which these two roles may be brought closer together, by treating each
participant in an experimental study as an opportunity for public engagement,
examining the messages (positive or negative) that participants already deduce
from common experimental paradigms, and exploring the role that improved science
communication methods can have on engaging and educating participants. The work
has the potential to substantially increase one type of broader impact of social
and behavioral research – public outreach and engagement.

The researcher team centers this investigation in the field of linguistics and
focuses on commonly used speaker perception tasks. In the first phase of the
project, the team develops a Linguistics and Language Ideology (LLI) survey
instrument designed to test the public’s standing ideas around language and the
field of linguistics. In the second phase, participants complete a series of
speaker perception experiments testing how responses to this survey are impacted
by different methodological aspects of the experiment. Participants across the
studies are debriefed using innovative and engaging techniques. The results of
this project not only highlight how specific methodological choices impact
participants’ understanding of language and linguistics, but also whether and
how science communication with participants can mitigate any negative effects,
and actively produce positive outcomes.
