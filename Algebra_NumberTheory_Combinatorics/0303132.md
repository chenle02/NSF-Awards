Abstract

Title: Lattice Points, the Gauss Circle Problem, and the Riemann Zeta-Function

The investigator studies the properties of lattice points close to smooth curves
and surfaces and applications of these properties to classical number theory
problems. One objective is to improve on the Iwaniec-Bombieri method and to
obtain new results in the Gauss circle problem and on the order of the Riemann
zeta-function on the critical line. Another aim is to improve on the Fouvry-
Iwaniec method for estimating exponential sums with monomials and to obtain new
applications on the distribution of almost-prime numbers in short intervals and
B-free numbers in short intervals. The investigator and his colleagues are also
using Pade approximation polynomials to obtain new bounds on the fractional
parts of rational numbers and applications to diophantine equations and on the
irreducibility of polynomials. Another line of research is on the convergence of
Minmod-type numerical methods for hyperbolic differential equations.

The Gauss circle problem and the problem of the order of the Riemann zeta-
function on the critical line are two of the most famed problems in number
theory. The Riemann zeta-function is closely related to the distribution of
prime numbers. Knowledge about prime numbers plays a crucial role in the areas
of cryptography and data encryption which are important both for national
security and e-commerce. Hyperbolic differential equations find applications in
problems involving flow (some examples are gases around aircraft, wake of
aircraft, underground contamination, weather patterns). In most cases it is
impossible to solve exactly the relevant differential equation, so numerical
schemes for an approximate solution are applied. The investigator and his
colleagues have achieved progress and are working toward completely solving an
important open problem in the mathematical theory of numerical methods for
hyperbolic differential equations.
