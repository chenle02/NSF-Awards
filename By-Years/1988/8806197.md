The research project is aimed at understanding the nature of metastable
electronic and structural states in amorphous semiconductors, their relaxation
to equilibrium and their relation to structural and compositional
heterogeneities will be controlled by preparing multilayered hydrogenated
amorphous silicon that consist of ultrathin layers of different compositions or
dopant concentrations in order to optimize a variety of new electronic
properties. Methods will be explored to further control and modify the
electronic properties of field- induced and photo-induced reversible structural
changes.
