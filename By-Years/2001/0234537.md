With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
(CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at Boston College will acquire a
Spectrofluorometer with Lifetime Capability. This equipment will enhance
research focused on biomolecules, biomimetic probes and compounds, and novel
materials. Some specific projects include a) characterization of materials used
for multiphoton optical memory; b) molecular sensors for DNA damage detection;
c) DNA-fluorophore conjugates; d) development of efficient reactions for
stereoselective organic synthesis; e) interactions of phospholipases with
interfaces; and f) allosteric control of metabolic pathways. Investigators at
several institutions in the Boston area will also use the spectrofluorometer.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fluorescence spectrometer counts photons of light in
the ultraviolet (UV) and visible regions. When a sample of material is
illuminated by UV light at a given frequency or energy, the reflected light
consists of the original UV light, but also may contain light in the visible
region of the spectrum, at a lower frequency or energy. The fluorometer is a
very sensitive instrument used to detect the fluorescence signal. &lt;br/&gt;
