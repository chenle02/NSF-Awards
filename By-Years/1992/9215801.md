In this project sponsored by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Prof. Leone of the University of Colorado will study how the
collisions of rare earth atoms with inert gas atoms depend on the orientation
and specific quantum states of reactants and products. This work, including
detailed theoretical calculations, will be extended to studies of reactive
collisions which produce diatomic molecules in the gas phase. The result will be
a greatly increased understanding of the quantum basis of steric effects on
simple chemical reactions. %%% When molecules and atoms collide in chemical
reactions, the reactivity and nature of the products formed depend on the
detailed geometrical arrangement of incoming reactants at the moment of
collision. In this study Prof. Leone will use oriented atoms and will measure
how this orientation is transferred to reaction products. This will lead to a
greatly improved understanding of precisely how orientation affects reactive
collisions, thereby answering questions which have long been of interest in
fundamental studies of chemical reactions.
