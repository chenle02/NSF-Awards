Experiments will be carried out to examine the dynamics of charge density wave
(CDW) and spin density wave (SDW) ground states. This is a continuation of
research supported under a previous grant. Three strongly related experiments
will be pursued: (1) the collective mode ac response of CDW and SDW condensates
in the radio, micro-, millimeter, and infrared spectral range; (2) the
examination of thermoelectric, elastic and magnetic properties in the CDW state,
and (3) the search for non-linear excitations of the CDW ground state. The
experiments will be conducted on various inorganic organic linear chain
compounds which develop charge or spin density wave ground states.
