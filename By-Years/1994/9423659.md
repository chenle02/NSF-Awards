9423659 Warner Nuclear reaction cross sections will be measured for the light
neutron-rich radioactive nuclei 6He, 8He and 11Li using beams produced at the
radioactive beam facilities at Michigan State University and the University of
Notre Dame. Cross sections for the 2n-separation reaction will also be
extracted. These data will be compared with calculations using the optical,
strong absorption, and microscopic models. Cluster studies will use the 350 MeV
polarized proton beam from the Osaka RCNP cyclotron to knock alpha-particles out
of light nuclei, such as 6Li, 12C, and 28Si. The alpha-particle clustering
probability and momentum distribution within the nucleus will be determined. All
these studies will actively involve undergraduates, as part of an RUI
program.***
