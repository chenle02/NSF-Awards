The fields of computer engineering and digital data communications are becoming
interwoven rapidly. Examples of systems where the disciplines overlap are the
telephone network, computer integrated manufacturing (CIM) systems and the
various local area networks (LANs) serving commerce and education.The computer
engineer should understand the principles of digital data communications. The
B.S.Co.E. computer engineering program at the New Jersey Institute of Technology
includes a two course sequence in the senior year, communications theory and
lab. Also, electrical engineering students wishing to specialize in
communications, one of the senior year options in the B.S.E.E. program at NJIT,
need to increase their understanding of digital data communications through a
stronger lab experience. The educational experience of both sets of students is
being strengthened considerably by the development of this multidisciplinary
laboratory. The equipment being obtained comprises combined pattern generator,
pattern detection equipment to measure the bit error rate in data communications
systems, multiplexer/ demultiplexer equipment to experiment with the mixing of
several data sources on a single medium, and distortion analyzers which can
measure the signal/noise ratio and distortion level of transmitted signals.
