This inservice program involves a partnership among planetary scientists,
science educators, and teachers at the elementary and middle school level. It is
designed to : (a) provide education in astronomy and basic scientific principles
for teachers and (b) provide teachers with the means to communicate these
concepts in an inquiry fashion to students. Since topics in space science are
part of the elementary school curriculum from Kindergarten through eighth grade,
providing teachers with knowledge of both concepts and teaching methods will
enable them to provide hands-on experiences that will enhance the critical
thinking skills of their students. The program will involve teachers in four
week long leadership workshops, follow up classes during the year, and close
working relationships with scientists. Included in the project will be the
development of resource materials for teachers to share as they conduct two-day
workshops for other elementary school teachers. The cost sharing of the project
will be at least twelve percent of the project. If the project is enhanced by a
grant from NASA the total cost sharing will become 53% of the project.
