Houk 9422318 This project involves systematic two-dimensional spectral
classification of nearly a quarter- million stars from Harvard's Henry Draper
Catalogue, using high-quality spectroscopia plates taken with the Michigan
Curtis Schmidt telescope at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile and
the Burrell Schmidt at Kitt Peak National Observatory near Tucson AZ. Working
northward from the south celestial pole, so far over 155,000 stars have been
classified and their spectral types published. From these, good temperatures,
absolute brightnesses and distances can be obtained for the stars. Chemical
peculiarities and binarity are also detected from many of them. This 5-year
grant will support the classification of stars for Volume 6 of the Michigan
Spectral Catalogue, covering declinations from +5 to +30 degrees, and the start
of classification of Volume 7 stars, +35 to +90 degrees, the last installment of
the project. ***
