The Physics Department at Lewis and Clark College is developing a modern
laboratory for teaching solid state physics. Building on a base of introductory
and intermediate courses, the Physics faculty has recently turned its attention
to the development of a series of advanced laboratory/student-faculty research
investigations which will serve to emphasize topics being studied in
Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics, Modern Physics, Solid State Physics
and Quantum Mechanics. Solid State Physics was selected to illustrate
fundamental interactions of electrons with matter. The development of this
laboratory is also very practical in view of the graduate and career plans of
undergraduate physics majors. The laboratory will support a range of experiments
of differing degrees of sophistication. A number of pieces of equipment for
crystal growth and electrical and optical measurements have or are being
acquired. The central piece of equipment in this project is a superconducting
magnet and variable temperature cryostat to be used to investigate fundamental
properties of materials. The system is capable of temperatures from 1.5 to 300
Kelvin and magnetic fields up to ten Tesla. This system will be used by students
enrolled in Advanced Laboratory, Undergraduate Research, or student-faculty
collaborative research. Examples of concepts to be studied are: magnetic
susceptibility, specific heat, electrical conductivity, Landau quantization,
electronic band structure, superconductivity, and semiconductor carrier
concentration. The grantee institution is matching the NSF award with an equal
sum obtained from non-Federal sources.
