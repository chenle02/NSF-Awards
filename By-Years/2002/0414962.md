This proposal seeks funding to acquire a Nanonics MultiView 2000 near-field
scanning optical microscope (NSOM) system with spectroscopic capability. The
NSOM will enable new research directions dealing with photonic crystals,
nanoscale waveguides, fluorescent nanoparticles, quantum dots, DNA-based
nanobarcodes, biodegradable fiber nanocomposites, anti-fouling coatings,
electroluminescent organic electronics, molecular scale devices, and
heterostructure semiconducting devices. The Nanonics instrument is extremely
flexible in its functionality, making accessible a variety of optical phenomena
at the nanoscale. Near-field or confocal optical images can be acquired
simultaneously with nanoscale topographical images. Light can be
collected/excited both in the far-field with an optical microscope (in
transmission or reflection) and in the near-field with the nanoscale aperture
probe. Coupling the light from the probe or the optical microscope to a
spectrometer allows correlation of spectral data (fluorescence,
electroluminescence, photoluminescence, etc.) with topographical data. The NSOM
will be incorporated into courses both in the College of Engineering and in the
College of Agriculture and Life Sciences. The instrument will also be the basis
for developing a hands-on module dealing with the waveguiding of light; through
a variety of CCMR outreach programs, this module will be made available to K-12
teachers for use in their classroom science classes and, for older students, as
background information for understanding the operation of the NSOM. The ability
to correlate nanoscale optical phenomena with nanoscale topographical
information will open up new areas of inquiry and aid in solving current
problems that could not be addressed previously.
