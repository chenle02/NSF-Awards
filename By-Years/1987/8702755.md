Work will be done investigating geometric-analytic properties of domains as
they relate to solutions of partial differential equations. The work
concentrates on the boundaries of domains for it is at the boundary where the
nature of solutions tends to be obscure. Among the concepts which have evolved
in the measurement of boundary regularity, one of the most important is that of
capacity, or more precisely, the capacity of a set. Although there are a number
of types of capacity one may define, the source of theory almost surely rests
with electrostatics and measurement of how well a conductor can support a
charge. This in itself is a question about solutions of a partial differential
equations. Several questions in the theory of capacities will be addressed in
this work. The first is concerned with nature of weighted capacities arising in
the study of degenerate elliptic equations. One wishes to chacterize the
boundary regular points or the removable singularities for solutions. The
capacities (set functions) are built out of the differential operator. Certain
fundamental questions as yet are incompletely answered. They include how
weighted capacity depends on the weight at least as far as null sets are
concerned. One would also want to be able to classify regular points into
equivalence classes according to types of degeneracy. On a larger scale, results
on equivalence of capacities and concepts of regularity for nonlinear equations
are only just appearing. This research will have application to the theory of
partial differential equations and potential theory.
