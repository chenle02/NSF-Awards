NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: This project investigates the mechanical integrity of
a new breed of multifunctional ceramic composites with advanced properties such
as low density, high strength, and high thermal stability. Potential
applications for these novel materials include porous membranes for separation
processes, heterogeneous solid catalysts, corrosion-resistant coatings,
insulation system parts, and low carbon footprint concrete alternatives. This
research formulates new design rules for damage-tolerant novel ceramic materials
and new standards for quality assessment of material components. The research
activities provide training for undergraduate and graduate students in
nanomaterials science, advanced mechanics, and nanotechnology. This research
supports the organization of high school science outreach workshops in
collaboration will local high schools to promote the recruitment and retention
of underrepresented groups into science and engineering
disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS: This project investigates
the premature failure of advanced aluminosilicate nanocomposites due to
prolonged exposure to low-level repetitive loadings. This is an important issue
as early failure usually results in shortened service lifetimes and increased
maintenance costs of components. Using cutting-edge nanoscale depth-sensing
methods, this research seeks to generate new microstructure-performance
relationships. The knowledge generated could lead to new materials design rules
and thus accelerate the insertion of aluminosilicate nanohybrids in science and
engineering applications. The research rests on a strong partnership between
industry (Anton Paar) and academia (Northwestern University) leading to a joint
academia-industry workshop focused on advances in surface mechanical
characterization. This research contributes to a skilled and diverse workforce
through research internship opportunities for undergraduate students and
training opportunities for graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
