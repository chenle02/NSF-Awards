The long term goal of this research is to understand supernova explosions and
use that knowledge to determine the distances of other galaxies. These distances
are basic to our efforts to understand the origin of the universe and determine
its age. The approach is based on observations followed by close comparison of
the data to theoretical models. As the research proceeds, such questions as the
rate of supernovae in our galaxy and other galaxies, the types of stars which
become supernovae, the effects of these explosions on the interstellar gas, the
role of supernovae in manufacturing heavy elements, the energy output of
supernovae and the properties of various types of supernovae will be addressed.
This work has been underway for more than a decade and will continue under this
grant.
