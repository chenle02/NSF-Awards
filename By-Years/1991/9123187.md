This project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic program is
concerned with chemistry of 4d and 5d metal porphyrin and tetraazaporphyrin
complexes. Specific areas to be considered are multiple metal-metal bonded
dimers (including heterometallic bonds), mesodiscotic liquid crystals (and
possibly ferroelectric fibers), and electrochemical catalysts for multielectron
redox reactions of molecular hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and ammonia. %%% This
research is intended to produce a set of new and unusual substances whose
physical and chemical properties will add to our fundamental understanding of
the structures and reactivities of the heavy transition elements and the
mechanisms of mysterious multi-electron redox processes, such as nitrogen
fixation, that are catalyzed by metalloenzymes. Unusual catalysts and liquid
crystalline materials may result from this highly interdisciplinary research.
