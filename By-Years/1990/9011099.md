The proposed research will characterize gas-liquid mass transfer in mycelial
fermentations and optimize reactor performance utilizing a model mycelial
fermentation. A new chemical technique for the measurement of mass transfer
coefficient will be utilized to characterize the gas-liquid mass transfer. An
unsteady-state chemical technique utilizing an instantaneous reaction between
ozone and indigo dye has been developed and is well- suited for modelling
mycelial fermentations because of low ionic strengths and ease of data
collection and analysis. The biological phase will be modeled with cellulose
fibers, which in suspension behave similarly to mycelular growths. This model
system will be used to characterize the gas- liquid mass transfer as a function
of stirrer speed, gassing rate and solids concentration in a variety of agitated
reactors. The replacement of turbine agitators with hydrofoil impellers has
significant industrial interest, primarily due to energy savings and lower shear
exposure for the mycelial broth. The reaction of glucose to gluconic acid by
Aspergillus niger will be carried out in the most promising reactor
configurations to determine if the improvements in gas-liquid mass transfer
translate into improvements in the mycelular reactor performance.
