The primary objective of this U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research project in
physical oceanography between Miroslav Gacic,of the Institute of Oceanography
and Fisheries and Paul E. La Violette of the Naval Ocean Research and
Development Station, is to develop the first climatological atlas of the
Adriatic Sea using NOAA satellite imagery and oceanographic ship data collected
by the Yugoslavs. The atlas will deepen understanding of the effects of
temperature patterns, coastal weather fronts on formation of the deep waters in
the eastern Mediterranean and Adriatic Seas. The investigators will jointly
perform computer simulations aimed at predicting the physical behavior of these
solutions. This project was approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on
Cooperation in Science and Technology and is supported through a joint fund
consisting of matching contributions from the U.S. and Yugoslav governments. The
U.S. contribution is provided annually by the Department of State. No NSF funds
are involved. The grants are composed principally of Yugoslav dinars and made to
the principal Yugoslav institute. Funds include travel for U.S. scientists to
Yugoslavia and a modest dollar allowance for Yugoslav scientists' living
expenses in the U.S.
