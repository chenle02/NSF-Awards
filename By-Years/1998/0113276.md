Many of the recent successes in behavioral neuroscience in both invertebrate and
vertebrate systems have been attained by identifying individual neurons and
assessing the role of each neuron in behavior by physiologically manipulating
its activity level. There are, however, aspects of behavior that have not been
adequately explained by this approach. In the case of the medicinal leech, the
neuronal network controlling the initiation of swimming is well-understood at
several levels, but this understanding does not account for the unpredictability
with which stimulation of this pathway leads to swimming. Two possible reasons
for this inadequacy will be addressed in this proposal: (1) neuronal networks
provide static descriptions of the system and do not accurately reflect their
dynamics, and (2) even simple behaviors are a function of large populations of
neurons distributed throughout the nervous system. &lt;br/&gt;Because of the
inherent complexity in the firing patterns of large populations of neurons,
computational approaches are necessary for deciphering how the nervous system
encodes behavior. This project will use linear statistical and spectral
techniques and nonlinear techniques, in conjunction with discrete wavelet
transforms, to test: (1) whether the 'state' or pattern of ongoing activity in
the leech nerve cord prior to stimulation determines the likelihood that
swimming will be elicited by a specific input, and (2) whether the neuronal
control of swim initiation is a distributed property of the entire ventral nerve
cord or is localizable to neuronal activity from specific regions of the leech
nervous system. This project will provide research experiences for 10
undergraduate students from a primarily undergraduate women's
college.&lt;br/&gt;
