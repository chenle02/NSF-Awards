The 2017 Midwest Conference on Representation Theory will be held October 20-
22, 2017, on the campus of Purdue University in West Lafayette, IN. The
conference will gather established experts, recent Ph.D.s, and graduate students
for the purpose of discussing and disseminating new results in the broad area of
Representation Theory, a fundamental mathematical subject with applications to
many other areas within mathematics.

Nine speakers have been invited to this year's conference, including several
early-career researchers. The conference will also feature talks by established
researchers whose specialties include automorphic forms, and representation
theory. The conference website is
