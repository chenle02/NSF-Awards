This research performs an analysis of the frictional forces in wire ropes and in
the individual strands when subjected to axial, torsional, and bending loads and
verifies the results with laboratory experiments. The first portion of this
research will estimate the effective length, measured from the fractured end of
a wire, to sustain its appropriate share of the load. This analysis will involve
the contact forces, the coefficient of friction, and an invocation of Saint-
Venant's principle. The second portion of the research will determine the
bending stresses in a rope with friction. This will involve the solution of the
nonlinear equations of equilibrium for a thin wire. Experiments will be
performed on several types of wire ropes to check the validity of the
assumptions made in the analysis.
