This project creates an international science research exchange between the
Inupiaq students of the North Slope of Alaska and Zapotec and Purehepecha
student of Oaxaca and Michoacan, Mexico to research, observe, and experience the
science of biodiversity and climate change both in Mexico and Alaska. Inupiaq
students will travel to Mexico and Zapotec and Purehepecha students will travel
to Alaska to immerse themselves in the local environment, language, and culture
of each others regions. This exchange project will provide a global context
within which local students can understand their environmental and social
cultural experiences. In addition, the anthropological investigators will be
observing the cultural construction of science and education among the
participants, including scientists, teachers, and students.
