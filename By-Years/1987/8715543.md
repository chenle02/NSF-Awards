It is the purpose of this research to determine the nitrate concentration in
snow and ice samples collected from Windless Bight, Antarctica. Due to the high
accumulation rate at that site, high time resolution can be obtained, and it is
expected that correlations can be made with known solar events that would have
produced nitrogen compounds in the upper atmosphere. The technique may provide a
means of determining past levels of solar activity. Measurement of recent levels
of nitrates may also help test hypotheses that nitrogen is removed from the
stratosphere by falling ice crystals as part of the processes that cause the
annual ozone hole. This research is partially supported be AFOSR.
