This S-STEM scholars program is designed to promote and sustain interest in
engineering through engaging students in experiential learning opportunities.
The project provides experiential learning opportunities and funding for 30
high-achieving students with financial need. Specific goals of the S-STEM
Scholars program are to improve educational opportunities for students through
experiential learning, increase retention and graduation of students, and
increase the numbers of well educated and skilled employees in technical areas
of national need. The program builds on the strengths of Purdue University's
College of Engineering mentoring and tutoring programs of the Women in
Engineering Program (WIEP) and Minority Engineering Program (MEP) as well as
Purdue University's service learning, global programs, and undergraduate
research efforts.
