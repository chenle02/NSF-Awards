The Institute for Scientific Computing and Applied Mathematics at Indiana
University will upgrade its set of workstations and acquire graphic
workstations, a laser color printer and some video material. This equipment will
be dedicated to support research projects concerning the approximation and
bifurcation of attractors, the numerical study of collisionless plasmas, the
development of new algorithms related to the incremental unknowns methods, and
their application to fluid mechanics.
