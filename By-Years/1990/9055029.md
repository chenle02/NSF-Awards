The College of Sciences at Louisiana State University in Shreveport will
initiate an eight-week, commuter Young Scholars project in Biology, Chemistry,
Computer Science, Mathematics and Physics for 20 students entering grades 10-12.
The project will involve courses specially designed for the participants in the
morning, and research with university faculty mentors in the afternoon. Typical
research projects will involve: genetic variation in salt tolerant and sensitive
varieties of cotton, identification of cardenolides in monarch butterflies,
effectiveness of the neighborhood watch program, and applying Snyder's
coincidence classes to parameter passing in Ada.
