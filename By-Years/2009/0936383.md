0711077&lt;br/&gt;DePaor&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports a
collaborative software development project between Worcester Polytecnic
Institute and James Madison University. The investigators and undergraduate
student assistants will develop techniques for building a 4-D "virtual globe"
visualization package using Google Earth, Keyhole Markup Language (KML),
SketchUp modeling software, and NASA WorldWind's open source code. The software
would be used to create and present tectonic and geophysical syntheses through
time, using geologically well-constrained mapping areas as prototype. The PIs
will involve undergraduate students with both geoscience and computing academic
backgrounds who will be trained in digital field mapping and in the development
of the visualization approach. The PIs intend to make the software freely
accessible for users so they can create virtual globe maps without advanced
programming requirements.
