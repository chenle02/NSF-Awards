The Department of Chemistry is acquiring a capillary gas chromatography-mass
spectrometer system, associated computer equipment, and a library database. The
system is allowing both chemistry majors and nonmajors to become familiar with
the use of computer integrated instrumentation, data analysis, and database
searching. Students at the sophomore through senior levels are carrying out
experiments using the instrument in courses including organic chemistry,
inorganic chemistry, and instrumental analysis, as well as in an intensive
Environmental Chemistry Institute and in a variety of undergraduate research
projects.
