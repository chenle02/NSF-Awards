Under the supervision of Prof. Pamela Smith, Ph.D student Pierre-Etienne
Stockland will explore the development of etymological science with a focus on
how the results of biological research on invasive insect populations have
enhanced the state's capacity to respond to agricultural disasters.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will culminate in a doctoral dissertation.
Agricultural disasters have been an understudied type of natural disasters. The
work will contribute to the growing interdisciplinary field of disaster studies.
The data collected from this project may be made available in the Academic
Commons of Columbia University.
