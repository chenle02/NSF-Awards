Treil and Peller will continue their work on Hankel operators and their
applications. In particular, they will investigate spectral properties of self-
adjoint Hankel operators and their relations with balanced realizations with
continuous time and with discrete time; spectral characterizations of the
completely regular vectorial stationary random processes; superoptimal
approximations of matrix-valued functions; and special approximation by finite
rank Hankel operators that repeat first singular values of the initial operator.
Operator theory is that part of mathematics that studies the infinite
dimensional generalizations of matrices. In particular, when restricted to
finite dimensional subspaces, an operator has the usual linear properties, and
thus can be represented by a matrix. The central problem in operator theory is
to classify operators satisfying additional conditions given in terms of
associated operators (e.g. the adjoint) or in terms of the underlying space.
Operator theory underlies much of mathematics, and many of the applications of
mathematics to other sciences.
