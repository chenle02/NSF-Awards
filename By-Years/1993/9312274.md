This award is to conduct the annual NSF Design and Manufacturing Grantees
Conference. The conference will involve researchers from the Division of Design
and Manufacturing Systems and the Division of Engineering Education and Centers,
both located within the Directorate for Engineering, and the Division of
Information, Robots and Intelligent Systems, located within the Directorate for
Computer and Information Science and Engineering. The conference ensures that
the individual researchers are informed about the ongoing activities of their
colleagues. An elimination of duplication of their efforts may be achieved and a
degree of cooperation may result from this activity. An overall improvement of
efficiency of the research activity could be expected. In addition, the
conference program organization allows for ample time to discuss manufacturing
research in detail with the collective research community at the meeting, with
feedback to and input from the National Science Foundation. Finally personal
contacts between the grantees and program directors in the Divisions should
contribute to clarifying many current issues in their work. The aims of the
conference are to enhance communication between researchers, encourage joint
research, promote synergism, and develop networks for technical interchange.
Attendees to the conference gain an early access to the information
disseminated.
