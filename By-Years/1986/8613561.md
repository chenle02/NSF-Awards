The objective of this project is to explore the use of gamma-ray densitometry as
a method to assess the amount of blockage in a pipe of a fire protection
sprinkler system. Sprinkler systems are installed at the time of construction of
a building and the water in the pipes remain stagnant. As a result, oxidation
and encrustation develops which will reduce the effectiveness of the sprinkler
system when it is needed the most to extinguish a fire. The project will
evaluate the equipment with respect to its usefulness in determining the degree
of blockage in a pipe filled with water.
