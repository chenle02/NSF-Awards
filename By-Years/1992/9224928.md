Dr. Lon B. Knight and other members of the Chemistry Department of Furman
University are being supported to continue a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry. For the period 1993-5, ten undergraduate
students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in a variety of
research projects. Projects range the traditional areas of chemistry-analytical,
inorganic, organic, physical and biochemistry. A unique feature of this program
is the inclusion of two visiting faculty from regional colleges, who, along with
their students will participate in the program.
