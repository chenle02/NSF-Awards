This project places modern biotechnology equipment in the laboratory for use by
students. The instrumentation is centered around the electrophoresis procedure
which is used to chemically separate DNA fragments and proteins. The major
equipment items are electrophoresis chambers, power supplies, digital pipets,
and a gel imaging system. Students have hands- on use of this equipment and
produce a written lab report which includes a section relating the laboratory
activities with actual applications in use in the fields of biology, medicine,
and forensics.
