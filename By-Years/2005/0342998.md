With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
(CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin in
Madison will upgrade a 300 MHz NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will enable
researchers to carry out studies on a) the synthesis of complex, biologically-
active natural products; b) "foldamers", oligomers that display discrete folding
preferences similar to those of biopolymers; c) chemical synthesis of
carbohydrate derivatives; d) mechanistic investigations of alkene polymerization
as catalyzed by metallocenes; and e) protein structure-function relationships.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of
the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the
structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to
characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the
dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-
art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier
research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic
organic chemistry and biochemistry. &lt;br/&gt;
