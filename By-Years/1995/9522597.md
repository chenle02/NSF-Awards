Abstract 9522597 Shaw Funds are provided to the State University of New York -
Buffalo in the Support of 7th US/Japan Workshop on High- Temperature
Superconductivity (HTS) during October 23-27, 1995. The objectives of the
Workshop are: 1) to bring together specialists from both countries in the
development of HTS; 2) to visit R&D laboratories to gain an understanding of the
level of equipment and personnel support in HTS; and 3) identify the problem
areas that are particularly suited for international cooperative programs to
further the progress of HTS. The workshop will be held at the National Research
Institute on Metals in Tsukaba, Japan on October 23-24th. The technical tour
consists of three visits to key research centers/labs during October 25-27th.
This is the second Workshop in Japan. The previous one was held in Houston. %%%
This workshop is organized to address research issues that will advance progress
in five technical areas related to national needs: 1. tapes and coils, and their
applications; 2. bulk materials and applications; 3. thin-films and new
materials; 4. vortex structure and critical currents; 5. theory and
characterization.
