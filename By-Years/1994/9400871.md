Fogel And States DEB-9400871 Hypogeous fungi (truffles and false truffles) will
be surveyed on forest islands in the Great Basin and Arizona. These are among
the least known species, and the western U.S. is potentially a region of high
diversity. Additionally, the Hypogeous fungi are keystone species, critical to
the survival of the important coniferous forests. These fungi also provide an
ideal system for studying mutualistic relationships. They from obligate,
ectomycorrhizal associations with forest trees and are dependent on rodents fro
spore dispersal. Hypogeous fungi can exist only in the scattered forest islands
in the region east of the Sierra Nevada-Cascade ranges; thus, this provides an
opportunity to explore speciation and biogeography among fungi. The data will be
useful in identifying truffles and false truffles for establishing
ectomycorrhizae on tree seedling destined for out planting on calcareous soils,
as dietary sources for small mammals, and for understanding factors for
maintaining large rodent populations for endangered predators.
