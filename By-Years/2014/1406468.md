The research projects involve the interplay between the study of algebraic
structures and topology, the study of shapes or spaces. Algebraic topologists
use algebraic structures to describe and simplify topological phenomena.
Spectra, which represent cohomology theories, are algebraic structures built out
of topological spaces and hence are useful for translating from one field to the
other. In one project, the PI and Greenlees develop algebraic models for certain
types of spectra with symmetries that allow complete calculations. The PI
continues to train graduate students and disseminate research results. In
addition, the PI is involved with several organizations that promote the
participation of women and underrepresented minorities in math and science.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI continues to study when derived equivalences can be
realized by underlying richly structured equivalences. Examples of this arise in
the PI's long term project with John Greenlees of constructing algebraic models
for rational G-equivariant spectra for compact Lie groups G. More specifically,
the PI and Greenlees plan to extend their model for tori to provide an algebraic
model for rational G-equivariant commutative and associative ring spectra. The
PI and Kathryn Hess continue to develop the homotopical setting for coalgebras
with motivations coming from Rognes' Hopf-Galois extensions of ring spectra and
Hess' homotopical framework for descent. The PI and Birgit Richter are
developing a simple algebraic model for homotopically commutative differential
graded algebras.
