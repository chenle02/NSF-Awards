This award to Professors Arveson and Wolf is made under the Mathematical
Sciences Research Group initiative. It will support postdocs and graduate
students in Modern Analysis at the University of California at Berkeley. The
research supported by this award will deal with various aspects of Modern
Analysis including the representation theory of Lie groups, the theory of
operator algebras, and ergodic theory. As the mathematical vehicle for
exploiting the symmetries inherent in a system, the representation theory of Lie
groups has had a profound impact upon mathematics itself, particularly in
analysis and number theory, and upon theoretical physics, especially quantum
mechanics and elementary particle physics. The theory of operator algebras
begins with the notion of operator, which can be thought of as finite or
infinite matrices of complex numbers. Special types of operators are often put
together in an algebra, naturally called an operator algebra. These abstract
objects have a surprising variety of applications. For example, they play a key
role in knot theory, which in turn is currently being used to study the
structure of DNA, and they are of fundamental importance in noncommutative
geometry, which is becoming increasingly important in physics. Ergodic theory in
general concerns understanding the average behavior of systems whose dynamics is
too complicated or chaotic to be followed in microscopic detail. Under the
heading "dynamics can be placed the modern theory of how groups of abstract
transformations act on smooth spaces. In this way ergodic theory makes contact
with geometry in its quest to classify flows on homogeneous spaces.
