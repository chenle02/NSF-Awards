Research in theoretical physics will include work on strings and superstrings,
wormholes, tests of the standard electroweak model in high energy e+e-
collisions, solitons, and topics at the interface between cosmology and particle
physics. The problems to be studied include several which are at the forefront
of elementary particle theory and cosmology, such as the question of whether
superstrings, which are being advanced as a promising model of the physics of
elementary particles, are fundamental or arise from some deeper underlying
dynamics.
