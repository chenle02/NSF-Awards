Experimenting with Robotics Leads to Further Understanding of Science,
Mathematics, and Technology is a two year project for 200 elementary and junior
high school science and computer teachers from New York City public and non-
public schools to integrate the learning of fundamental principles in science
underlying the microprocessor and electric circuits, with logical operations and
computer control. In eight Saturday workshops teachers will build and use
circuits, electromagnets, and transistors. Logo programs will control switches
which will in turn control the robot each participant will build. Teachers will
attend monthly follow-up meetings and be supported in the classroom by the
project staff and volunteer scientists. Materials produced will include a manual
and a videotape which document the enhancement. This collaborative effort
involves The Center for Advanced Study in Education/CASE of the Graduate School
and University Center, CUNY, The Institute for Schools of the Future (The PI is
President), New York Community School Districts Board of Education, scientists
who are members of the American Physical Society and the Robotics Research
Laboratory of the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York
University, and the Center for Learning Technologies, New York State Department
of Education. Through an integrated approach to teaching science and technology,
participants will increase their understanding of various concepts, have more
time for teaching, and be able to provide students with more in depth
instruction.
