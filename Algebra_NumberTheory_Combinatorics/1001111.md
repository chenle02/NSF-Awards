The proposer plans to work on a variety of problems in additive combinatorics,
specifically: Continuing his work on the Polymath4 project to produce a
deterministic algorithm to find large prime numbers quickly; exploring the
ramifications of a ground-breaking probabilistic approach that he has developed
to attack certain additive combinatorial problems (such as the 2D corners
problem); and continuing the development of some fresh ideas on sum-product
inequalities. A good example here is the proposer's work in the Polymath4
project: To date he, and other participants, have produced an algorithm to
compute the parity of the prime counting function faster than any previous
method; and furthermore, the proposer has produced a ``polynomial ring
analogue'' of this algorithm which shows great promise towards completing the
project (when generalized further, perhaps).

Understanding the structure of prime numbers (2,3,5,7,11, and so) is one of the
enduring legacies of the ancient Greeks, and in recent years enormous progress
has been made. Polymath4, an online collaborative research program initiated by
Timothy Gowers, Gil Kalai, and Terrence Tao, addresses a related, fundamental
question: How quickly can one even produce large prime numbers? The proposer has
been a major participant in this project, and has thus far made significant
strides in addressing this problem. He plans to continue working on it with
other Polymath4 researchers and with some of his students. In addition, he plans
to continue his work on developing some ground-breaking methods in a relatively
new field called ``additive combinatorics'', which has become a hot area of late
due to works of Gowers, Green, Tao, and others.
