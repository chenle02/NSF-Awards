The college will purchase a 200 MHz FT-NMR spectrometer to enhance the student
laboratory experience. It will introduce 13C NMR, variable temperature, and
time-resolved studies into the laboratory program. The spectrometer will be
integrated into the curriculum so that every student experience builds upon
knowledge and expertise already gained. NMR spectroscopy will be introduced in
the sophomore year and integrated into the upper division curriculum. In each
course, the students will independently operate the instrument, using it not
only for identification and structural characterization of compounds but also to
obtain chemical parameters such as equilibrium and rate constants, diffusion
coefficients, etc. It will also provide valuable hands-on experience with a
computer- controlled data acquisition system. An advanced theory course
including work with the spectrometer, and independent research projects
involving FT-NMR, will be offered. The Physics department will incorporate the
spectrometer into their modern physics laboratory course.
