The new quantum mechanics, discovered, elaborated and interpreted during the
crucial years 1925-1928, radically transformed the physics and philosophy of the
20th century. Dr. Beller is examining the intellectual and social history of the
quantum revolution as a multi-levelled and dynamic network of scientific
dialogues at that time. She aims to incorpore the very fact of the existence of
the scientific community and the complex interaction among its members into a
basic level of the formation of scientific knowledge. She will describe how
theoretical ideas and philosophical commitments took shape during the complex
process of negotiations. This research will bring to light the experimental
aspect of the quantum revolution (1925-1928) and spell out the important impact
of less central scientists, thus shedding light on the collective aspect of
scientific creativity. Dr. Beller has studied many primary and secondary sources
in the history of quantum physics, and has published a series of papers on this
topic. Under this grant, she will examine additional primary documents available
in the US and in archives in Austria and Germany.
