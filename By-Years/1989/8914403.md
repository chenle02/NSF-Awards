Dr. Clouthier is supported by a grant from The Experimental Physical Chemistry
Program to study the high resolution spectra of small transient molecules and
free radicals produced through high temperature decomposition in an expanding
jet. The results of this work have a direct impact on many areas of applied
research and engineering including energy conversion, fuel utilization, coal
gasification, and chemical vapor deposition techniques used in the semiconductor
industry. Dr. Clouthier has developed a new technique which he calls pyrolysis
jet spectroscopy, in which precursor molecules, entrained in a high pressure
stream of inert gas, are pyrolyzed just prior to expansion through a nozzle into
a vacuum chamber. The short contact time and expansion cooling allow the
observation of the rotationally cold spectra of even very short-lived and
reactive species. He plans to apply this new technique to the study of several
transient species including: dichlorocarbene, formyl cyanide, thioacetaldehyde,
thioacetone, selenoformaldehyde, and a series of alkyl metal compounds thought
to be important intermediates in the chemical vapor deposition process used by
semiconductor industries.
