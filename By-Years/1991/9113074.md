The Rosensteil School at the University of Miami will continue operation of a
satellite communications facility for scientific research purposes. Through a
cooperative agreement between NASA and the University of Miami, operational
control and scheduling of NASA's ATS-3 satellite has been turned over to the
University. Limited use of the LES 9/8 DoD communications satellites has also
been obtained. A modest communications facility has been established by the
University in Malabar, Florida to facilitate usage of these satellites for NSF-
sponsored research activities. The ocean sciences and Antarctic research
communities have regularly scheduled access to the satellites for voice and data
communications in support of remote research investigations. The ongoing work to
be accomplished includes: 1) continued coordination of oceanographic and
Antarctic ATS usage; 2) the study and implementation of other communications
paths (utilizing LES 9/8 and INMARSAT systems) between high seas and Antarctic
users and the continental U.S.; 3) providing the capability for direct satellite
mediated data network access via DECnet, TCP/IP and other methods. The
communications services provided by this facility are important to the
successful completion of many research projects at sea and in Antarctica.
