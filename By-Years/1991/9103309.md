Medusae are known to be important predators affecting the structure of marine
plankton communities. Although evidence indicates medusae may be selective
predators, the mechanics of this process have not been clearly described. The
research proposed here will examine the relationship between propulsion and prey
encounter by cruising medusa predators. Preliminary observations indicate that
fluid flow and particle entrainment caused by medusa bell motions may determine
encounter rates of mobile medusae with various types of prey. This hypothesis
will be tested in the laboratory by quantitatively describing flow patterns
around mobile medusae as well as response patterns of prey species. Predictions
from laboratory work will be compared with prey selection characteristic of the
same medusa species in the field. Ultimately, understanding of the mechanics of
prey encounter and selection by medusae will help explain the complex effects of
these predators on the plankton community.
