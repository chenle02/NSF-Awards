How science is taught varies considerably across contexts and time. What shapes
science instruction? How do broader political and cultural factors interact with
educatorsâ€™ characteristics to affect how science is understood and taught? This
doctoral dissertation research uses theory from cultural anthropology and
science and technology studies to investigate which cultural, political, and
individual factors emerge as most important in shaping how science is understood
and taught in different contexts. In addition to training a graduate student,
this project disseminates its results broadly to stakeholder and academic
audiences. Results further develop educational curricula.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project conducts a year of ethnographic research to
address two central questions: 1) How do science educators understand the
influence of broader cultural trends on science pedagogy; and 2) How do
individual characteristics affect how science educators teach science across
different cultural contexts? The student investigator employs participant
observation and in-depth interviews with science educators, researchers, and
curriculum developers in different institutional settings across multiple
iterations. Using a comparative approach, the project advances understanding of
how notions of science shift when educators of varying background learn how to
teach in different institutional settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
