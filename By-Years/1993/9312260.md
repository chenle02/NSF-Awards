9312260 Cohen This project involves the dissertation research of a student in
cultural anthropology from Columbia University. The student is studying how
Chinese peasants communicate values about gender relations through their
linguistic forms of proverbs and folk sayings. The sayings are thought of as
representing traditional wisdom and shared folk experience, and are used to
sanction behavior. Using household surveys, personal interviews, elicitation of
life histories and participant observation as well as archival research, the
project will describe how rural Chinese women are changing gender relations in
the face of tradition. This research is important because it sheds light on the
changing roles of women and men in traditional societies. With changes in
employment opportunities, traditional gender roles change all over the world,
and this one case study of how the changes are instituted in a traditional
society will provide valuable comparative material to understand similar
processes in different places. In addition dissertation research increases the
scientific capacity of the nation. ***
