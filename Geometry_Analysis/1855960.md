The international workshop "Australian-German Workshop on Differential Geometry
in the Large" will take place from February 4-15, 2019, at the MATRIX institute
of the University of Melbourne in Creswick, Australia. This workshop has two
parts. The first week (February 4-8) will involve an international conference
with high-profile speakers who are prominent researchers, mentors, and leaders
of professional organizations in Australia, Germany, the U.S., and elsewhere. A
research symposium will take place in the second week. Participants will meet in
research groups close to their primary research interests. Three goals of this
two-part workshop are to highlight recent advances in the geometry, foster
communication between experts and early-career researchers, and identify avenues
for future work. All three goals will benefit graduate students, postdoctoral
researchers, and other early-career mathematicians. The award supports
participation of US researchers in this event.

The academic focus of the meeting is on recent developments in differential
geometry, geometric analysis, and associated topics in differential topology.
The plenary speakers were chosen in part with these topics in mind. In addition,
the four subjects according to which the participants will be grouped in the
second week are as follows: - Geometric evolution equations and curvature flow -
Structures on manifolds and mathematical physics - Higher invariants and
positive scalar curvature - Recent developments in non-negative sectional
curvature The results presented in this workshop, as well as a summary of the
problem session, is tentatively planned to be published in the London
Mathematical Society's Lecture Note Series, as well as in the 2019 MATRIX Annals
volume of the MATRIX Book Series. In addition, this information will be made
freely available through the arXiv. The webpage for the workshop is below.
