Lee 9613937 This is a workshop award entitled "Manufacturing Polymer Composites
by Liquid Molding" that will be held in Columbus, OH, June 13-14, 1996. The
objective of the workshop is to identify strategic research activities to
advance scientific understanding in Manufacturing of Liquid Polymer Composite.
Approximately 100 people will be invited to participate including speakers from
academia, industry, and government. The workshop will focus on the following
topics: (1.) Performing Fundamentals (2.) Performing Technology, and (3.)
Materials Characterization. In addition, a computer demonstration session is
scheduled introducing different flow modeling codes to the same place for
comparison and evaluation. Proceedings from the workshop will be prepared and
published by Engineering Research Center for Net Shape Manufacturing.
