A Polarographic analyzer system is being used by the Chemistry Department at
Washington College to provide students with extensive "hands on" experience
using modern voltammetric methods in analytical chemistry courses. This
instrumentation is also being used in student research projects, one of which is
concerned with the effects on marine species of increased zinc and aluminum
concentrations in the Chesepeake Bay. A forensic chemistry course offered each
spring to advanced high school students also utilizes polarographic methods.
