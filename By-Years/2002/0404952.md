0404952 Marcus Professors Marcus and Rosen plan to complete their book, `Markov
Processes, Gaussian Processes and Local Times', which includes the results of
their research over the last sixteen years using isomorphism theorems to study
local times of symmetric Markov processes by employing the well developed theory
of Gaussian processes. They anticipate that the book will stimulate new
research, which should lead to significant insights in stochastic processes and
possibly physics. They also intend to continue their research concentrating on
the First Ray-Knight Theorem, the one classical isomorphism theorem for the
local times of Brownian motion that they have not been able to extend, and to
consider a problem raised by Symanzik in quantum field theory, involving self-
intersection local times. Professor Marcus plans to continue his research on the
continuity and boundedness of stochastic convolutions with respect to infinitely
divisible processes. Professor Rosen intends to study large deviations and
exponential integrability for functionals of Markov processes related to
intersections. He also intends to study fine properties of the geometry of the
simple random walk in two dimensions. The research of Professors Marcus and
Rosen is aimed at understanding the structure of stochastic processes.
Stochastic processes are models for the evolution of random phenomena in time.
However, even though the processes are random they contain some fundamental
inner structure which when understood makes them in some sense predictable.
Global warming is a good example. The temperature varies, day by day and season
by season. There is a fundamental question: Is the average temperature getting
warmer, or is the warming we seem to be witnessing simply a short term
fluctuation of a basically stable weather pattern? The research supported by
this grant does not attempt to answer this specific question. It is instead a
study of the fundamental properties of random structures, which may give the
tools to more effectively deal with important questions such as this one.
