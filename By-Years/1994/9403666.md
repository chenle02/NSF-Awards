9403666 Bauer The research proposed encompasses much of nuclear physics and
extends into particle physics and astrophysics. Some of the many proposed topics
include an analysis of chaos in nuclear deformation and structure,
fragmentation, pion correlations and interferometry in heavy-ion collisions,
hadronization at RHIC energies, studies of nuclear effective interactions, and
applications to nuclear astrophysics. ***
