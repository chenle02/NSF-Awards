This Engineering Research Equipment Grant will support purchase of equipment
capable of producing narrow linewidth (&lt; 100 MHz) or short temporal width dye
laser pulses. Specially, a pulsed dye amplifier (PDA) is sought which would
enable a variety of spectroscopic experiments involving diatomic molecules that
are attractive candidates for new VUV, UV or visible lasers. Also an existing CW
dye laser will be upgraded to narrow linewidth, scanning operation. Both of
these items of equipment will be coupled with existing pump lasers (excimer for
the PDA, AR+ ion for the CW dye) to examine the structure via spectroscopy of:
(1) rare gas dimers (for a potential anti-Stokes Raman laser in the VUV); (2)
rare gas oxides; and (3) lead monoiodide. Furthermore, experiments designed to
explore the pulsed amplication of quantum well semiconductor lasers will be
conducted. This equipment will improve the ability to investigate the details of
the structure and chemical behavior of potential new laser molecules and develop
new sources of tunable radiation in the VUV to visible, as well as expand the
scope of other on-going research.
