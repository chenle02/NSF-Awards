The award will support participant travel costs for the 2018 Biomedical
Engineering Society (BMES)-Cellular and Molecular Bioengineering (CMBE)
Conference being held at the Leows Coronado Resort, CA from January 2-5, 2019.
The CMBE field is experiencing exponential growth, with the subfield of
mechanobiology being a significant driver.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference
program includes podium sessions with keynote and topical invited speakers,
including both women and members of underrepresented groups. The primary
objective of the meeting is to broaden the boundaries of current capabilities in
cell and molecular bioengineering through pursuit of fundamental research,
development of novel techniques and biological models, and translation of these
discoveries into real-world technology and medical applications. The conference
will introduce and integrate a diverse group of engineers and basic scientists
possessing clinical and/or entrepreneurial experience. Invited speakers and
keynotes will discuss how they bridge the gap between fundamental research and
translation in their specific fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
