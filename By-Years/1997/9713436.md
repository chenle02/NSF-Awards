This is a study to quantitatively test the capabilities of a widely-used model
of ionospheric plasma convection by comparing predictions to in situ
electrostatic measurements from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program
(DMSP) satellites. One of the critical needs of space weather forecasting is a
reliable model of the polar cap ionospheric electrostatic potential distribution
pattern and the cross cap potential drop as they respond to changing conditions
in the solar wind. To date the most comprehensive model is one using a spherical
harmonic expansion based on data from the Dynamics Explorer-2 satellite. The
investigators will evaluate this model to provide quantitative descriptions of
the deviations from in situ DMSP satellite measurements as a function of
interplanetary magnetic field variability. They will compare observed and
predicted potential distributions along the satellite tracks to quantify
differences attributable to time variations and real variations from the model.
Ultimately, this work will help develop more advanced models of the high-
latitude potential distribution for use in space weather forecasts.
