9312641 Deviche A symposium has been organized by Dr. Deviche as part of the
annual meeting of the American Society of Zoologists. This conference will focus
on the endocrine mechanisms involved in the physiological functions of artic
birds and mammals. The physiological functions include endocrine control of pre-
migratory fattening, hibernation and reproductive endocrinology. The topic,
"Endocrinology of Artic Birds and Mammals", is timely and the speakers are
considered experts in their respective fields. It is anticipated that the
symposium will be of interest to comparative endocrinologists and physiologists
as well as behavioral ecologists. ***
