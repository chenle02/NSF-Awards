This research program concentrates on designing efficient graph algorithms using
topological methods. The approaches are based on recently developed techniques
and results in topological graph theory. A topological approach is proposed to
obtain a polynomial-time bounded probabilistic algorithm solving the graph
isomorphism problem, which is one of the most important graph problems whose
complexity still remains unknown and which has many applications. The method
adopted here is to derive a complete invariant of a graph that can be computed
efficiently, based on the combination of the topological and combinatorial
structures of the graph. The project is also seeking an extension of the theory
and applications of Whitney's linear synthesis theorem for 2-connected graphs. A
concept of semi-k-connectedness of graphs is introduced, and a conjecture is
proposed that every k-connected graph has a semi- k-connected linear synthesis.
Such an extension will provide us with techniques that will find wide
applications in designing efficient sequential and parallel algorithms for such
problems as graph connectivity, graph imbedding, and graph emulation.
