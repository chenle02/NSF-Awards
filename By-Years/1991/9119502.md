The proposed research will study how muscle function and bone movement
(physiological features of organisms) correlate with structural (morphological)
and behavioral features. Most work to date has focused on animal morphology, and
relatively little research has been done on the physiological function of
features of organisms as these functions relate to morphology and behavior. In
particular, a general question of interest to comparative biologists will be
addressed: how congruent are the distributions of physiological and
morphological characteristics in organisms? The muscles and bones of the head
region in fishes will be used as a model system to investigate this question.
With nearly 23,000 species, ray-finned fishes comprise more than half of all
vertebrates, and have proven to be an excellent model system for the study of
animal function in the past. In addition, many of the fish groups to be studied
are of considerable economic importance while others occur in regions of the
world where there is great concern for the loss of biodiversity. This research
will contribute to our understanding of (1) the utility of physiological data
for testing comparative hypotheses in biology, (2) the biomechanics of bone and
muscle function in vertebrates, and (3) our understanding of the biodiversity of
the largest group of vertebrates.
