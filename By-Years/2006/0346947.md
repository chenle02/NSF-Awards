The demand for ethylene, one of the highest production chemical commodities in
the world will exceed 100 million metric tons by 2010 as products derived from
ethylene are displacing conventional materials in packaging, building,
automotive and other applications. High temperature pyrolysis of hydrocarbons
has been practiced for over a half century and still over a half billion dollars
of Fe-Ni-Cr based tubular products are consumed each year. The culprit,
catalytic coke formation, leads to increased tube wall temperature, poor heat
transfer, increased pressure drop, inner tube diameter reduction, and tube
plugging. The combination of in- service operation and decoking cycles has
reduced tube life by 4-6 years. &lt;br/&gt;This Faculty Early Career Development
(CAREER) award will concentrate on improving process efficiency by (1) limiting
catalytic coke formation by applying adherent SiC coatings via pulsed laser
deposition to the inner diameter of tube material traditionally used for
ethylene pyrolysis service, (2) determining what microstructural changes the SiC
coated Fe-Ni-Cr tubing undergoes during service, and (3) determining what
influence changes in microstructure have on the life of the tubing. Since
diffusion underlies the self- healing mechanism of coatings as well as the
mechanism of coating degradation by interdiffusion with the substrate, knowledge
of the diffusion characteristics of the system is of fundamental importance.
&lt;br/&gt;The program will also establish a foundation for a lifetime of
educational excellence through improved pedagogy, curriculum development,
outreach, and mentoring. This effort is highlighted by the ASM endorsed
Northeast Teachers' Training Camp beginning in 2004 under the PIs
direction.&lt;br/&gt;
