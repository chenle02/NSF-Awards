The Seventh United States National Conference on Wind Engineering will be held
on the campus of the University of California, Los Angeles, on June 27-30, 1993.
The objectives of the conference are: to stimulate the exchange of knowledge and
information about activities in disciplinary and interdisciplinary research
areas; to transfer this information to practitioners; to seek their input on
what are the results of research they need for rapid utilization; to determine
gaps in knowledge especially for complementary research areas; and in discussing
new directions for research. The presentations will consist of invited papers
and papers selected from abstract submission. Proceedings will be published from
the papers received.
