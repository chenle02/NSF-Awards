0305949/0306269 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Matthias Felleisen (Northeastern
University)&lt;br/&gt;Shriram Krishnamurthi (Brown
University)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the past few years, the Web has evolved
from a static medium into a dynamic one. Many Web sites now enter into
interactive dialogs with consumers. Unfortunately, the existing technology for
building&lt;br/&gt;interactive Web services is inherently flawed. As a result,
many Web programs are broken and cannot keep up with consumers' actions in Web
browsers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators propose to investigate the
foundations of Web services. Specifically, they will develop models of
interactions on the Web; they will use the models to study common errors in
interactive Web&lt;br/&gt;programs; and they intend to develop protection
mechanisms against such errors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposers also intend
to translate their theoretical designs into working prototypes. They intend to
use their existing server and Web programming infrastructure to implement type
systems and run-time checks&lt;br/&gt;for CGI scripting (`a la Perl) and servlet
programming (`a la Java). They will port some existing Web applications
(including conference management, workshop registration) to this new software
infrastructure and will thus test the practical validity of their efforts.
Consequently, they expect to improve the quality of an increasingly critical
medium of communication and commerce.&lt;br/&gt;
