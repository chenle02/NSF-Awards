9411945 Pienkowski This Equipment Grant proposes the purchase of an electronic
controller (with computer related accessories) for a servohydraulic biomaterials
test system that is dedicated to support research in biomaterials engineering.
This device will regulate the movement of a hydraulically driven piston which
pulls or pushes on a test specimen, measures the force exerted on the specimen
and the change in length of the specimen, and calculates specific engineering
materials properties. Materials engineering research techniques provide
fundamental knowledge regarding the causes and treatments for osteoporotic bone.
The proposed equipment will also create new opportunities for hands-on-
involvement of undergraduate students in ongoing research projects. ***
