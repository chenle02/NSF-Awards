The South Atlantic appears to be the locus of a broad boundary between two
major geochemical provinces of the earth's mantle. The DUPAL anomaly centered
over the South Atlantic may be the result of contamination of the asthenosphere
either by delamination of sub- continental lithosphere during the breakup and
scatter of Gondwanaland or from the dispersal of mantle plumes of deeper origin
within the earth. A 38-day cruise to dredge the Mid- Atlantic Ridge and adjacent
seamounts from about 41S to 52S will be conducted. The post-cruise analytical
program will provide a means to study the isotopic and geochemical nature of the
DUPAL boundary, delineate the possible effects of the Gough, Discovery, and
Shona off-ridge hotspots on mid-ocean ridge volcanism and its budget, and
further evaluate the merit of two competing hypotheses: the plume dispersion
model and the delamination of the sub-Gondwana continental lithosphere.
