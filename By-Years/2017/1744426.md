With the increasing use of autonomous systems in society, such as self-driving
vehicles, issues of ethics becomes paramount. The proposal seeks to bring
researchers in AI and Robotics together with researchers in ethics and the law
to discuss the relationships between research in ethical, legal and social
implications (ELSI) and research in technological development and design. The
focus of the workshop will be both on the ethics and legality of using
autonomous systems and on how to imbue autonomous systems with a set of ethical
behaviors. The workshop will discuss the issues and how NSF can promote
interdisciplinary work between technologists and ethicists in the ELSI arena.
Approximately 30 researchers in AI, robotics, ethics and the law, together with
regulators and industrial people from the automotive industry will be invited.
The one-day format, which will be held at Stanford University, will include
lightning talks by participants, several breakout sessions, and work towards an
executive summary and electronic reference guide on ?best practices? for such
collaborative research.
