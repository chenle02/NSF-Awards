The proposal aims to provide participant support for about a dozen young US
based mathematicians to attend an advanced school/workshop on Random Matrices
and Growth Models at the International Center for Theoretical Physics, Trieste,
Italy from September 2 till September 13, 2013. The main topics to be covered at
the program are the universality of local distribution of the eigenvalues of
large random Hermitian matrices, spectral properties of non-Hermitian random
matrices, and recent advances in random growth models and interacting particle
systems. The topics of the program have many important applications in
statistics, nuclear physics, theoretical computer science, and population
biology. The proposal will allow to attract talented young mathematicians (with
emphasis on gender equality and minority participation) to this exciting and
rapidly growing area of research.
