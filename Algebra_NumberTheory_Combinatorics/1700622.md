Extremal combinatorics is a central area of combinatorics and has experienced an
impressive growth in recent few decades. It deals with the problems of finding
the maximum or minimum value of a function over a class of finite objects. Such
problems are often related to other branches of mathematics and other fields of
science, including biology, chemistry, computer science, information and coding
theory.

Classical extremal problems, such as Sperner's theorem and Turan's theorem,
consider the size of a set system or graph. On the other hand, results such as
Dirac's theorem on Hamilton cycles and the Hajnal-Szemeredi theorem, consider
the minimum or maximum degree of a graph. The proposed research considers degree
versions of several classical results in extremal set theory, including the
Erdos-Ko-Rado theorem and the Kruskal-Katona theorem. An obvious difficulty
towards solving these problems is that the shifting method, an important tool in
extremal set theory, can not be applied. The project also considers degree
versions of two well-known difficult problems in extremal (hyper)graph theory:
the clique density problem and hypergraph Turan problem. Lastly, extending
Dirac's theorem to hypergraphs has attracted much attention in recent years, and
the PI will continue his research on this topic. The tools that the PI will
apply to attack these problems include the algebraic method, probabilistic
method, flag algebra method, absorbing method, and regularity method.
