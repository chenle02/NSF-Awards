Parallel Computing for Undergraduate Faculty The purpose of this project is to
prepare undergraduate faculty to teach parallel computing. When participants
have completed the course which we will offer, they will be prepared to add
parallel computing to their curriculum, either by integrating topics on parallel
computing into existing courses or by teaching one or more courses specifically
on parallel computing. In addition, participants will be ready to assess the
feasibility of establishing a parallel computing laboratory at their own
college. The course will begin with an intensive two-week session in the summer
of 1997. This course will include lectures surveying the broad scope of parallel
computing and instruction on the design and implementation of parallel
algorithms. About half of the course time will be spent on hands-on development
and implementation of parallel programs using the parallel computers at Colgate.
During the fall, participants will work on projects, with site visits from the
instructors where possible. At the follow-up session in January or February,
1998, participants will present their project results and will have an
opportunity to discuss the practical aspects of teaching parallel computing to
undergraduates. A second group of participants will follow a similar pattern
with a course in the summer of 1998, project work and a follow-up session early
in 1999.
