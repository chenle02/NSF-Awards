This Americas Program award will support a U.S.- Mexico workshop on
conservation problems of neotropical migrant birds. The workshop, jointly
organized by Dr. Steven Sader of the University of Maine and Dr. A. Estrada of
the Institute of Biology of the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM),
will advance our understanding of neotropical migrant bird ecology and develop
strategies for coordination of cooperative research, conservation, monitoring,
and training programs. The Breeding Bird Survey in North America has shown that
populations of several neotropical migrant birds have declined drastically over
the last 10 years. Various studies point to the loss of habitat both on breeding
and wintering grounds as a major cause of these declines. Because neotropical
migrants are a shared resource between Mexico and the United States, bilateral
strategies are fundamental for the conservation of these species. Expected
outcomes of this workshop are greater coordination of the monitoring of avian
populations and habitats, identification of conservation strategies, training
and research needs and of opportunities for future collaboration, and a
publication of the proceedings of the workshop.
