The Department of chemistry is introducing cooperative guided inquiry
laboratories into the general chemistry course. The students are forgoing
twelve, individually performed, traditional one laboratory period exercises in
order to work in groups on selected research oriented projects per semester.
During the course of the semester, students apply their problem solving skills
to projects approximating the research process as closely as possible. In
addition to learning how to recognize fruitful approaches to scientific
investigations and to plan experiments, the students also use both their written
and oral communication skills to critique and evaluate their results.
