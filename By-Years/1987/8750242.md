This project is to set up a new electro-optics laboratory, a field that is
emerging as one of the critical areas of telecommunications. Instrumentation
such as monochrometers, low power lasers, pyroelectric radiometers and fiber
optics communications links will be integrated into an undergraduate laboratory.
New experiments are to be developed which will strengthen undergraduate
education in the fields of lasers, fiber optics communications, electro-optical
instruments and holography.
