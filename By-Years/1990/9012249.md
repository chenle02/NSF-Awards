Professors C. Austin Angell, George H. Wolf, Stuart M. Lindsay, and Dr. William
F. Oliver are supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program to study vitrification, viscous liquids, and the glass
transition in the very high pressure regime. This research will elucidate the
behavior of a variety of important chemical systems and materials when subjected
to conditions of extreme pressure. The main thrust of this research concerns the
extension of the study of liquid states and glass transition phenomenology to
the very high pressure regime of 10 GPa where the product of the pressure and
volume are comparable to the intermolecular potential. A combination of
experimental techniques will be used to characterize such systems including the
use of ultra-high contrast Brillouin scattering in conjunction with the use of a
diamond anvil cell to maintain samples at ultra high pressures. A subsidiary
thrust of the proposal is to explore the use of pressure-induced vitrification
by destabilization of crystal lattices. Angell and co-workers conjecture that
the pressure-induced vitrification phenomenon is a spinodal collapse similar in
principle to that which terminates the liquid state at extreme negative
pressures.
