This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP) award from the
Research Facilities Office provides funds to Bermuda Biological Station for
Research (BBSR) for the repair and renovation of the Conklin Laboratories which
house research and research training activities in biology, chemistry, and
oceanography. This building was constructed in 1961 and last renovated in 1980.
The ARFMP grant of $200,000 and $238,725 provided by the grantee as cost sharing
will be used to modernize these research and research training facilities. This
project will address the need to improve the current research infrastructure so
as to strengthen existing programs and encourage more sophisticated research.
The renovation will provide high standards of power, solvent and chemical
storage, seawater, and computer network infrastructure in a location which
presents particularly difficult problems for many areas of laboratory
operations. This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by providing
an improved research and research training environment to an increasing number
of scientists and students wishing to take advantage of the key location of BBSR
for the pursuit of new initiatives in global geosciences and marine molecular
biology.
