The objective of the proposal is to identify, assess and prioritize the national
research needs for the civil engineering profession. The conference will be
structured and managed to go beyond the development of a long list of research
ideas. The emphasis will be to select high priority problems, and to develop a
prospectus for problem solution to each of them. The Forum will be attended by
consultants, developers, suppliers, builders/constructors, specialty
contractors, associations, researchers academics, and government agencies.
