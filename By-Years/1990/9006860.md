A laser Doppler velocimeter will be acquired for the research program on the
hydrodynamics, interphase transport and chemical kinetics of phase transfer
catalysis. The goal of the research is to develop quantitative models and
methods for the study of catalysis and related processes. The proposed
velocimeter will complete the equipment used at the University of Southern
California, Department of Chemical Engineering, to develop new organic synthesis
techniques.
