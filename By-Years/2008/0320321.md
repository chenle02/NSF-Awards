This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
develop transgenic crop plants exhibiting increased resistance to nematode
infection and damage. Present strategies for dealing with nematode infections
involve chemicals that are both toxic and environmentally hazardous. A
transgenic solution has the potential to provide economic benefit to producers
through improved yields as well as social and environmental benefits resulting
from the reduction in the use of hazardous and polluting materials. The specific
goal of this Phase I research is to genetically modify plants to express the
genes necessary for the biosynthesis of specific naturally occurring fatty acids
and to determine whether the accumulation of the fatty acids of interest in the
roots results in concomitant increase in resistance to plant-pathogenic
nematodes. Positive results in this phase of research could lead directly to the
application of this transgenic technology to economically relevant crops.

The commercial application of this project is in the area of nematode control
products for use in agriculture and horticulture. It is estimated that parasitic
nematodes cost the agriculture and horticulture industries in excess of $8
billion annually in the United States and $78 billion annually worldwide. In
specialty crop markets, nematode damage is highest in strawberries, bananas, and
other high-value vegetables and fruits. Among high acreage row crops, nematode
damage is greatest in soybeans and cotton. Many of the currently available
products for nematode control are highly toxic, expensive and cumbersome to
apply, and also represent significant risks to the environment. Most of the
chemical nematicides will become unavailable in the near future, mainly for
environmental reasons. For instance, methyl bromide is a significant contributor
to ozone depletion and will be banned in the U.S. in 2005. Transgenics for
nematode control in soy, corn and cotton would likely have favorable market
acceptance, since a large proportion of these U.S. crops are already genetically
modified for herbicide resistance and insect control.
