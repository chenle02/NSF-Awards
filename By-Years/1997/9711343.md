This project involves the research of a cultural anthropologist from the
University of California-San Diego. The goal of the research is to develop
methods for the identification and measurement of American, Mexican, and
Japanese cultural orientations, defined as cultural models which have strong
psychological significance for individuals. Three different methods for the
assessment of cultural orientations will be studied: ratings of statements,
ratings of single terms or phrases, and intensive interviewing of s small sample
of respondents. Native born Americans, Mexicans and Japanese respondents living
in southern California will be sampled. If successful, this basic,
methodological project will provide anthropologists and other social scientists
with a conceptual framework and set of empirical methods by which persons can be
assessed to determine which aspects of their cultural have become internalized
into psychologically significant ways of understanding and reacting to the
world. This research is important because it will advance our understanding of
fundamental issues of how people orient themselves to their reality, and how
they feel about the information they deal with.
