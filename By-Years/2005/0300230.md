This award supports six US participants in the second Asia-Pacific Advanced
Studies Institute, to be held in Canberra, Australia in October 2002. Other
participants in this regional meeting are expected from Japan, China, Taiwan and
Korea, as well as the host country. By design, meeting participants will include
both eminent scientists and postdoctoral researchers from all of these
countries, with the goal of increasing future collaborative interactions among
them. The subject of this meeting is "The Genome-Phenome Link", an important new
interdisciplinary area of molecular bioscience. Speakers will address leading
edge perspectives on this topic from the fields of bioengineering, biomedicine,
agriculture and environment. They will also discuss model systems being used and
the latest developments in new research tools including genomics, proteomics,
phenomics and bioinformatics.
