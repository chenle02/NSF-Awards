This award in the Environmental Geochemistry and Biogeochemistry Program is made
to Dr. Susan L. Brantley, Department of Geosciences, and Dr. Carol G. Pantano,
Department of Materials Science and Engineering, both of Pennsylvania State
University, for research on weathering of hornblende. The work is jointly
supported by the Division of Chemistry and the Division of Earth Sciences. The
rate of etch pit development and the rate of dissolution of hornblende under
laboratory conditions will be studied and compared to hornblende etching rates
observed in soils. The effects of bacteria on hornblende dissolution will also
be investigated in order to isolate direct and indirect microbial interactions
with the mineral surface. Changes in the surface will be analyzed using x-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy and secondary ion mass spectrometry. Not only will
the rate of hornblende weathering be determined, but the role of oxygen,
acidity, pit formation, and bacterial reactions will be determined. Dissolution
of hornblende is the principal source of iron and magnesium to natural waters
from soils developed on granite lithologies and is a contributor to reduction of
atmospheric carbon dioxide reduction through silicate weathering. Methods from
geochemistry, materials and microbiology will be used to achieve an integrated
understanding of the nature of hornblende weathering in the field and to develop
a model that can be used in laboratory investigations.
