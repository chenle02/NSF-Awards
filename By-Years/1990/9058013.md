Rates of chemical reactions on metal surfaces are simulated using a dynamic
Monte Carlo formalism. The initial emphasis is on the adsorption step, with an
attempt to predict the formation of islands and other nonstatistical patterns
caused by adsorbate-adsorbate interactions, and on the effect of such
interactions on the apparent (experimentally observable) activation energies of
bimolecular reactions. The work will be extended to thermal desorption systems
as well. The ability to predict to effects of index plane on the rates of
various surface processes would be of great help both in the design of new
selective catalysts and in the design of catalytic reactors.
