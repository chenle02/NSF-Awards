Since 2003, the ACM International Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor
Systems (SenSys) has served as a high caliber, cross disciplinary forum for
research on systems issues in embedded and networked sensors. SenSys, a single
track forum, addresses issues that span multiple research areas, including
wireless communication, networking, operating systems, architecture, low power
circuits, distributed algorithms, data processing, scheduling, sensors, energy
harvesting, and signal processing. Student participation in top research venues,
such as SenSys, is critical for a vibrant research community. Further, students
often have limited sources of funds to travel to conferences. Bringing students
together with experienced practitioners enriches existing research projects and
creates new collaborations. Travel grants will be awarded based on need. This
award will support to cover travel and conference registration expenses for
twenty students and help increase the representation and participation of
graduate students in SenSys.
