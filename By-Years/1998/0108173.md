Two distantly related plant families, the Solanaceae (potato family) and
Rosaceae (rose family) use the same molecular method to reject self pollen. This
project will examine diversification at the self incompatibility (S-) locus in
the Rosaceae to test hypotheses about differences in S-allele evolution in the
two families. Preliminary data indicate that alleles in the Rosaceae are quite
young and that non-overlapping sets of alleles occur in the two subfamilies
investigated. This stands in stark contrast to the lack of turnover and ancient
alleles seen in the Solanaceae. This project will determine if these differences
generally hold or are peculiar to the groups of Rosaceae that have been sampled
and evaluate equilibrium and non-equilibrium hypotheses to explain family-level
differences. This project will also use sequence and gene structure information
to determine whether use RNases for self incompatibility in these two families
is due to common ancestry or parallel evolution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Loci
involved in self-nonself recognition exhibit the highest levels of genetic
variability known. Examples include the self-incompatibility loci of flowering
plants, fungi, and clonal marine invertebrates, and the disease fighting major
histocompatiblity loci (MHC) of humans and other vertebrates. Extreme
variability is due to the types of selection, generally called balancing
selection, that act on such genes. Understanding the evolution these genes is
important for many fields. First, the much greater time depth of variation
allows historical inference that reaches farther back in time than is possible
when using other genes. Second, analysis of diversification patterns at these
genes provides information on the selective forces that drive their evolution.
Third, examination of patterns of selection at the molecular level provides
insight into as yet poorly understood aspects of the molecular basis of self
recognition. &lt;br/&gt;
