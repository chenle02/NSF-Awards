This project addresses a new and unique technique for estimating the daytime,
vertical ExB drift velocities in the equatorial ionospheric F region from
ground-based magnetometer observations. It has recently been demonstrated,
quantitatively, that the strength of the daytime upward ExB drift velocity is
linearly related to the difference between the horizontal H component values
measured by a magnetometer located on the magnetic equator and one 6 to 9
degrees away in latitude. This project plans to extend the results of this
unique finding by asking the fundamental question: How does this delta H versus
ExB relationship vary with season, geomagnetic activity and solar activity? An
answer to this question provides answers in turn to a variety of space weather
scientific questions as well as applying the technique, immediately, to
Operational Real Time Ionospheric Specification and Forecast Models currently
under development in support of civilian and military customers.
