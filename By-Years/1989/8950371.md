This project is to develop a laboratory course in fermentation processes, an
area of biotechnology that has been neglected, and one in which trained
Bachelor's level people are in great demand. The laboratory involves exercises
in: 1. fermentation processes from shake- flask stage to scale up in
minifermentors; 2. culture selection, maintenance and management; 3. product
analysis and recovery. The fermentation equipment request is for a series of 1
to 2-liter fermentors ranging from basic to computer-interfaced, as well as for
auxiliary equipment (waterbaths, lyophilizer, freezer) to be used for inoculum
preparation, culture, and product management. It will add to the students'
ability to gather and analyze fermentation process data as well as to understand
the physiological processes involved. This course could serve as a model for
biotechnology training at the undergraduate level. The university will provide
50% matching funds.
