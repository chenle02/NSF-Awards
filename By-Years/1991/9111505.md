This is a Research Equipment Grant for a laboratory to do measurement of fast
voltage transients. The funds will be used to purchase an opto-electronic
voltage probe, an optical transmission line, and ancillary equipment. The
equipment will be of immediate benefit in two projects: 1) Laboratory simulation
of lightning-induced voltages on overhead power lines; and 2) Effects of non-
standard voltage waveshapes on impulse strengths of dielectric systems.
