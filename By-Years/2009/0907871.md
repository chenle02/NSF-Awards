SGER: Lake Faunas Through Time: Tracking Clades onto
Continents&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lisa E. Park, EAR-0907871&lt;br/&gt;University
of Akron&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;PI requests funds archive her
lakes through time database in two NSF supported database efforts, Paleostrat
and Paleobiology Database. The nature and scope of this data will allow many
questions key to the history of life to be addressed, including: 1) how does
lake faunal diversity in the Paleozoic, Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras compare with
the biodiversity patterns from the marine realm? 2) do lake faunas follow the
logistic, additive or exponential model of diversification? 3) what happened in
lakes during mass extinction events such as those found at the Permian/Triassic
or Cretaceous/Tertiary boundaries? Since most modern diversity is found today in
continental environments, answering these and other questions will allow the
community to better understand modern biodiversity and how it might be impacted
by climate change and other anthropogenically-driven change. The database has
the potential to revolutionize how we look at the history of life on Earth and
it will catalyze advances in our understanding of biological evolution as a
whole. Therefore this request satisfies at least one of the five criteria for
awarding a SGER. &lt;br/&gt;
