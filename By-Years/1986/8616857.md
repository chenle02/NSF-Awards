This project will continue the development of computerized analysis of
bioacoustic signals. Many animals use sound for communicating, and research on
vocal learning in some non-human species provides models for understanding
speech development in humans. Despite this importance, there are few rigorous,
standardized methods for describing bioacoustic signals, or for quantitatively
assessing and comparing animal vocalizations. A wide variety of techniques are
used now, and many are very laborious, difficult to repeat, and often depend on
subjective interpretation. This work will further develop computer-aided methods
for quantitatively analyzing animal vocalizations. The research is designed on
two related fronts. 1) Advanced, standardized signal processing techniques will
be constructed, to serve as tools for the description, storage and comparison of
such sounds. These techniques will provide a quantitative base for laboratory
analysis of auditory perception of communication sounds, or for field data on
vocal communication in a wide range of animals. 2) These techniques will be used
to examine vocal development in a well-studied songbird that learns its specific
song. Vocal learning in songbirds has become better understood recently because
of new anatomical and neurochemical information. The specific pathways have been
outlined between parts of the brain involved in song production and hearing, and
specific hormones and neurochemicals have been found to affect the production
and perceptions of the song. These techniques will allow the complex vocal
sounds of the song to be analyzed as the individual components of the song
develop during learning. This approach promises to provide a novel productive
way of investigating complex vocal behavior during learning, and will have
impact on the fields of speech and communication as well as auditory perception
and bioacoustics.
