There is a need for the development of computational aids to design which
permit engineers to progress beyond the automation of inefficient heuristic
design procedures currently in use. This research will investigate the
development of a model which includes normative as well as descriptive decision
making techniques. A clear distinction is made between objective and subjective
considerations, and each is dealt with in an appropriate manner. Subjective
judgments and assumptions embodied in the rules, but which may not be applicable
to a particular set of decision makers or situations, will be separated from the
objective judgments, preventing unnecessary constraints from being met. The
result will be the capability to tackle previously inextricable problems, and to
create vastly improved solutions to current design problems.
