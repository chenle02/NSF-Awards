9411928 Shanks This equipment is to be used for research to maximize the
production of pharmaceutical compounds from genetically- transformed "hairy
root" plant cultures of Catharanthus roseus. The HPLC photodiode array will be
used to identify and quantitate alkaloids obtained from C. roseus. This
equipment will also be used to fingerprint the specific composition of a
recombinant protein obtained from a genetically engineered Escherichia coli. ***
