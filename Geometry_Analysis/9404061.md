9404061 Katok The topics covered in the proposed plan of research cover
geometric rigidity in classes of dynamical systems. These include
classifications of Anosov actions of certain groups and various kinds of smooth
actions of lattices on semi-simple Lie groups. Areas of smooth ergodic theory
relative to dynamical systems are also planned for investigation. The research
has potential applications to other areas of dynamical systems theory and
mathematical physics. ***
