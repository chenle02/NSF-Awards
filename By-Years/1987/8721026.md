The Tibetan plateau and the Himalayas are perhaps the best known example of the
effect of a large-scale continental collision. A detailed understanding of this
continental collision zone is crucial to help understanding of the development
of mature continental crust, since it is recognized that continental collision
is the essential last step in this process. The aim of this project is to
explore the mechanisms dominantly responsible for crustal thickening and
consequent uplift in the formation of a collisional plateau such as Tibet. The
work will involve study of rocks from the Gangdise, Nyaingentanglha, Damxung and
nearby areas of the Tibetan plateau. Samples will be analyzed by 40Ar/39Ar
geochronology, apatite fission track dating and U-Pb dating to provide data to
constrain the timing and rates of uplift in southern Lhasa Terrane. This will be
compared to strain data from detailed structural analysis to test several models
for the evolution of the Tibetan plateau. This research will be conducted under
the Earth Sciences Protocol between the NSF and the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
