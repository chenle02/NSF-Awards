In this research, investigations into the growth of compound semiconductors for
optoelectronic device applications will be undertaken. Initial efforts have
focused on design and construction of a crystal growth facility. The primary
first year funding of this NSF award will support a graduate research assistant
for 9 months and a technical support person for 11 months, part time. Additional
matching funds are currently under procurement. Within this first year, we
expect to obtain high purity GaAs and AlGaAs materials of exceptional uniformity
over a 3" substrate. Device structures for new lasers and other optoelectronic
components will be fabricated and tested at CHTM. Students will be trained in
the art of MOCVD and experiments directed at new materials to extend the
wavelength range of optoelectronic components.
