The research group of Dr. Wenjun Du at the Central Michigan University develops
new methodologies for preparing a new class of polymers by linking sugar units
together and investigates the conditions for controlling the degradation of
these polymers. Sugar-based polymers are potentially compatible with biological
systems and useful in biomedical applications. The degradation of these polymers
under controlled conditions to regenerate the monomers allows recycling of the
polymer products and, therefore, is environmentally beneficial. Outreach and
educational activities of this project include developing an online course on
sustainable polymer for high school teachers, partnering with the Central
Michigan Science/Mathematics/Technology Center in organizing outreach activities
for K-12 students and teachers, and mentoring graduate and undergraduate
students in research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under the support of Macromolecular,
Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of NSF, Dr. Wenjun Du aims to develop
synthetic methodogies for preparing degradable polymers by connecting sugar
units together via orthoester linkages, thereby circumventing the notoriously
challenging syntheses of O-glycosyl linkages. His research group studies the
mechanism, scope and limitation of the polymerization process, explores the
synthesis of high molecular weight sugar-based polymers by exploiting the
reverse anomeric effect, and investigates the degradation of the sugar
poly(orthoesters).
