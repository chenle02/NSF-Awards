The Privacy Enhancing Technology Symposium (PETS), established in 2000, brings
together privacy and anonymity experts from around the world to discuss recent
advances and new perspectives. PETS addresses the design and realization of
privacy services for the Internet and other data systems and communication
networks. The 2023 edition of PETS is a hybrid event with a physical gathering
held in Lausanne, Switzerland and a concurrent virtual event, from July 10â€“15,
2023.

The conference presents a valuable opportunity for researchers to share their
results and learn about the state of the art in privacy research. It also offers
Ph.D. and MS research students a unique platform to learn the recent advances in
this area and encourages them to take new initiatives, form new collaborations,
and produce additional results.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
