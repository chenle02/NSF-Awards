9312642 Andreas The proposed project is the continuation of the analysis of the
atmospheric boundary layer data set obtained in the austral winter 1992 from the
joint U.S.-Russian Ice Camp in the Weddell Sea. The collaborative field effort
resulted in a comprehensive data set describing the atmospheric boundary layer
under generally stable conditions. The analysis will be directed primarily at
evaluating the surface energy budget as the end point of the process of energy
transfer from the ocean through the ice into the atmosphere, and at studying the
air-ice momentum exchange as part of the larger scientific question of how the
sea ice cover responds to the dynamics of the atmosphere and the ocean. ***
