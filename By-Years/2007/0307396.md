AST-0307396 Haynes The process of galaxy and disk formation appears to be
sufficiently fine-tuned as to produce final configurations that obey simple
scaling laws. These relations can be used to probe the processes that govern the
structure and evolution of galactic systems, as well as providing a route to the
determination of redshift-independent distances. This research builds on
previous work on the Tully-Fisher relation and its use as a distance indicator,
by exploiting the database now almost completed. Such a rich database of
detailed digital data with uniform characteristics will allow a comprehensive
exploration of the basis for the Tully-Fisher relation within models of galaxy
and disk formation, as well as characterizing the origins and magnitudes of any
biases, corrections, and errors. A new peculiar velocity sample will permit the
derivation of the bulk flow field in and around the Local Supercluster, and thus
a measurement of the local galaxy and mass density of the Universe, crucial to
statistical studies of the influence of environment on the properties of nearby
galaxies.

The database will be made publicly available and as such will be a valuable
reference for other workers, and of considerable use for creating public
outreach displays. Students at both the graduate and undergraduate level will
participate in the analysis, following in the footsteps of previous graduate,
summer REU and undergraduate students who have worked with the investigators.
