The PI plans to study several questions in representation theory and algebraic
geometry which are related to the ``wonderful compactification'' of adjoint
groups and (more generally) the complete symmetric varieties. More specifically,
the PI will continue his work on Lusztig's G-stable-piece decomposition and the
connection to representation theory. On the geometric side, the Frobenius
splitting properties and normality of the closures of G-stable pieces will be
studied by the PI together with collaborators. On the side of representation
theory, the PI will focus on understanding the behavior at infinity of the
character sheaves.

The PI's research is in the area of representation theory. Representation theory
is an area of modern algebra concerned with understanding symmetries by means of
matrices and has many applications in chemistry and physics. The PI's work will
focus on using methods of algebraic geometry to obtain new results in
representation theory. The PI's research will hopefully reveal the close
relations between representation theory and algebraic geometry and is likely to
have an impact on both areas.
