The project develops a new curriculum to educate next-generation security
analysis. The new curriculum attempts to integrate two very distinct areas, data
analysis and security. In particular, new labs and projects in existing courses
for security are redesigned to make students naturally exposed to learn big data
processing techniques with real-world examples. For example, "large-scale
malware analytics" will be provided in Information Security Lab (CS6265), and
similarly "large-scale static and dynamic analysis" will be provided in
"Software Analysis and Testing" (CS 6340) at Georgia Tech. To broaden our
efforts, all materials and resources (e.g., new course materials, labs and
related tools) will be shared as online training modules publicly available so
that the educational communities can adopt the data-driven approach in their
education. As a result, the number as well as the quality of security analysts
can be vastly increased, and hence our government and industries can be much
more effective in securing the cyberspace.
