9312476 Fowler This research studies low-dimensional strongly interacting
magnetic and electronic systems which are increasingly important in condensed
matter physics for understanding high temperature superconductivity, mesoscopic
systems and anisotropic materials. The approach uses exact solutions, usually
solved by the Bethe Ansatz, of one-dimensional strongly interacting models which
are physically plausible. However, the exact solutions for these so- called
integrable systems are often difficult to interpret physically and apply to
higher dimension systems. Systems which will be studied during the grant period
include the XXZ spin chain, sine-Gordon thermodynamics, Calogero-type systems
and the Toda lattice. %%% The theoretical research being done on this grant uses
highly mathematical techniques to obtain exact solutions of model physical
systems. In most cases, these exact solutions can only be obtained in dimensions
lower than the three dimensions in which we live. Thus, the applicability of
these solutions to the real world is not always clear. On the other hand, it is
nearly impossible so far to obtain exact solutions of three-dimensional systems
and many materials have characteristics of lower dimensional systems. Thus,
judicious use of exact solutions in lower dimensions can help us understand
properties of real physical systems. This is particularly the case with high
temperature superconductors, certain mesoscopic electronic devices and
anisotropic materials in general. ***
