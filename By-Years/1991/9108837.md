This award supports collaboration on polycarbonate/epoxy copolymers and coating
systems between James Bell, University of Connecticut and Yu Yunchao, Chinese
Academy of Sciences' Institute of Chemistry. Polycarbonate is widely used for
optical applications such as windows in airplanes and trains, or for eyeglasses,
but has poor scratch and abrasion resistance. Epoxies are considerably harder,
but do not have the toughness and impact resistance of polycarbonate. In this
proposal, the mechanical and chemical properties of epoxy-polycarbonate reacted
systems will be investigated, as will the properties of reacted epoxy coatings
on solid polycarbonate. This research could lead to an improved composite with
both toughness and surface hardness and should help illuminate the mechanism of
toughening of high glass transition temperature polymers.
