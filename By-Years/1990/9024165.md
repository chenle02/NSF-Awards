The principal thrust of the research addresses the issue of what chemical and
structural requirements are needed to optimize coating durability, bond
strength, and surface activity. The ultimate goal is to provide improved
materials for biomedical applications. The ion beam sputter process will provide
biocompatible coatings with significantly improved properties, i.e., bond
strength, fatigue properties, as compared to currently used coating procedures.
This detailed study of material properties will provide the necessary knowledge
to optimize properties which are critical for the long- term fixation of medical
devices.
