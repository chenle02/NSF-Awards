9730627 Hutchinson The Children Designing and Engineering (CD&amp;E) Project is
developing twelve "TechEdge Topics," instructional units for grades K-5. The
units reflect apply a design and technology approach to real-world activities.
The units are intended to increase the scientific and technological literacy,
capability, and responsibility of all students. The "TechEdge Topics" for grades
K-2 and 3-5 are based upon subject matter that is both interesting to young
learners and relevant to business and industrial settings in such areas as
transportation, food, safety and security, health, utilities, and industries.
Each unit for grades K-2 is comprised of a "Guided Portfolio," a "Big Book, and
a "Teacher's Guide." Units developed for grades 3-5 each include a "Guided
Portfolio," a "Technology Education Topic Book," and a "Teacher's Guide." The
project taps the potential of business, industry, and engineering communities to
assist curriculum developers and educators in developing and disseminating
integrated science, mathematics, and technology materials. TIES Magazine and the
New Jersey Chamber of Commerce will lead in distribution of the materials after
field-testing and revision.
