This I-Corps project will explore the commercial feasibility of production of
bio-adhesive from swine manure. If successful, this technology will lead to bio-
adhesive products that can act as substitutes for petroleum-based adhesive
products, and be precursors for novel bio-based products from animal waste. The
proof-of-concept demonstration to be achieved by this I-Corps project is the
production of bio-adhesive with specified viscosity from swine manure using a
modular filtration-vacuum distillation prototype unit. Successful implementation
of the project will translate the knowledge created through a prior NSF funding
into new products. Successful commercialization of this technology will allow
40.2 million tons of swine manure produced annually in the U.S. to be used to
supply about 28 million tons of bio-adhesive for industrial carpeting,
packaging, soil stabilization, crack sealing, roofing, pavement construction and
fertilizer coating applications. Therefore, the mission of this proof-of-concept
is to bring the rapid, scalable, and cost-efficient bio-adhesive production
capabilities of the technology platform outside of the research lab and closer
to the market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project offers a unique, simultaneous
approach to 1) develop sustainable construction adhesives as a commercial
product, 2) sequester carbon from manure into bio-adhesive, 3) address problems
associated with manure management while creating a source of revenue for
farmers, and 4) create new jobs related to the production and application of
bio-adhesive. Currently, the ability to safely dispose of large amounts of
manure limits the growth of swine farms. Development of bio-adhesive from manure
will offer a solution for swine manure management while providing a renewable
construction material. Therefore, this technology can result in major, positive
environmental and economic impacts in both the agricultural and construction
sectors.
