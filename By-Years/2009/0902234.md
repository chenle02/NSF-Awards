Understanding the relationship between the geometry of a space and the spectra
of natural geometric differential operators on the space is a problem which
arises in a number of branches of science. Individual eigenvalues are hard to
analyze and often the geometry of a space is more clearly reflected by certain
weighted averages of the eigenvalues such as zeta invariants. Okikiolu is
proposing to study both the general theory of zeta invariants and special cases
which are of particular physical and geometrical
relevance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this research is to increase our
understanding of the geometric significance of zeta invariants for future
physical and geometrical applications.&lt;br/&gt;Okikiolu proposes to continue
to make her research accessible to undergraduates through student seminars and
colloquia, and to further integrate research into the undergraduate experience.
She seeks to:&lt;br/&gt;a) motivate course material with accessible examples and
calculations taken from her own research,&lt;br/&gt;b) create opportunity for
students to collaborate on building proofs in the classroom,&lt;br/&gt;c) foster
collaborative intellectual curiosity.&lt;br/&gt;This will hopefully produce
students who have a deeper understanding and appreciation for the
subject.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
