This research project concerns the modeling, analysis, and numerical exploration
of deformations of mechanical and biomechanical systems, in particular highly
deformable thin-surface structures and solids. These occur naturally in bio-
molecular systems and also in man-made thin films and elastomers. Lipid-bilayer
membranes are ubiquitous in bio-molecular systems, and the accurate modeling and
prediction of their mechanical response under external stimuli is crucial for
understanding the behavior of cell function and also that of liposomes, the
latter of which can be used as vehicles for nutrient and drug delivery.
Likewise, a fundamental understanding of the nonlinear response of highly
deformable structures and materials is important, for example, in the design of
sensors as well as for many other engineering applications. The research aims to
provide new classes of continuum-mechanical models and novel approaches to their
mathematical analysis, leading to a quantitative understanding of the behavior
of such systems.

This project centers on the modeling, computation, and analysis of highly
deformable, thin elastic structures and solids. In particular, classes of
problems for incompressible solids, thin elastic surfaces, two-phase lipid-
bilayer vesicles, and generalized rod models will be addressed. The main goals
of the work are: (i) to provide new classes of continuum-mechanics-based models,
(ii) to systematically find global equilibria as loading and other parameters
vary and assess their stability (local energy minima), and (iii) to identify new
phenomena. Goal (ii) entails rigorous existence results as well as systematic
numerical computation. In particular, the former will entail addressing new
questions in both partial differential equations and the calculus of variations.
Goals (i) and (ii) inform and enrich the other; goal (iii) is enabled by goals
(i) and (ii). The proposed work is highly interdisciplinary, requiring tools and
perspectives from several fields, including nonlinear continuum mechanics,
biophysics, materials science, nonlinear elliptic partial differential
equations, bifurcation theory, calculus of variations, numerical methods, and
symmetry ideas.
