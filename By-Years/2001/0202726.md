As noted in the proposal, optical networking actually encompasses a range of
technologies which are under continuous improvement. Many universities and
research organizations are currently interested in deploying a subset of these
technologies using various strategies to enhance research and
learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is for SURA to facilitate a
workshop that &lt;br/&gt;explores the current state of optical
technologies,&lt;br/&gt;assists in educating campus networking professionals
about optical technologies,&lt;br/&gt;explores current best practices involving
the deployment of optical technologies in support of advanced academic networks
at the local, regional and national level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This will be a
2-day meeting in North Carolina, December 13-14, 2001. The long-term outcome of
the conference is expected to be an Optical Networking Cookbook. &lt;br/&gt;
