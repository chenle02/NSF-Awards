Bioremediation is an emerging technology which exploits the natural degradative
processes of microorganisms for the purpose of cleaning up chemical wastes.
Although several case studies have reported impressive results, for example the
restoration of the Alaskan coastline following the recent oil spill, the
processes controlling the rates of chemical degradation are not well understood.
One aspect which has not been fully investigated is the role of bacterial
population migration. Motile bacteria are able to move in response to chemical
gradients toward beneficial substances and away from substances which may be
detrimental to their survival. The purpose of this study is to determine the
significance of bacterial migration in bioremediation processes and its
potential for accelerating the overall rate of chemical degradation.
Experimental studies will measure bacterial motility and chemotaxis in terms of
population parameters derived from known cell mechanisms for a model system such
as Pseudomonas and benzene. These parameters will be incorporated into
mathematical models describing bacterial population dynamics to determine their
effect on the population. The results will be used to determine the feasibility
of this type of study and approach and also provide direction for the
development of a research program in the area of bioremediation.
