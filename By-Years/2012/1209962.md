This action funds Christopher A. Rokicki of University of Florida to conduct a
research project, entitled "Practical implications of the regeneration of ion
exchange resins for water treatment" during the summer of 2012 at the Australian
Water Quality Centre in Adelaide, Australia. The host scientist is Dr. Mary
Drikas.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is an investigation of how ion
exchange resins from full scale treatment processes are regenerated into the
bicarbonate form. Additionally chloride-form and bicarbonate-form resins are
being investigated to explain how they preferentially remove certain organic
matter fractions. This research provides further insights into the chemistry of
ion exchange processes and how they differ with the reuse of resins when in the
chloride- or bicarbonate-form.

The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-
hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science,
science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
