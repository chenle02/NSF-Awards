This U.S.-Polish project will provide U.S. undergraduate and graduate students
opportunities to conduct collaborative research at the joint Polish/US atomic
physics and photonics laboratory at Jagiellonian University in Krakow. Short
visits will also be made to the University of Latvia in Riga. The research
activities will be in the field of modern atomic and molecular spectroscopy and
applications of near-resonant nonlinear-optics systems to sensitive measurements
of electromagnetic fields. The principal investigators are Dr. Dmitry Budker
from the University of California - Berkeley, Wojciech Gawlik from Jagiellonian
University in Krakow and Marcis Auzinsh from the University of Latvia.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project in physics research fulfills the program
objectives of bringing together leading experts in the U.S. and Central/Eastern
Europe to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong
mutual interest and competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and
mutuality of benefit. The project will also provide U.S. students with a global
perspective and opportunities for professional growth through international
cooperative research training, networking and mentoring.
