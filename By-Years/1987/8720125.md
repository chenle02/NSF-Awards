This small project is to aid in defraying costs for young researchers at the
postdoctoral level to participate in a week- long intensive conference on
neutrinos in particle physics and astrophysics. This project will help ensure
that some of the most promising of junior U.S. scientists (experimental and
theoretical) in the field have a first hand opportunity to be current on its
rapid development and this will contribute to U.S. "competitiveness" in it.
