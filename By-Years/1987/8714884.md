Popper and a graduate student will analyze many years' worth of photographic
spectra of binary stars in order to determine stellar masses and other stellar
parameters. The mass of a star determines nearly all of its characteristics
including its size, temperature, and lifetime. Observationally, stellar masses
can be obtained when two stars orbit about each other, each attracted by the
other's gravity. Popper will analyze a large collection of photographic spectra
of binary stars in order to extract masses and other fundamental parameters.
