This award supports the creation of a new Research Experience for Undergraduates
(REU) site at the University of South Carolina. This site will provide a 10-week
summer research experience for 8 participants. The REU site will leverage the
expertise of the USC Physics and Astronomy faculty in areas of nuclear and
particle physics, nanotechnology, and theoretical/computational modeling to
advance the understanding of the fundamental physical interactions that govern
the structure and substance of matter on microscopic and microscopic scales. In
addition to research, participants will engage in weekly educational activities,
which will teach research strategies, ethics, and career strategies. Planned
social activities will build a sense of community among mentors and
participants. The summer will conclude with a symposium, during which
participants will present their research findings in both a poster and an oral
presentation. The presentation materials are designed such that participants
will leave the program with the materials necessary to present their research at
national and regional meetings.
