This project is a collaborative study of flame assisted SiO2 formation and
deposition for use in the Outside Vapor Deposition (OVD) process of forming SiO2
boules for producing optical fiber. An attractive new method, called Electrin
Field Enhanced Deposition (EFED), to enhance the deposition rate of SiO2 using
an electric field is a major topic of study. The scientific goal of the research
is to determine scaling laws for designing optimal flame configurations and for
understanding the effect of operating parameters on the deposition process. The
methodology combines numerical and analytic modeling with experimental
measurements. Benefits of the research include an enhanced ability to predict
the effect of changing operating parameters and geometry on the deposition rate
and efficiency and the potential addition of a valuable new method for enhancing
deposition. Although the study focuses on the OVD process, the results should be
valuable in obtaining an improved understanding of other silica deposition
processes and configurations and other flame deposition processes such as
silicon carbide surface hardening and titanium dioxide paint production.
