Significant resources in research support and effort have been expended on the
problem of earthquake hazard mitigation over the past twenty years. Most of this
research effort has been directed toward questions of geophysical research and
structural engineering. This expenditure of effort has been entirely appropriate
in terms of advancing scientific understanding of the underlying phenomena
responsible for earthquake losses. The tragic fact is that earthquakes continue
to consume human beings. The specific mechanisms of death and injury in
earthquakes have not yet been the subject of extensive study. In particular,
very little is known as to what distinguished those who survive from those who
do not. As yet, there is no effective field of earthquake injury epidemiology
and prevention. While there have been indications of promise and interest from
individual researchers in several fields, this topic has suffered the fate of
many transdisciplinary problems. It has been dealt with peripherally by several
disciplines, but not accepted as the central responsibility of any particular
research group. An international workshop on the epidemiology of injuries in
natural disasters will be organized. The purpose of the workshop is twofold:
evaluation and discussion of existing information from past events, and the
formulation of a practical set of guidelines for future data collection.
