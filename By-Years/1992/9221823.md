PARALLEL PROCESSING IN A NEURAL NETWORK The goal of the proposed research is to
gain further insight into mechanisms of parallel processing in the nervous
system. Research will focus on the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR), which
stabilizes vision by producing eye rotations that counterbalance head rotations.
The VOR is mediated by vestibular nuclei neurons (VNNs). Recent neural network
models suggest that the distributed encoding of eye-movement commands VNNs
results because VNNs operate in parallel. The underlying assumption is that
parallelism is critical to VOR function. The primary aim of the project is to
quantitatively test this assumption by studying the effects on VOR of lesioning
varying numbers of VNNs. Experimental subjects will be goldfish because they
have a suitably well-developed VOR. To generate predictions, varying numbers of
VNNs will be removed from a highly parallel and realistic model of the goldfish
VOR. The initial prediction is that VNN lesions should degrade VOR function by
increasing VOR harmonic distortion. This will be tested experimentally by
comparing VOR eye-movements before and after VNN lesions. Data will be
quantified using eye-velocity power spectra. Lesion size will be quantified
histologically. Results will be incorporated into larger and more realistic VOR
neural network models, which will be implemented on massively parallel
computers. //
