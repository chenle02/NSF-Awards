9351686 Blount Recent advances in computing hardware and software have, for the
first time, brought massive numbers of earth and space- derived data sets into
the realm of undergraduate instruction. Affordable storage and image-
manipulation hardware coupled with user-friendly analysis software for
scientific visualization are the major advances. In addition, the rapid
expansion of regional supercomputing centers and ubiquitous networks have led to
computing facility surpluses which now allow undergraduate students access to
computing time previously reserved for graduate and post-graduate researchers.
To address these realities, we are developing an interdisciplinary earth and
planetary science teaching curricula centered on coordination between formerly
disparate academic departments. To spearhead this effort, we have formed the
Earth System Science Institute (ESSI), which includes the departments of Space
Studies, Geography, and Geology. A networked undergraduate imaging laboratory is
being established for training of undergraduate earth and planetary science
students in the emerging fields of scientific visualization of multispatial and
multitemporal data sets. Individual graphics workstations are being networked to
a Cray X-MP supercomputer. The coupled hardware system is capable of both
acquiring and analyzing a suite of in-situ and space-derived data sets including
the high-resolution (1 km) multiband imaging data sets of the NOAA AVHRR sensors
acquired by our newly installed satellite ground station. The curricula includes
exercises in data acquisition, data visualization, scientific programming,
information extraction and computer modeling. Undergraduates exposed to these
curricula will be well prepared to deal with the plethora of earth and planetary
data to be generated as a part of the International Global Change Research
Program in the next decade and beyond. ***
