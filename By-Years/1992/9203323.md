This project is for the upgrade and acquisition of control electronics for a
scanning Auger microprobe and X-ray photoelectron spectrometer that was donated
to the university. This will have a beneficial effect on several different
research groups at the university and allow many others to benefit from the
facility. Examples of research projects that will make use of this instrument
are investigations of ferroelectric films, mechanical studies of structural
ceramics, analysis of Si-SiO2-metal device structures, investigations into
plasma etching, electronic materials studies examining high-Tc superconducting
thin film and bulk materials.
