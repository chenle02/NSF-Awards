The grant will support the acquisition of a Computer Numerically Controlled
(CNC) surface grinder to support an existing grant in the area of creep feed
grinding of Alumina and Zirconia ceramics with diamond wheels. Fundamental
grinding parameters have been obtained to achieve stochastic characterization of
unit load distribution and to provide quantitative analysis of the relative
importance of the material removal mechanism either by fracture or plastic
deformation. The CNC grinder will provide state-of-the-art equipment to conduct
research in the optimization of the ceramic grinding process parameters, to
achieve cycle times that are competitive with metal machining without
sacrificing the strength of ground structural ceramics. The ultimate goal is to
make ceramic grinding cost effective and to eliminate the need for secondary
operations such as lapping to finish ground ceramic components. A study of wheel
wear mechanisms in diamond wheels and the impact of wear on strength and surface
integrity of ground ceramic components will also be conducted. This should help
in formulating new compositions of diamond wheels.
