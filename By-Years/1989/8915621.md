A fundamental problem in developmental biology concerns the mechanisms by which
cells interact in a harmonious fashion such that their spatial and temporal
organization results in a functional metazoan. One such mechanism involves the
use of diffusible substances, released by one cell (or tissue) which affect the
behavior of a specific target cell (or tissue). A well documented, but poorly
understood example is that of chemotactic signalling, a seemingly ubiquitous
phenomenon in embryogenesis and development. The long term objective of this
research is to understand the biogenesis of a chemotactic signalling system. The
model system is D. discoideum, for which pulses of cAMP function as the
chemotactic signal. Production of the chemotactic signal, once initiated, is
autocatalytic. The primary focus of this research is the role of the cAMP cell
surface receptor in regulating the production of cAMP pulses. Current lines of
investigation consist of biochemical analysis of receptor phosphorylation, and
the characterization of CAR-kinase, the enzyme which specifically phosphorylates
the ligand-occupied form of the cAMP receptor in plasma membranes. The results
of this research will provide new information concerning a novel enzyme (kinase)
that phosphorylates the cell membrane receptor for the chemoattractant molecule,
cyclic AMP, and about the role of receptor phosphorylation in signal
transduction. Of particular interest is how such phenomena are regulated to
produce sustained oscillations of cAMP such that pulses of cAMP are produced.
