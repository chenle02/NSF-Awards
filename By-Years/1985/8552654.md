This research is concerned with the formation, growth, and eventual oxidation of
soot particles in diffusion flames. The work will have both experimental and
theoretical parts. The experiments will be conducted on a steady, planar,
counterflow, laminar diffusion flame. The investigated parameters will be fuel
concentration and temperature, oxidizer concentration and temperature, and
pressure level. The theoretical work will focus on modeling soot formation and
oxidation in the limit of low soot volume fraction.
