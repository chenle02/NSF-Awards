The project is concerned with developing and applying ideas from complexity
theory to three distinct but related areas of computation: Under continued
investigation are the theoretical possibilities for general purpose parallel
computers. The problem is to devise idealised high level models that are both
convenient for the programmer as well as efficiently simulated in realistic
technologies. As a distinct topic in parallel computation the computational
capabilities of brainlike models of computation are being studied. Such neural
models appear to become more distinct from other complexity models if
biologically plausible restrictions on time and space resources are imposed.
Thirdly, partly in support of this latter work, the PI will continue to
investigate the limits of what can be learned or induced, as imposed by such
criteria as polynomial time computability.
