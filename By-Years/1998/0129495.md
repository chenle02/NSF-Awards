This project focuses on the use of a regional, climate/chemical transport model
(Reg-Chem-CM) to study the sources and fate of air pollution and hazes in East
Asia. The project will combine diagnostic analyses of data from the region,
including air quality data gathered from 5 non-urban sites in China and data
from the Aerosol Characterization Experiment in Asia, with model simulations for
resolving the relevant chemical and transport processes that control the fate
and export of primary and secondary pollutants and hazes from the region. This
research will contribute to improving our understanding of the linkages between
air quality and climate change.
