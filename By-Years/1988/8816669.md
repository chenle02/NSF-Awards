Constraints on the composition of the earth's core can be obtained by comparing
shock wave equation of state and compressional velocity at high pressure data to
seismic data over the pressure and temperature range present in the earth's
outer core. Knowledge of the composition of the core is inextricably interwoven
with theories of the differentiation and thermal evolution of the earth. Recent
results from this project constrain the temperature of a core in terms of the
melting point of Fe and FeS. This award provides support for continuation of a
program of exploration and measurements of the equation of state, pressure-
volume-temperature relations of candidate core materials- Fe, FeS, and FeO. In
addition to the equation of state longitudinal and bulk sound speed at high
pressure and high temperatures using velocity interferometry and a new
preheating technology will be measured. The regime of shock measurements of
preheated samples is 1000 - 2500 K both in core materials and some minerals of
mantle.
