The Materials Research Laboratory (MRL) at the University of Pennsylvania
supports a broad, interdisciplinary program of materials research which is
currently organized into four primary thrust areas. Research on reduced
dimensionality and structure in macromolecular systems addresses the design,
synthesis and structural characterization of materials created from one- and
two-dimensional structures, with emphasis on macromolecular materials with
properties that cannot be realized in traditional crystalline or polymeric
materials. The thrust on structure and micromechanics of interfaces is
investigating the characteristics of interfaces controlling the deformation,
fracture, and fatigue behavior of multiphase materials. The research is focussed
on high temperature metallic alloys and composites, and the approach ranges from
studies of atomic and electronic structure to continuum mechanics. Research in
the surfaces and interfaces thrust aims at atomic and molecular level
understanding of surfaces and novel interfacial structures, and their influence
on chemical reaction dynamics. In the advanced polymers thrust, investigators
seek to achieve the design and synthesis of new families of organic, inorganic
and hybrid polymers of technological importance and to understand their
behavior. The University of Pennsylvania MRL also supports focussed research
initiatives to respond to special opportunities in materials research through a
multidisciplinary team approach; two initiatives currently supported address
fullerenes and materials simulation, respectively. The MRL also operates and
maintains major central facilities for materials research. It provides seed
funds for exploratory research, supports programs in education and human
resources in the materials field, and supports a range of programs involving
knowledge transfer and outreach to industry and other sectors. The MRL currently
supports the activities of about 39 faculty members, 8 postdoctoral research
associates, 52 graduate students, 22 undergraduates and 9 technical and
scientific staff members. The MRL central facilities also support a substantial
amount of research that is funded primarily from other sources. The University
of Pennsylvania MRL is directed by Professor E. Ward Plummer.
