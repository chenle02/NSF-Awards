In this project, Dr. Barsony and her collaborators will conduct an observational
survey to search for sub-stellar or planetary-mass objects in regions of star
formation. These objects, called T-dwarfs, are relatively luminous when young,
and can be detected because they exhibit broad absorption features from methane
in their spectra. The research team will conduct a wide-area infrared survey to
find T-dwarfs by imaging at the wavelength of the methane band and at an
adjacent wavelength. Objects that are faint in the methane band are likely to be
T-dwarf stars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research activity will have a broader
educational impact through the involvement of undergraduate students in the
research effort. Students will be recruited at San Francisco State University
and at Utah Valley State College (now Utah Valley University), and will have the
opportunity to visit the other institution in the collaboration. The detection
of large numbers of T-dwarfs will help improve theories of star formation,
especially in the domain between the least-massive stars and the most-massive
planets.
