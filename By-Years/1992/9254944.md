This award provides support for Mr. Kamen to explore the feasibility of
developing an interactive educational kiosk (to be named FIRST PLACE),
programmed with electronic mathematics and science games and placed in out-of-
school area such as shopping malls to reach K-12 children. Students would play
the games and be rewards with coupons. This multi- disciplinary project would
expand students access to science and mathematics, the learning into the
economy, and present learning as a leisure time activity.
