In the data translation arena, there is considerable speculation about the
relative merits of the pairwise model of data translation versus the
intermediate-form model. If translation is desired between some number of
specific encoding schemes, the pairwise model of translation requires that
translators be written between every combination of the encoding schemes, taken
two at a time. The intermediate-form model requires that a new, generic encoding
scheme be used as an intermediate vehicle. Then, for each encoding scheme, two
translators need to be written, one to and one from the intermediate encoding
scheme. These can then be composed to form a translation bridge between any two
specific encoding schemes. This project proposes two experiments to evaluate
these models of data translation. The first experiment is designed to compare
the quality of the translators in each case. The second experiment is designed
to compare the effort required to generate the translators in each case. The
ultimate goal of the work is to provide general, definitive guidelines for
choosing a model of data translation. These guidelines will allow the myriad
practitioners who do data translation to optimize their efforts by choosing the
model that best supports their individual translation environment.
