This project focuses on the study of the electronic and structural properties of
size-resolved clusters, which possess large static or dynamic electric dipole
moments. The experiments will be carried out on free clusters in beams. The
following topics will be explored: (i) the electronic surface structure of
sliver and gold nanoclusters, specifically, the screening parameters of s- and
d-electrons in the surface region; (ii) the influence of adsorbed molecules on
the optical spectra of such clusters; (iii) the formation of dipolar amino acid
zwitterions in water clusters. The broader impacts involve education of both
undergraduate and graduate students, encouragement of diversity and outreach to
local high school students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
