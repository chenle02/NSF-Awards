9528928 Bowman Microstructural design of ceramics with microstructures inspired
by nature is the key to ongoing research on hierarchical microstructure systems
for mechanical or electronic applications. The proposed project is focused on
preferred orientation and anisotropy effects on processing and properties of
ceramics. The combined processing and property analysis of textured silicon
nitrides provides a quantified correlation of orientation to anisotropy. In this
project, deliberately textured materials will be studied to provide
understanding of the mechanisms producing the texturing and the effect the
texturing will have on the resultant mechanical and electrical properties. %%%
The goal of the proposed research is to develop an understanding of how
texturing that occurs in actual components and how that texturing can be used to
optimize the properties. ***
