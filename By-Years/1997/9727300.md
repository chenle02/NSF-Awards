9727300 Hamburger This award provides partial funding (75%) for the acquisition
and field installation of Global Positioning System (GPS) stations that will be
used for measuring crustal strain associated with the displacement of magma
underneath volcanoes. The remaining 25% cost of the project will be paid by
Indiana University. Continuous measurement of vertical and horizontal
displacements of the crust above volcanoes will be achieved by installing an
array of GPS receivers in order to better understand the processes associated
with volcanic eruptions and to improve eruption prediction capabilities. ***
