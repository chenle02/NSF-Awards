on Cooperative Earthquake studies, Annex 111 Program, this project supports a
U.S./PRC/Japan Trilateral Symposium/Workshop on Innovative Lifeline Earthquake
Engineering. The meeting is scheduled to be held in May, 1994 in Xian, PRC. The
objective of the symposium is to facilitate the cooperative research on
innovative lifeline protection measures against earthquake hazards between
researchers in ORC, Japan and the United States to review progress to date with
each countries and to form future research directions and to identify
opportunities for further collaboration. During the protocol coordination
meeting in March 1993 in Washington, DC, this proposed trilateral
Symposium/Workshop has been included as a high priority cooperative activity to
be implemented in 1994 by both countries. Proceedings of the symposium will be
published and widely distributed in the research community of lifeline
earthquake engineering. ***
