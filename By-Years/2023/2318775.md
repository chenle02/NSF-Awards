The investigator has recently demonstrated that ancient DNA (aDNA) from coral as
well as coral-associated microbes can be sequenced from coral fragments up to
six thousand years old. These fragments can be readily obtained from reef cores
kept in geological collections. In this EAGER, the investigator is expanding
these results and comparing corals and their microbes from two geographic
regions and over the past few thousand years. By demonstrating the potential of
aDNA as a useful tool to unravel the history of coral populations, the project
may open up a new scientific field around coral aDNA studies. Outreach includes
press releases, social media posts, public lectures, and potentially a
documentary film. The project is supporting a female graduate student and an
undergraduate student from an underrepresented background.

Focusing on the most important Caribbean reef-building coral species, Acropora
palmata, the investigator is attempting to detect differences in the genetic
composition of coral populations and their associated microbial communities
between two locations and two time periods that are the most likely to show an
eco-evolutionary transition. Specifically, they are using cores from two
locations that harbor genetically disparate A. palmata populations, Florida and
US Virgin Islands, and time periods bounding a “reef gap” 3,300-2,900 years ago,
when A. palmata populations are thought to have collapsed. They are also
establishing the hybridization capture protocol to enrich samples with coral
aDNA and attempting to sequence aDNA from the second most-important Caribbean
reef builder, Orbicella faveolata.
