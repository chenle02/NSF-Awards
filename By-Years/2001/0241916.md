ABSTRACT

OCE-0241916



Recent studies have implied that winds over the Southern Ocean can influence
ocean circulation far away from the Southern Ocean itself. In particular, the
deep meridional overturning circulation may be driven by windstress over the
Southern Ocean. This circulation is thought to influence global climate through
the transport of heat. This study will examine how interannual variations of the
winds over the Southern Oceans may drive significant variability in the global
ocean circulation. The project will use numerical and analytical models to
consider how changes in wind intensity, or the latitude of the maximum winds
causes changes in the circulation. The variability of the deep meridional
overturning circulation has important consequences for the variability of
climate. Understanding the causes of this variability will have important
implications for climate prediction. This study has direct relevance to the
goals of the Climate Variability program.
