In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor Huw M. Davies of the Department of Chemistry at Emory
University will explore the development of new synthetic methods using
donor/acceptor carbenoids as the key intermediates. While rhodium catalysts are
well established for this type of chemistry, this study will define the new
synthetic opportunities that exist when silver and gold are used as catalysts.
The project will also expand the range of viable donor groups that can be
employed in this chemistry with a particular emphasis on the stereoselective
synthesis of novel amino acids. The new synthetic methodologies developed during
these studies could become enabling technologies that will impact other fields
of science such as pharmaceutical and materials science. The program will
contribute to environmentally benign methods for chemical synthesis as the key
reactions can be conducted with extremely low catalyst loadings and nitrogen gas
is the only by-product. In addition, this project will provide excellent
training of students, from pre-undergraduate to post-doctoral, including those
from groups historically underrepresented in the sciences.
