Abstract DBI 9750211 Catharina Casper-Lindley This action funds an NSF
Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biosciences Related to the Environment for
1997. This fellowship provides an opportunity for the Fellow to gain additional
scientific training beyond the doctoral degree and to pursue innovative and
imaginative into the fundamental mechanisms underlying the interactions between
organisms and their environment at the molecular, cellular, organismal,
population, community and/or ecosystem level in any area of biology supported by
the Directorate for Biological Sciences of the National Science Foundation. Each
fellowship supports a research and training plan to be carried out in a
sponsoring laboratory. The research and training plan for this fellowship is
entitled "Physiological and molecular analysis of photodamage accompanying
photosynthesis." Light fuels photosynthetic carbon dioxide fixation but also
damages a protein crucial to photosynthesis. This project examines the natural
rates of damage and repair of D1, the main target protein of photodamage; the
composition of the degradation complex after photodamage; and the proteins and
respective genes involved in the damage/repair cycle of D1, using mutants of
Chlamydomonas and barley.
