With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Robert Van Valin will direct a
research project to document and analyze the interaction of information
structure and syntax in selected Amazonian languages. Information-structural
distinctions may be signalled by word order, syntactic forms, morphological
markers, and prosody. While descriptive grammars often contain some information
about the morphosyntactic indicators, there have been few non-impressionistic
analyses of prosody as a signal of information structure in non-Indo-European
languages, and in particular from indigenous languages of the Americas. The
research involves a significant fieldwork component in the Brazilian Amazon on
three highly endangered languages: Piraha (Mura), Satere-Mawe (Tupi) and two
closely related Arawan dialects, Banawa and Yarawara. This research project is a
collaborative venture between the PI at the University at Buffalo, and Prof.
Daniel Everett of the University of Manchester, England.

The significance of the project lies in the description of the interaction of
information structure and syntax in these languages and of the role that prosody
plays in signaling information-structural contrasts in them. We will be
documenting facts that have never been documented from endangered languages on
phenomena of intense current theoretical interest, both within phonetics and
phonology, on the one hand, and syntax and discourse-pragmatics, on the other.
This will constitute the most extensive analysis of the interaction of prosody,
information structure and syntax done on any indigenous language of the
Americas, and as such it will be valuable both for the cross-linguistic study of
these subsystems of grammar and also for testing different theories of
information structure. The broader impact of the project will be first and
foremost its contribution to the documentation of three highly endangered
languages of the Amazon basin.
