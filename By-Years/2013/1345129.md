The goal of the project is to use space-geodetic methods to search for
precursory inflation at volcanoes in Southeast Asia. Indonesia and the
Philippines are home for about 15% of the world?s active volcanoes, which are
responsible for some of the largest known historic eruptions, including the
climate-changing 1815 Tabora, the 1883 Krakatoa and the 1991 Pinatubo eruptions.
Volcanic eruptions are inevitably preceded by the ascent of new magma to shallow
storage levels, resulting in swelling of the ground surface, which is observable
with satellites. The detection of inflation could pin-point to volcanoes, which
are more likely to erupt in the near future. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We will use
Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) observations from a variety of
international SAR satellites. The data sources include the Japanese ALOS-1
satellite which operated from 2007 to 2011, and the European Sentinel-1 and
Japanese ALOS-2 satellites which are both scheduled for launch in early 2014.
Our objective is to develop a 10-year inventory of deforming volcanoes for the
region. Scientific questions this project will address include weather all or
only particular types of volcanoes exhibit precursory inflation, whether
inflation occurs immediately prior to an eruption and for how long, and how much
inflation a volcano can sustain without eruption, and what are the controls for
the ascent of magma towards the surface and for the depth of magma storage. We
also will combine the satellite observations with ground-based observations of
the Indonesian Volcanological Survey and the Philippines Institute of
Volcanology and Seismology in an effort to improve models for the magma plumbing
systems of actively deforming volcanoes. This project will contribute to the
development of the Southeast Asia Geohazard Natural Laboratory as part of the
Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS).
