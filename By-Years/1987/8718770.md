This project will use chemical vapor deposition (CVD) to deposit YBa2Cu3Ox
coatings onto commercially available ceramic and/or metallic fiber tows (bundles
of fibers). This proposal will emphasize on the development of the coating
process and coating characterization. A CVD furnace and commercially available
reactants will be used to deposit the YBa2Cu3Ox coatings in a batch process.
Electrical, magnetic, chemical, structural, and mechanical characterization will
be performed on the coated tows.
