This represents a continuation of research previously supported by NSF grant
EAR83-19109 involving experimental and theoretical studies of the geochemistry
of igneous vapor phases. Specific objectives include (1) expansion of previously
developed models of the processes involved in evolution of magmatic vapors to
include the effects of batch vs. fractional vapor evolution, pressure-dependent
vapor/liquid partitioning of chlorine, oxygen- fugacity dependent partitioning
equilibria, and the effects of crystallization of hydrous mineral phases and (2)
further experimental studies of partitioning of ore metals (particularly
tungsten, zinc, copper, and molybdenum) among magma, vapor, and mineral phases.
The results of these studies will further our understanding of the fundamental
processes involved in the end- stages of crystallization of igneous rocks, the
evolution of magmatic vapors, and the formation of important ore deposits. This
work is jointly supported by DOE Geothermal Technology Division.
