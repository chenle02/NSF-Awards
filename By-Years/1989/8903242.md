The central focus of this mathematical research concerns problems in complex
function theory and quasiconformal mappings. One of the primary objectives of
the work is that of classifying certain groups of homeomorphisms of Euclidean
space. Among the best understood groups are the so-called Mobius groups, those
groups whose elements are represented by simplest linear (fractional)
transformations. The classification problem is one of determining which other
groups are topologically conjugate to a Mobius group and to understand what the
obstruction is that might prevent such a group isomorphism. Among the target
groups is one known as the convergence group which has many properties of groups
of quasiconformal mappings. Many convergence groups are known to be conjugate to
Mobius groups, but to date, no complete classification has been found. Work will
be done in an effort to determine the extent to which these groups all enjoy the
same properties relative to Mobius groups. A second line of investigation
concerns injectivity criteria for locally univalent functions. This work seeks
conditions which guarantee the extension of locally univalent meromorphic
mappings from neighborhoods of a domain to a quasiconformal map of the entire
complex plane. The extension is to be carried so that the complex dilatation
remains bounded by a fixed amount. There is a sizeable literature concerning
questions of this type. One specific objective of this work is to remove the
condition that the meromorphic function be holomorphic in a neighborhood of a
domain and only assume this property within a closed domain. If one drops the
condition that the initial function be meromorphic, then the extension problem
becomes too general. However, a natural condition on the cross-ratio of a
complex function within a disc leads to a more restrictive class where
quasiconformal extensions (the injectivity problem) have been shown to exist.
Work will continue in determining precise conditions on cross-ratios which will
guarantee injectivity. //
