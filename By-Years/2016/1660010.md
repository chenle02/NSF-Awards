The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to create
additives that can replace hazardous and toxic corrosion inhibitors with more
environmentally friendly alternatives. Direct costs of corrosion are enormous
both financially and also by impacting health and safety. Examples of such
health and safety impacts are due to the breakdown of the structural integrity
of buildings, the deterioration of infrastructure and the leaching of heavy
metals into water supplies. While the demand for corrosion inhibitors is
growing, some common and effective solutions are being phased out due to their
hazardous effect on environmental and human health. The corrosion inhibitor
replacements developed in this project will potentially reduce the amount of
harmful corrosion protection materials currently used to protect a large variety
of metal-based structures, such as buildings, bridges, pipelines, ships, cars,
trucks, and airplanes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project aims to advance
a novel encapsulation system for controlled release of inhibitors that provides
smart corrosion protection to metal coatings. The encapsulation enables the use
of environmentally friendly inhibitor alternatives that are currently
incompatible with coatings. It achieves this by preventing contact between the
inhibitor and the coating during coating application and providing controlled
release during corrosion-triggered events, allowing on-demand corrosion
protection. Consequently, the environmental impact of corrosion protection
systems can be decreased through the use of more environmentally friendly
materials and the reduction of the required amount of inhibitive compounds.
Further, they can be incorporated into existing corrosion protection systems
without significant changes in coating formulation or application method.
