Transposition mechanisms of Penelope-like elements are one of the last
uncharacterized mechanism of retromobility in eukaryotes. Establishment of a
tractable system to dissect the mechanism and target preferences of these
elements would not only advance our basic understanding of naturally occurring
genome rearrangements but may also help design novel gene delivery systems in
eukaryotes. The project will provide support for a summer undergraduate
internship to train a student in microbiology and molecular biology techniques
in the context of intensive summer research atmosphere at the
MBL.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Retrotransposons are mobile genetic elements, i.e.,
fragments of DNA that are inserted in the genomes of multicellular organisms,
but may replicate autonomously, using virus-like mechanisms of making RNA and
then reverse transcribing it. The two main retrotransposon subclasse are the
LTR-and non-LTR (LINE) retrotransposons and the third major subclass, named
Penelope-like elements has been found only recently and is not well-studied.
Interestingly, and unlike the other two classes of retrotransposons, Penelope-
like elements appear to locate in those regions of the genome where the
nucleotide sequence is arranged into the so-called (TA)n microsatellites, i.e.,
multiple repetitions of just two nucleotides. Such repetitions are rarely found
within active protein-coding genes, and in this project, researchers are seeking
to define the molecular details of how the retroelements 'find' where to
integrate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
