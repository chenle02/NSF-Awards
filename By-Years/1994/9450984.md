9450984 Thompson The project will purchase an FT-NMR for use in a unifying theme
of Molecular Structure: Theory, Synthesis, Characterization. This approach
involves cooperative planning among the faculty in chemistry to ensure a
sequentially significant laboratory experience with extensive student use of
instrumentation and computers as the essential molecular probes. The instrument,
along with our FT-IR, and GC-MS, and computers for molecular modeling are the
foundation of this project. Hands-on data acquisition and interpretation
experiments in NMR will be developed for all the laboratory courses beginning
with general chemistry. In upper level courses and undergraduate research,
students will be exposed to the utility of FT-NMR as a tool for probing
molecular structure and dynamics. This contemporary approach to laboratory
design and teaching, beginning at an early point in the curriculum, is expected
to attract, inform and educate the following audience: prospective students;
enrolled students in the sciences; students in chemistry, biology and physics as
well as chemistry; regional high school science teachers; chemistry faculty from
other liberal arts colleges.
