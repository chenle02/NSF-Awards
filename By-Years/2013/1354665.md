This project will explore how leaf-feeding insects may determine leaf color and
the timing of autumn leaf fall. The project challenges two traditional beliefs
about autumn foliage color: that the timing and degree of autumn coloration can
be predicted exclusively from the temperature, moisture, and day length
conditions experienced by a tree, and that the fall colors we enjoy are simply
those exposed as green pigment, in the form of chlorophyll, is degraded. In
particular, the research will test the idea that insect damage can either
advance or delay the timing of leaf loss and can alter presence of
anthocycanins, the compounds responsible for orange, red, and purple leaf
colors. By examining a suite of deciduous trees common in eastern North America,
this study will contrast how leaf damage by insects affects tree species that
use anthocyanins compared to those that use other pigments. Chemical changes in
leaves, including the production of colors, are a major way in which plants
recover necessary nutrients for growth and reproduction in future seasons.
Therefore, a second part of this research will determine how trees that differ
in the amount and timing of autumn coloration differ in how and when they
produce new leaves in the subsequent spring. A long term goal of this work is to
predict how insects change the timing of plant growth in ways that affect the
sustainability and diversity of forests.

These ecological studies will contribute to a better ability to forecast how
well trees prepare for winter. Such knowledge is critical to predicting how
biological communities of plants and leaf-eating insects in temperate forests
will change with increasing global temperatures. Additionally, it will help us
determine if insects that cause widespread damage to forests may potentially
impact fall foliage tourism revenue by delaying or decreasing autumn coloration
across the landscape. Finally, this award will support the training of graduate
and undergraduate students in interdisciplinary research in botany, entomology,
and climate change.
