It is well recognized that one of the most computationally intensive problems
encountered in the analysis and simulation of electric power systems if the
transient stability problem. Hence it is this area in which the high speed
parallel and vector computers being made available today, will find the most
applicability in the near and distant future. One current trend in increasing
the computational power of digital computing engines is to use inexpensive
moderate speed processors and medium to large scale parallelism (10-1000
processors) such as the Sequent Balance, Encore Multimax, Intel iPSC, BBN
Butterfly. Another trend is to use the more expensive high speed vector
processors and small scale parallelism (1-10) such as the CRAY and IBM vector
processors with parallel pipelines, while there are other computers with a foot
in both camps, such as the Alliant. Frequency domain based algorithms, rather
than traditional time domain algorithms, display three important characteristics
which have the potential for utilizing the specialist architectures in the
machines above. First, frequency domain techniques often lead to algorithms
which are very naturally parallelizable, whereas time domain algorithms suffer
from precedent relationships which are inherent in numerical integration schemes
and limit the amount of exploitable parallelism. Second, frequency domain
techniques applied to power system dynamics problems, often result in algorithms
which are rich in highly vectorizable inner product calculations, contrasting
the time domain algorithms, in which code vectorization is extremely limited.
Third, frequency domain data compression can be easily exploited.
