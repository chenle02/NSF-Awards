The paleoclimatic record on Hawaii contains evidence of recurring ice-cap
glaciation that has been correlated with the last 200,000 years of the marine
oxygen isotope record. Associated with these glacial deposits are sedimentary
deposits indicative of past wind intensity and direction. This proposal requests
support for a field program to study these eolian sediments, interbedded
paleosols, and tephras in order to reconstruct the glacial-interglacial history
of wind direction and intensity for this region. The results will be used to
test the validity of GCM wind simulations for the last glacial maximum. This
project will provide the first constraints on past wind intensity and direction
in the subtropical region of the Pacific basin.
