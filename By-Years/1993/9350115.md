Dr. Kroll's ongoing research seeks to test and develop a model of memory
representation in the bilingual. The model proposes that there are asymmetries
in the strength of the connections between words in concepts in different
languages that are a consequence of the manner in which the second language is
acquired. During early stages of second language learning, the second language
learner is hypothesized to rely on the first language to mediate access to
meaning. As a greater fluency in the second language is achieved, a direct
access to meaning becomes possible. The goal of this larger research is to
identify the factors that mediate cognitive change for the adult second language
learner. This project will further test the proposed model of bilingual memory
representation by examining the conditions under which transfer occurs across
languages, and by identifying aspects of individual performance in the first
language that predict the attainment of second language fluency. Interactive
activities at the host institution include: teaching a graduate seminar on
bilingualism; involving undergraduate women at the host institution in the
research project; and organizing a colloquium series and informal mentoring
seminar for graduate student women. This project furthers VPW program objectives
which are (1) to provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in
engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and (2) providing
greater visibility for women scientists and engineers employed in industry,
government, and academic institutions. By encouraging the participation of women
in science, it is a valuable investment in the Nation's future scientific
vitality.
