9318327 Dongarra This award is a software capitalization award to further
enhance the distribution of Netlib software over the internet. Netlib software
is a collection of numerical analysis software libraries. Since the initiation
of the project in 1987, more than 1.2 million accesses to Netlib software have
been made with more than 450,000 in 1993 alone. The award supports the
development of tools to: 1. Allow transparent access to a distributed set of
interoperable software repositories; 2. Allow filtering and customizing of the
information base. 3. Allow fast search and retrieval mechanisms. 4. Allow
evaluation of software repository performance. 5. Allow user contributions of
software and performance data to be incorporated into the information base. 6.
Allow auxiliary databases and services to be made available.
