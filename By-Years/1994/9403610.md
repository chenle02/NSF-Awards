9403610 Roman This award provides partial support for dissertation research
expenses of a PhD student of Dr. Paul Roman of the Horn Point Environmental
Laboratory of the University of Maryland. The graduate student, Ms. Juanita
Urban-Rich, will carry out oceanographic research in cooperation with faculty of
the University of Tromso and the University of Bergen, Norway. She will
participate in a series of research cruises off Northern Norway related to two
major Norwegian research programs on particle flux and the carbon cycle in
Arctic waters. These will give her the opportunity to collect invaluable data
for her dissertation research on the contribution made by zooplankton fecal
pellets to particle flux and carbon cycles in different geographical locations.
She will carry out experiments to measure the chemical composition and
dissolution of particulate organic carbon to dissolved organic carbon from fecal
pellets and "marine snow", an aggregate of organic and inorganic detritus. She
hopes to determine whether the two forms of detritus contribute significantly
different forms of organic carbon to abyssal waters and sediments as they decay,
due possibly to different decay rates, different composition, or differences in
the transformation of particulate to dissolved organic carbon. These data will
be compared with data she will collect in the Arabian Sea under other
sponsorship. Macrozooplankton fecal pellets and marine snow are important
transporters of organic carbon as well as nutrients, pollutants and trace metals
from the upper ocean layers to deep water and the sediments. However this
contribution can take several paths and it varies seasonally. In addition to
this contribution to vertical flux, they are an important food source for other
animals. Increased knowledge of the composition and fate of these organic
particles will contribute to improved models and understanding of global
biogeochemical cycles.
