Description: This project supports participation by Dr. A. Saeed of the
Government College, Lahore, Pakistan, and Dr. S. Murad of the University of
Illinois at Chicago in a research project dealing with the method of
nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD). The research at U. Illinois involves
the use of NEMD simulation methods to evaluate and develop techniques for
predicting transport properties, including viscosity and thermal conductivity,
of dense fluid mixtures. At the Government College it will involve the use of
the same methods for study of the structure of solids. Dr. Saeed will spend
several weeks each summer during the next two years to acquire sufficient
experience with NEMD techniques to develop the research at his home institute in
Lahore. Dr. Murad will travel to Lahore to work on the research plan, to give
seminars at the three main universities in that city, and to participate in a
one-week workshop on computer simulation techniques. Scope: This project
addresses an area of science which is gaining increased importance by utilizing
high speed computers for simulating complex engineering and scientific problems.
The area is particularly suitable for developing countries where the cost of
sophisticated experimental equipment is often prohibitive, and the use of
computer simulation is an attractive alternative. The project fits the Science
in developing Program well by allowing for the training of a scientist from
Pakistan and to have him participate in research in the U.S.
