9602952 Kakac This U.S.-Brazil Program award will support collaborative research
involving Drs. Sadik Kakac and Hongtan Liu of the University of Miami, Professor
Renato Machado Cotta at the University of Rio de Janeiro and Professor Carlos A.
C. Santos at the Federal University of Paraiba to study heat flow involving both
smooth ducts and passages with arrays of blocks simulating electronic
components. Drs. Kakac and Liu will conduct the experimental investigation and
Drs. Cotta and Santos will do the theoretical studies in Brazil. Dr. Kakac has
extensive experience in the study of transient forced convection while the
Brazilians' expertise is in the theoretical simulation of different heat
transfer problems by use of a generalized integral transform technique. By
joining efforts, they will work on an important problem of heat transfer and
develop recommendations to design heat exchangers and cooling systems for
electronic devices. ***
