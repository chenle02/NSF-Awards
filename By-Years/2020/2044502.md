The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps Hubs project is to
catalyze an inclusive Mid-Atlantic innovation network to spur the development of
deep technology startups that will have much-needed economic and societal
impacts regionally, nationally, and globally. Research universities are
positioned to support commercialization of scientific discoveries, and NSF
I-Corps accelerates the growth and impact of university-launched deep technology
ventures. The uniquely-experienced Mid-Atlantic Region I-Corps Hub team will
build on the initial success of I-Corps Nodes to continue the cultural
transformation at several of the country's top research universities to embed
innovative practices into the conceptualization and conduct of research; to
solve critical societal problems; and to create jobs, opportunities, and
economic value. This Hub project directly aligns with the goals of the American
Innovation and Competitiveness Act, which is critically important for previously
industrialized regions such as the Mid-Atlantic region as it is experiencing
significant economic turmoil due to shifts in American manufacturing industries,
compounded by disruptions due to the pandemic. Also, the Hub vision and strategy
prioritizes diversity, equity, and inclusion, particularly among
underrepresented groups and underserved minorities and minority institutions
like Historically Black Colleges and Universities
(HBCUs).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The I-Corps program curriculum is built on
scientific methods that incorporate hypothesis testing, the build-measure-learn
cycle, and continuous iteration. Multiple outcomes result from the program,
teams: change research directions, get funding from grants or private investors,
or form start-up companies and grow through revenue. Equally important, the
impact of the program accrues over many years. The Hub model enables alignment
of a systematic and comprehensive analysis of regional impacts, as well as the
programmatic, environmental, and individual factors that mediate the efficacy of
the program itself. Understanding for whom and under what conditions I-Corps
programs are most effective, and what factors contribute to or detract from this
effectiveness is critical to inform the continued growth and scaling of
I-Corps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
