This project will establish at the Colorado School of Mines a research
experiences for undergraduates site in the area of robotics and intelligent
systems. Students will be recruited from minority groups and from smaller
colleges in the Rocky Mountain states. The Department of Engineering at CSM,
which has submitted this proposal, offers a strong interdisciplinary systems
oriented program which focuses on the use of robotics and automation for space
and mining applications. The student management plans anticipate both summer and
academic year involvement for participation students during the 1990 and 1991
academic years.
