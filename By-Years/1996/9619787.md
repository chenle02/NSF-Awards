9619787 Software testing is a critical part of software development. A new
approach to software testing based on AI Planning is investigated. The
similarity of plans to test cases for some systems (e.g., command language and
transaction based systems) makes the representation well suited for test
generation. The representation encourages testers to think at a higher level
when designing tests. To exploit these potential advantages, an automated test
generator is constructed with an AI planning system at its core. This generator
allows representation of testing goals and testing criteria to support a variety
of testing tasks. The project's contribution to Software Testing is to extend
how testing goals are articulated. Its contribution to AI planning is developing
new search strategies for efficient planning, and determining how to generate
goals that conform to tester's intent, and evaluating the efficacy of using AI
planners during software testing. Tasks include 1) improve planning efficiency
for generating large tests; 2) include representation of test focus and various
test criteria to make the approach flexible; 3) represent high level testing
goals to reduce tedium for testers; 4) evaluate the efficacy of the new approach
to identify strengths and weaknesses of using AI Planning for testing. ***
