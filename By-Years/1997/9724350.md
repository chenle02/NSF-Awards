Abstract The National Center for Macromolecular Imaging (NCMI)
URL:HTTP://ncmi.bioch.bcm.tmc.edu at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) requests
partial funding to acquire a 300 keV electron microscope equipped with a field
emission gun and a liquid helium specimen stage. NCMI is a national resource
center supported by the National Center for Research Resources of NIH. Its
mission is to develop electron imaging of macromolecular assemblies near atomic
resolution. We also conduct methodology development, collaboration, service,
technology dissemination and training. The improved imaging capability will be
used in all these components of the NCMI research mission.
