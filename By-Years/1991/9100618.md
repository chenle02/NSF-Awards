This project addresses the topic of adaptive control of robots. Specifically, if
focuses on instability mechanisms in the adaptive control of robots and
teleoperators. These instability phenomena arises from external disturbances and
unmodeled dynamics. The phenomena to be investigated include slow parameter
drift instabilities, high gain instabilities, fast adaptation instabilities,
bursting, and others. Various techniques including singular perturbation theory
and averaging, integral manifolds, network theory and scattering theory will be
used to understand the basic phenomena. Experiments will be conducted on robotic
devices to test theory. Ultimately, it is expected that understanding these
instability phenomena will be a factor in the design and implementation of
robust controllers for robots.
