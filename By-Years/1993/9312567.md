ABSTRACT P.I. Erik Trinkaus/Robert Franciscus SBR-9312567 A major controversy
in anthropology surrounds the relationship (if any) of modern Europeans to
Neanderthals, who lived in Europe from about 100,000 to 30,000 years ago. Some
claim the Neanderthals were ancestors of Europeans, while others say the
Neanderthals were exerminated by the invading ancestors of Europeans. Recently,
this old controversy has once again been energized by a similar argument about
the origins of modern people everywhere - whether there was a world-wide
replacement of earlier, more primitive sorts of humans by modern invaders out of
Africa, or whether there was a gradual shift towards modernity everywhere (the
"replacement" vs. "regional continuity" theories). This dissertation project
provides for a detailed comparison of nasal anatomy among fossil and modern
human crania, which will aid in resolving this issue. The face and nose are
widely recognized as being key indicators of population relationships, and this
study will utilize the major extant examples. It is a very well conceived
project, and the graduate student to be supported is already known as an
interesting figure in the field. *** P\anthro\jfried\9312567.abs W ^_ WV+ F F v
