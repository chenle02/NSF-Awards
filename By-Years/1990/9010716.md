This is a Career Advancement Award to support Dr. Petersen's sabbatical visit
to the laboratory of Dr. Mary Lou Pardue at MIT. Dr. Petersen will take
advantage of constructs and techniques currently available in Dr. Pardue's
laboratory to study the putative role that heat shock RNA may play in regulating
protein synthesis following heat shock. These experiments will provide Dr.
Petersen the opportunity to acquire familiarity with a variety of modern
molecular biology techniques which will be applied directly to her own research
program. Given the depth of experience Dr. Petersen already has in the stress
response field, the acquisition of these new techniques and approaches are
anticipated to significantly enhance her career.
