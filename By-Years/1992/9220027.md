The principal objective of this research project is to obtain precise
determinations of the chemical equilibria that govern the observed mineral
assemblages in pelitic metamorphic rocks. Behavior of the minerals cordierite,
hematite-ilmenite, and andalusite-sillimanite at high pressures and/or
temperatures will be elucidated by phase equilibria experiments, calorimetric
measurements, theoretical modelling, and field studies. This research should
provide constraints for mineral thermochemical data and should lead to more
accurate quantification of the intensive variables of metamorphic rocks. The
results of the research will ultimately find application in studying pressure-
temperature-time paths, fluid flow, diffusion, and relations between
metamorphism and deformation.
