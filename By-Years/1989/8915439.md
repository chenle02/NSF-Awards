An extensive collection of decapod crustaceans was made on James Ross Island,
Antarctica, which provides the first record of this fossil fauna from Baremmian
into Campanian age rocks in the southern high latitudes. This time span is
particularly important because several genera with living descendants may have
evolved at this time in the Antarctic region. New taxa are also represented in
the collections which will make it possible to examine several aspects of
paleobiology. In addition to description and classification of the new species,
it will be possible to determine the amount of morphological variation within at
least two species that are now documented to have existed over a 20 million year
time span. Currently these species seem to show remarkably little change with
time. It is also probable that some of the new taxa will represent founder
species within genera that have subsequently become more widely dispersed. These
specimens, combined with those collected from New Zealand, will provide
information on the early history of a diverse, deep water, group of decapods
that are currently widely dispersed throughout the world.
