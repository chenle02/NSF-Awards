Research under relatively stable environmental conditions of the past 16 years
has shown that biological activity strongly influences soil-forming processes at
the San Dimas (California) research site. In September 2002, a catastrophic
wildfire burned virtually all of the San Dimas Experimental Forest in southern
California. This wildfire represents an extreme event that is nevertheless
characteristic of chaparral ecosystems. Because the pre-fire conditions have
been so thoroughly studied as at San Dimas, a rare opportunity is presented to
advance the understanding of post-fire soil processes. This research will
measure the initial post-fire response of biological communities and soil
processes by addressing the following hypotheses: (1) Fine-scale variation in
fuel loads created a fire severity mosaic in which recolonization by surface-
active soil fauna and microbes will proceed from minimally burned patches; (2)
Deeper-dwelling fauna were dormant in the dry soil and not immediately impacted,
but as soils wet up in the coming months, these organisms (especially
earthworms) will decline because of lost food sources, more severe
microclimates, and altered soil chemical conditions; and (3) The initial water
leaching into the soils will be highly alkaline because it passes through
overlying white ash, and will lead to clay dispersion, destabilization of soil
aggregates, a flush of waterborne clay, and increased silicate mineral
weathering rates. These hypotheses will be tested by detailed field sampling, in
situ monitoring, and laboratory analyses. These tests will identify mechanisms
that control the trajectory of soil ecosystem recovery following fires. This
research site will continue to serve diverse educational institutions through
field trips and research opportunities.
