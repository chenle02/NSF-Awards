This is a three-year cooperative project between Dr. Tim Schowalter, Oregon
State University, and Dr. Jung-Tai Chao, Taiwan Forestry Research Institute, to
study canopy Arthropod responses to storm disturbances at the U.S. and Taiwan
LTER sites. Specifically, this project will compare the arthropod response to
storm disturbances in early and late successful forests in wet temperate and
tropical forests. This is a good cross-site comparison that uses the facilities
available from LTER sites in Taiwan and the United States to study a very
important question: assessing the impacts by storm disturbances on natural
ecosystems. The proposed study could provide a basis of understanding the
process that regulates insect diversity and functional roles in wet forest
ecosystems. This project also provides an opportunity for a U.S. graduate
student to work in Pacific subtropical ecosystems. This proposal addresses an
important scientific question and meets the NSF objective of human resource
development. The National Science Council of Taiwan and the NSF jointly support
this project.
