This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of electroorganic synthesis. Professor Essie Kariv-Miller is
pursuing the use of tetraalkylammonium cations in the catalytic reduction of
organic compounds. The importance of this research lies in affording products
that would otherwise not be formed electrochemically in the absence of these
catalysts. Synthetic and electrochemical efforts are to be applied to further
the understanding of and make use of reductive organic chemistry. Cathodically
catalyzed cyclizations of ene-al and ene-imine reactants are to be explored. A
goal is to see if tetraalkylammonium cation catalysts can affect the organic
cathodic products formed in these reactions.
