In telerobotic applications, human operators interact with robots through a
computer network. This project is developing tools to prevent security threats
in telerobotics, by monitoring and detecting malicious activities and correcting
for them. To develop tools to prevent and mitigate security threats against
telerobotic systems, this project adapts cybersecurity methods and extends them
to cyber-physical systems. Knowledge about physical constraints and interactions
between the cyber and physical components of the system are leveraged for
security. A monitoring system is developed which collects operator commands and
robot feedback information to perform real-time verification of the operator.
Timely and reliable detection of any discrepancy between real and spoofed
operator movements enables quick detection of adversarial activities. The
results are evaluated on the UW-developed RAVEN surgical
robot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project brings together research in robotics,
computer and network security, control theory and machine learning, in order to
gain better understanding of complex teleoperated robotic systems and to
engineer telerobotic systems that provide strict safety, security and privacy
guarantees. The results are relevant and applicable to a wide range of
applications, including telerobotic surgery, search and rescue missions,
military operations, underwater infrastructure and repair, cleanup and repair in
hazardous environments, mining, as well as manipulation/inspections of objects
in low earth orbit. The project algorithms, software and hardware are being made
available to the non-profit cyber-physical research community. Graduate and
undergraduate students are being trained in cyber-physical systems security
topics, and K-12, community college students and under-represented minority
students are being engaged.
