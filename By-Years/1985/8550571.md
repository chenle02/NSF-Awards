This Leadership Activities project will provide enhancement and professional
development experiences for 25 exemplary secondary school mathematics teachers
from Santa Clara County, California public and private schools. The overall
goals of the two-year project involve the updating and deepening of the
participants' knowledge of problem solving and integrated approaches to school
mathematics topics and teaching methodologies, the networking of the
participants and university mathematics faculty, the conduct of follow-up
sessions and in-service workshops by the participants in their home schools,
appropriate recognition for honors teacher participants, and the investigation
of the modelistic approach within a carefully planned documentation, assessment
and evaluation effort. Selections of participants will be based upon detailed
applications requiring expressions of teacher and school commitments to
implement project emphases. Working with university mathematicians, the
participants will complete a 16-day summer workshop and eight monthly, day-long
meetings designed to increase their conceptual understanding of, and commitments
to, integrated treatments of mathematical topics, to develop strategies and
teachng plans for problem-solving applications in their own curriculum, and to
develop materials and techniques for use in their presentation of in-service
workshops. They will earn graduate academic credits from the University of Santa
Clara. During the preparation of the in-service workshops which the participants
will design and conduct, the project staff will be available for consultation
and support. Participants will be visited and observed in their classrooms and
in their workshops with their peers. Careful documentation and analysis of these
observations and of teacher reports will provide a significant basis for a
detailed project evaluation.
