Rocky coastlines around the world often show signs of storm or tsunami
inundation in the form of long-lived coastal boulder deposits. However, their
interpretation remains controversial. It is still not possible to infer the
magnitude of inundation with any accuracy, or in some cases even to determine
whether the deposits were generated by storm waves or by tsunamis. The
Inundation Signatures on Rocky Coastlines (ISROC) Research Coordination Network
will bring together researchers from the United States and other countries
around the world to define the field as a whole, establish standards, bring
together existing and new data into a central database, and define priority
research topics. Collaborations may be both virtual and in-person, all dependent
on safety protocols. Student training will be a priority during this 5 year
project, with the HBCU University of the Virgin Islands serving as the home site
for the Year 3 Student Conference and Workshop, and a second Workshop in Year 5
at a different site. Short-term research exchanges and student visits will take
place throughout the project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coastal boulder deposits
(CBD) are signatures of extreme marine inundation found on many rocky shorelines
worldwide. However, their interpretation remains contentious, with debate
extending to whether clasts were deposited by storm waves or tsunamis, and the
immediate implications for risk and planning. Reconstruction of the hydrodynamic
conditions and climatology leading to CBD generation has even greater
uncertainty. Nevertheless, these long-lived deposits provide what are sometimes
the only records of historic and prehistoric inundation, so reconstructions have
direct application to understanding past and present conditions, and high
predictive value for future inundation regimes. Here, the Inundation Signatures
on Rocky Coastlines (ISROC) Research Coordination Network is proposed to (1)
Define the overall CBD problem chain and associated research gaps by developing
a network of researchers from different disciplines, locations, and backgrounds;
(2) Extend and train the community of researchers, in particular to include
groups underrepresented in STEM at locations where CBDs are found; (3) Develop
CBD disciplinary standards for gathering and archiving data; (4) Develop and
implement cyberinfrastructure for researchers to upload, visualize, and analyze
CBD data; and (5) Create opportunities for cross-disciplinary, in-person, and
online collaboration and exchange.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
