This research, in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, uses laser
techniques to probe the spectroscopy, kinetics and dynamics of metal inorganic
compexes on the femto-, nano- and picosecond time scales. Such studies are
important to inorganic and biochemial processes. The dynamics of excited
electronic states and photochemical reactions in transition metal compounds at
short times in the subnanoseceond and femtosecond time scale will be
investigated. This research will study charge transfer excitations,
conformational relaxation of molecules following such processes, nonradiative
transitions to lower lying states of various types, and solvent reorganization
around solutes undergoing charge transfer transitions all of which require this
time resolution.
