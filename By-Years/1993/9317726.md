9317726 Levi This is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research in support of the
Intelligent Manufacturing Systems (IMS) Initiative. In an unprecedented world
wide effort, numerous commercial organizations and universities have joined
together under the Aegis of the IMS test cast (this particular one for
concurrent engineering) to conduct a one year feasibility study. This grant
provides partial support for a faculty member to work in this project. This
support is important in that the project may be the forerunner of a new paradigm
for the way research is to be performed.
