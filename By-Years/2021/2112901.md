Quantum mechanics is science's most detailed theory of the physical world, and
fully exploiting quantum mechanics is enabling new technologies such as quantum
computers. A fundamental requirement when building quantum systems is to verify
that the experimentalist has actually built what they intended to build. For
this reason, experimentalists test quantum systems by taking (inherently
probabilistic) measurements. The aim of this project is to process these
measurements in a new way in order to give a more accurate and reliable estimate
of how much the actual quantum state differs from the intended quantum state.
This more reliable verification procedure is an important step in constructing
fault-tolerant quantum computers, and as such, this project contributes toward
creating useful quantum computers. Thus the broader impact of the project
includes the potential impacts of quantum computing, as well as generally
contributing to the progress of science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical goal
of the project is to estimate the fidelity between two quantum states with high
certainty; in particular, the proposed method produces a rigorous confidence
interval within which the fidelity lies (within a desired probability of
failure). The approach is novel in the field, as it uses a computationally
constructed statistic, and is applied directly to the raw data without requiring
data-averaging or full tomography. The method has advantages over existing
direct methods as well as over maximum likelihood tomography methods. The
intellectual contributions of the proposed work will be showing that the
certification problem fits inside a very specific existing statistical
framework, deriving the estimators and solving related optimization problems,
and extending both the theory and applications, e.g., to quantum channels and
entanglement witnesses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
