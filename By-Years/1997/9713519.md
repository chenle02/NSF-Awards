Residual stresses are the main cause of unwanted warpage observed in injection
molded parts. The objective of this research is to develop new technology for
eliminating flow induced birefringence and minimizing thermally induced stresses
due to cooling. This objective will be accomplished by rapidly heating the mold
surface so that the melt can fill the cavity isothermally and yet be processed
within the normal injection molding cycle time. The outcome of this research
could eliminate the flow induced stresses in injection molded parts. The inverse
design optimization technique is very promising technique to obtain an optimally
prescribed temporal profile of the mold surface temperature and provide better
knowledge about the residual stress. This project will greatly enhance
applications in molding high-precision parts requiring absolute dimensional
stability. The results of these studies are expected to ultimately lead to the
development of an innovative cost-effective method of producing injection molded
parts.
