This award will provide one-half of the funds required to construct a low
magnetic induction space in which to house a magnetometer for measuring the
magnetic properties of rocks and minerals. The low magnetic induction space is
needed to provide a very low magnetic background for measuring the weak
magnetization of small geological samples in the Department of Geology at the
University of New Mexico. The University is committed to providing the other
half of the funds required. Paleomagnetism involves the study the Earth's past
magnetism as it is frozen into rocks and minerals that have cooled at known
dates in the Earth's history. The intensity and orientation of the Earth's
magnetic field in the past helps us to understand the nature of the internal
processes that give rise to the geomagnetic field and to reconstruct its past
variations, including field reversals.
