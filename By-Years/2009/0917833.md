This workshop will explore a range of issues related to new and emerging
technologies for advanced research for imaging related to capturing, digitizing
and analyzing historical objects. These include historical documents, visual
images, and three-dimensional (3D) artifacts, many of which are to be found in
widely-scattered collections and having restricted accessibility. By digitizing
historical objects, critical attributes are both preserved and at the same time
enable studies that are impossible with the traditional approaches. Such studies
might have been impossible up to now either because a research question requires
study of large quantities of data preserved in collections around the world or
because the study wishes to examine details invisible to the human eye, such as
the remains of erased texts preserved in palimpsests, miniature scripts on
cylinder seals, etc. or patterns that are hard to compare objectively (e.g.,
patterns of quilt images). A team at the University of Illinois, Urbana-
Champaign and the National Center for Supercomputing Applications organize and
convene the event in collaboration and with support from the Humanities, Arts,
Science, and Technology Advanced Collaboratory (HASTAC).
