In May 2007 there was a workshop at the Fields Institute on stacks in geometry
and topology; with this workshop, we saw a snapshot of the emerging field of
derived algebraic geometry. In a remarkable series of talks, many by
mathematicians with relatively recent PhDs, we saw the implementation and
application of derived schemes, derived stacks, higher categories, and the
attendant homotopy theory across a broad spectrum of geometric and topological
subjects. This new workshop is a follow-up to the 2007 conference: the main
point is to revisit the field three years later, to assess what has happened and
to to see where we are going. In particular, the field of derived algebraic
geometry and its interplay with higher category theory field has grown rapidly
since 2007 and is now central to several developing areas of algebraic topology.
It is an ideal moment to explore this interplay. Researchers who have agreed to
participate include Mark Behrens (MIT), D-C. Cisinski (Paris 13), Ralph Cohen
(Stanford), Andre Henriques (Utrecht), Gerd Laures, (Bochum), Tyler Lawson
(Minnesota), Mike Mandell (Indiana), Niko Naumann (Regensburg), and Charles Rezk
(UIUC).

Algebraic geometry is a classical field of mathematics, arising from the study
of solutions of systems of polynomial equations in many variables. The focus on
polynomials make the geometric objects studied very rigid, in contrast to
topology, which is the study of phenomena which remain unchanged under any
continuous deformation. Derived algebraic geometry seeks to import techniques
from algebraic topology into algebraic geometry in order to capture and
calculate some of the finer structure apparently hidden by the inherent
rigidity. There have been remarkable recent successes. This grant will be used
to fund the attendance of US research mathematicians near the beginning of their
careers, in this way promoting the spread of these ideas among the broader
research community.
