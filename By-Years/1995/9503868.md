The objective of this award is to compile data on the thermodynamic
characteristics of lipids, with a view to providing ready access to the data
itself and to the appropriate literature. An intact, selectively permeable
membrane or system of membranes is an essential feature of the living cell. The
membrane is in essence a bimolecular lipid leaflet in and on which are situated
a variety of proteins and other molecules. There exists a wealth of information
on lipid phase behavior much of which is scattered throughout the literature in
a variety of journals, books and proceedings both foreign and domestic. The
intention is to compile the data in a single, continuously revised relational
database. The database will be accessed on- line. Disk, CD-ROM as well as hard
copies of the data will be released periodically. The compilation will include a
tabulation of all known mesomorphic and polymorphic phase transition
temperatures and enthalpies for synthetic and biologically- derived lipids in
the dry and in the partially and fully hydrated states.
