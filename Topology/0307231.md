Technical Abstract

The main topic of the conference ``Groups--2003'' in Gaeta, Italy is Discrete
Groups. It will concentrate on: groups generated by finite automata, hyperbolic
groups in the sense of Gromov, Burnside groups, lattices in Lie groups, groups
of intermediate growth, and discrete groups of Lie type. The questions
concerning these groups are related to many areas of mathematics mentioned in
the next section. The subjects discussed during the conference will be related
to growth of groups, subgroup growth, property (T), expanders and Ramanujan
graphs, amenability, non-commutative dynamical systems, random walks on groups,
formal languages, branch groups, automata groups, fractal groups and fractal
sets, computation of spectra of Hecke operators, L2-invariants, bounded
cohomology, and the structure of lattices in Lie groups. A special emphasis will
be put on branch groups, as this conference is dedicated to R. Grigorchuk on the
occasion of his 50th anniversary. The main topic of the conference belongs of
course to Group Theory, but it is also closely related to Dynamical Systems,
Ergodic Theory, Geometry of Metric Spaces, Low-dimensional Topology, Discrete
Mathematics, Harmonic Analysis, Operator Algebras, Representations of Groups,
and L2 Cohomology.

Non-Technical Abstract

The planned conference ``Groups--2003'' in Gaeta, Italy intends to be a meeting
point for mathematicians with various specialties, with group theory serving as
a unifying ground. While centered on abstract algebra, participants with a
background from statistics, theoretical physics as well as the broad spectrum of
pure mathematics will contribute talks that stress as much as possible the
unifying nature of mathematics in general, and group theory in particular. Time
will generously be alloted for informal discussion and fruitful exchanges
between the participants. These will comprise both internationally renowned
experts and graduate students or young researchers who wish to embark in the
rapidly progressing field. Proceedings of the conference will be edited, and
assemble contributions from the participants. This conference is fittingly
dedicated to Professor Grigorchuk for his 50th birthday, who by his numerous
contributions to various diverse fields of mathematics has illustrated the goals
of this conference.
