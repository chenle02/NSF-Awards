This research is to conduct two refraction/wide-angle reflection profiles along
the axes of the Appalachian gravity high and gravity low in north Georgia using
timed quarry blasts and a portable 20- element array of three-component
seismometers. The principal goal of this experiment will be to trace changes in
crustal velocity structure and depth to Moho across the transition from accreted
crust beneath the Carolina Slate Belt to North American craton beneath the Blue
Ridge. The main profiles and more localized soundings will provide images of
lower crust and Moho that supplement existing normal incidence profiles. They
will also provide improved estimates of P and S wave velocities that will place
constraints on the composition and metamorphic grade of lower crustal rocks and
the detailed structure of the crust-mantle transition.
