A mirocalorimeter is acquired. It is used for the determinatio of heat of
adsorption/wetting reaction in process developments in mineral, chemical and
ceramic industries. Availability of this equipment will significantly improve
the quality of research related to aggregation and dispersion of fine particles,
sol-gel processing, and other topics.
