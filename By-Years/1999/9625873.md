This project will continue a survey of communities of terrestrial vertebrates in
the dry forests of western Madagascar, and to shift attention to transitional
forests and some newly identified and remote montane forest islands of unknown
composition. Twenty-four sites in these various habitats will be surveyed over a
36-month period, using methods employed successfully in an earlier study of
rainforest habitats on Madagascar. The arid forests of western Madagascar
contain some of the most interesting and unusual species of plants and animals
in the world, and the biodiversity of these forests is at present poorly
understood. The dry forests are degraded and threatened to at least the same
degree as the rainforests, and their destructionis accelerating as the demand
for resources increases. The primary purposes of this study are to 1) identify
areas of high diversity in order to assist in the development of protected
areas, 2) document species distributions on the Internet, 3) describe new
species that may be encountered, 4) produce guides for field identification, 5)
obtain specimens for systematic studies, 6) train Malagasy students, scientists,
and resource managers, and 7) develop a national Museum of Natural History in
Madagascar. The results, when combined with data from the earlier studies, will
give a comprehensive picture of the diversity of most of Madagascar's
terrestrial vertebrates, which will be essential to conservation planning for
Madagascar into the future. | H H + (á▀áG À F G ( n H H + ( d ' ╔ @ -- aÝª ▀ S u
