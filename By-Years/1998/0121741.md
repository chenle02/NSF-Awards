The AI Lab at The University of Arizona is researching, developing, and
enhancing tools to augment the knowledge, skills and abilities that users bring
in various degrees to the information search process. Results from three areas
of research are being used: information analysis and visualization; data mining;
and search agents. The platform for this research and development is an
integrated system that allows for the retrieval, analysis, categorization,
analysis and visualization of information from documents housed in a digital
library. In addition, through the use of transaction logs from the library, a
mechanism is provided whereby instructors can gauge the use of resources and
their students' paths through the learning experience; such transaction logs can
also prove valuable to students as a record of their learning experience within
a given course or even throughout their college career. The testbed for this
work includes two application domains that provide significant differences in
domain language and subject matter: computer science and information technology,
and the life sciences. Undergraduate students, professors and librarians are
assisting in the evaluation of the system. The team also expects to investigate
several issues: (1) whether use of a search agent improves the search results of
digital library users over those obtained using a conventional search engine;
(2) whether visualization of search results in the browser window reduces user
disorientation in the information space; and (3) whether synchronous or
asynchronous collaboration improves student performance over the course of a
semester.
