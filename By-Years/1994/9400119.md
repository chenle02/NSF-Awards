9400119 Settles The award is for research to improve understanding of the
dynamics of the assist gas used with laser cutting to blow away molten material
and plasma, with a view to improving performance. The technology of supersonic
microjets will be transferred to the field of laser cutting to improve cutting
speed and efficiency by maintaining supersonic flow along the entire cutting
edge of the kerf. Melt removal is enhanced and material redeposition in the kerf
is avoided. Significant improvements in conventional coaxial assist-gas delivery
will also be sought by improving nozzle design. The work is primarily
experimental and involves development of appropriate nozzles and microjets, and
cutting trials using actual commercial laser equipment. The research is expected
to impact the fundamental knowledge base related to gas dynamics as well as the
efficiency of the key manufacturing technology of laser cutting. Improvements in
assist gas dynamics are expected to translate directly into faster, cleaner
laser cuts. More powerful lasers now becoming available would also benefit from
the improved assist gas dynamics expected as a result of this research.
