The proposed reseach will investigate enhancements of gas electron diffraction
(GED) leading to application of this detection mode in gas chromatography. It is
proposed to use multichannel detection to obtain direct, real-time structural
information on molecules in the vapor phase. At present, limitations on this
method prevent its application. It is hoped that this research will reduce these
limitations and, hereby, establish serviceability, of GED for study of analytes
leaving the column of a gas chromatograph. If successful, this research could
pioneer a new instrument for direct "structural chromatography".
