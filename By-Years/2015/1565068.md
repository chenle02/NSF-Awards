The Southern Illinois Energy Scholarships program at Southern Illinois
University Carbondale (SIUC) will matriculate talented community college
students with demonstrated financial need to SIUC who will major in one of nine
energy-related STEM disciplines. The goal of the project will be to provide the
infrastructure and experiences necessary for scholars to complete a
baccalaureate degree and enter the energy workforce or a STEM graduate program.
Scholars will engage in hands-on activities led by faculty and work-force
professionals. The project will increase the number of students entering the
energy workforce, which has been identified as one of the areas critical to the
economic development of the state.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;To identify what
strategies and activities are successful in helping low income community college
transfer students succeed, the research team will identify a transfer student
peer group from within STEM disciplines representative of race/ethnicity,
gender, related program of study, and prior academic attainment. The
investigators will longitudinally follow both the Energy Scholars and the peer
comparison group semester-by-semester collecting hours attempted, hours earned,
course performance, grade point average, retention and graduation indicators.
The team will measure and compare academic attainment, retention and graduation
across the Energy Scholars and the peer comparison group.
