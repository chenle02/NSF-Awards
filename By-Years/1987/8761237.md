The objective of this SBIR Phase I proposal is to perform experiments, guided
by theory, to define and quantify the performance envelope of a new selective
laser sintering process. In this process, a powder surface is raster-scanned
with a high-power laser beam to fuse powder in areas to be occupied by the part
at that particular cross-section. In areas not sintered, the powder remains
loose and may be removed once the part is complete. Successive layers of powder
are then deposited and raster-scanned until the entire part is produced. A
general three-dimensional object can be produced in this way directly from a
solid model or other three-dimensional computer database. The research effort
will be directed toward investigation of process mechanics, material evaluation,
effects of additives, and assessment of achievable strengths, dimensional
tolerances, and part production rates. If successful, a follow-on Phase II is
planned.
