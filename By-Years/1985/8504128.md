This grant provides continuing support for the U.S. Committee in Rock Mechanics.
Major activities of this committee are in the areas of geomechanics and failure
of geologic structures. The activities have a good potential in providing
national visibility to several of the geomechanic issues including damage by
expansive soils, failure of slopes, ground stability, and subsidence. The
Committee activities in the previous years have helped to achieve a national
focus in rock mechanics research and in identifying several priority areas of
research in geotechnical engineering.
