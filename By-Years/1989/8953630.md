A unique restructuring of the undergraduate engineering curriculum is underway
to treat the need for more design emphasis while simultaneously building a
strong relationship between the individual engineering courses. Under a new
program, each engineering student is assigned a design project which is
completed over the course of the undergraduate curriculum. Students produce one
segment of the design in each engineering course consistent with the content of
the course. This new structure adds more design to the engineering curriculum
and enhance the students perceptions of the curriculum. The courses will fit
together more closely and each one will make a contribution to the overall
design project. The grantee institution is contributing significant funds to
this award.
