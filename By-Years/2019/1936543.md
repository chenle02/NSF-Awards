This award provides funding for US participation in the conference "Midwestern
Workshop in Asymptotic Analysis" that will be held October 4-6, 2019 at Purdue
University Fort Wayne. The conference focuses on recent developments in
analysis, especially in the areas of applied analysis, approximation theory,
potential theory, and complex analysis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A number of
distinguished mathematicians have agreed to participate in this conference. This
award gives early-career researchers, members of underrepresented groups, and
others an opportunity to participate in the conference. The organizing committee
will strive to advertise this widely through a number of different activities.
