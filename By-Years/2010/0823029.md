This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop new scale
up methods for the synthesis of surface stabilized metal nanoparticles from
aerosol. The advantage of chemical aerosol-flow synthesis is in its simplicity
in procedure and experimental setup, low cost and scalability. The method allows
for the synthesis of high quality nanoparticles in continuous flow regimen.
Phase I results proved feasibility of the method for the synthesis of high
quality silver nanoparticles with high yield. This Phase II project will focus
on increasing manufacturing capabilities to decrease the cost of nanoparticles
significantly.

Low cost, printed electrical conductors are expected to be a rapidly growing
market for flexible electronics and solar cells. Reducing processing
temperatures and material costs are key enablers to these growing applications.
The low cost production of nanometals will contribute to these trends.
