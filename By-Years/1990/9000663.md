Professor Gerald P. Caple and other members of the Chemistry Department of
Northern Arizona University are being supported to conduct a Research
Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry. During the summer of
1990, ten (10) undergraduate students will spend ten (10) weeks actively engaged
in a variety of research projects. Projects range from metal vapor synthesis of
potential anti-cancer drugs to tracing the source of Tsegi Orange Ware (red)
slip and (clay) paste using analytical chemistry. The participants in the
program will be Native American Indians, many of whom are former participants in
the Young Scholars Program of the National Science Foundation.
