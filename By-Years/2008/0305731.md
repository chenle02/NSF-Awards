The PIs will undertake a structural and thermo-chronological study of the Saudi
Arabian Red Sea margin as a part of the MARGINS "Rupture of the Continental
Lithosphere" initiative. This margin offers an exceptional opportunity to study
the processes associated with continental rifting and how extensional strain is
distributed in space and time. The PIs will employ apatite fission-track and
(U-Th)/He thermo-chronology and structural mapping in the study area to achieve
their objectives. The study will contribute to a more comprehensive
understanding of the Red Sea rift and will form a part of the overall
geological/geophysical work planned in this area under the MARGINS program. A
close collaboration with the Saudi Geological Survey is
envisaged.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
