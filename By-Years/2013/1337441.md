1337441&lt;br/&gt;Guswa&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative Major Research
Instrumentation (MRI) Program grant supports acquisition of three new fiber
optic Raman high resolution temperature profilers, or distributed temperature
systems (DTS) at the University of Nevada ? Reno and Smith College, a non-Ph.D.
granting institution.. The instruments will build on capabilities at the Center
for Transformative Environmental Monitoring Programs (CTEMPs) and expand
capabilities for research and education at Smith College. New higher resolution
capable DTS systems now offer the ability to measure temperature with precisions
of 0.1 degree C at centimeter scale spatial resolution and temporal resolution
of seconds over several kilometers of a fiber optic strand which can be deployed
in lakes, rivers, snow pack, trenched in soil, run down boreholes or strung up
trees or along civil structures. The capability promises continued advances in
understanding of watershed hydrology, limnology, physical oceanography,
cryosphere dynamics, soil science and terrestrial ecology.
