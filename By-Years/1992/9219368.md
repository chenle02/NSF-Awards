This award provides funding for the acquisition of instrument components that
will serve to upgrade the analytical capabilities (improved sensitivity and
decreased mass interferences from oxides) of an inductively coupled plasma-mass
spectrometer (ICP-MS) system installed in the Department of Geological Sciences
at Cornell University. The PI and research group will also develop the use of a
laser ablation source for the ICP-MS. The great promise of laser ablation
sampling is its capability for in situ analysis with spatial resolution, but the
application still requires much development as it applies to complex geological
sample targets. The project will develop specific analytical techniques for
microanalysis of trace elements in crustal and mantle minerals.
