The project builds on work on algorithms, tools, and applications for
parallel/distributed Symbolic and Algebraic Computation (SAC). Existing tools
for parallel SAC will be refined. Additional tools will be built and
applications to the algorithmic solution of specific problems in computer
algebra will be made. The project also investigates the design of a system to
make mathematical computations easily accessible and conveniently interoperable
on the Internet. The research also involves design and implementation of
experimental software that can become very useful for scientific research and
mathematics education. The research focuses on the following specific areas: I.
Parallel computation of GCD, factors, Grobner Basis, and Characteristic Sets of
polynomials. 2. Building and refining PVM (MPI) based tools for
parallel/distributed SAC. 3. Initial Design of a distributed system for Internet
Accessible Mathematical Computing (IAMC).
