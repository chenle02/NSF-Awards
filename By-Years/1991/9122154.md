This project involves a series of experiments to study the effects of monetary
incentives on the performance of a mental arithmetic "production" task. The
nature of the contingencies will be varied to create an experimental design
comparing the effects of large, medium, and small monetary payoffs in piece
rate, variable ratio, quota, and tournament incentive schemes, including flat
hourly wage conditions. To a much greater extent than in previous research, we
will measure the effects of incentive scheme contingency and size of monetary
award on the fine-grained structure of behavior. It is expected that the results
of this systematic study will lead to well-calibrated tasks which can be used in
other experimental studies of incentive effects which should yield to greater
generalizability of research findings.
