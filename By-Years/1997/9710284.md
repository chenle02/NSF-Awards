This research project is directed at the design and detailed specification of
the Advanced ZPL language in anticipation of its full experimental evaluation.
Advanced ZPL is intended as the programming language for scientific and
engineering computations that are to be run on parallel supercomputers. Unlike
ZPL (and other antecedent data parallel languages) Advanced ZPL is suitable for
general parallel algorithms. Advanced ZPL contains ZPL as a proper subset,
giving it full support for data parallel computation. In addition, Advanced ZPL
provides the capability to express thread parallelism, task parallelism and
pipelining. ZPL provides array data structures, while Advanced ZPL adds general
data structuring capabilities. Control over data motion and computational
granularity are provided. The goal is to produce a precise specification with
which to write sample applications. Based on these applications users can assess
the convenience and expressivity of Advanced ZPL, and compiler writers can
formulate ways to produce efficient, portable code for it.
