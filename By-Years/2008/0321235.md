This project, enabling next generation research projects in automatic sensing
and modeling, aims at acquiring a massive image capture and processing facility.
The infrastructure includes specialized digital video cameras and projectors, a
high resolution motions apparatus, a three dimensional scanner, a lighting grid,
a robot arm, and a video compute cluster. The components form a massive "Digital
Eye" that will enable capturing the appearance, shape, motion, and behavior of
real objects and scenes at previously unattainable resolutions and frame rates.
Interdisciplinary ties and collaborations in Zoology, Mathematics, Statistics,
Urban Design and Planning, and Architecture will benefit from the specific
projects and applications to be supported by the infrastructure. These projects
include:&lt;br/&gt; High Fidelity Modeling of Human Shape and Motion: Digital
Humans&lt;br/&gt; Insects in Flight: Biological Motion Analysis, Modeling Insect
Flight&lt;br/&gt;Analysis of Physical Processes: Physics Capture&lt;br/&gt;
Lightfield Analysis: Plenoptic Imaging and Modeling Research,
&lt;br/&gt;Plenoptic Function Capture and Simulating Compound Eyes&lt;br/&gt; 3D
Object Recognition from Range Data&lt;br/&gt; Urban Simulation and
Visualization.&lt;br/&gt;Enabling hand-on experience for students in courses on
digital sensing technologies and animation production, the project promotes
teaching, training and learning by providing a state-of-the-art
facility.&lt;br/&gt;
