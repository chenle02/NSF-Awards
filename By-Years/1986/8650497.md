A major modernization of the equipment used to teach techniques of biochemical
research and cellular/molecular biology is being undertaken by the Biology
faculty at Furman University. The new equipment, including a modern
spectrophotometer, a tabletop ultracentrifuge, high performance liquid
chromatograph, oxygen electrode, state-of-the-art video densitometer and an
ultra-pure water system, are the basis of a major revision in the way two core
courses and several electives are being taught. In a five year period, about 250
undergraduates involved in an average of three to four courses per student will
have extensive hands-on experience with the new equipment. The project is
expected to result in much better informed students who are experienced in
current laboratory technology. This will help to increase the number of students
who enter graduate school with good laboratory skills. In preparation for this
project the Principal Investigator visited eight colleges with excellent
reputations in teaching modern biology to undergraduates, in order to take
maximal advantage of curricular improvements found there. As a result, this
project incorporates many of the best current ideas in teaching the chemistry of
biological systems.
