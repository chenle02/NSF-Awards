*** 9761329 Yializis This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
proposes a new nanostructural fabrication process for the production of high
strength ceramic-polymer nanolaminate materials. A patented ultra high speed
polymer deposition process allows the formation, in a vacuum environment, of
self supported multilayer structures with thousands of nanosize inorganic and
polymer layers. The polymer materials are highly cross-linked radiation cured
mutlifunctional acrylate monomers tht have high thermal and mechanical
stability. The inorganic layers can be ceramic layers that include materials
such as alumina, silica, zirconia, and titania. Crystal nucleation and grain
growth of the ceramic layers can be influenced by functionalization of the
polymer materials. The proposed investigation will systematically explore the
limits of this new process with particular focus on the mechanical material
properties. In the phase I work, materials such as alumina/polymer and
silica/polymer will be processed into nanolaminate composites and the mechanical
properties of composites with varying ceramic layer thickness and ceramic /
polymer thickness ratios will be compared to basic bulk material properties. The
phase II wok will seek further optimization and in-depth testing of materials
for specific industrial applications. High strength, lightweight, abrasion
resistant ceramic-polymer composites may have a range of applications that
includes components for aircraft, automobiles, protective materials for
corrosive and oxidative environments, and biocompatible orthopedic components.
