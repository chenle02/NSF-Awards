What are consequences for cognition of living in multiple cultures? Despite the
salience of this topic for modern life, not much is known about
multiculturalism. One hypothesis is that some benefits come naturally from
living in more than one culture and speaking more than one language. Bicultural
and bilingual experiences may encourage divergent thinking and cognitive
flexibility, which together facilitate creative thought. &lt;br/&gt;With support
from NSF, Dr. Arthur Reber and Anatoliy Kharkhurin, M.A., will explore this
working hypothesis. Mr. Kharkhurin will conduct a cross-regional study of
divergent thinking that compares Russian-English bilingual emigrants who live in
the United States, Russian-English bilinguals who always have and continue to
live in Russia, and monolingual groups in both cultures. Broader impacts include
a better understanding of cultural diversity and bilingualism. Moreover this
research will be conducted in the context of Mr. Kharkhurin's doctoral
dissertation and thereby contributes to his graduate education. &lt;br/&gt;
