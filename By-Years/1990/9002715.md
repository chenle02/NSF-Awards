This research is concerned with algebraic K-theory. The principal investigator
will study the special lambda-ring identities for the general exterior power
operations. In addition he will study the connection between the algebraic
K-groups and the motivic cohomology groups and work on higher periods of
symmetric powers of elliptic curves. This project is in the general area of
algebraic K-theory. K-theory concerns the evolution of the ideas of vector
space, basis, linear mapping and general linear group to a context where the
scalars are from a commutative or noncommutative ring. In this context, K-theory
can be utilized in algebraic geometry and other mathematical models involving
coefficients from rings.
