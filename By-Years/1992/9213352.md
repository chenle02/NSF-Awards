This proposal emphasizes the synthesis of new ternary tungsten and niobium
chalcogenide compounds that contain discrete clusters of transition metal atoms.
This important class of materials exhibits a host of interesting properties
ranging from catalytic activity to magnetism and superconductivity. The
synthetic approach to be used is based upon the utilization of superlattice
reactants, which involves separating the two key steps of a solid-state reaction
- interdiffusion of the reactant, and crystallization of the products.
Interdiffusion to an amorphous state is accomplished by tailoring the structure
of the initial superlattice reactant. The crystallization of the resulting
amorphous intermediate is controlled via stoichiometry and/or through seeding of
the composite with isostructural analogues. Materials characterization and the
further development of this synthetic approach is a significant part of the
proposed research, as is extending the range of properties exhibited by these
potentially functional materials.
