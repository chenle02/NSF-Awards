Florida State University's project will revise the science content and science
education courses for elementary teachers. Courses will be developed in
chemistry, physics, biology, and earth science. The themes of global change,
Florida's fragile environment, and Science/Technology/Society will be interwoven
into all these courses. The courses will be taught from a constructivist
perspective, providing students with hands-on group experiences in science and
opportunities for constructing their own understanding of science concepts. The
diverse group of faculty that will be involved in developing the courses
includes scientists, science educators, and experts in multicultural education,
the history and philosophy of science, and linguistic issues in teaching
science. The University's system of Professional Development Schools will serve
as the setting for the science methods course and field experiences, and the
project will work closely with teachers and students at these schools. A network
will be established by the State Department of Education to disseminate plans
and materials to other colleges and universities in the Florida. The
University's cost- sharing is 15% of NSF's contribution.
