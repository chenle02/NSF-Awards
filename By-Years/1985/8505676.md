The behaivor and design of lapped splices in reinforced concrete members
subjected to seismic loading has been investigated and more than 80 beam or
column type specimens and 20 flat elements were tested. The behavior and design
of lapped splices for various spacings of the spliced bars is now addressed. The
transition between contact splices and separate anchored bars is examined. The
experimental work includes 40 pullout tests and 8 beam tests with cyclic loading
simulating seismic action. The analytical investigation extends current work on
three-dimensional non-linear analysis of anchored bars. In this research design
guidelines will be developed for closely-spaced bars; this is a specific but
practical situation in construction.
