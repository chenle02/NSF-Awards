9451499 Barbour This proposal investigates the construction of a Parallel and
Distributed Processing Laboratory to support new courses on parallel processing
in our undergraduate curriculum. The lab will also be used as a test bed for
student experiments including class projects, parallel programming assignments
and undergraduate research projects. These projects will include, but will not
be limited to, designing and testing of parallel algorithms, measuring
performance of parallel algorithms, designing and implementing distributed
programs, setting N-way dynamic connection on LANs, and implementing remote
procedure call packages. Students will gain practical experience in parallel
programming, network system programming for distributed applications, and
application development for neural networks, pattern recognition, and fuzzy
logic control systems. The proposed parallel computer system will consist of
four SUN workstations (already in place), a parallel CNAPS computer and a SUN
Sparc Station. The SUN Sparc Station will act as a front end for the CNAPS
computer and as a server for the four SUN workstations. This parallel and
distributed system will be connected to the department's existing LAN via a
gateway which will allow students to develop projects without interfering with
the operation of the LAN. Due to the increasing importance of
parallel/distributed computations and computer networks, the proposed laboratory
will better prepare students for both professional and academic careers. The lab
will enhance the senior year and the minority summer research programs supported
by the College of Arts and Sciences at Georgia Southern University. We expect
that the Physics and Biology Departments as well as the Engineering studies and
Engineering technology programs will also benefit from this project.
