This research investigates the tradeoff between failure-free overhead and output
latency in transparent distributed rollback-recovery. This tradeoff arises
because, with rollback-recovery, output to the "outside world" must be delayed
until enough recovery information is recorded on stable storage to guarantee
that if a failure occurs, the system will never roll back to a state preceding
the one from which the output was performed. The resulting latency can be
reduced by keeping recovery information on stable storage closely up-to-date
during failure-free operation, but at the expense of extra failure- free
overhead. The work includes an investigation of how rollback-recovery methods
based on logging can be extended to support nondeterministic process execution,
occurring, for instance, as a result of multithreading. Nondeterministic events
are recorded on stable storage, and are used during failure recovery to replay
the same events. For example, by recording the execution of synchronization
primitives such as semaphores, one can support multithreading in which all
access to shared data is protected by these synchronization primitives.
Checkpoints offer an alternative for processes for which recording
nondeterministic events is impossible or is too expensive.
