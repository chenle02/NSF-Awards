Networks of sensors are increasingly important in a variety of applications
including national security, environmental monitoring, and health care. These
systems should serve their purposes with minimal communication between sensors
and minimal computation overhead from coding. In particular, these efficiencies
can dramatically improve battery life, and in systems such as those implanted in
a body, replacing spent batteries is very difficult

This project will develop original approaches to the signal coding in sensor
network systems. Though distributed source coding principles seem to be a
natural fit for sensor networks, they are rarely used in these systems. Reasons
include high complexity, high delay, and sensitivity to the accuracy of the
assumed probabilistic models. Also, there may be no node with the memory and
computing power to do Slepian-Wolf decoding. The failure of these methods in
practice has left a glaring technological gap. Most sensor networks use simple
uniform scalar quantization and compression that does not exploit inter-sensor
correlation, or no compression at all. This project will use high-resolution
quantization theory to develop a framework for providing and exploiting
quantized side information among nearby nodes in a network, with the aim of
supporting inference and computation tasks.

The central innovative idea is to allow limited (low-rate, short-range)
communication among encoders to enable adaptation. A second key area of
innovation is a focus on information acquisition systems that are designed to
make a computation rather than enable reproduction of every measured value. The
focus on acquisition and computation -- as opposed to communication -- is
consistent with the actual motivation for deploying sensor networks, and it
brings robustness to uncertainty in measurement distributions to the forefront.
