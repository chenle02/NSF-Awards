This project will bring eight students to the Loyola Campus. They will be
recruited from Loyola and several minority institutions in the New Orleans area.
The students will be divided into two groups of four each to work in the area of
different software development methodologies (logic- oriented and object-
oriented)using CASE tools. The students will spend six weeks at Loyola in the
summer of 1992, and then continue work, with assistance from faculty at their
home institution, during the school year.
