9424448 Xu Many industrial processes involve the electrical heating of a
conductor. A typical example is the electrical spot welding of metal sheets in
the manufacturing of such products as automobile bodies, tanks, and armored
vehicles. The mathematical modeling of such processes often leads to systems of
degenerate partial differential equations with diffusive and convective
couplings. The study of these systems leads to deep and intriguing questions in
nonlinear analysis. In these considerations, the presence of strong
nonlinearities and degeneracy gives rise to very rich structures of solutions.
Our recent research findings indicate that solutions of these systems display
new phenomena that cannot be incorporated into the classical variational
formulation, and a new notion of a capacity solution is, therefore, introduced
to study these systems. In this proposal, we propose to study the finer
properties of capacity solutions, such as regularity, partial regularity, large
time behavior, and other related questions. The proposed research is important
from the point of view of industrial applications. The mathematical results we
wish to obtain can lead to a more efficient production line, a new or better
product. For example, in the welding of metal sheets, one of our objectives is
to find out how the welding time is related to the material properties and the
current applied. This information is critical to the automation of the welding
procedure.
