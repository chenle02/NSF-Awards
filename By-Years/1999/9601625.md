9601625 Weller The Vector Measuring Current Meter (VMCM) was developed by Drs.
Robert Weller and Russ Davis and commercially produced by EG&amp;G Sealink
System. According to the PIs, the science requirements for high quality vector
measurements in the near surface region near buoys continue to increase and the
VMCM propeller current meter is recognized as the current standard. The problem
is that the VMCM is no longer commercially available and the data recorder and
reader, originally manufactured by Sea Data Corp, are also no longer available
or repairable. This proposal seeks funding to redesign the vector measuring
circuitry, data acquisition and storage components so as to provide a new,
lighter, flexible, inexpensive and low power instrument. Replacement of aging
tape recorders will increase data return. Reduction of size and weight will
permit the use of the VMCM on new mooring designs, such as horizontal arrays.
The project will permit the over 40 EG&amp;G Sea Link, Inc. VMCMs that the Upper
Ocean Processes group uses, as well as those within the rest of the
oceanographic community to be used reliably into the next decade. WHOI's cost
share of $159,000 represents 51% of the total cost for this project. ***
