In this CAREER project supported by the Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Schmuttenmaer will use time-resolved far-infrared
spectroscopy with sub-picosecond resolution to study condensed phase dynamics.
This technique will be used to examine the dynamics of electron solvation in
liquids, the dynamics of photoconductivity in organic molecular crystals, and
the dynamics of energy dissipation in liquids. The educational component
involves innovation in undergraduate teaching, including the use of discovery-
based education, written assignments, case studies, and the involvement of
undergraduates in this research program. In the recent past, time-resolved laser
studies with sub-picosecond temporal resolution in the ultraviolet and infrared
spectral regions have helped contribute to increased understanding of many in
chemistry, physics, biology, optics, and electronics. The technological advances
in this work will allow similar studies to be carried out in the far-infrared
spectral region, a fertile and as yet untapped area where much new knowledge
remains to be discovered.
