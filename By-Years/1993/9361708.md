9361708 Cosman This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is in the
general area of separations chemistry and in the subfields of extraction and
crystallization. The objective of the research is to demonstrate the separation
and purification of small quantities of complex natural products by
supercritical fluid (SCF)/cosolvent extraction and crystallization. The process
steps include critical fluid comminution of raw materials, selective SCF
extraction of product and closely related compounds, purification by programmed
SCF elution of extracts by HPLC, and SCF crystallization of the active natural
product(s). Techniques to be investigated in the Phase I studies include
retrograde crystallization, which relies on the inversion of temperature
dependence of solubility as pressure is increased; "homologous" antisolvent
recrystallization, in which the proportion of SCF in the SCF/cosolvent mixture
is increased in order to decrease extractant polarity and cause precipitation,
and; "heterologous" antisolvent crystallization, in which a third component is
added to affect extractant polarity and cause precipitation. Prototypical
natural products to be studied are Taxol and Cephalomannine. %%% Successful
results of the Phase I studies will find application in the
crystallization/purification of natural product therapeutics such as Taxol which
are finding increased use in the health care industry. Commercialization will be
facilitated by increasing their availability while reducing manufacturing costs.
