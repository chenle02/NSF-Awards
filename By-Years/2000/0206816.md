The Lunar and Planetary Institute (LPI) will use $286,915, or 67% of a $430,373
total project budget, over three years to develop "SkyTellers," a space science
and astronomy resource for small informal (and formal) learning settings such as
planetariums, museum classes, school and community libraries, youth groups and
home school settings. LPI educators and science staff, in consultation with a
Native American master story teller, evaluation consultants, and an advisory
board, will develop 12 SkyTeller topics. Each SkyTeller topic pairs a myth or
legend (primarily but not exclusively Native American) with a relevant science
story (Sky Story/Science Story) that explains our current understanding of the
phenomenon that the ancient tale sought to explain. Ancillary materials
(illustrations produced by LPI graphics staff, images from the latest in space
science missions and research) will complete the 12 story sets to be used by
informal and formal science educators at a variety of venues. Extensive
formative and summative evaluation (alpha and beta testing) at multiple test
venues is designed to insure high quality informal science education
products.&lt;br/&gt;
