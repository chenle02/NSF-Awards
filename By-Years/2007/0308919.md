Title

A model for the selection of ambush sites by sit-and-wait predators

Abstract

Most research on animal foraging behavior focuses on fast, active animals that
search widely through the environment for their prey. However, many predators
are relatively sedentary, and capture prey by waiting in ambush for long periods
of time. The study of ambush foraging behavior has been neglected in part
because of a lack of theoretical analysis of the problems faced by ambush
predators, and also because of the difficulty in studying cryptic, secretive
animals in their natural habitat. This study will address these problems by
using modern computational modeling techniques to generate quantitative
predictions about ambush hunting behavior. This mathematical model will then be
tested through a combination of field and laboratory studies on an ambush
predator that has proven to be a very tractable subject for the study of
foraging behavior, the timber rattlesnake (Crotalus horridus). This project will
both increase our knowledge of foraging strategies that are used by species that
ambush their prey, and also provide much-needed empirical testing of a modeling
approach that is becoming increasingly popular in behavior and ecology.
