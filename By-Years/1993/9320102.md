9320102 Cohen This project involves the dissertation research of a cultural
anthropology student from Columbia University. The student will study the nature
of the transformation of traditional Chinese families in a rural area of
northeast China. Using ethnographic methods of participant observation and in-
depth interviews, the student will trace the impact on the life and work of
families in one hamlet of land reform, marriage laws, the cultural revolution
and other national government policies. The end result will be an ethnography
that describes how these rural families have coped with and responded to the
national government's efforts to change them. This research is important because
it will add to our base of studies of rural Chinese communities. This case study
of the successes and failures of the national state in changing the lives of
rural families will help us understand similar processes in other areas where
governments are engaged in drastic modernization policies. We will be better
able to respond to problems and opportunities the more we understand about the
reality in these remote rural areas. ***
