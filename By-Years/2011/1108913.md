This project aims to determine the relationship between galaxies and the hot gas
surrounding them. The portion of the intergalactic medium (IGM) that is photo-
ionized and heated to temperatures of order 10,000 K outweighs the baryonic
(i.e., ordinary) matter inside galaxies by roughly a factor of 4. This gas can
be studied in relatively nearby galaxies by observing the hydrogen Lyman-alpha
absorption line in the spectra of more distant active galactic nuclei (AGN) near
the same line of sight. The Principal Investigator and collaborators have shown
that about half of the Lyman-alpha absorbers at redshifts less than 0.017 are
located within about 400 kiloparsecs of a moderate-sized or larger galaxy. The
team will continue and expand upon this work, in four parts: (1) improve the
statistics by a factor of order 10 using archival AGN spectra obtained with the
Cosmic Origins Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope; (2) identify all
bright galaxies near all observed AGN lines of sight, using public archival data
and new observations with ground-based telescopes; (3) improve the quality of
the existing estimates of galaxy distances, luminosities, classifications, and
orientations, using published data and new data when appropriate; and (4)
perform an in-depth analysis of the physical conditions in individual absorbers.
The goal is to determine the properties of the absorbers as a function of
distance from the galaxy, separately for galaxies of different types, sizes,
luminosities and environments. This project will train a graduate student to
make use of space-based ultraviolet and ground-based optical and radio
observational facilities, some involving international collaborations. Some
parts of the project will be made appropriate for research projects for
undergraduate students, including those participating in the formal Research
Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program at the performing institution. An
exhibit illustrating the existence of matter outside galaxies will be created
for the Space Place museum at the University of Wisconsin.
