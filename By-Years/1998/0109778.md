This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to design a
nanoparticle-monoclonal antibody conjugate that is capable of detecting select
biological warfare agents including Brucella and Francisella. This novel
approach to detection is effective, sensitive, selective, inexpensive and truly
portable. The system uses an innovative detection method involving two
wavelengths of fluorescence, which further increases selectivity and
sensitivity. The sensor mechanism uses a thin film of conjugate that can be
exploited in a number of ways for detection of other pathogens of relevance to
both military and non-military sectors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial
applications of the technology to be developed in this project will be in the
area of counter-terrorism and in medical, food, agricultural and related fields
where pathogen contamination must be detected.&lt;br/&gt;
