This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will synthesize
semiconductor interconnects by using a novel chemical vapor deposition technique
for deposition of silver and copper films on high aspect ratio patterned
substrates for sub 100 nm CMOS devices. This technique called hybrid chemical
vapor deposition combines the advantages of conventional Chemical Vapor
Deposition to achieve integrated circuit super filling, of trenches and vias
under low temperature processing conditions. This technique utilizes precursors
made with metallic nanoparticles (size of metallic particles: 35 nm) that can be
uniformly dispersed inorganic solutions using appropriate surfactants. The
liquid precursor can be transported to the patterned wafer surface in the form
of mist and under appropriate low temperature thermal conditions can form a
conformal film of metal on the surface, which further aggregates inside the
pores to achieve super filling. Initial work conducted on copper films has shown
very promising results.

Application of the research is expected in microelectronics industry. The
important are of reliable interconnects will help signal integrity. The
successful development of hybrid chemical vapor deposition process has not yet
been reported in the literature and would represent an important advancement in
metal thin film deposition process.
