This conference on Iterated Methods for Large Linear Systems will be held at
the University of Texas at Austin October 19-21, 1988. Concentration will be on
providing an overview of the state of the art in the use of iterative methods
for solving large sparse linear systems, and on identifying current and future
research directions in the mainstream of modern scientific computing. There will
be a series of invited addresses and contributed talks. The organizer is
Professor David Kincaid of the Center for Numerical Analysis at the University
of Texas. There is some participant support available.
