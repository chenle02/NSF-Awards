ABSTRACT: The effects of forest management, and the changes associated with
stand development, have not been given sufficient emphasis in studies of
environmental stress in forested ecosystems. Calcium budgets indicate that young
northern hardwood stands (&lt;30 yrs old) transfer Ca from mineral soil into
aboveground vegetation, forest floor, and drainage water, whereas older stands
are in approximate steady state. This difference is important to understanding
the relative importance of acid rain in Ca depletion in the northeastern United
States. Futhermore, if young stands tap a pool of soil Ca unavailable to older
stands, then repeated harvest will not result in rapid Ca depletion, as has been
predicted based on rates of export and weathering in older stands. If, on the
other hand, rapid Ca uptake by young stands hastens the depletion of readily
available pools, sustainable forestry may be threatened. &lt;br/&gt;Our
objectives are to determine the importance of non-silicate sources of
weatherable Ca in the mineral soil, and the effect of stand age on the source
and magnitude of Ca mobilized from the mineral soil. We will use Sr isotopes and
element ratios to identify the relative importance of different soil Ca pools to
meeting the Ca needs of regenerating forests.&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS:
Multiple Universities will be involved in this research through subcontracts,
and at least 3 graduate students and 2 undergraduates will be trained. This work
will provide information that will enable forest managers and policy makers to
maker better decisions about silviculture.&lt;br/&gt;
