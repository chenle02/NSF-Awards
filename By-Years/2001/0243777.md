The project deals with the study of ex-post efficient multi-object auctions when
there are a finite number of possibly heterogeneous goods and agents' values are
interdependent. The recent spurt of interest in the study of ex-post efficient,
multiple-object auctions is largely the result of large-scale privatization of
socially held assets by governments. In light of the influence economic theory
has had on the recent design of a number of these privatization auctions, it is
of some importance to understand which of the results from the one-dimensional
symmetric auction literature, on which economists base most of their intuition,
are sensitive to dimensionality, heterogeneity, and interdependency. This is
especially germane since the multi-object, multi-dimensional case is by far the
more common.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent work by the PI in collaboration with
another researcher extended Vickrey's ex-post efficient multiunit auction to
environments with interdependent values. (As a by-product of this analysis they
also established the ex-post efficiency of the recently designed FCC auction.)
However, while the modified version of Vickrey's auction is simple to play in
principle, it requires the bidders to submit many bids to the auctioneer. This
is rather onerous from a practical point of view. An ascending version of the
above auction that allowed simpler equilibrium bidding behavior would be a
significant practical advantage. The first project described in the proposal
outlines plans to explore this possibility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second part
of the proposal outlines plans to further generalize the auction environment. As
in Vickrey, the researcher's modified auction has so far been one in which goods
are homogeneous and bidders' demands are downward sloping. However, these
assumptions are often too restrictive to describe some of the more common
environments. The proposal describes plans to extend the modified Vickrey
auction to the case of heterogeneous goods and interdependent
valuations.&lt;br/&gt;
