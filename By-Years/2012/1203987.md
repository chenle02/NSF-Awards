The award is cover partial travel support to approximately 40 US participants to
attend the "IPY 2012: From Knowledge to Action Conference," International Polar
Year (IPY) conference to be held in April 2012 in Montreal, Canada.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drawing on results and best practices from the IPY
2007-2008 activities, the conference will bring together over 2,000 Arctic and
Antarctic researchers, policy- and decision-makers, and interested parties from
academia, industry, non-government, education, Arctic communities, and
circumpolar indigenous peoples. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In awarding the travel
funds, preference will be given to applicants from under-represented groups,
young scientists, and students; those presenting oral and/or posters at the
conference; and those that are actively involved in research related to the
program theme. Travel support will also be offered to a small number of
educators who are actively engaged in presenting information on polar studies in
their classrooms. In addition, selection for travel-grant awards will be based
on disciplinary balance, geographical location, interest in polar-related
activities, a balance of Antarctic and Arctic participation, financial need, and
the ability to assume some of the travel costs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
