This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of
2009(Public Law 111-5). This Integrative Graduate Education and Research
Traineeship (IGERT) award supports a program at the University of California,
Los Angeles on the topic of clean energy for green industry. An
interdisciplinary approach to graduate education is designed to train U.S. Ph.D.
scientists and engineers for leadership roles in the clean energy sector. The
technical thrusts merge three scientific areas of energy harvesting, storage and
conservation with policy and business to address complex clean energy issues and
identify areas for transformational research. Through this foundational
structure, this IGERT addresses the urgent societal challenge of meeting
increasing energy needs without further negatively affecting the environment.
The development of such solutions is only feasible through university-industry-
local government partnerships with highly-skilled, broadly-educated, globally-
minded leadership. Such partnerships have high potential for economic
development in urban areas primed for growth in this sector, with a well-trained
workforce, a supportive government and visionary industrial foundations. Close
interaction with industry is fostered through industrial innovation partners,
intellectual property development and rapid technology transfer for job
creation. Emphasis is placed on economic expansion through clean energy
research, new business, highly trained workforce development, equity and
inclusion. Program strategies include cross-disciplinary, integrated research
and education training, modular clean energy curriculum for both on-campus and
on-line dissemination, diversity and inclusion. The overarching theme of energy
harvesting, storage, conservation and policy is echoed in integrated research,
education and service components. IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet
the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the
interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the
technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of
the future. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate
education by establishing innovative new models for graduate education and
training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends
traditional disciplinary boundaries.
