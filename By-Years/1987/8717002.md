Nitrogen compounds are among the most important chemical species involved in
the complex chemical and photochemical processes in the global troposphere.
Interactions of odd- nitrogen compounds with non-methane hydrocarbons and a
variety of radical species have been shown to have a potential impact on
atmospheric chemistry on local, regional, and global scales. Because of their
central role in atmospheric chemistry, a complete study of the cycle of odd-
nitrogen compounds has been recommended as part of an overall Global
Tropospheric Chemistry Program. Alkyl nitrates are photochemical products of
atmospheric hydrocarbon oxidation in the presence of reactive oxides of
nitrogen. Recent measurements of alkyl nitrates that these compounds may
constitute a significant fraction of the total reactive nitrogen in the "clean"
troposphere. Because of their potential contribution in the nitrogen budget and
their significance to oxidant chemistry, detailed information is required to
understand the sources, composition, concentration and variability of alkyl
nitrate in the global troposphere. The objectives of this research are to
accurately measure relevant alkyl nitrate compounds in the troposphere, to
estimate the contribution of alkyl nitrates to the budget of reactive nitrogen
species in the troposphere, and to investigate the long-range transport of alkyl
nitrates to remote marine areas.
