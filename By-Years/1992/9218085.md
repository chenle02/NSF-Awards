The origin of the magnetic fields on the Sun and other cool stars remains an
important but poorly understood phenomenon in astrophysics. Since magnetic
activity has been shown to change the sun's luminosity and ultraviolet flux, it
may have significant effects on the terrestrial environment. The PI has
developed a numerical method of studying the emergence of magnetic flux tubes
from their supposed place of origin at the base of the convective zone to the
surface of the Sun. He will now explore the effects of varying the magnetic
field, the total flux and the initial location of the flux. Differential
rotation and radiative diffusion will be studied. Flux emergence on other cool
stars will be explored.
