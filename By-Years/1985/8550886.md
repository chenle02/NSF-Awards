The Council of State Science Supervisors will develop a science education
database and a telecommunications (computer/telephone) network among the 50
state Departments of Education, the National Science Teachers Association and
its affiliates, the National Science Resource Center/National Academy of
Sciences, and existing intrastate systems. The computers and peripherals will be
donated to the project by IBM. The network will facilitate close working
relationships among national, state, and local educational agencies and serve
private organizations who wish to use it. The database to be developed and
disseminated will include: -abstracts of curriculum guides for all disciplines
in science available from all 50 states, -common topics taught in science
programs in the states, and valid and reliable assessment items, -a science
educator's employment listing, -current certification standards, -calendars of
important activity dates of major science education organizations, -position
papers concerning effective science teaching, -general science education
information of use to teachers, -contemporary legislative and court activities
which will impact science education, and -messages and surveys. Information
distributed on the primary network will reach teachers in each state through
intrastate computer networks or existing intrastate newsletters. Organizations
dedicated to improving science education will be contacted and encouraged to
link to the network directly, or indirectly through their state science
supervisor.
