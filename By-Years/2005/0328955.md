Waste plastic treatment technology is becoming an increasingly more important
concern in the recovery of valuable fossil fuel resources and especially in
terms of environmental protection. This is particularly relevant in the case of
halogenated plastics, such as PVC, where the presence of chlorine renders the
waste less amenable to recycle than is the case with such polymers as
polyethylene or polypropylene. Tens of millions of tons of PVC are manufactured
each year in the US and practically none of it is recycled. Catalytic
hydrodehalogenation represents an alternative, innovative and promising approach
whereby the waste halogenated plastics can be transformed into reusable
products. This investigation explores the feasibility of a catalytic degradation
of waste PVC with a concomitant targeted chemical transformation of the
chlorinated content into recoverable HCl. This will generate a fuel oil free of
any chlorinated contaminants, which can be combusted without the problem of
releasing toxic chlorine compounds into the environment. The proposal represents
a significant advance over the investigators prior successful efforts in
fundamental hydrodehalogenation studies. The research will also be a part of a
multidisciplinary training program that provides research experiences for
undergraduates, undergraduate co-op students, and graduate students and that
targets underrepresented groups. A major long-term societal benefit would also
be the development of a new remediation technology in which a potentially toxic
waste is transformed into commercially viable products with no detrimental
effect on the environment.
