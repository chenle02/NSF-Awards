Elimination of the need for painstaking alignment of coronal X-ray images with
vector magnetograms and for expert scrutiny of the X-ray structure of the core
field is an important step toward practical operational forecasting of Earth-
directed Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) and their geoeffectiveness from vector
magnetographs. An empirical evaluation of the reliability of core magnetic field
determinations based upon three distinct methods will be carried out. These
magnetogram-alone methods of resolving the 180 degree ambiguity in the direction
of the transverse magnetic field in cases of strong shear and twist will be
tested with a set of 20-30 active regions where coeval X-ray data can be used to
define the field direction. The active regions that have strongly sheared core
magnetic fields are most likely to produce CMEs, and knowledge of the
orientation of this core field is important for anticipating the direction of
the Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) at Earth.
