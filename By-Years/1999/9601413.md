This project in computational cosmology deals with studies of inhomogeneous
cosmological space-times in regions where the standard linear theory of
cosmological perturbations has its limitations, namely super-horizon scales or
highly non- linear collapse of matter structures. Prof. Laguna's approach will
utilize high performance computing to solve the full non-linear set of
Einstein's equations governing cosmological dynamics. This will be followed up
with investigations of the propagation of light in clumpy universes. Here, the
emphasis will be on two topics: weak gravitational lensing and polarization of
the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. This research is timely and
complementary to previous research in this area that makes little use of the
full details of modern gravitation theory. CMB polarization experiments are now
being undertaken by several different groups, and it will be important to
understand the implications of their results.
