The PI studies a variety of problems in non-holonomic dynamics. The study is
related with rigidity theory, the theory of completely integrable systems with
continuous and discrete time, contact geometry, and the theory of Hill's
equation. The main theme of the research is an interaction between continuous
and discrete, and between rigidity and flexibility. The methods of study are
mostly geometrical. The project has grown out of the PI's work in these areas in
the last several years.

This research project has a potential of making an impact in a number of applied
fields including vehicle motion theory, pursuit problems, theoretical robotics,
and flotation theory. The developed methods and new insights will find
applications in various other problems of contemporary interest, modeled by
ordinary differential and finite difference equations. The PI is the Director of
the Mathematics Advance Studies Semesters Program (MASS) at Penn State. The
project has an additional impact by engaging the MASS participants, advanced
undergraduate students from across the USA, and influencing their career choices
in mathematics and related disciplines.
