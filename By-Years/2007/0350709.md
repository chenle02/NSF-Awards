Increasingly, arbitration is being used to settle disputes. Because traditional
litigation is more costly and requires a greater degree of disclosure than
arbitration, many companies prefer arbitration to settle disputes. The inclusion
of clauses in a variety of contracts which stipulate arbitration as the dispute
mechanism is ever increasing, a phenomenon which has been bolstered by the U.S.
Supreme Courts decision that employers can force workers to use binding
arbitration to settle labor disputes. With this increasing reliance on
arbitration and the availability of choices as to its structure, it is important
to understand the ramifications of the specific form of arbitration being
employed. Predominantly arbitration takes one of two forms, "conventiona" where
the arbiter unilaterally decides the outcome and "final offer" where the arbiter
has to select from proposals offered by the disputants. &lt;br/&gt;This project
examines the theoretical and behavioral properties of these common forms of
arbitration as well as other less prominent methods. Specifically, the project
examines the role of uncertainty regarding the value of the issue under dispute.
For example, in a labor dispute the market value of the worker's output may be
unknown when the wage is negotiated. The specific guidelines of alternative
arbitration mechanisms coupled with uncertainty generate a variety of strategies
each bargainer might undertake. By systematically varying the uncertainty and
the arbitration method, this study identifies what outcomes are likely to arise
in particular situations, thereby enabling more informed decisions by
individuals, consumer groups, businesses and others facing arbitration. This
research will also serve to inform policy makers about potential structural
biases as arbitration continues to serve as a substitute for court
proceedings.&lt;br/&gt;
