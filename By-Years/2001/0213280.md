ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: CTS-0213280&lt;br/&gt;Principal

Sta&lt;br/&gt;Title: GOALI - Characterization of Dense Colloidal Suspensions
with FDPM&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, the PI proposes to (i) develop
and test new inverse algorithms for assessing particle size and size
distribution in monodisperse, binary, and polydisperse suspensions from
experimental multi-wavelength FDPM data, (ii) assess changes in FDPM measured
scattering properties arising from depletion force, electrostatic interactions,
and colloids functionalized with ligand receptor systems of biological
significance; and (iii) evaluate those changes in the context of first
principles models of partial structure factor. The final objective of the GOALI
project is to develop a low cost, simple diagnostics tool in characterize the
interaction between colloidal particles in dense suspensions. Extension of the
system to on-line characterization of intermediate and final colloidal products
is planned for chemical, pharmaceutical, and biotechnology
industries.&lt;br/&gt;
