Professor Leonard Gross is one of the leading researchers in mathematical
physics. He has made major contributions to analysis on Hilbert space,
probability theory, logarithmic Sobolev inequalities, and quantum field theory.
Of highest priority in the current proposal is the construction of quantized
Yang-Mills fields. He hopes to combine his previous work on abelian gauge goups
with his previous work on nonabelian path dependent field strengths and with
techniques from stochastic differential equations to obtain compactness of
Euclidean measures. Second, Professor Gross plans to seek a Euclidean extension
of his earlier work on Clifford algebra hypercontractivity for Fermions. Such an
extension is expected to be closely related to the Osterwalder-Schrader
formulation of Euclidean quantum field theory, Third, Professor Gross plans to
explore the existence of logarithmic Sobolev inequalities on noncompact Lie
groups and on hyperbolic n-space via the method of central limit type theorems
on groups.
