Tree-ring chronologies provide one of the most important records of past
climate. These records provide annual resolution and unambiguous records of
terrestrial climatological change. This research project will reconstruct the
magnitude and frequency of drought in the northern Great Plains of North America
for last three-hundred year interval of earth history. The geographic location
for this study has been neglected in previous paloeclimate research. Since it is
an important agricultural region for the US, understanding the history of
drought in this region is important for understanding future climate changes and
their possible effect on food supplies.
