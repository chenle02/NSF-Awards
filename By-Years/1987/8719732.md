Anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a are pharmacologically active peptides derived from
the third and fifth components of serum complement. When administered focally to
the rat hypothalamus, they mimic the neurotransmitters dopamine and
norepinephrine in their respective abilities to modify standard behavioral
tests. There are specific binding sites for both peptides on fresh brain slices
and for C3a on synaptosome fractions (nerve terminal fractions in vitro). C5a
has been shown to stimulate the release of both dopamine and norepinephrine from
synaptosomes. Preliminary data obtained by high performance liquid
chromatography indicate that C3a releases dopamine from synaptosomes of the
striatal region of the forebrain. Dr. William's data are the first report of
activities of the anaphylatoxins in the central nervous system. Further study of
these phenomena may reveal their possible modulatory function in the brain.
There are two main objectives in Dr. William's proposed studies. The first
objective is to characterize the locations and mechanisms of neurotransmitter
releasing activity in the brain. The release of neurotransmitter substances in
vitro in the presence of blockers for calcium channels, GTP binding proteins and
autoreceptors. The second objective is to associate the brain binding sites with
specific nerve terminal types by immunocytochemistry and transmission electron
microscopy.
