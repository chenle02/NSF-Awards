To investigate the electrification of clouds near their tops, the electric
field will be measured using three research aircraft during the
Convection/Precipitation/Electrification Experiment (CaPE) scheduled for Florida
during the Summer of 1991. Also, the persistence of charge in dissipating
thunderstorm clouds will be investigated using the same aircraft and
instrumentation.
