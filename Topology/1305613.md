The PI plans to study topology of 3-manifolds, especially Heegaard splittings of
3-manifolds. The first part of the project is to investigate the relation
between the Heegaard genus of a 3-manifold and the rank of its fundamental
group. This research is built on the PI's recent success in constructing a
hyperbolic counterexample to the Rank versus Genus Conjecture. The second goal
of the proposed research is to answer a long-standing question in 3-manifold
topology concerning Heegaard genus and a degree-one map. This question asks
whether it is possible to have a degree-one map from a 3-manifold to another
3-manifold with larger Heegaard genus. This question is related to the Poincare
Conjecture as well as a few other important questions in 3-manifold topology.
The third part of the project is to solve a conjecture of Morimoto and Moriah on
tunnel number of knots in the 3-sphere. The PI plans to develop new tools and
use techniques from his previous work to achieve these goals.

Three-manifolds are objects modeled on the 3-dimensional space that we are
living in. A donut and the spatial universe are both examples of 3-manifolds.
These objects arise naturally in many contexts in physical and other natural
sciences and model many interesting phenomena. A geometric way of studying
3-manifolds is to cut a complicated 3-manifold into a pair of simpler
3-dimensional pieces called handebodies along a 2-dimensional surface. This
decomposition is called a Heegaard splitting. The PI plans to study 3-manifolds
using Heegaard splittings. The research targets several central questions in
low-dimensional topology and knot theory, which has potential impact on other
areas of scientific investigations, such as the topological structures of DNA.
