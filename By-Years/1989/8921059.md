Attempts to explain what caused the stock market crashes around the world in
October, 1987 have suffered from the paucity of major economic developments
occurring around that time that could have triggered the crashes. Shifting
expectations regarding monetary policy, foreign investors' fears of a dollar
decline, increasing riskiness of assets--none of these appeared major enough, if
at all, to explain the magnitude of the crashes. The purpose of this project is
to determine whether the climate of investor expectations before the crash was
such that these expectations, in and of themseleves, could have been a major
factor in causing the crash. Transactions data for stock-option futures traded
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange will be analyzed to investigate the nature of
these expectations. These data should be especially informative in this regard
because, theoretically, there should be a close relationship between option
prices and underlying asset prices. For example, a significant probability of a
market crash will lead to relatively high prices for put options that pay off
only when the stock market falls substantially. This project will glean new
insights from the options data about expectations of a market crash. This
research is important because it should corroborate or discredit the hypothesis
that the crash was a self-fulfilling prophesy--i.e., that the market crashed
because investors simply viewed it as over valued and expected a crash.
