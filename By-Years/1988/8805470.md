The PIs intend to develop and refine application of micro- Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) to fluid composition studies in both synthetic and
natural fluid inclusions and fluid-buffering minerals. Comparison of FTIR and
other spectroscopic techniques will be carried out for calibration purposes to
improve methods of determining H2O-CO2, etc. contents. Compositions of fluids so
determined will be used with other techniques (phase equilibria, stable
isotopes, etc.) to understand conditions of high-grade metamorphism, and the
compositions, quantities, and modes of migration for fluids in the deep crust.
Specifically, they will address the controversy regarding the extent to which
granulite facies metamorphism is dominated by partial melting vs. CO2
infiltration.
