Collaborative Project: Cepheids in Magellanic Cloud Star Clusters. This award
supports Dr. Olszewski's participation in a joint project with Dr. Mario Mateo
of the Carnegie Institution. These researchers will identify and study Cepheids
in star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds. These stars provide a fundamental
data set to fine tune the Cepheid distance scale, as well as pulsational and
stellar evolutionary theory.
