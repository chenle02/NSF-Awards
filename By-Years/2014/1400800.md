This award supports fundamental research on porosity formation and localization
of electrochemical deposition in order to develop an innovative additive process
for manufacturing of metal parts without thermal damage. Specifically, the
research team will perform molecular dynamics simulation of porosity formation
during electrochemical deposition to understand the mechanism of porosity
formation in electrochemical deposition, develop a physics-based predictive
model for prediction of porosity in electrochemical deposition and conduct
experiments to verify the model, test the hypothesis that current density is the
determining factor for porosity in electrochemical deposition, evaluate the
feasibility of using localized electrochemical deposition to produce functional
metal parts from computer aided design models, and establish the process
parametric relationships in electrochemical
deposition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is expected to have a
transformative effect on 3-D printing of a wide variety of conductive materials,
result in extensive benefits to biomedical, healthcare, electronic, automotive,
and metal working industries, and extend frontiers of additive manufacturing.
Research results will provide knowledge and understanding to perform layer-by-
layer manufacturing of metal parts by electrochemical deposition and enable
producing metal parts by additive manufacturing without thermal damage. This
research project features multi-disciplinary approach involving manufacturing
technology, molecular dynamics simulation, electrochemistry, control theory, and
materials science. This multi-disciplinary approach will positively impact
engineering education at University of Cincinnati, and broaden participation of
the underrepresented groups in research.
