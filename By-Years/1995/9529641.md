9529641 Bray In this project, the PI will supervise and work closely with
students from Indonesia to analyze, interpret, and publish data collected in a
study of the Indonesian Throughflow. The flow of water from the Pacific through
the Indonesian Archipelago to the Indian Ocean is a problem of long-standing
interest to the oceanographic community, and the PI, in collaboration with a
number of other US institutions and Indonesian scientists, has made significant
progress in obtaining data that will allow this flow to be quantified. Work has
been carried out on an Indonesian vessel, and Indonesian scientists, as well as
Indonesian students are intimately involved with the work.
