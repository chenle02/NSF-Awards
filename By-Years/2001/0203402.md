The Advanced Materials Program in the Division of Chemistry makes this award to
Furman University to prepare solid-state charge-transfer complexes from
functionalized diacetylenes. With this award, Professors Timothy Hanks at Furman
University and William Pennington at Clemson University will prepare three types
of polymeric materials - crystalline and microcrystalline powders, and amorphous
thin films - from hosts derived from donor diacetylene molecules with attached
inclusion acceptor-compounds - organo-iodides - in a 'pocket' or 'cavity' of the
polymeric material. Nanoporous zeolite type materials will be prepared from
these polymers after removal of the inclusion compounds by thermolysis or
solvent extraction. A number of donor molecules, which not only photopolymerize,
but also provide cavities of different sizes and shapes for acceptor molecules,
will be synthesized and characterized, and these studies may result in new
classes of porous organic solids with tunable optical, electronic and chemical
properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The zeolite-like nanoporous materials that will
be prepared in this study are expected to have tunable optical, electronic and
chemical properties. This project at a primarily undergraduate institution,
which has an active research program with undergraduate and high school
students, will provide, in addition, research and educational opportunities in
material synthesis and characterization.
