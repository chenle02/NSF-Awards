Two on-going research projects; (1) Computer Simulation of hyperthermic Cancer
Therapy and (2) Hydrodynamic Simulations of Continental Shelf Oceanography share
a common need for high performance graphics workstations - both require the
construction, display, and the manipulation of complex geometrical models for
three-dimensional finite element analysis. The limitations imposed by
conventional two-dimensional projections of three-dimensional objects
necessitates that graphical processing occur in real-time in order to verify
data input and analyze data output. The hyperthermia research involves the
construction of three-dimensional anatomical models of the human body as
computational domains which are used to analyze understand and define adequate
thermal dose delivery. The hydrodynamic numerical studies focuses on selected
oceanographic processes such as tides and currents and their effects on
temperature profiles, nutrient distributions as well as other environmental
factors. Detailed geometrical representations of the complex waterways, e.g.
Gulf of Maine, Alboran Sea, etc., are necessary for accurate simulations.
Despite the distinctively different phenomenon involved both research projects
share the feature that the fine geometrical details have a major influence on
the computed results. The action provides partial support for the purchase of a
Silicon-Graphics IRIS graphics workstation which will be networked with the
existing computational resources within the Numerical Methods Laboratory of the
Thayer School.
