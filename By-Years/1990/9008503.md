With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program will support the research of Dr.
Harold Hart of the Department of Chemistry at Michigan State University. Dr.
Hart will continue his program which focuses on the synthesis of novel aromatic
compounds with rigid frameworks that have intramolecular cavities, and that have
exceptional thermal stabilities. Synthetic studies developed for the iptycenes
will be extended to substituted and functionalized supertriptycene, to
supertritriptycene, to cycloiptycenes, to novel iptycene "trimers", to helically
chiral iptycenes, and to triptycenes containing two and three anthracene
moieties. Also targeted for synthesis is tetrahedralene, a novel C36H24
hydrocarbon containing four tri-substituted benzene rings and six cis double
bonds that has T symmetry, a central cavity, and is calculated to be strain-
free.
