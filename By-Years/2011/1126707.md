Research Objectives and Approaches: The objective of this research is to bridge
engineering and natural sciences in an inter-disciplinary collaboration, which
will enhance course instruction and research projects across disciplines. The
approach is to acquire a state-of-art biopotential instrumentation system that
allows the PIs to enhance their collaboration in more advanced research projects
with students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The intellectual merit
of the proposal is centered on enhancing a facility that will foster the
interaction between the faculty and students in science and engineering to plan
and conduct research. This interaction will allow its members to work as a team
of scientists and engineers across disciplines, and to interpret and communicate
research findings in both peer-reviewed journal publications and at national
conferences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The broader impacts will be
to effectively integrate education and research; enhance scientific and
technical understanding, and engage in research that can benefit society. The
outcome of this research is aimed at developing new devices and/or new
treatments to improve the quality of life of individuals suffering from
neurological disorders. This collaboration is being conducted by under-
represented minorities at different stages of professional development, who have
demonstrated a track record of engaging under-represented minority students in
research in the natural sciences and engineering. This equipment will be
utilized to continue improving the research projects from their successful
collaborations and allow students to conduct research and independent study
projects. Through a data-sharing plan, peer-institutions will be able to access
the data collected with this equipment for other projects.
