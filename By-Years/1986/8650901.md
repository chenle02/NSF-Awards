The quality of undergraduate laboratory instruction at Mount Holyoke College is
being enhanced through the recent acquisition of video equipment to illustrate
the conduct of laboratory work on a micro scale in chemistry, biology and
psychology. Micro-scale laboratory work is necessary in many departments
currently for reasons of safety, economy, and ease of waste disposal. In each of
the three disciplinary areas, high resolution, high color fidelity video is
being used to instruct students in micro-manipulation and identification.
Properly recorded and edited video tapes preserve simulations and experiments
for student use in the future.
