This Engineering Research Equipment Grant will support Watts of modelocked power
at 1.053 um. This laser, which generates 50 picosecond pulses, will be used to
pump a near IR femtosecond dye laser, and also seed a Nd:YLF regenerative
amplifier. The proposed Nd:YLF laser will replace our failing Nd:YAG laser and
provide us with the needed reliability and stability necessary to carry out
planned fundamental and device studies on GaAs based samples. It will also allow
us to extend our femtosecond system operating wavelength from 870nm to 1.3 um
and enable us to expand our time- resolved studies of optical nonlinearities to
narrow gap InGaAs semiconductor materials.
