A set of experiments using a novel apparatus is being developed to learn more
about energy transfer between molecules. Information on interactions on surfaces
versus gas phase transfers are derived. The findings from this research have
potential application in heterogeneous catalysis, semi-conductor device
chemistry, and chemical laser design.
