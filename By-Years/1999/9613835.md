Abstract CTS-9613835 R. Lueptow Northwestern University Particle motion and
concentration in the proximity of the cylindrical surface of a rotating filter
separator will be investigated, ond on this basis the anti-plugging mechanisms
and filtration performance will be better evaluated. Particle Tracking
Velocimetry and video imaging will give information on the role of Taylor
vortices and shear flow in reducing the pore plugging. Microscopic and
macroscopic modeling will provide the framework to scale-up the results. The
effects of particle density, size and concentration, as well as the influence of
the filter rotational speed, will be analyzed. Critical parameters, such as the
ratio between the particle and pore size for optimum performance, are expected
to be determined. The results will be useful for the design of rotating filter
separators and scale-up of laboratory data, as well as for enhancement of
filtration performance with particular relevance to bioengineering.
