Ohio Northern University has purchased a FTNMR equipped for 13C and 1H. This
instrument is being used at Northwest Ohio as well as other institutions in the
surrounding 15 county areas. This instrument impacts college science instruction
in several ways. First, a two day collegium for chemistry faculty at the ten
area small colleges and branch campuses is offered. The attendees perform a
variety of applications on the instrument and will use the instrument in courses
offered at their own institution. A summer workshop for secondary teachers
provides hands-on experience for these teachers. The instrument is also
integrated into all levels of the curriculum at Ohio Northern University. The
institution is matching the NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.
