*** 9633386 Shinosuka Recent earthquakes have demonstrated that urban
infrastructure failures in general and highway systems failures in particular
can cause significant economic loss. This project examines the effect of
earthquakes on urban highway infrastructure productivity by making use of a
multidisciplinary and integrative approach, combining expertise in civil
engineering, urban planning, economics, and public policy. Emphasis will be
placed on filling the gap that currently exists between traditional engineering
and socio-economic and policy issues studies. The objective of this project is
to develop an integrated framework and innovative methodologies for evaluating
the economic consequences of urban seismic risk and risk reduction from the
perspective of infrastructure systems performance and productivity. The results
can contribute to the long-term goal of optimally enhancing the productivity of
urban highway transportation infrastructure exposed to significant seismic
hazard. While the methodologies developed will be applicable to urban areas in
general, a prototyping exercise will refine the general framework in the case of
highway transportation systems in Los Angeles. The prototype will provide a
foundation for evaluating the general framework in which it will be embedded. In
addition, the framework and results from the prototyping exercise will guide the
development of experimental civil infrastructure curricula at the University of
Southern California intended to serve as a model for multidisciplinary education
and training of students.***
