The Large Hadron Collider now being built at the European Laboratory for
Particle Physics promises discoveries of great scientific importance. This will
be the first particle accelerator with sufficiently high energy to enable
researchers to study fundamental interactions of a kind never before observed -
those responsible for giving particles mass. With its ability to explore the
mass/energy region of one trillion electron volts (1TeV), the LHC will be
instrumental in the completion of the Standard Model of the strong,
electromagnetic and weak forces. The construction of the Large Hadron Collider
is an international effort with collaborators from many countries. 20% of which
are from the United States including a number here at the University of Iowa.
The Collaborators from the University of Iowa are involved with the CMS portion
of the LHC and are particularly involved with its Forward Calorimeter part of
the Hadron Calorimeter.

The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS): CMS is a proton-proton detector designed to run
at the highest luminosity in the LHC. The main features of the CMS are a muon
system, an electromagnetic calorimeter, a central tracking, and a hadron
calorimeter. One of the goals of the CMS project it to find the Higgs Boson HO
which is predicted to exist by the Standard Model of Particle Physics.

This proposal focuses on the scientific exploitation of the CMS detector, one of
two general-purpose detectors at the LHC. This group plan to strengthen
university infrastructure in four areas critical to the long-term success of the
CMS research program: software and computing, maintenance and operations,
detector upgrade research and development and education and outreach (E/O).
