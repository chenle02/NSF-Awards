Contemporary encryption schemes are almost exclusively distribution-agnostic.
Their security properties are independent of the statistical characteristics of
plaintexts, and the output of these schemes are ciphertexts that are uniformly
distributed bit strings, irrespective of use case. While conceptually simple,
such encryption schemes fail to meet basic, real-world requirements and have
left longstanding functional gaps in key security applications. This project
investigates new formalisms and methodologies to guide scientific exploration of
such security challenges and yield novel, principled solutions backed by
experimental validation and robust, practical design. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project develops a new framework, called Distribution-Sensitive Cryptography
(DSC), for cryptographic tool design that will connect and improve upon several
existing primitives and produce entirely new ones. DSC can be applied to create
new solutions to security challenges for which good approaches have historically
been elusive, including brute-force attacks against password-based encryption,
censorship of encrypted protocols, and securing human-generated authentication
secrets. The investigators are actively engaged with industry partners, to glean
real-world requirements and to transition the new tools into practice.
