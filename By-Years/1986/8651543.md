Children's Television Workshop(CTW) has produced a special 30 minute program for
their "3-2-1 CONTACT" science series on the space program in response to the
recent space shuttle tragedy. CTW has extensive footage on the scientific
aspects of the space program along with interviews with astronauts Charles
Bolden, Sally Ride, Mary Cleave and Franklin Chang-Diaz. The program is hosted
by Robin, one of the regulars on "3-2-1 CONTACT." This program, aimed at
children ages 8-12, reviews the scientific aspects of space exploration,
examines the risks, explores the many- faceted life of being an astronaut, and
places the space program in an understandable context for children.
