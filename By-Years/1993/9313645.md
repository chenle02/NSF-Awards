9313645 Kleinman This proposal concerns a numerical and methodological first
principles approach to the calculation of the electronic structure of large
unit-cell systems both at zero and finite temperature with a view to finding
heats of formation, surface energies, surface magnetism, elastic constants and
so on. Specific systems for study include 1) Boron carbides 2) Ge-GaAs
interfaces 3) Rh(001) surfaces 4) NaK alloys and 5) Gd(001) surfaces. Work also
continues with the development of better pseudopotentials and better density
functionals for exchange and correlation - with a specific view to improving
descriptions of f-electron states. %%% The work described here is at the cutting
edge of the general area of calculating materials propoerties from a first-
principles atomistic approach. Metallic and semiconducting systems will be
studied as well as the more problematic heavy-metals. The proposal concerns not
only sophisticated "number crunching" to get at specific properties of interest
such as surface magnetism, melting points of alloys, elastic constants etc., but
also the basics of how to do ever more reliable and yet faster calculations.
This work is in the top league of computational materials science in this
country. ***
