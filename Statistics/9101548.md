The Principal Investigator will study statistical methods. These involve the
optimal choices of sequences of binary questions for problems of classification,
probability class estimation, regression, and survival analysis. Much of the
computer- intensive research that is planned involves new capabilities and
significant improvements of the algorithms and techniques given by Breiman,
Friedman, Olshen, and Stone in Classification and Regression Trees and its
associated CART software. Some computations will be done in an innovative
distributed mode on a system of workstations. The investigators plan
applications to test data sets, particularly a large data set concerning the
quick diagnosis of heart attack. Details are given for an application to the
enhancement of certain magnetic resonance images that are important to making
prognoses for patients with lymphoma. (Support is not requested for the conduct
of clinical trials; indeed, the data do not arise from conventional clinical
trials.) The statistics research involved is of importance to a wide variety of
applications, some of them medical.
