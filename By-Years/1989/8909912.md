In FY 89 a few number of U.S. investigators were supported by NSF to conduct a
study of the 1985 Chile earthquake. This project is to provide international
travel support for some of these investigators to travel to Chile for a joint
conference with Chilean investigators of the same earthquake. The scientific
exchange and interaction will be conducted in Santiago, Chile in August 1989
during the occasion of the Fifth Quadrennial Chilean Conference on Seismology
and Earthquake Engineering. A proceeding of the conference will document the
technical information and made available to the research community.
