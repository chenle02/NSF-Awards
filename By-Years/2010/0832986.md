ARI-MA: Collaborative Research: High Z Materials for Nuclear Detection: Synergy
of Growth, Characterization and Defect Physics for Room Temperature
Devices&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to
develop novel high density thin films for application as room temperature
nuclear detection devices and to understand the basic charge collection
mechanisms that would govern their performance. The approach is a synergistic
coupling of crystal growth, materials characterization and device physics. The
goal is to combine expertise in materials science, physics and engineering for
potential breakthroughs in the application of complex oxides with high stopping
power to achieve cost-effective nuclear detection capability.&lt;br/&gt;The
intellectual merit of the work will be the development of a fundamental
framework for the identification of new candidate materials, coupled with
development of the characterization tools and miniaturized electronics required
for next generation devices. The work will leverage significant recent
breakthroughs in the field of complex functional oxide materials with tunable
electronic properties.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact will be in the contribution
to national infrastructure for nuclear scanning capability and in the
development of human capital. Graduate and undergraduate students will be
educated in this highly interdisciplinary field and student recruitment will
leverage existing programs to enhance diversity at UC Berkeley and the Naval
Postgraduate School (NPS). An outreach component is also included in
collaboration with the NPS Center for Homeland Defense and Security. This will
provide high-quality materials to educate local and state officials, and other
first responders, on the availability, limitations and potential impact of
current and future technologies for nuclear threat detection.
