9408525 Weiss This research will investigate the sources of agricultural
productivity growth during the nineteenth century. The goal of the study is to
decompose the growth of output per worker into four key components: increased
time at work, increased effort per unit of time, shifts in the composition of
farm output, increased mechanization, and yield per acre. The decomposition
analysis is carried out for men, women and children in the labor force. The
study uses time series data on the U.S. labor force for 1820 and each of the
decade from 1840 to 1900. The basic analysis is extended using alternative
estimates of labor input, and accounting for labor requirements that vary by
region, among other things. This study is important because it identifies those
sources of agricultural productivity growth that would enable us to gain
valuable insights into the role of agriculture in industrialization and vice-
versa.
