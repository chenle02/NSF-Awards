The University of Northern Iowa will initiate a three-week, commuter, Early
Alert Initiative Young Scholars project in Mathematics and Physics for 24
students entering grades 7,8. This project emphasizes research participation in
the study of energy transer, light, sound, probability, and statistics. Students
conduct investigations and design experiments. There also are opportunities for
students to engage in career exploration activities through interactions with
scientists.
