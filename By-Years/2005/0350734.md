The proposed two-day workshop ( November 19-20,2003) will provide a much-needed
opportunity for researchers, practitioners, and educators to convene and discuss
some of the many pressing issues regarding emergency management as it is
evolving currently in the U.S., particularly in a national environment that is
pre-occupied with homeland security. The focus will be on documenting research
and policy needs in the fields of emergency management and homeland security.
The basic intellectual intent of this workshop is to initiate a process of
knowledge coordination and transfer. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project team
plans will ask some of the workshop invitees to help shape the agenda by
providing their input about the issues and topics of highest need and interest.
After the workshop, the final report will provide a list of recommendations from
the 80 participants regarding future research and policy needs, with their
priorities indicated. The results will be shared with attendees, NSF, and with
the interested public via a project website. The workshop and follow-on
activities are intended to assist in the formulation of programs and projects
that result from the unprecedented government initiative that established the
Dept. of Homeland Security. In particular, education and training programs
designed for current and future emergency managers and first responders will
benefit from a process that helps to re-define emergency management within the
context of homeland security. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
