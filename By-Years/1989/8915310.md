In flowering plants reproductive success is measured not only by the number of
seeds produced in an individual's own fruits, but also by the number of seeds
sired in fruits of other plants. This second component of reproduction has been
coined, " male reproductive success," because it reflects a plant's ability to
disperse pollen or male gametes to other receptive individuals in the
population. Few studies have measured male reproductive success in natural plant
populations. Consequently, we know very little about the characteristics that
make certain individuals more successful male parents than others. This issue is
central to our understanding of the evolution of floral traits and functional
sex ratios in plant populations. The proposed research will use protein markers
(isoenzymes) to monitor paternity in experimental populations of the alpine
plant, Polemonium viscosum. In this way it can be determined whether male
reproductive success is influenced by extensive variation in flower size, pollen
production and nectar production in this species. The proposed research has
important implications for crop improvement and management. First, our ability
to prevent contamination of crop seed by pollen of related weed populations
depends on our knowledge of factors controlling pollen donation. Next, spread of
valuable genetic improvements through crop populations can be accomplished most
readily if genes for such improvements are associated with others enhancing
paternal success. Third, introducing superior pollen donors into stands of
orchard or seed crops should improve yield with little economic cost and no
environmental damage. The proposed research will provide information basic to
reaching these goals.
