This project continues the research initiated earlier on the numerical modeling
of clouds including parameterizations for electrical charging, charge
separation, and lightning. It includes the analysis of cloud electrical and
microphysical data collected by the storm-penetrating T-28 aircraft during the
STEPS program (Severe Thunderstorm Electrification and Precipitation Study)
conducted in Kansas in the early summer of 2000. The existing cloud model will
be improved by addition of a more accurate treatment of microphysics, apart from
electrical effects, and by experimenting with different parameterizations for
the non-inductive charging mechanism. The model will be validated by comparison
with observations of thunderstorms from STEPS and other field programs. A new
objective is to compute Maxwell current vectors as part of the simulations as a
way to test hypotheses that relate thunderstorm activity to the global
electrical circuit. The work advances the understanding of thunderstorms by
providing a comprehensive and self-consistent numerical model that enables the
simulation of charging, lightning, and precipitation under different
environmental conditions.
