9629245 Oberbauer Tropical rain forests (IRF), the worlds most productive
terrestrial ecosystems, are a major component of the global carbon budget. The
lack of a comprehensive understanding of the relation between climate and TRF
productivity is a major impediment for realistically modeling the role of TRF in
global carbon budgets under current and possible future climate scenarios.
Recent results from fie1d work in Costa Rica, supported by other modeling
studies, show that tree growth in TRF varies significantly on a year-to-year
basis. This variation is not related to simple annual averages of climatic
variables, and is therefore hypothesized to result from the interaction of these
variables on a sub-annual scale. To determine the basis for this major ecosystem
response will require a combination of controlled observations and modeling at
physiologically relevant time scales, which is the goal of this project. This
research will address four central hypotheses: 1) Forest-level productivity in
TRF varies substantially among years. 2) Variation in annual aboveground
production is driven by the combined effects of subannual variation in radiation
and temperature, with episodic soil moisture limitation. 3) Stand-level
production in TRF varies significantly along within-forest edaphic gradients. 4)
TRF productivity is significantly affected by variation in speeies composition.
To assess forest-level productivity and its relation to climate, annual
production of tree biomass, fine litter, fine roots, and coarse wood debris will
be measured. The study-plots will be replicated across the main topographic and
edaphic gradients present in the old-growth TRF at the La Selva Biological
Station in Costa Rica. In parallel with the plots, tree functional responses to
climatic factors will be determined at short and medium time scales for species
of trees from different functional groups. Short-term studies will be used to
assess the relation between whole-tree performance and local microclimate. Th e
response functions developed from this work will be further tested and
calibrated on a series of individuals measured monthly. These functional
responses will then be used to parameterize a top down model of forest
productivity, based on the relationship between canopy carbon gain and
intercepted radiation. Results of both the empirical studies of forest
productivity and the forest-level process model, will potentially have wide
applicability for understanding regional variations in TRF productivity,
predicting responses to global climatic change, and for managing human-
influenced tropical ecosystems.
