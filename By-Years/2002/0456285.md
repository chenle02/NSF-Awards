This is a U.S.- China Conference consisting of two workshops on research and
education partnership in symbolic computation proposed by Dr. Michael Singer,
North Carolina State University and Professor Ziming Li, Chinese Academy of
Sciences, China. One workshop will be at North Carolina State University in
Raleigh, NC on October 16-22, 2005, and the other at the Mathematics
Mechanization Research Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, from
July 31-August 6, 2006. The workshops will focus on important issues related to
symbolic computation and will include one junior scientist and 7 U.S. graduate
students. A long-term research partnership is expected to develop between the
U.S. and Chinese researchers and graduate students. This conference will be
jointly supported by the NSF and the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
