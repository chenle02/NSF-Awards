9319799 Kurz This award is for support to convene a workshop on the Pliocene
history of the East Antarctic ice sheet. Recent evidence from glacial geologic
studies of the Sirius Formation (a deposit of a variety of glacial sediments
which is found at high elevations throughout the Transantarctic Mountains) has
suggested that the East Antarctic ice sheet may have been significantly smaller
during the Pliocene, thus challenging the prevailing view that it has remained
stable over long time periods. Understanding the timing and causes of variations
in the Antarctic ice sheet is critical to global climate and sea level models.
The result of this workshop will be a concise summary of the existing
information, a review of glacial geologic models, and identification of the
critical data that must be obtained to better constrain the models of the East
Antarctic ice sheet. ***
