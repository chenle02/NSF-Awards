With previous NSF funding and support from IBM, an electronic network, PSI-NET,
has been established which links all state science supervisors, and is
accessible by the NSF, NSTA, and other organizations concerned with school
science education. This system will now be extended to science teachers in six
states to test the technical feasibility and the utility of this further
networking through a single system. IBM will continue to support the development
of the system technically. A committee of state science supervisors will guide
and evaluate the use of the system in the six trial states to provide a basis
for decisions on the desireability of ultimate extension to science teachers in
all states. Introduction of state mathematics supervisors onto PSI-NET will also
be initiated to evaluate the utility of this additional extension. Cost sharing
by the partners will total 159% of the NSF funding.
