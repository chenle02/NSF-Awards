This award from the Division of Chemistry supports a new conference, the 2012
Water and Aqueous Solutions Gordon Research Seminar (GRS), organized entirely by
and for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows who are doing research
related to water and aqueous solutions. This GRS will precede the associated
2012 Water and Aqueous Solutions Gordon Research Conference (GRC). The focus of
these two meetings is on identifying key questions, describing recent
breakthroughs, and unveiling surprising discoveries related to water and aqueous
solutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Water is an important and unique substance that
plays a central role in a wide variety of problems ranging from bioengineering
to weather predictions to material processing and development. Although water is
a deceptively simple three-atom molecule, it possesses a unique set of
distinguishing physical properties that set it apart from any other substance on
Earth. Understanding the fundamental principles governing the structure and
dynamics of water, and particularly how water mediates chemical interactions and
processes, continues to pose formidable challenges and yield abundant surprises.
The planned GRS will provide a unique forum for graduate students and
postdoctoral fellows to present and exchange new data and cutting edge ideas in
fields related to water and aqueous solutions. A key aim of the GRS is to enable
young investigators to become active conference participants through an
educational and encouraging platform that facilitates the establishment of
networks with their peers.
