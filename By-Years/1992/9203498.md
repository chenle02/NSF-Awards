This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will help the
Departments of Chemistry at Brown University and the University of Rhode Island
acquire, maintain and operate a workstation network. The areas of chemical
research that will be enhanced by the acquisition include: 1. The Quantum
Mechanics of Surface Adsorbates. 2. The Atomic Geometry of Solid Surfaces. 3.
The Equilibrium and Dynamical Properties of Atomic and Molecular Clusters. 4.
The Formation and Decay of Clusters. 5. Elementary Excitations in Liquids. 6.
Quantum Monte Carlo Algorithums. Chemists carrying out frontier research are
relying more and more on computers that are capable of handling sophisticated
simulations, data analysis and graphics software. The need to accomodate
multiple users on the single laboratory computer and multiple users on a single
chemistry department facility can be met by a single solution: individual
workstations for the majority of user needs and, for the remainder, ready access
to other types of workstations and, ultimately, to a mini supercomputer
