Recent work has used the marine copepod Tigriopus californicus as a model for
understanding the cause of genetic incompatibilities in the early generations of
hybridization between divergent populations. This proposal seeks to extend this
work to patterns of fitness, morphology and genetic composition in freely mating
hybrid swarms over tens of generations. Replicate hybrid swarms will be
established for two different pairs of populations, with different starting
frequencies for the two parental types. Over a period of 2 1/2 years, subsamples
will be removed from each swarm at regular intervals and assayed for fitness,
morphology and a series of molecular markers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Such work is
relevant to agricultural issues involving introgression between wild and crop
plants and the probability of genetic assimilation. Results may also have
applications to fisheries and wildlife management due to concern over the
duration of outbreeding depression and the potential for purging deleterious
combinations. Lastly, the work will contribute to fundamental evolutionary
questions involving the nature of species boundaries and the role of
hybridization in creating new species.&lt;br/&gt;
