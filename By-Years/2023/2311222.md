The proposed project is a three-day conference aimed at recruiting, retaining,
and supporting underrepresented biomedical engineering (BME) PhD students
through the postdoc, and into academic careers. The project is significant
because there is a great need for a more diverse faculty pool in BME to continue
to educate BME undergraduates, a group which becomes larger and more diverse
every year. In addition, diversity of BME faculty increases diversity among
research projects, improving the field of biomedical engineering with potential
to identify solutions aimed at decreasing health disparities.

The 2023 Rising Scholars in BME Regional Career Conference is a three-day
conference held at the University of Minnesota â€“ Twin Cities in partnership with
ten regional academic institutions. The goals of the conference are to: (1)
communicate the pathways to becoming an underrepresented faculty member (2)
explore opportunities offered to a BME academic; (3) realize the impacts of
being an underrepresented academic on classrooms, science, and society; (4)
integrate diverse perspectives into the programming (academic, medical,
governmental, and business sectors); (5) obtain tools to build a successful
research program; and (6) meet mentors & future collaborators to expand personal
networks. The proposed project would allow for over 25 Scholars to attend, as
well as five postdoctoral researchers in BME.
