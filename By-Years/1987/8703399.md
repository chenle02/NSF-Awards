This proposal outlines an interdisciplinary program designed and constructed to
attack an important specific problem in new materials: the achievement of higly
oriented semiconducting and metallic polymers through solution processing. The
program includes the following components: (I) Synthesis of Soluble Conjugated
Polymers and Compatible Polymer Blends, (II) Solution Processing of
Semiconducting and Metallic Polymers and of Polymer Blends, (III) Theoretical
Studies of Specific Problems Underlying the Solution Processing of Conducting
Polymers, and (IV) Characterization of the Highly Oriented Conducting Polymers
and Polymer Blends, and Characterization of the Polymer Solutions from which
they are processed. This Materials Research Group brings together an
interdisciplinary set of talents and expertise to form a coherent program to
attack the problem of the preparation and characterization of highly oriented
semiconducting and metallic polymers through solution processing.
