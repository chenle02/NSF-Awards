This project will develop novel MEMS-based capacitive plates with a large
tunable dynamic range for power harvesting and voltage conversion. The device is
unique in that it uses an innovative multi-cavity design to optimize the power
harvesting and step-up voltage conversion efficiency, and electroplated nickel
as the main structural material. The goal is to provide significantly improved
performance in a small, lightweight, low-cost and maintenance-free energy
source. The impacts of this work include new basic science that paves the way
for portable wireless sensor systems for aircraft and bridges, educating
students with state-of-the-art technology, and boosting US competitiveness and
economic development.
