The research objective of this award is to develop a robust and tractable
methodology for assessing the impact of input model error, with minimal
assumption placed on the parametric form of the input model. The discrepancy
between model assumption and reality, or input model error, constitutes an
important concern in many stochastic estimation problems, since it can affect
the accuracy of outputs in various magnitudes. The key ingredient is a class of
sensitivity estimators that are taken with respect to nonparametric statistical
distances, derived via a new line of infinitesimal analysis on optimization
problems over probability space. These sensitivity estimators are robust in that
they automatically capture model discrepancy along the worst-case directions in
the model space, and they are computationally tractable via efficient Monte
Carlo methods. On the theoretical side, they will help provide fundamental
understanding of model risk in stochastic computation, and on the practical
side, they can be widely used to perform stress tests on the reliability of
model assumptions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this
research will provide a robust and implementable method to assess the effect of
model risk in computations that arise in many applications. Industries such as
manufacturing, communication, call centers, and financial risk management all
need to carry out calculations of different performance measures on a regular
basis. The methodologies that come out from the research will provide
sensitivity analysis tools to measure the impact and risk of inaccurate model
assumptions in these calculations. The results of this research will also be
used to develop new courses in undergraduate and graduate levels, and to
establish mentorship of students from under-represented groups. The
implementation will be widely disseminated through open software for both
academic and industrial use.
