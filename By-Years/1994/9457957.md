9457957 Lewis Principal Investigator would pursue new areas of research and
instrumentation which are emerging in materials science and engineering. In
particular, the proposed research and educational plan would focus on developing
a fundamental understanding of cross-disciplinary interactions in polymer-
stabilized nanosized ceramic systems. Novel materials with unusual properties
are expected at the size and scale of nanosized particles, which are greatly
different or improved over conventional bulk ceramics. Efforts will be directed
to design organic processing aids their effects on microstructural development.
The specific research objectives are to study the role of "free" and adsorbed
polymeric species on interparticle forces, suspension stability and rheology,
and the influence of such properties on the resulting microstructures of ceramic
forms and coatings derived from these systems. The educational component of the
proposed plan would focus mainly on two activities: new course and text
development. The Principal Investigator plan to develop a new graduate level
course entitled "Sol-Gel and Nanosized Particulate Ceramic Processing Science"
to be taught in the Spring, 1995. These course notes and those developed for a
senior level course "Ceramics Processing and Microstructural Development" which
the Principal Investigator currently teach will serve as a basis for preparing a
much needed text book -- Colloidal Processing of Advanced Ceramics. %%% The
specific research objectives are to study the role of 'free' and adsorbed
polymeric species on interparticle forces, suspension stability and rheology and
the influence of such properties on the resulting microstructure of ceramic
forms and coating derived from these systems. The Principal Investigator also
plan to develop a new graduate level course and may prepare a text book in the
field in the near future. ***
