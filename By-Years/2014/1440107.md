The IUCRC for Electromagnetic Compatibility (CEMC) proposes renewal as a two-
site I/UCRC, comprising personnel and facilities at the Missouri University of
Science and Technology and the University of Houston. CEMC's industry sector
requires understanding of noise physics, development of innovative measurement
and modeling techniques, and formulation of design methodologies. This includes
immunity and electromagnetic interference (EMI), which ensures an electronic
system: (1) can function in the presence of external electromagnetic noise; and,
(2) its EMI does not impact the functionality of other devices. Signal and power
integrity design ensures proper circuit operation at high speeds. Phase II
efforts will target development of methods for higher frequencies and smaller
geometry scales. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Design for electromagnetic compatibility
is critical in electronics. Good electromagnetic compatibility design is
essential to successful product development, customer satisfaction and industry
competitiveness. Research outcomes from CEMC in Phase I include 31 students
graduated from the center and numerous hires of students by industry members.
There were over 50 publications and one spin-off company during Phase I with
research results incorporated into university courses, and on-site and on-line
company short courses. Research outcomes in Phase II will be disseminated
through the center website, publications, technical conferences, short courses,
IEEE EMC Society committee activities, spin-off companies, and industry
application notes. Demonstrations suitable for motivating interest in K-12
students in technical careers are planned.
