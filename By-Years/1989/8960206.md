A six legged parallel link manipulator (called a Stewart Platform) has the
ability to perform six degree of freedom manipulation, and is mechanically much
simpler than conventional serial mechanisms with similar manipulative
capability. Despite their mechanical simplicity, such mechanisms have not been
exploited except for low accuracy, low speed applications because of the
difficulty in performing real-time control of the highly non-linear, highly
coupled mechanism. The control problem is exacerbated by the fact that there is
no known closed from solution to the forward kinematics of such platforms. This
project will develop two cooperating neural nets which together help control a
six legged parallel link manipulator in the high speed, high accuracy domain.
Each of the two neural nets is itself composed of tow cascaded neural nets. The
proposed system is interesting because it solves a problem for which there is no
known acceptable solution, and also because there are many important
applications which could be cost effectively implemented with a stewart Platform
if the control problem could be overcome. The proposed system is also
significant because is cascaded organization of neural nets should greatly
reduce the training time required for the system to achieve good results.
