This award supports the Gordon Research Conference on Atmospheric Chemistry in
Newport, RI on June 17-21, 2001. This Gordon Research Conference is one of the
major meetings in this field. This year, the conference will cover a broad range
of areas in atmospheric chemistry, including measurements of the troposphere
from space, tropospheric aerosols, urban and regional chemistry, global
tropospheric chemistry, snowpack and high-latitude boundary layer phenomena,
Sun/Earth coupling in atmospheric chemistry, interactions between laboratory and
theoretical studies of atmospheric reactions, and stratospheric chemistry and
dynamics. The meeting will be attended by both established researchers and young
scientists, among them the participants of the preceding Atmospheric Chemistry
Colloquium for Emerging Senior Scientists (ACCESS).
