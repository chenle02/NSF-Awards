This proposal requests partial funding to purchase a 600 NMR spectrometer that
will be used by ten major users and seven minor users. The spectrometer will
support a variety of research, ranging from NMR studies of protein-nucleic acid
and peptide- metal complexes to determinations of the structures of
intermediates in organic and biological synthesis of biomolecules. The
sensitivity and resolution of this instrument will significantly enhance the
type of information that will be obtained from biomolecular NMR studies. Joint
support from the Instrumentation and Instrument Development and Chemical
Instrument Programs is recommended.
