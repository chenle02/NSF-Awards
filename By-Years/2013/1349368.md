EAGER: Mississippian Bear Gulch Limestone Paleoecology, Stratigraphy, and
Geochemistry&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;George Stanley, University of Montana,
EAR-1349368&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt; The Bear Gulch Limestone
(BG) in located in central Montana and is a plattenkalk representing one of the
most outstanding Mississippian marine konservat lagerstätte. It is a thin
limestone lens 30 meters thick, that suggests restricted conditions. Deposited
during the latest Mississippian the BG records a time of great climatic,
environmental, and potential evolutionary change as yet unstudied. We know so
little about the paleoecology of this lagerstätte as well as the chemical and
physical setting which allowed the amazing preservation of soft-parts which
characterizes much of the fauna. Most of the exposures are located on private
land and due to the activities of commercial fossil marketers, only a single
landowner is now permitting access. This project aims to undertake a field and
laboratory study aimed at providing needed physical, chemical and paleoecologic
data. The acquisition of such data will provide the intellectual background and
broader impacts for formulating a later, more fully developed project.
