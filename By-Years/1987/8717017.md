Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, and thus they, and their
chemistry, occupy an important position in biochemistry. Nature is able to
efficiently make amino acids in a highly specific fashion because it employs
enzymes. However, many amino acids of potential use are not synthesized by
nature, and so the chemist is in need of tools to make these compounds with the
same specificity as found in nature. This project in the Organic and
Macromolecular Chemistry Program is developing such reactions for which the
chemistry community will have great use. The overall objective of the proposed
research is to develop efficient and practical methodology for the asymmetric
synthesis of alpha-amino acids based on carbon-carbon bond constructions of
electrophilic glycine-derived templates. In addition, the free radical and
electrocyclic couplings to these glycine-templates will be investigated. On the
practical side, access to either D- or L- configured amino acids in high optical
purity and chemical purity will be the primary utility of this research. These
selective coupling reactions will be achieved by a careful study of the
fundamental chemistry of hemi-amino acetals as substrates for cationic and
radical reactions with a variety of organometallic reagents. A new organotin
acetylide coupling reaction has been discovered and will be investigated as a
means for preparing vinyl and alkynyl alpha-amino acids which have potent
biological activities. Several second-generation chiral auxilliaries will be
investigated to broaden the scope of the electrophilic glycine template concept.
The new methodology will be demonstrated with total syntheses of several
representative, complex amino acids.
