The purpose of this project is to develop facilities which give undergraduates
experience with a range of laboratory procedures that are currently unavailable.
This project is part of a more comprehensive adjustment in the psychology
department's curriculum which will reestablish an emphasis on laboratory
experiences. The laboratory in physiological psychology is providing experience
with both traditional methodologies and psychophysiological methodologies. A
laboratory course in developmental psychobiology is being added to the
curriculum to take advantage of the improved animal facilities. The equipment is
being used to upgrade the laboratory in introduction to psychology and is
available for senior students to use in their independent projects.
