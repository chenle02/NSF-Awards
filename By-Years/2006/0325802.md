&lt;br/&gt;This project proposes the Scalable Non-stOP Server (SNOPS)
architecture: a reliable, available, and serviceable (RAS) hardware platform.
SNOPS offers both cost and performance scalability unparalleled by conventional
RAS-oriented servers by using commodity blade components interconnected through
a scalable network and hardware distributed shared memory (DSM). SNOPS offers
non-stop service through fast application-transparent detection and recovery of
soft/transient errors and/or single processor/memory component failure, and hot-
swapping of a module upon hardware component failure without state
loss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project proposes the MEMory BaRrier Across the
NEtwork (MEMBRANE), an abstraction layer to regulate memory data transfer
between processor and memory modules. MEMBRANE serves as an impenetrable barrier
for faulty data both from the processor and the memory sides, allowing only
error-free data to transfer across. On the processor side, the MEMBRANE
coherence protocols detect and trigger recovery for errors originating from
redundant processors of a group by comparing their requests. On the memory side,
the MEMBRANE memory redundancy protocols detect and recover from errors
originating from the memory components via a RAID-like distributed parity
scheme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This prototype will support a commodity OS (such as
Linux) and deliver the necessary performance to permit full-scale evaluation of
our ideas against commercial-grade server applications. Scalable server
simulation infrastructure will be also be available for distribution, allowing
for fast, accurate, and full-system simulation of servers. Several proof-of-
concept prototypes have been built in industrial and academic settings and
especially for students are an invaluable experience, but with a high potential
to have impact on industrial research and development as
well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
