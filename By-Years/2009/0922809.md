0922809&lt;br/&gt;Qian&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Acquisition of the MultiView 4000TM
multi-probe SPM system will allow two or more independently controlled SPM
probes to be placed nanometers apart to enable a variety of multi point
measurements. The instrument will support five specialized multi-disciplinary
research tracks: fundamental research on micro- and nano-scale fluid sciences,
measurement of the interface thermal resistance for nano-fluids, resonator-based
biological and chemical sensors, probing the membrane landscape of the
Plasmodium falciparum digestive vacuole, and imaging mycobacterial biofilms
using the MultiView 4000TM. With the new instrumentation, integration of the
research into graduate and undergraduate curriculum will be developed for
courses in Microscopy and Micro/Nanofabrication, Electrokinetic and Colloidal
Transport Phenomena, Micro/Nanofluidics, Micro/Nano Heat Transfer, Design of
BioMEMS/NEMS Devices, Biological Microscopy, and Nanotechnology for
Bioengineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Incorporation of the state-of-the-art
instrumentation into undergraduate and graduate curricula and courses will
attract more students to science and engineering, and will allow the next
generation to gain the basic knowledge and hands-on experience in the emerging
areas of micro- and nano-scale science and engineering.
