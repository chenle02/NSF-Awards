This research will examine the extent to which alternative cognitive processes
might explain whether or not a particular Nash equilibrium (from among many)
will be achieved in a particular game. The focus will be on both what
information is used by subjects depending on their sophistication and on
learning in games where it is explicitly recognized that subjects are likely to
exhibit heterogeneous behavior.
