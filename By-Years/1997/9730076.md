This collaborative project with Grofman (9730578) deals with applications of
psychological models of choice to actual data on voting behavior and other
choice processes. We aim to develop probabilistic models of choice that will
enable us to reconstruct underlying patterns of preferences from partial data on
observed voting choices, with a focus on developing models that can be tested on
data from elections around the world. We also will look at ways of classifying
underlying cognitive information processing in terms of distinctions such as
choices based on `preferences` versus choices based on what may be called
`judgements,` and we consider how different measurement techniques may be needed
for different types of cognitive mechanisms. Our work is linked to recent
developments in a number of different social science disciplines, especially
economics and political science, and to random utility models in statistics.
