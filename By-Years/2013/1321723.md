This workshop will bring together scientists from the petrology and geochemistry
domains, data managers, sample curators, and cyberinfrastructure specialists to
gather requirements and develop a vision for an advanced information and
knowledge management system that will transform the way petrological and
geochemical data and samples are acquired, analyzed, published, and re-used
across the geosciences in the conduct of science. The outcomes of this workshop
will provide guidance to the EarthCube initiative from the petrology-
geochemistry community to design and develop the architecture of an Earth
Science cyberinfrastructure that is aligned with the end-users' needs for data
and sample access, software tools for data and metadata acquisition, workflow
support, data analysis, data visualization, and modeling, computing
capabilities, interoperability with data from other domains, as well as policies
and procedures that address the scientists' concerns regarding, for example,
data sharing, data citation, intellectual property, sample curation, and career
advancement. The workshop report will be made widely accessible on the web.
