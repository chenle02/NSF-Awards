The PI is co-organizing a conference on long-range dependence, self-similarity,
and heavy tails, which will take place in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina
in April 2012. More details can be found on the conference web-site
http://lrd2012.web.unc.edu. The three themes of the conference are studied and
arise across a wide range of disciplines and applications, including
probability, statistics, geophysics, telecommunications, engineering, economics,
finance and insurance. Many of these fields were literally transformed by the
use of models involving long-range dependence and heavy tails. For example, with
a dramatic shift from circuit to packet switching in modern communication
networks, these models took over the dominant place from the models based on
Poisson assumptions and exponential distributions. New exciting areas of
application such as social networks are posing new challenges where power laws,
scaling limits, and self-similarity phenomena emerge in a new light.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The conference will feature talks from world renowned experts as well
as poster presentations by students and junior researchers. It is expected to
have an important and long lasting scientific, educational, and socioeconomic
impact. The conference will foster the exchange of ideas between probabilists,
theoretical and applied statisticians, other scientists, as well as students and
practitioners. This will likely lead to formulating new problems relevant to
important applications, thereby stimulating the development of new fundamental
theoretical research. Many of these problems are expected to have a broad
educational, scientific, and general impact on society. For example, in
connection to understanding risk, gauging uncertainty in complex setting, or
taking advantage of emerging network structures. Most importantly, the event
would introduce young researchers and graduate students to important areas of
research.&lt;br/&gt;
