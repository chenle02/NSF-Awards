The nature of dark matter is currently unknown. Cosmic rays, which are energetic
sub-atomic particles from space that travel at velocities near the speed of
light, can help to identify dark matter particles. This is because one possible
cosmic ray production mechanism is the annihilation of dark matter particles.
Cosmic ray antideuteron particles are a particularly interesting potential
signature of dark matter annihilation. This CAREER award supports scientists at
the University of Hawaii to study dark matter by performing the first
measurements of the cosmic-ray antideuteron flux. The group will utilize data
from the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS), currently operating onboard the
International Space Station, and data from the General Antiparticle Spectrometer
(GAPS), a balloon experiment that is under development. This award will support
scientific investigations that utilize the complementary capabilities of both
experiments to perform high-sensitivity measurements of cosmic-ray
antideuterons. The group is also developing a summer course to teach computer
programming to local high school students. Students will be taught programming
skills using Raspberry Pi computers. Mimicking scientific ballooning operations,
the devices will be mounted on kites to measure temperatures and humidity, and
take aerial pictures.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The planned program includes the
development of antideuteron production physics simulations, analysis of AMS
data, simulations and calibration of the GAPS detectors, and ultimately analysis
of GAPS data. These experiments use different technologies to detect cosmic
rays. Utilizing both provides the group with complementary data, extending the
energy range of the proposed study and improving the control of the systematic
effects that limit the sensitivity of the search for these rare events. This
award is jointly funded by the Physics Division and the Experimental Program to
Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).
