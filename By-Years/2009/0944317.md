This workshop will be held June 27-July 1, 2010 Bratislava, Slovak Republic, and
will be attended by 20 US scientists funded from this grant. This meeting will
bring together scientists from the Americas, Asia and Europe to discuss
investigations of earthquake dynamics using numerical simulations and earthquake
observation. Participants will work together to optimize strategies for improved
modeling and testable predictions. There will be three days of talks focusing on
simulations of past earthquakes, fault zone structure and rheology, laboratory
data on friction, energy budget for seismic activity, scaling laws and other
earthquake parameters.

This is the only workshop in the past three years to concentrate on the
combination of numerical modeling and observational data related to earthquake
physics.
