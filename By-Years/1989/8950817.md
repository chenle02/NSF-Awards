Collection of quantitive chemical imformation has become a necessity for
fundamental research in areas such as the neurosciences, molecular biology,
pharmacology, ecology, and toxicology. Undergraduate education must train
students entering these fields to understand and properly apply various types of
chemical instrumentation. Through this project high-performance-liquid-
chromatography (HPLC) is introduced into laboratory courses and undergraduate
research projects in psychology, biology and chemistry. HPLC experiments are
introduced into five courses within the three departments. The experiments are
developed through senior independent study projects. The grantee provides funds
for this project that are an equal match for the NSF award.
