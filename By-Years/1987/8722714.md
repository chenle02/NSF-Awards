Professor Libchaber will investigate various aspects of nonlinear phenomena
through highly controlled experiments. Turbulent heat flow will be studied using
the model system of liquid 4He at temperatures of 5 Kelvin. Heat flow will be
investigated in liquid mercury and these studies will be aimed at increased
understanding of the onset of chaos in this type of flow. A third experiment
will be continued study of the motion of the interfaces between two different
phases of matter, especially to determine the interface motion and pattern
formation and the stability of the motion.
