9600360 Blaumueller The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables
U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twentyfour months of research
abroad. The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the
use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions
abroad. This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research visit which
will support Dr. Christine M. Blaumueller to work with Dr. Marek Mlodzik at the
European Molecular Biology Laboratory, in Heidelberg, Germany. Dr. Blaumueller's
project is to identify targets of the AP-1 transciption complex by: 1)
Performing a preliminary genetic screen for modifiers of a phenotype produced by
the expression of a constitutively activated Jun mutant in Drosophilia
photoreceptor recursors, 2) Characterizing mutant phenotypes/genetic
interactions of these modifiers, 3) Genetically and molecularly mapping modifier
genes, and molecularly cloning the most interesting of these genes, and 4)
Characterizing any molecular/biochemical interactions between modifier genes and
Jun. ***
