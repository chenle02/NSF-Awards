This research will focus on developing a science base for manufacturing system
operation and design is founded on a consistent, systematic hierarchical
framework. The goal of the project is to extend this framework by means of
observation, experimentation, and analysis. The approach treats the operations
of a production system as a control problem, and uses notions from control
theory and engineering to develop operation policies. Such potentially
disruptive events as machine failures, material shortages, and worker absences
change the short term capacity of the system. They are used as signals for the
recalculation of short term schedules. The stochastic scheduling problem is
hierarchically decomposed so that the recalculations are fast, affect only the
necessary parts of the production system, and bring the system as close as
possible to production and performance targets. The significance of this
research is the development of more effective and reactive production control
and scheduling technology. The ability to produce flexible schedules which can
reflect the changing needs of the factory floor is extremely important to
industry.
