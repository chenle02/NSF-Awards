This award supports the acquisition of an advanced analytical transmission
electron microscope (TEM) for materials science research and education at The
University of Alabama (UA). This state of the art instrument will be equipped
with the ability to do scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) imaging,
an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) system, and high angle annular
dark field (HAADF) imaging. It will also allow for digital imaging, and high
resolution imaging through exit wave reconstruction. The instrument and
accessories have been selected to meet the diverse needs of our multi-
disciplinary materials efforts which include: catalysis for fuel cells, magnetic
recording, nanoparticles, dielectric layers for semiconductors,
metallic/dendrimer interfacial science, and thermal barrier coatings. The
instrument will be housed in a multi-user Central Analytical Facility (CAF),
which will make it readily assessible to all researchers in the UA system and
neighboring institutions. This new microscope will allow the research community
in the region to more effectively pursue their studies of materials at the
nanoscale, while also promoting the teaching, training and learning of the
graduate and undergraduate students. It will also aid in the recruitment of
underrepresented groups to UA. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
