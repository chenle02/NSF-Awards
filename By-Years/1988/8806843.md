The Nd:YAG pumped dye laser system is used for the development and application
of advanced laser diagnostics techniques for the study of one- and two-phase
flows in chemically reacting systems. Projects include the development and use
of LIF techniques for the measurement of species in chemically reacting boundary
layers, the development of a particle size and number density in flames, and VUV
ionization hydrocarbons for mass spectrometric analysis. The addition of this
piece of laboratory equipment will allow for a comprehensive insight into
specific chemical processes which control combustion performance in a variety of
practical applications.
