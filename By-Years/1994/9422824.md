This renewal award is made in the Organic Dynamics Program in support of the
research of Dr. Richard Caldwell. Alkene triplets and triplet biradicals will be
studied (1) by conventional organic mechanistic methods to determine chemical
outcomes and infer the nature of the intermediates; (2) by laser flash
photolysis to determine transient lifetimes and intersystem crossing rates, and
energies and kinetic properties of transients, and; (3) by CAS-MCSCF
computations of spin-orbit coupling in small model systems. The results will
lead to a fundamental understanding of triplet biradicals and olefin triplets,
specifically their energetics and energy surfaces, conformations, dynamics, and
ultimately the role of all of these in determining the outcomes of photochemical
processes. Among the triplet reactions which will be studied are ring-opening
rearrangements, olefin addition reactions, and intersystem crossing of olefin
triplets. Understanding the fundamental properties and mechanistic behavior of
biradical intermediates will provide the chemist with the tools to design new
chemical reactions of alkene triplets and extend their role in synthetic
photochemistry.
