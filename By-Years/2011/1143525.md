The Environmental Chemical Sciences (ECS) program of the Division of Chemistry
will support the research program of Prof. Albena Ivanisevic of Purdue
University. Prof. Ivanisevic and her students will develop novel surface
functionalization methods to form peptide coatings that passivate GaP surfaces
in order to prevent the release of toxic Ga in biological systems, test the long
term stability of peptide-coated GaP films, nanoparticles and nanowires in
physiologically relevant conditions, and understand the molecular phenomena that
govern their survival or deterioration under different environmental conditions.
The specific aims of the study are: i) Explore surface functionalization schemes
that result in the immobilization of peptides on GaP with high coverage and
reproducibility while preventing the reformation of oxide on the semiconductor
surface; ii) Quantify the amount of inorganic material released under different
environmental conditions and use analytical tools to understand the processes
associated with surface degradation; iii) Correlate stability under different
environmental conditions with bio-recognition properties using Quartz Crystal
Microbalance with Dissipation (QCM-D) and clinically relevant
samples.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Effective passivation of GaP surafces by peptide
coatings will enable the application of GaP materials in biosensing platforms
used in biological systems. It will also alleviate toxicity concerns associated
with the wide spread use of GaP and other III-V semiconductor materials in the
electronics industry. The project will provide excellent educational
opportunities for students, including some from under represented groups,
desiring to work at the interdiciplinary research area of nanomaterials
toxicity.
