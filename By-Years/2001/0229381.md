CUNY City College TITLE: Curriculum Reform of the Mechanical Engineering Program
at City College

Abstract

This project plans for the systemic reform of the mechanical engineering
curriculum at the City College of New York. Building on our previous experience
in educational projects, five current members of the Mechanical Engineering
Faculty and a current and former Associate Dean will spearhead the planning
process.

The purpose of the plan will be to develop means for achieving the following
objectives: a) Integration of emerging technologies into the curriculum. These
technologies include micro-electro mechanical systems (MEMS), nanotechnology,
biotechnology, new application of materials, intelligent systems, and advanced
computer aided engineering software b) Reform of pedagogical methods by
introducing the results of cognitive research, industry needs and technological
literacy concerns into the design of the learning environment c) Consistency of
instruction by formulating department policies on expectations, responsibility,
ethics, homework, report writing and team work d) Issues related to retention,
timely graduation and greater enrollment of women and e) Broader impact of the
reform effort and dissemination of results.

The planning activities will be carried out by involving the Department's
stakeholders, namely: faculty (including adjuncts and graduate teaching
assistants), students and employers. After gathering the views of all the
stakeholders, each course will be analyzed to determine a strategy for
implementing the proposed changes. A report detailing the curriculum reform plan
will be prepared. The report will also include a plan for evaluation of the
implementation phase of this effort.
