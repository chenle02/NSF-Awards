ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Developing, managing, evaluating and disseminating NSF
educational projects is sometimes difficult. Challenges include developing
faculty communities, using more robust evaluation methods, and encouraging
broader adoption. This project supports a series of half-day interactive web-
based seminars directed to engineering and computer science faculty members to
help them better understand how to address these issues in grant proposals by
demonstrating project design, management, evaluation and dissemination.
Participants learn about NSF programs, discuss educational theory and perform
mock reviews. The developed materials are being archived and made available to
the education community.
