The principal investigator will study several problems in differential geometry
as applied to the theory of minimal surfaces. One involves an approach to
proving the isometric inequality for minimal surfaces. The second involves
applying generalized Morse index theory to obtain a sharp estimate for the index
of a minimal surface. And he will analyze the problem of globally reflecting a
constant mean curvature surface which meets a plane at a constant angle. Two-
dimensional minimal surfaces are mathematical models of soap films. These must
have zero mean curvature. The surface of a saddle has zero mean curvature if at
each point the amount of curvature in the upward direction exactly cancels the
amount in the downward direction. The principal investigator will study various
problems concerning the number of tubes such minimal surfaces may have.
