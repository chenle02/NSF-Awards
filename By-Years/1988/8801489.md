This is a proposal for research in developing better methods for solving
optimization problems that present special difficulties because of their large
size, because they contain nonsmooth data, or because they contain stochastic
elements. It includes both direct development and testing of algorithms, and
improvement of the theory base to support future algorithmic development.
Previous NSF support has made possible the development of a new, very fast,
decomposition method for structured convex optimization problems (bundle-based
decomposition). The method has been theoretically justified, and has been tested
on large structured linear programming problems with excellent results. The next
step, proposed here, is to test the algorithm on decomposable nonlinear (convex)
programming problems to see if its computational effectiveness in the linear
case carries over to nonlinear problems. It is planned to test specially
structured problems, such as nonlinear networks with side constraints, as well
as block-separable problems without any particular network structure. At the
same time, it is planned to carry out research aimed at accelerating the
convergence of the underlying (bundle) algorithm used in the decomposition
method. Such acceleration would not only extend the speed and capability of the
method just described, but would also make it possible for many other kinds of
nonsmooth convex programming problems to be solved more quickly and easily. To
devise such acceleration methods the PI will study the efficient approximation
of nonsmooth optimization problems, primarily those having some convex
structure, and the use of such approximations in algorithm development.
