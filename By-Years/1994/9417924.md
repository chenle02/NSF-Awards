9417924 Sellin This proposal calls for a study of the, "Interaction of X-Rays,
Vacuum UV, and Ions with Atoms, Ions and Surfaces". It is for the study of
various physical processes which occur in direct photoionization and in the
related phenomena of electron emission in grazing incidence collisions of ions
with clean surfaces. It proposes to compare the rates for single and double
photoionization both experimentally and theoretically in He. it proposes to
study the production of hollow atoms in Li and to pursue work in collaboration
with Japanese co-workers on merged photon-ion beam experiments. Finally
experiments on electron emission in grazing incidence ion-surface interactions
will be studied. ***
