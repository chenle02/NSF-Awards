A broad variety of problems in the theory of the elementary particles and the
fundamental forces will be studied. The work will include investigations of
string theory, lattice field theories, exclusive processes in quantum
chromodynamics, and applications of field theoretic techniques to a variety of
other problems. String theory is a very promising attempt to relate and describe
all the fundamental forces. Lattice theory is an attempt to deal with complex
systems by replacing the continuum of space by a discrete lattice of points.
Quantum chromodynamics is the leading candidate theory of the strong nuclear
force, and exclusive processes are ones leading to a specific collection of
final particles. The work to be done will cover a number of the leading thrusts
in elementary particle theory today.
