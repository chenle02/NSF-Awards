The objective of this research is to develop an experimental program to
investigate the deposition of hard-to-plate metals from nonaqueous supercritical
electrolyte solutions. The focus of the present study is to investigate the
effects on the pressure- and temperature-dependent physicochemical properties of
the solution in the mixture-critical region on the deposition process with
nonaqueous mixtures of two solvents in order to avoid the extreme temperatures
and pressures needed with supercritical water. It is not currently possible to a
priori characterize the deposits produced by electrodeposition in the mixture-
critical region fundamental information will be obtained which can be used to
develop guidelines for controlling the deposition process. This work will lead
to a novel way to electrodeposit hard-to- plate metals, such as aluminum,
titanium, and lithium, from nonaqueous media which could potentially alleviate
the difficulties associated with controlling the deposit quality or the
stability of the solution. The key technical objective which must be addressed
is determining the benefit of using a supercritical fluid electrolyte medium as
opposed to a liquid medium. The impact of this work is to address the issue of
deposition at moderate temperatures in a medium which has liquidlike solvent
capacities and gaslike transport characteristics. The technical information
generated here can have a major impact on similar processing techniques
currently practiced with liquid-phase electrolyte solutions. Although it should
be recognized that the advantages of using supercritical fluids depend on each
specific application, deposition from supercritical electrolyte solutions could
lead to new methods for producing materials such as thin film semiconductors,
organic compounds, alloys, and electroformed superconductors.
