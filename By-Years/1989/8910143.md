This Research Opportunities for Women Career Advancement Award is in the general
area of experimental physical chemistry and in the subfield of molecular
spectroscopy. During the twelve month period beginning 1 September 1989,
Professor Gilbert will undertake a systematic study of the spectroscopy of the
halogen amines and of their subsequent fragments that are produced by photolysis
under low temperature matrix isolation conditions. The thrust of this
investigation is to determine the effect of the nature of the halogen on the
electronic states and reaction pathways of the halogen amines. This Career
Advancement Award will enable Professor Gilbert to broaden significantly her
research activities and to transition from a primarily teaching position to one
wherein she can establish and maintain a viable, independent research program in
her laboratory at the University of Denver.
