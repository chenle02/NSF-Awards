Asynchronous programming is in demand today because responsiveness is important
on all modern devices: desktop, mobile, or web. Asynchronous programming is
especially important in mobile and wearable apps, which are expected by 2016 to
reach 300 billion downloads annually. One contemporary development task is
refactoring long-running, blocking synchronous code (e.g., accessing the web,
database, or file system) into non-blocking asynchronous code. While major
programming languages make asynchrony possible, they do not make it easy.

This proposal aims to significantly enrich educational resources and
programmers? toolset for adding, modernizing, tuning, and suggesting asynchrony.
The PI plans to pursue research activities in four areas: (1) Mining and
recommending refactorings; (2) Automated refactorings for adding asynchrony into
mobile apps, for modernizing legacy asynchronous code, and for converting
between async variants; (3) Detecting and fixing async errors; (4) Extending
async refactorings to other domains, with the intent of discovering theories and
reusable principles. This project has the potential to revolutionize how mobile
app programmers use asynchrony, to educate them about successful usage of
asynchrony, and to significantly reduce the cost and increase the quality of
their code.
