The success of advancing technologies critical to designing future-generation
high-performance global networks and reliable distributed applications hinges on
the available tools that can effectively prototype test, and analyze new ideas.
The project will enable advances in the area of high-performance modeling and
simulation of large-scale networks. The research includes an investigation of
the fundamental technologies that enable real-time large-scale network
simulations and the development of a real-time immersive network simulation
environment. Real-time network simulation combines the advantages of both
simulation and emulation by running simulation models that interact with the
physical world. Immersive large-scale network simulation requires that the
simulation not only capture important characteristics of the target global
network, but also support seamless interactions with distributed applications in
real time. The project is divided into three research thrusts: imprecise
simulation, GPU co-simulation, and the development of the immersive network
simulation environment. Imprecise simulation, extended from the imprecise
computation technique originally designed for real-time systems, aims to achieve
real-time performance of large-scale network simulations, by allowing the
simulation to choose among models with different modeling representations and
with variable computing requirements during run-time. GPU co-simulation exploits
the computing resource of graphics processors, which are almost omnipresent on
todays desktop computers and become more powerful than CPUs; certain numerical
computations, such as the network background traffic calculation, can be
offloaded to the graphics hardware, so that the CPUs can concentrate on more
critical tasks for real-time simulation. An immersive network simulation
environment will be developed based on the imprecise simulation and GPU co-
simulation techniques, and will also include models of network protocols of
alternative designs of the layered network structures.
