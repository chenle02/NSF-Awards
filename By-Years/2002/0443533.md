This CCLI (A&amp;I) project involves the development of course and lab modules
in tolerancing issues and micro / nano assembly techniques. Modules are being
designed and developed for senior level undergraduate students in industrial,
manufacturing and mechanical engineering. We are creating virtual reality based
environments to enhance student learning as well as encouraging inter university
student projects involving students at New Mexico State University, and
Monterrey Tech (Monterrey, Mexico). The industry partners involved include
Sandia National Laboratories and MicroSat Systems. A focus in this project is
the education of minority students (Hispanic and Native American); through
workshop activities, we are highlighting the importance of educational
opportunities and introducing minority and other students to the micro devices
assembly subject area. Apart from these workshops, outreach activities involving
school students and teachers (at the Mescalero Apache Reservation) are being
conducted. Dissemination activities include publishing papers in leading
journals and at conferences. Other dissemination activities are through a
project web site.
