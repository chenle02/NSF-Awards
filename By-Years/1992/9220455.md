This research concerns electronic transport in ultra-small metallic structures.
These are structures in which one or more dimensions are of order 1000 > or
less. Fundamental questions concerning electron motion in disordered systems
will be investigated. These structures will also be used as tools for the study
of fundamental physical phenomena. Topics which will be investigated include the
effects of reduced dimensionality on the behavior of magnetic impurities (Kondo
effect), nonlinear behavior in the presence of microwave fields, magnetization
reversal through quantum tunneling in individual 100 > particles, and
superconductivity in one dimension. %%% Ultra-small metallic structures form the
basis of all current microelectronic devices. The small size of these devices is
central to their high performance and low cost, and thus there is a continuing
desire to develop ever smaller devices. The purpose of this research is two-
fold. First, to study the fundamental properties of metallic structures with
sizes below 100 nanometers. While this is considerably smaller than currently
available commercial devices, structures in this size range will be of great
importance in future generations of devices. It is important to understand the
behavior of these structures, particularly since they will likely exhibit new
properties which are not found in larger structures. Second, these structures
will be used as tools in the study of fundamental phenomena. In many cases these
structures can be used to probe effects which are not accessible with larger
structures. Examples include superconductivity in one dimension, and the effect
of confinement on magnetic ions in metals.
