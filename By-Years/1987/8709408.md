The Great South Channel region contains unusually abundant populations of three
endangered whale species: right, humpback and fin whales, and their principle
prey items in the zooplankton, copepods. The South Channel Ocean Productivity
Experiment (SCOPEX) will look at the physical oceanographic and
biological/ecological mechanisms responsible for these aggregations. Using both
aerial and ship-based surveys (visual, acoustics, tows), the distribution and
abundance of right whales and zooplankton in the region will be determined.
Detailed distributional and behavioral observations of these animals, including
data from intensive sonar and radio-tagging studies, primary production
assessments and hydrographic characterization will provide tests of hypotheses
on how the aggregations form and are maintained. This component will focus on
the advanced hydroacoustic assessments of zooplankton distribution and
abundance.
