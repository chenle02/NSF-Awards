This Phase I Small Business Technology Transfer project seeks to develop
organic light emitting diode (OLED) technology for low-power, low-cost displays.
A proprietary OLED technology, based on vacuum-deposited, small-molecule organic
thin films, is widely recognized for excellent brightness and contrast, fast
response time, high power efficiency at low operating voltage, and excellent
reliability. The proposer recently demonstrated a novel stacked OLED pixel
architecture (SOLED) that achieves high-resolution, full color performance,
where the red (R), green (G) and blue (B) sub-pixels are vertically positioned
to emit any mixture of color and brightness. To realize full commercial
potential, however, significant research remains to be done to achieve saturated
full-color. The proposers intend to perform certain materials research and
device structure optimization to demonstrate the feasibility of achieving
saturated R-G-B spectral emission characteristics. If successful, this research
will provide the basis for high resolution, full-color displays in Phase II
using photolithographic patterning techniques. This technology has the potential
to serve transportation, industrial, communications, computing and consumer
electronics markets, including applications for personal digital assistants,
projection displays, viewfinders in camcorders, video phones, hand-held
computers, computer monitors, and, ultimately, the TV monitor on the wall.
