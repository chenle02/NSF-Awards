In this RUI project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Craig will use FTIR spectroscopy to obtain structures of
several small, non-polar organic molecules. He will analyze the rotationally
resolved IR spectra of the trans isomers and their isotopic species of several
molecules which have higher electronic energies than their respective cis
isomers. The structures will be compared with those of the cis isomers and will
provide data for comparison with ab initio calculations. High resolution
infrared spectra will be recorded on a spectrometer at the National Institute
for Standards and Technology in the laboratory of Dr. Walter J. Lafferty. %%%
There is a curious phenomenon called the "cis effect" in molecules with large
substituent groups (which we will call X and Y) at either end of a rigid, planar
carbon-carbon double-bonded skeleton, for example, HXC=CYH. In such molecules
the isomeric structure in which the two large (X and Y) groups are on the same
side (in the "cis" or near position) is energetically more stable than the
structure in which the large groups are on opposite corners of the molecule (in
the "trans" position). Intuitively, one would expect that the "cis" structure
would be less stable energetically because the large groups can interfere with
each other more readily. This current project will acquire data which will allow
theoretical studies to be compared with experimental structures in order to test
the validity of the theoretical models. It is expected that a successful theory
will help explain this curious "cis effect" anomaly.
