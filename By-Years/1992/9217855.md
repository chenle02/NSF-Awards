The goal of this project is to bring together researchers from a number of
disciplines to focus on the current state of research and new research
directions in manufacturing for the last decade of the twentieth century. This
is the second conference in a series of two. The first was held in Gaithersburg,
Maryland during the summer of 1991. This conference, as was the first, is
sponsored by the Operations Research Society of America, the German Operations
Research Society, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and with
additional support from the National Science Foundation. This is an important
opportunity to link theory and practice in manufacturing.
