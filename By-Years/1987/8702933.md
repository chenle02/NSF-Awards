Magnetic materials are of great importance in computer memories and magnetic
recording devices. It is not fully understood what controls magnetic
interactions, and hence the magnetic properties of materials. The present
proposal is one of a number of efforts to examine model systems in which
different magnetic interactions can be isolated, studied in detail and better
understood. Systems have recently been synthesized which conform to the model of
a spin 1/2, one dimensional Heisenberg ferromagnet. The goal of the present
proposal is to address aspects of the model that have implications for nonlinear
phenomena, magnetic-structural correlations and dynamic properties. To this end,
there will be a detailed study to observe the crossover from spin wave to bound
magnon domination of magnetic susceptibilities. The dependence of the
superexchange interaction on bond angle will also be studied by measuring the
magnetic susceptibility of samples placed under uniaxial stress. Other
experiments will examine the phase diagrams and the multicritical point of
quasi-one- dimensional mixed metal systems showing spin glass behavior.
