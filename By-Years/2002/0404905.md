0404905&lt;br/&gt;Kutzko&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This U.S.-Chile award will provide
support for Dr. Philip Kutzko, University of Iowa, to collaborate with Dr. Jose
Pantoja of the Universidad Catolica de Valparaiso, and Dr. Jorge Soto Andrade,
the University of Chile in Santiago. They will study the representation theory
of the twisted groups SL*(2).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Weil representation of
SL*(2,F), where F is a locally compact field, is a natural and fundamental
representation with strong connections with number theory. The Pis will study
analogues of the Weil representation for the twisted groups SL*(2,A) where A is
a ring with involution. Dr. Soto Andrade pioneered the methods they will use,
and is an expert in the representation theory of finite groups. Drs. Pantoja and
Kutzko are experts in representation theory of p-adic groups with applications
to number theory. A U.S. graduate student will work together with these
researchers as well as Chilean students in the host department. &lt;br/&gt;
