9452523 Sherwood The mathematics faculty, supported by Penn Valley Community
College, is embarking on a general mathematics curriculum reform effort in
response to the changing needs of its clientele, the community, and its transfer
program. Students entering the mathematics curriculum at each level are being
provided with new numeric, geometric and other mathematical experiences. The
community and transfer program demand graduates possessing greater problem
solving and communicative skills than is possible by the traditional curriculum.
To address these concerns the mathematics faculty is establishing a computer
laboratory which will provide the needed experiences in a problem solving
environment.
