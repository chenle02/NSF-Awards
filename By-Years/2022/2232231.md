The 2022 Campus Cyberinfrastructure PI Workshop builds upon the success of the
previous Campus Cyberinfrastructure Workshops providing an opportunity for
recipients of all active NSF Campus Cyberinfrastructure (CC*) awards to meet in
person, exchange project findings, interact with national cyberinfrastructure
experts and collaborate across project areas and project regions. By again co-
locating with the Quilt Fall Member Meeting, the broader scope encourages
relationships between campus cyberinfrastructure, science driven applications,
and regional and national cyberinfrastructure resources. The meeting schedule
provides additional opportunities for interaction between PIs themselves as well
as between the diverse groups participating in the meetings. Included in the
2022 PI Workshop is an expanded pre-workshop set of breakout sessions half-day
breakout sessions on topics relevant to challenges facing campuses and CC* PI
teams. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project is the
exchange of project findings, interaction between national cyberinfrastructure
experts, collaboration across project areas and project regions that will lead
to new ideas, relationships and collaborations associated with an in person
workshop. The broader impact associated with the workshop includes the
dissemination of workshop information, including the workshop presentations. By
co-locating with the Quilt meeting the workshop continues to bring together
stakeholders with a vested interest in leveraging campus cyberinfrastructure
investments to provide the opportunity to develop stronger ties between campus
cyberinfrastructure, science driven applications and regional and national
cyberinfrastructure resources, leading to a broader set of collaborations and
lasting impact on national campus cyberinfrastructure and science driven
applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
