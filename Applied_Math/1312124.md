The proposed research is primarily concerned with a rigorous investigation of
Monte Carlo methods, moderate and large deviations for metastable stochastic
dynamical systems that may also have multiscale features. Rare events play a key
role and large deviations theory deals with their estimation. The PI will
consider two broad classes of problems. The first class of problems is related
to a rigorous investigation and design of provably efficient Monte Carlo methods
for metastable systems. The second class of problems is about large deviations
and a rigorous analysis of associated Monte Carlo methods for stochastic
processes with multiple scales. The problems outlined in this research proposal
are partially motivated by fundamental mathematical questions and partially by
generic questions in other branches of science, such as chemical physics,
biology and engineering, where metastability is important.

Many problems arising from chemistry and physics involve rare but significant
exit events from the basin of attraction of stable states and transition events
between stable states. The transitions happen on a time scale much longer than
the intrinsic time scale of the dynamical system. These rare events are
important, for example in conformational changes of biomolecules, chemical
reactions and nucleation events during phase transitions. Even though, a large
body of work exists in the chemistry, physics and mathematics literature
addressing issues related to energy landscapes and metastability, this research
seeks to provide new insights about the effect of multiple scale features and
about issues involved in the design of algorithms. The PI will focus on a
rigorous mathematical development of moderate and large deviations as well as
efficient Monte Carlo methods via large deviations for systems that may have
metastability and multiple features.
