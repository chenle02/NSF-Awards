Thomas Moran and other members of the School of Chemistry and Biochemistry at
Georgia Institute of Technology are being supported to provide a Research
Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in chemistry. For the period 1996-98,
ten undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in
basic research projects drawn from the traditional areas of chemistry and
biochemistry. Participants are recruited nation-wide, with many coming from the
southeastern U. S. In addition to individual research projects, students make
oral presentations and participate in regular research conferences which
acquaint them with the work in other summer projects.
