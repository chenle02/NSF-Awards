The research is on fundamental studies of superconductivity and magnetism in
layered materials. The superconductivity studies emphasizes anomalous behavior
in the temperature and angular dependence of the upper critical field in
superconducting graphite interacalation compounds. The magnetic studies
emphasize a direct observation of magnetic vortices using a spin-sensitive
scanning tunneling microscope, high field magnetization and susceptibility
measurements. Materials studied include ionic fluoride graphite intercalation
compounds, boron nitride intercalation compounds, and dilute magnetic
superlattices. The principal investigator has trained a large number of graduate
students inn the area of research. She is classified a world leader in the topic
of the research by her peers.
