9527663 SNIDER In situ observations of collembolan populations in the root zone
of Michigan agroecosystems have provided reliable evidence that conventional
sampling methods severely underestimate population densities and cannot
adequately document vertical distribution and activity of Collembola throughout
the root profile. Evidence from microvideo recordings indicates that Collembola
range to depths of &gt;100 cm in large numbers, and that collembolan and root
demographics may be correlated over space and time. Based on data which suggest
the existence of much larger populations than previously estimated (populations
which persist and are active throughout the water), the PIs propose that the
magnitude of collembolan influence on carbon cycling may also have been
underestimated. This project will quantify the demographics of Collembola / root
associations in the field, and document potential mechanisms underlying these
associations. In addition, the work will assess potential effects of collembolan
activity in the root zone on carbon flow through below-ground trophic networks.
The work is directly linked to ongoing NSF/LTER research at Kellogg Biological
Station, which focuses on ecological properties of natural and managed
ecosystems, and on the mechanisms which regulate interactions in these systems.
The research will also add significantly to current understanding of below-
ground interactions, by documenting distribution and activity of a major soil
faunal component, the nature of its association with roots and rhizospheres, and
the magnitude of its effect on carbon cycling within below-ground trophic
networks.
