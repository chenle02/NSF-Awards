9357496 Trumble This research is directed towards the liquid phase processing of
advanced metal-ceramic composites. Poor wetting hampers the processing of many
composite systems. Although interfacial chemical interactions are thought to
promote wetting, systematic studies of their effects and associated
microstructural development are lacking. Reaction-driven wetting is studied
using the sessile drop technique. Infiltration of liquid metals into porous
ceramics is included in the research. The role of chemical interactions in
wetting phenomena is examined through critical experiment coupled with direct
interfacial characterization using electron microscopy. %%% The knowledge
generated in this program is fundamental to the understanding of the properties
of metal-matrix composites. This understanding can be applied to tailoring the
properties of these technologically useful materials. ***
