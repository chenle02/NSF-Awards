The objective of this research project is to develop a low cost sensor array
system, based on current state-of-the-art technology of fiber optic and MEMS
sensors, for real-time monitoring of ground motion and ground failures such as
liquefaction and slope instability through down-hole measurement. It is expected
that the new sensor system will be able to measure 3D ground deformation and 2D
soil accelerationdown to a depth of 40 meters. Each sensor array will be
connected to a wireless node to anble remote sensor
configuration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This multidisciplinary team research will be
conducted by RPI investigators in collaboration with Caltrans and Army Corp of
Engineers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sensing system would enable a better
understanding of ground failure mechanisms and provide an advance sensing tool
for geotechnical monitoring. The research outcome will be integrated into the
undergraduate curriculum and hands-on sensing module will be introduced to a
number of engineering courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a small team project
under NSF 03-512.&lt;br/&gt;
