Theoretical and numerical studies are to be conducted on flows of viscoelastic
fluids. These fluids are common in the processing of polymeric and other
industrially important materials. The focus here is on the propagation of stress
waves and the time evolution of instabilities. Rotational couette flow and flow
through an extruder will serve as test cases for more accurate, numerically,
stable, and efficient computational algorithms to be developed.
