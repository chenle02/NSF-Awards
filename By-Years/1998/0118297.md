AST-0118297&lt;br/&gt;Lubin, Philip M.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The White
Mountain Research Station (WMRS) Barcroft Observatory site will be used make
measurements of the polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation
(CMB) in order to assess the site for its usefulness for mm and submillimeter
wavelength astronomy and to perform cutting edge original scientific research on
a very important aspect of CMB: its polarization. Measurements of the amplitude
and spatial distribution of CMB polarization along with its correlation with the
temperature anisotropy will provide profound information about the structure,
evolution and ionization history of the University. Assessing the site, which
looks very promising, will open up a US mainland site for sub-submillimeter wave
astronomy enabling less expensive site visits than now possible using off-shore
observatories and thus enable its frequent scientifically productive use by
students. &lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
