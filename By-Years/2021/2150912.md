The broader impact of this SBIR Phase I project is to improve education and
experiential learning. The proposed tool will support both synchronous and
asynchronous learning while providing students with the opportunity to engage
independently and connect their learning to internships, job shadows, service
projects, and other real-world learning experiences. This project will enhance
teacher capacity to guide and assess student learning, increase transparency and
objectivity in assessment, and expand the learning ecosystem of schools by
empowering students to engage in and validate authentic, real-world learning
experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
Phase I project will develop a novel competency-based evaluation tool and
learner recommendation engine designed to: assess a range of currently needed
skills and competencies, aggregate assessment data for the purpose of generating
a comprehensive learner record in real time, and generate personalized
competency pathways and recommendations for learning and growth. The key
intellectual merits of this proposal are the formulas used to aggregate
assessment data over time and the algorithms used to generate personalized
competency pathways and learner recommendations. The technical challenges are
the development and testing of the associated algorithms to guide and evaluate
learning in both academic and authentic, real-world contexts. Research conducted
during this Phase I project enable testing and refining of the data aggregation
formulas utilized by the assessment tool, as well as optimization of the learner
recommendation algorithms used for the creation of personalized competency
pathways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
