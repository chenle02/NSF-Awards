The PI plans to establish new results concerning geometric and dynamical
properties of special subsets of the representation variety of a finitely
generated group into a semisimple Lie group. Besides classical methods from
differential geometry, rigidity theory and algebraic groups, new techniques from
continuous bounded cohomology will be employed in an essential way. The project
builds upon previous joint work with M. Burger and A. Iozzi,in which the bounded
Kaehler class, a second continuous bounded cohomology class, was used, both, to
establish rigidity results for Zariski dense representations of arbitrary
finitely generated groups into Lie groups of Hermitian type, as well as to
define and study connected components of the representation variety of a surface
group, which give generalizations of Teichmueller space. One part of the project
concerns the study of refined geometric properties of surface group
representations in these special components, of parametrizations similar to
Fenchel-Nielsen or shear coordinates on Teichmueller space, and of the explicit
relations between these generalized Teichmueller spaces and the moduli spaces of
Higgs bundles and of locally homogeneous geometric structures on the surface. In
a second part of the project, methods and techniques used in the study of the
bounded Kaehler class will be extended to define and investigate bounded
cohomology classes in higher degree, which are expected to give rise to new
rigidity phenomena and structural results about representations into other
semisimple Lie groups.

Symmetries arise everywhere in nature and are very important in biology,
chemistry, physics and mathematics. Mathematically one way to study symmetries
is to consider symmetry groups, that is groups of transformations preserving the
given symmetries. Patterns with many symmetries are often optimal configurations
and as such stable or rigid, because small deformations or changes destroy the
symmetry. Sometimes patterns with symmetries arise in families and form so
called "moduli spaces"; then, small or even large deformations do not break
symmetry even though they change the pattern. In this project both phenomena are
detected and studied using a special measurement for the geometric complexity of
objects, which depends only on their symmetries.
