This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses the long-
standing UV sensitivity problem in CCDs. UV quantum efficiency (QE) could be
improved by attaching a `UV screen` to the face of the CCD that would also
provide visible rejection. Research would focus on preparation and evaluation of
the screen, which would be fabricated from a lumogen-coated dichroic mirror. A
back-illuminated CCD with the UV screen attached could achieve nearly 50% QE
from 200 to 400 nm.
