Research Infrastructure: Acquisition of a Distributed Computation and Immersive
Visualization Environment for Complex Systems This Academic Research
Infrastructure award supports the acquisition of a high speed SMD computing
system operating at a peak speed of approximately 15 GFLops. The research
projects supported by the equipment include: 1. The computational study of
gravitational instabilities in realistic protostellar disks. 2. The
computational study of collisional stellar systems. 3. Gravitational lensing. 4.
Schrodinger equations for molecules. 5. Sedimentary basin and whole planet
evolution modeling. 6. Quantum chromodynamics. 7. Global illumination
simulations of complete, large scale structures (bridges, etc.).
