9504434 This project will obtain a series of upper ocean current profiles from
the acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) permanently mounted on the hull of
the German icebreaking research ship Polarstern. The data will be obtained from
the Eurasian Basin of the Arctic Ocean in the summer of 1995. The project has
two specific objectives: to measure the spatial distribution of the background
and the internal wave shear with sufficient horizontal coverage to identify
possible sources and dissipation regions for internal wave energy, and to
document the distribution of Atlantic Intermediate Water within the Eurasian
Basin and modified surface water on the arctic continental shelf. The resulting
information will allow a substantial improvement in our understanding of how
internal waves, through shear-induced turbulence, affect the arctic oceanic heat
budget. A better understanding of the circulation processes in the eastern
Arctic Ocean will clarify interactions between the oceanic and the global
climate, and provide information required to parameterize and to tune global
circulation models currently being used to study climate change. ***
