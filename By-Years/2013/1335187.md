The overarching goal of this research is to explore the relationship of economic
vulnerability, resilience, and recovery in selected communities of the three
coastal counties of Mississippi (Harrison, Hancock and Jackson). This project
will compare vulnerability and resilience of these communities at finer scales
of analysis (i.e. parcel and household level) than has been accomplished in past
research. This project will: 1) identify factors contributing to spatial and
temporal variations in vulnerability and resilience; 2) estimate errors in
vulnerability and resilience assessments by comparing their results at different
scales of analysis; and 3) identify variables that contribute to the recovery of
these communities after disasters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this
analysis will help answer why communities with similar socio-economic
compositions and facing identical disasters have different vulnerabilities and
recovery rates. The results of this research will directly benefit Gulf Coast
communities in their efforts to increase their resilience towards tropical
cyclones by providing insight into best and worst practices in mitigation
policy. Other benefits of this project include: 1) increasing local
participation in decision making regarding tropical cyclones; 2) aiding local
policy makers in the design and deployment of effective mitigation and economic
development policies; 3) complementing local efforts to increase community
resilience; (4) developing game-based educational tools to increase student
participation in research; (5) constructing a web-based Spatial Decision Support
System that will provide a venue for local participation in decision-making; and
(6) disseminating research outcomes through community outreach, conferences, and
scientific publications.
