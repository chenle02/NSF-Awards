The Laser Electro-Optics Technology Department enhances its curriculum by
developing a Lightwave Communications Laboratory. With the advent of the
information superhighway, the Telecommunications Reform Act of 1996, and the
tremendous growth in the fiber-optics industry over the past 5 years, there will
be a dramatic increase in the demand for technicians educated in lightwave
communications. According to a recent Federal study, the demand for technicians
educated in photonics, which includes lightwave communications, will double to
740,000 by the year 2000. The new laboratory addresses this need through the
development of a state-of-the-art Lightwave Communications Laboratory. The
laboratory contains two workstations, each equipped with a high-speed integrated
optical modulator and support hardware, a fusion splicer, an optical timedomain
reflectometer (OTDR), a fiber-optic attenuation test set, a fiber-optic fault
locator, and a fiber-optic termination kit. The stations can be designed to
emulate a real-world fiber-optic communication system, capable of transmitting
analog and digital information at rates of up to 2.5 Ghz through several
kilometers of both single-mode and multimode fiber. With the opportunity to gain
hands-on experience with an actual working lightwave communication system,
students are significantly better prepared to pursue careers in the rapidly
growing field of photonics, telecommunications, or research and development or
to continue their studies at the 4-year college and university level. *
