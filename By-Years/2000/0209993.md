Munroe 0209993

This is a proposal submitted by Dr. Jeffrey Munroe, Middlebury College, to
request a planning visit to the Qinghai and Tibetan Plateau, China, to collect
information for developing a cooperative study with Lanzhou University on late
Pleistocene glaciation. This is an important topic for understanding the amount
of water tied up in glacial ice. This visit can also provide a unique
opportunity to two American investigators early in their career to visit the
plateau and to enrich their knowledge of Asian continental glaciation with
first-hand observations.
