9510390 Williams The 13th International Conference on Defects in Insulating
Materials will be held July 15-16, 1996 at Wake Forest University. The
Conference will focus on wide-gap materials and their defects in bulk and
interface regions. A wide range of scientific and technological topics will be
covered. The scientific sessions will feature theoretical (computational)
methods and experimental techniques for understanding defect physics.
Ferroelectric memory materials, gate insulators, blue diode laser materials, and
fiber optics are some of the technological problems to be discussed. %%% The
