Although bacteriophages are the most numerous biological entity on Earth and are
profoundly important for ecology, evolution and pathogenesis, far less is known
about their genomics than for bacteria. This project by Drs. Ry Young and Carlos
Gonzalez of Texas A and M University has two inter-dependent thrusts, one in
basic science addressing this significant deficit in phage genomics, and one
educational. The educational component is the established Program in Genomics
for Undergraduates (PGU), established in 2001 at TAMU with prior NSF-USDA
support. The scientific focus is to annotate 120 genomes of bacteriophages
infectious for diverse environmental bacterial genera: Burkholderia,
Rhodococcus, Xylella, Desulfovibrio, and Acinetobacter. The hosts in each of
these genera were selected because of their environmental importance, i.e.
causing plant, animal or human disease or causing corrosion. Genomic information
about the phage of these various hosts may prove useful in biocontrol
strategies. Comparative genomics of the phage genomes will also examine
evolution of the genomes and evidence for lateral gene transfer events. Much of
the laboratory work isolating phage from environmental samples and completing
and annotating the phage genomic sequences is being done by the undergraduate
participants of the PGU. The activities of the PGU include a lecture-laboratory
course, Practical Genomics, which is open to junior and senior students in the
life science majors. A significant fraction of the students in these courses are
students from under-represented minority groups. The course provides lectures on
the basics of bacteriophage biology and the fundamentals of genomics but also
focuses on practical aspects of modern high-throughput DNA sequencing and the
tools of genome annotation. The students are conducting the experiments and
annotate the phage genomes in the context of this course. Many of the students
will prepare manuscripts for publication.
