Novae, dwarf novae, novae-like stars are all thought to be pairs of stars in
which a "main sequence" star is slowly expanding and transferring some of its
matter onto an orbiting "white dwarf." The heating of fresh hydrogen from the
first star results in thermonuclear reactions on the white dwarf's surface,
leading to a vast class of rapid brightenings we observe as nova-type stars.
Many astronomers are trying to understand whether each of these systems is the
same type of object in a different stage of evolution or whether they are
fundamentally different types of objects. In this two-year study the Principal
Investigator (PI) and a student will monitor a dozen binary stars that have
under- gone nova eruptions in the past to examine the periods and other orbital
characteristics that would lead to improved estimates of these stars' masses and
radii. This is expected to double the number of stars for which these
fundamental parameters are known and to permit a better estimate to be made of
the distribution of their periods. The PI anticipates that this study will
contribute to resolving whether nova undergo rapid mass transfer events followed
by little exchanges between the two stars over longer times. A resolution of
this issue will help determine whether novae, dwarf novae, and nova-like systems
are the same system merely observed in different stages of evolution. This is an
award under the auspices of the NSF's Research for Undergraduate Institutions
program and is expected to contribute to the scientific instruction of graduate
and undergraduate students at the PI's institution.
