The purpose of this travel grant is to increase participation at the 2013
International Workshop on Software Engineering for Computational Science and
Engineering Workshop, taking place in Conjunction with the International
Conference on Software Engineering 2013. The grant will increase the amount and
diversity of participation from the Software Engineering and Computational
Science/Engineering communities, help nurture interactions, synergies and
collaborations involving the two communities, and help build the next generation
of knowledgeable researchers and practitioners working on software development
to sustain and advance software for computational science and engineering. The
funds will support faculty and students, with attention to underrepresented
groups.
