Aerosol particles in the marine boundary layer and free troposphere impact the
global solar radiation balance, both directly through radiation backscatter and
indirectly as cloud condensation nuclei. This project will use individual-
particle methods to examine tropospheric processes that affect aerosol- particle
size distribution, concentrations, and chemical compositions. Primary focus will
be on the marine boundary layer and stratocumulus clouds that cap that layer in
the remote areas of the South Pacific. Analyses will be performed with automated
electron-beam instruments, especially the new scanning electron microscope.
Methods developed by this research group over the past decade allow the study of
large numbers of particles by quantitative determination of composition and
morphology. The data from this research will be used to address current issues
in atmospheric aerosol research, including (a) the generation, fractionation,
and reaction of marine aerosol particles; (b) production of natural, non-sea-
salt sulfate particles; (c) partitioning of aerosol particles between droplets
and interstitial air in marine stratocumulus clouds; (d) cloud processing of
aerosol particles; and (e) evolution of aerosols during long-range transport in
the marine troposphere. As a ancillary task, the structure and composition of
complex supermicron to submicron particles will be investigated a high spatial
resolutions using transmission electron microscopy, both by imaging and by
chemical analysis. Transmission electron microscopy also makes possible the
examination of reactions involving nitrate and ammonia in submicron individual
particles. The proposed studies, taken together, will provide fine-scale data
about a wide range of particle types that occur in the marine troposphere and
that affect radiation backscatter and the microphysical properties of clouds.
