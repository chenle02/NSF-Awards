With the support of the Organic Dynamics Program in the Chemistry Division,
Professor Dmitry Rudkevich of the University of Texas- Arlington proposes to
synthesize and investigate the activity of encapsulating chemical cages that
trap nitrogen oxide species and can be manipulated through chemical design to
catalyze reactions of environmental and biological significance. Professor
Rudkevich proposes to use a series of calixarene-NO+ compounds as novel
nitrosating agents for organic synthesis. The decreased reactivity of
encapsulated NO+ will be used to achieve selective nitrosation. He will also
examine the reactivity and rates of encapsulating nitrosating reagents in
stereoselective and regioselective reactions with a series of alcohols, thiols,
and amides. A systemic approach will be used to gain information on the
reactivity and selectivity of new and modified reagents. It is anticipated that
these principles will help in the rational design of specific catalyst with
future applications to industrial and pharmaceutical syntheses.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports Professors
Dmitry Rudkevich of the University of Texas- Arlington who will demonstrate
useful applications of NOx which is known to be a significant air pollutant. If
the stated goals are achieved, Professor Rudkevich will expand the knowledge
currently available in the field of calixarenes and nanotubes. The experimental
and theoretical tools that will be used will give students exposure and hands-on
experience in modern synthetic chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;
