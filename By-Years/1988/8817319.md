Mechanisms of mitosis will be studied in sea urchin eggs treated at metaphase
with 10 mM caffeine to produce large monasters. These monasters are, in effect,
mitotic spindles turned inside out, and because of their size and configuration,
they provide many novel ways of exploring the mitotic process. The primary
objectives of the proposed research are: 1) To characterize the model system and
compare it with equivalent normal bipolar division stages, 2) To examine the
transition from one aster system to another, and 3) To compare chromosome
movements, especially away from the aster center with congression of chromosomes
at the metaphase plate in normal division. Methods will include light microscopy
of living eggs as well as fixed and stained sections, low light level time-lapse
video recording of fluorescently labeled living eggs, and electron microscopy.
The results should provide some insight into mitotic mechanisms as well as
address the more general problem of how a cell is able to restructure its
tubulin cytoskeleton in response to an internal or external stimulus.
