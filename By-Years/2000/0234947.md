With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
(CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at Louisiana State University will
upgrade a 400 MHz solid-state NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will enable
researchers to carry out research in a number of areas: a) molecular
interactions of pesticides, toxics with soil; b) characterization of novel
polymer materials; c) characterization of organic sorbents in sediments; and d)
studies on the structure of fibrils formed by protein self-
assembly.&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most
powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of
molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific
arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of
interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR
spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research.
The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in environmental and
materials chemistry and biotechnology. &lt;br/&gt;
