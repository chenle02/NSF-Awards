Proposal Title: Leadership Workshops and Graduate Student Travel Grant

Principal Investigator: Hratch G Semerjian Institution: Council for Chemical
Research

Proposal No: CBET-0827100

This award supports a pair of leadership workshops at the Council for Chemical
Research annual meeting on April 27-29, 2008. One is for approximately 20
graduate students from Chemistry and Chemical engineering Departments at U.S.
universities, with emphasis on underrepresented groups and those from minority-
serving institutions. The other is for incoming chairs of such departments for
them to develop their own respective leadership styles. Specifically the award
supports the engagement of facilitators and the travel of the graduate students
to attend their workshop and the annual meeting.

The theme of the annual meeting is 'Chemical Research at the Crossroad: The
Impact of Globalization on Innovation, Competitiveness, and Education'.
