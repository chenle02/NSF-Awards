The Chesapeake Community Modeling Program (CCMP) seeks to improve modeling tools
and related resources specific to the Chesapeake Bay, its watershed, and
connected environmental systems by fostering collaborative open source research.
Toward this end, the CCMP is convening the third bi-annual Chesapeake Modeling
Symposium as a venue to identify and showcase existing modeling efforts as well
as communicate how models are used as decision support tools by different
developer and user groups. Environmental models are increasingly taking on
higher profile roles in the management process. The 2012 Chesapeake Modeling
Symposium will attempt to shed light on emerging concerns and conflicts as they
relate to regulatory thresholds and the environmental models that are used to
set them, focusing on topics such as understanding, communication, and
credibility. By bringing together modelers, managers, scientists, and
stakeholders for a series of plenary talks, panel discussions, and special
sessions, they hope to highlight the unique issues and concerns of each of these
groups and provide a venue for open dialogue that will hopefully lead to greater
understanding and adoption of these and other models.
