Proposal Title: Spin dependent transport properties of semiconducting
nanostructures

John Philip, The Catholic University of America

The objective of this research is to explore methods to improve the efficiency
of carrier spin transport through ferromagnet/semiconductor device structures.
The approach is to reduce the depletion region in a ferromagnet/semiconductor
interface and tune the interface resistance-area product for achieving large
spin transport for realizing practical devices. This approach is explored on
technologically important semiconducting channels such as silicon, germanium and
semiconductors with low-band-gap and large spin-orbit coupling.

Intellectual Merit: In order to design and fabricate high-performance
semiconductor spintronic devices, a novel technique to tune the interface
resistance of the ferromagnet/semiconductor tunnel contacts using a thin layer
of non-magnetic, low-work-function layer is explored. This approach allows
exploration of suitable low-work-function materials for manipulating interface
properties and novel device designs to achieve efficient semiconductor-based
spin electronics.

Broader Impacts: This research will establish a new direction with significant
impact on the field of spin electronics and thus make possible new generations
of novel devices with multi-functionalities. The advantages of spin-based
devices include low power consumption, high storage density and transistors with
low leakage currents and switching energies. The integrated educational and
outreach component of this research will provide novel content for new courses
in nanotechnology, hands-on learning opportunities for undergraduate and
graduate students as well as District of Columbia high school students and
teachers, especially for the large population of minority and under-represented
students. This program also covers diverse aspects of science and engineering
including semiconductor processing, device design and fabrication and ultra-high
vacuum techniques that are essential for a technology-based economy.
