Abstract

Award: DMS-0607956 Principal Investigator: Christopher G. Connell, David M.
Fisher, Matthias Weber

The Bloomington Geometry Workshop brings together leading geometers to discuss
and disseminate recent advances in geometry and related fields. This year's list
of speakers includes Denis Auroux, Manfred Einseidler, Nikolai Ivanov, Gregory
Margulis and Juan Souto. These speakers will inform participants of work in
symplectic geometry, dynamics on homogeneous spaces and applications to number
theory, rigidity theory, hyperbolic geometry and Teichmuller theory.

The purpose of the Workshop is to help foster cooperation and collaboration
among researchers in the midwest region as well as help educate graduate
students and young researchers about the latest developments in geometry. Most
of the funding will be used to support the travel of graduate students and
recent PhD's. These young researchers will come away from the workshop better
prepared to take part in current research in geometry, a field of basic research
that is important to computer graphics, quantum physics, material science, and
many other scientific disciplines.
