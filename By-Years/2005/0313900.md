Plants first inhabited land approximately 450 million years ago. The
adaptations in plant form that accompanied the movement of plants to land have
been well studied. Much less is known about the physiological changes or
adaptations that accompanied this important event. This project will focus on
the origin of the small heat shock protein family in plants, and the question of
whether diversification in these small heat shock proteins was associated with
movement onto land. All organisms have a heat shock response. Heat shock
proteins are produced when organisms are exposed to high temperatures and,
through interactions with other proteins, the heat shock proteins enable
organisms to withstand and survive high-temperature stress. In land plants the
small heat shock proteins are a particularly important component of the heat
shock response, making up the bulk of the protein produced during heat shock.
Compared to the small heat shock proteins of other organisms, the plant small
heat shock proteins are also unusually diverse. Using cDNA cloning and PCR
techniques the PI will examine the small heat shock protein genes of Charophytes
(a group of algae) and Bryophytes (hornworts, liverworts, and mosses; the most
ancient lineages of land plants). The PI will determine if the small heat shock
proteins increased in number and changed in amino acid sequence during the time
period that plants first inhabited land. This POWRE award will enable Dr. Waters
to continue her independent research career and to attend to family needs by
supporting her as a visiting scientist at the University of California, San
Diego.
