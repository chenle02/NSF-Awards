The measurement of G, the Newtonian constant of Gravitation, is a long standing
problem which continues to provide a challenge to our scientific creativity.
Today's nearly 1% discrepancy between the recent PTB (Physikalisch-Technische
Bundesanstalt) measurement and the `accepted` value of G is of considerable
interest to experimental physics and the world of standards. The fact that the
PTB measurement appears to be competently and thoughtfully done makes the
discrepancy even more intriguing. A new free-fall approach (using g to measure
G) will be used. In this experiment, an FG5 absolute gravimeter is to be
employed in connection with a movable 1200 lb. Tungsten mass that surrounds the
dropping chamber. Little g is measured when the surrounding mass is located
above the FG5's dropping region and then when it is located below the dropping
region. The 80 micro-gal difference in these two measurements together with the
geometry of the surrounding mass can be used to determine G. A preliminary
(proof-of- concept) experiment using a 200 lb. Mass has already been carried
out. This follow-on experiment is expected to result in an accuracy for G of
better than 5 parts in 10,000.
