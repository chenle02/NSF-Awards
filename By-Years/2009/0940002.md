This award supports an Organizational Communication and Information Systems
(OCIS) Doctoral Colloquium at the 2009 Academy of Management (AOM) Annual
Meeting to be held August 7-12, 2009 in Chicago, IL. The OCIS division within
the AOM conference brings together researchers in the areas communications and
information systems and issues related to the contemporary information-based
society. The focus of the OCIS Doctoral Consortium is the intellectual content
of the students' doctoral dissertations. These represent cutting edge research
in the field of organizational communication and information systems. The OCIS
doctoral consortium brings together highly talented students and several senior
researchers, facilitating the development of a social network that will play a
major role in the career success of new researchers. Since both faculty and
students are diverse on several dimensions (research topics, methodological
approaches, national and cultural background), the students' horizons are
broadened at a critical stage in their professional development.
