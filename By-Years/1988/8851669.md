This project enhances this institution's already existing materials laboratory
by incorporating: a PC-based multi-channel stress-strain-temperature data
acquisition and display system that permits more insightful student analysis of
material response to static and low-frequency dynamic loading; and, integrating
a CCTV display system with an inverted metallograph and other optical equipment,
permitting classroom demonstration and group laboratory examination of
microstructures and fracture surfaces. This award is being matched by an equal
sum from the grantee.
