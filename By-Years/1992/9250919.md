A formal real-time signal processing laboratory is being developed. Laboratory
facilities will include DSP development systems, PCs, data acquisition systems,
and spectrum analyzers. Laboratory facilities will be utilized primarily by
students in four undergraduate courses: digital signal processing, biomedical
signal processing, speech processing, and senior design honors work. Students
are provided with a guided design experience and are exposed to practical signal
processing problems and important technologies for implementing real-time
digital signal processing systems.
