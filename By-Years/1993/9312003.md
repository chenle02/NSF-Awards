9312003 Silberschatz The use of data at different levels of information content
is essential to the performance of very large databases because lower
information content (or lower resolution) data is smaller and thus can
significantly decrease I/O and communication costs. The ability to trade query
response resolution for faster performance has been suggested as an approach to
meeting real-time performance constraints. These two performance advantages of a
multiresolution system can be exploited fully only by a database management
system (DBMS) that supports the convenient retrieval of data at different levels
of resolution. A data model that defines and supports the notions of
multiresolution and incremental improvement of query responses, or "progressive
refinement," is constructed. The basis of this model is a new construct, called
the "sandbag," for representing imprecise information about a set. Practical,
efficient algorithms that implement the sandbag, and thus enable a
multiresolution DBMS, are developed. An extended query language that specifies
the tradeoff of resolution for performance, and a mechanism for implementing
such queries, are also developed. This research will provide solutions which
effectively balance performance and cost for the information-processing
challenges of next generation database applications such as multimedia,
scientific, geographic, and other very large databases. ***
