The primary goal of the US Ignite Initiative is to break a fundamental deadlock:
there is insufficient investment in gigabit applications that can take advantage
of advanced network infrastructure because such infrastructure is rare and
dispersed. And conversely, there is a lack of broad availability of advanced
broadband infrastructure for open experimentation and innovation because there
are few advanced applications and services to justify it. US Ignite applications
are focused on national priority areas of advanced manufacturing, clean energy
and transportation, cyber learning, health IT, and public safety/emergency
preparedness. Many of the applications under development in this program build
on NSF-funded advanced networking and computational infrastructure developed as
part of the NSF GENI program. All of the projects demonstrate the value of
advanced networking. This project supports the 3rd annual US Ignite Application
Summit, an event that will demonstrate the next generation applications
currently being developed, educate a broad community on the potential for next-
generation application capabilities and recruit cities and individuals for the
next round of application development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Applications
Summit is being held March 24-25, 2015 at George Washington University's Marvin
Center in Washington, DC and the Hilton Crystal City Hotel in Arlington, VA. Co-
location with the GENI Engineering Conference (GEC 22) and meetings of the Open
Grid Forum (OGF) and Global Lambda Integrated Facility (GLIF) will maximize the
potential for advancing technology, education, and outreach. This project
supports academic and student participation in the Summit, along with the costs
of hosting the event and broadly disseminating its results throughout the
advanced networking research and gigabit application development communities.
