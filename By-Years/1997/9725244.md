9725244 Raimi A mathematician at the University of Rochester is investigating
the history of the mathematics education reform efforts during the period
1958-1974, which are known as "The New Math". The research addresses a number of
questions, including: What were the intentions of the reformers, i.e. what sorts
of classrooms, curricula, teachers, and teaching methods did they envision? To
what degree did the intentions of the reformers succeed and which failed? To
what degree could their intentions have better succeeded had they used different
strategies and to what degree was their project hopeless? What residue was left
after the reform effort ended? Does the "New Math" experience have useful
implications for current and future efforts at reform in mathematics education?
