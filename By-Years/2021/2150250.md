This project is funded from the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU)
Sites program in the Directorate for Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences.
This REU program has both scientific and societal benefits, integrating research
and education. This project will train undergraduate students from Minority
Serving Institutions (MSIs) with research opportunities and support their
placement in graduate studies programs. This 8-week summer program provides
eight students from underrepresented backgrounds with training in research
methods as well as research and mentorship opportunities. Students will focus
their research on US political economy and mobilization. Often referenced as the
key or conduit for the revitalization of US democracy, students will examine the
context, drivers, and consequences of mobilization and engagement in civic life.
Despite its importance, mobilization faces numerous barriers and challenges that
threaten the continuity of political engagement and the overall health of US
democracy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to deepen the demographic
and methodological diversity of graduate school applicants. Demographic and
methodological diversity are essential for advancing knowledge and understanding
issues broadly related to attitudes, behavior, and institutions connected to
public policy and the provision of public services. This project also engages in
research on strategies to 1) close the quantitative literacy gap in the social
sciences, 2) improve student preparation for graduate studies, and 3) enhance
their academic success. This program will develop open-access pedagogical
materials to improve quantitative skills and support the pedagogical training of
faculty and researchers involved in undergraduate methods
teaching.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
