Computational mechanism design has been highly successful in providing a
theoretical and practical framework for coordinated decision making in systems
with multiple, self-interested agents. A key property introduced within
mechanism design theory is that of "incentive-compatibility," namely that it is
an agent's best interest to truthfully reveal private information about its
preferences for different outcomes even in settings of strategic
interdependence. However, there has been relatively little attention given to
the use of incentive mechanisms for the purpose of coordinating computational
processes, where the inputs to the computation are distributed across agents.
The focus of this project is on the problem of incentive-compatible learning,
where the private information of agents represents "training data" and the
design goal is to allow the system to collectively learn from the distributed
experience that this information represents.

The research seeks mechanisms that promote learning with self-interested agents
that is just as effective as it would be with cooperative agents, and to
otherwise understand when this is not possible. It will provide a new bridge
between mechanism design theory and computer science. The research is centered
around three themes: (1) incentive-compatible reinforcement learning, where the
design goal is to quickly learn an optimal policy for the entire state space
when each agent has private information about the rewards for some subset of the
state space and may misreport them; (2) incentive-compatible supervised
learning, where each agent has private knowledge of a set of labeled training
examples and the design goal is to learn a hypothesis that minimizes global
error despite agents' ability to misreport training data; (3) incentive-
compatible information aggregation, where each agent has a subjective belief
about the probability of some uncertain events and participates in a mechanism
to capitalize on its information, and the design goal is to achieve online
aggregation of information despite the intrinsic self-interest of agents. This
project has the potential for broad spillover benefits to societal, engineering,
and business settings where learning is performed with self-interested agents.
