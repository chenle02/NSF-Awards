This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
will assist the Departments of Chemistry, Material Science, Physics and
Mechanical Engineering at Rice University acquire a SQUID Magnetometer. This new
instrumentation will greatly enhance research in the following areas: Dopyballs,
Buckytubes, and Fullerene Fibers, Perpendicular Magnetic Thin Film Studies,
Magnetochemical studies in Bioinorganic Chemistry, and Main Group
Element/Transition Metal Compounds, Clusters and Phases. Magnetism is a property
of a material arising from the force exerted on a system by a magnetic body
along with an electric field. The SQUID is used to measure very small currents
or voltages, which is useful to the understanding of the behavior of materials.
