9311089 Gul The activities of trade and exchange are fundamental to economics,
yet, until very recently, there was little research on perhaps the most pure
form of trading, i.e., bilateral bargaining. A research breakthrough, about a
decade ago, led to a flood of papers on this topic, all of which emphasized in
myriad variations, the role of the relative slight impatience of bargainers to
come to agreement, and the precise protocol of the bargaining process. This
theory has been widely and usefully applied in a variety of fields, including
industrial organization, international trade and finance, political economy,
macroeconomics, and so on. This project readdresses this basic question from a
new perspective and replaces the slight impatience between offers of the old
theory with slight uncertainty about the strategic posture of one's opponent.
That is, with small probability the other player may be one of many "irrational"
types. The message very crudely put is this: Bargaining isn't so much about
slight impatience and the exact protocol of offers and counteroffers; rather, it
is driven by such factors as bluffing and posturing of various sorts. In this
spirit, the model developed stresses reputational effects which both causal
empiricism and personal introspection suggest are important in bargaining. So
far this approach seems very promising, and some simple cases have been
completely analyzed. This project will extend these preliminary results to more
general settings. As noted, the earlier bargaining models have been fruitfully
applied in many areas; a reputation-based bargaining paradigm will be
potentially as useful. ***
