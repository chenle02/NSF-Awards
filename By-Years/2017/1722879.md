To understand the dynamics of Earth's interior and predict ground motions during
large earthquakes, seismologists use waves emitted from earthquakes to image
structures of the Earth. The traditional receiver function method, which uses
medium-size earthquakes thousands of kilometers away as sources, is a popular
tool in studying receiver-side discontinuities and depth of sedimentary basins.
This research aims to develop a new receiver function method that can take
advantage of the rise of dense seismic arrays with hundreds or even thousands of
sensors, to produce more detailed and reliable images of the Earth.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new receiver-function methodology aims to overcome the
limitations introduced by deconvolution at individual stations, by inverting for
full receiver function images directly from the waveforms recorded along a dense
profile. This approach will produce higher-resolution images because it makes
better use of available data and enhances coherent conversions. The researchers
will test this new method with available data to image subduction zones in
Middle and South America that can generate large or even mega-thrust
earthquakes. Additionally, the method will be applied to data collected in a
densely populated basin in southern California to better characterize possible
ground motions during future large earthquakes.
