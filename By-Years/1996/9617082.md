Abstract ATM-9617082 Moore, Berrien University of New Hampshire Title: Global
Analysis, Interpretation and Modeling (GAIM) This award is directed toward the
activities and office of the Global Analysis, Interpretation, and Modeling Task
Force (GAIM) of the International Geosphere Biosphere Program (IGBP). The GAIM
Office is housed in the Institute for the Study of Earth, Oceans, and Space at
the University of New Hampshire. The Goal of GAIM is to advance the study of the
coupled dynamics of the Earth system using as tools both data and models. The
challenge to GAIM is to initiate activities that will lead to the rapid
development and application of a suite of Global Prognostic Biogeochemical
Models. These Global Biogeochemical Models would subsequently be linked, partly
through hydrological coupling, to General Circulation Models, thereby providing
models of the Earth system. In order to make progress toward its goal, the Task
Force must analyze current models and data, interpret the capability of current
models and experimental programs against the demands for knowledge, and the
advance and synthesize our understanding of the global biogeochemical cycles and
their links to the hydrological cycle and more generally to the physical-climate
system as a whole. This award supports workshops, pilot modeling experiments
such as inter- comparisons, and base-level support of the GAIM Task Force
Office.
