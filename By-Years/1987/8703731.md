This research program investigates the solvability in the large of initial-
boundary value problems for two classes of third order systems of nonlinear
partial differential equations. These two classes of equations have been
proposed as more sophisticated models for ice mechanics which incorporates the
effects of primary and secondary creep of polycrystalline ice. The stability of
the solution of the initial-boundary value problem will also be analyzed. The
research results are expected to have a significant impact on glaciology and
Artic engineering,
