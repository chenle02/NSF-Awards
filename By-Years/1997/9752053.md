There is a technology gap in two-year agricultural technician education that
will continue to grow unless positive action is taken. Future graduates must be
prepared to enter an industry that is taking on global responsibilities; that is
confronting the problems of environmental pollution; that must remain
competitive in the worldwide marketplace; that requires more specialized
knowledge; and that is experiencing an accelerating rate of technological
change. These challenges require a higher level of mathematics, science, and
technology education than is currently offered. To address this technology gap,
the Technical Agriculture Association, an association of colleges, schools, and
programs, within land-grant institutions offering certificate and associate
degrees in technical agriculture, is holding a national conference to promote
significant improvements within agricultural technician education. This national
conference brings together stakeholders in advanced agricultural technology from
both the academic (research and education including secondary schools and two-
year colleges and universities) and employment sectors. Among the focus areas of
the conference are: (a) standards for associate degree technicians in
agricultural fields; (b) job descriptions of what technicians in these areas can
best do; (c) programs and curricula which currently exist on which these
programs can build; (d) common and distinct elements of programs for
agricultural technicians; (e) involvement of employers in curriculum
development, faculty and student development, and research; (f) what education
agricultural technicians need and who should provide it; (g) future needs for
technicians in evolving agricultural fields such as precision agriculture, and
(h) further educational opportunities for students with associate degrees in
agriculture.
