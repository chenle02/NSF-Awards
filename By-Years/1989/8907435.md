The principal investigator will analyse the dynamics of topological defects in
solutions of nonlinear field equations. These problems arise naturally in
various physical contexts. In particular, vortex dynamics in superconductors,
spiral waves in reaction-diffusion processes, grain boundaries and dislocation
defects in models of convection, and the dynamics of topological singularities
in nonlinear hyperbolic field theories of modern physics will be examined. The
methodology to be employed is that of multiple-scale analysis which exploits the
separaton of spatial scales multiple-scale analysis which that are instrinsic to
these problems: the distance between defects is taken as large compared to their
effective radii. This methodology has been successfully applied to the two-
dimensional nonlinear Schroedinger equation, nonlinear heat equation, and
nonlinear wave equation, and it is clear that their scope is sufficient to lead
to new and useful insights in the physical problems to be studied in this
project.
