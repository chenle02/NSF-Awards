This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) in Engineering program
entitled, "NUE: Nanomanufacturing for Energy and Biomedical Engineering", at
Drexel University under the direction of Dr. Ying Sun,seeks to develop an
interdisciplinary education and research training program in nanomanufacturing
to prepare the next generation of engineers to meet the challenges of
efficiently integrating nanoscale building blocks into functional micro devices
and meso/macroscale systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The interdisciplinary
education plan will better prepare the next generation of engineers to meet the
growing demand of economically fabricating nanostructure, multi-functional
devices and engineering systems with properties beyond what is currently
available. Direct impacts at Drexel include a new undergraduate technical
elective course targeting 30-40 students per year, lab teaching modules for the
required course sequence on Experimental Measurements impacting about 600
students per year, and intensive research opportunities for 10 students from the
College of Engineering, School of Biomedical Engineering, Science and Health
Systems, and College of Arts and Sciences. Broader impacts outside of Drexel
include publishing lab materials and course modules developed in this course,
creating a central library for nanomanufacturing technologies and applications,
introducing course modules into the curriculum at local community and four year
colleges. The community outreach programs extends to inner-city K-12 teachers
and students through the Philly Materials Science &amp; Engineering Day, Philly
Science Festival, and Girl Scouts of Eastern Pennsylvania in Science events.
