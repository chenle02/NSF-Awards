This award supports research in Elementary Particle Physics by Dr. Joey W.
Huston, a Presidential Young Investigator. Dr. Huston has been involved in the
design, construction, installation and running of the lead/liquid argon
calorimeter for an experiment (E706) at Fermilab. The data taken will allow one
of the best determination of the gluon structure function of hadrons and the
investigation of gluon fragmentation through analysing the production of direct
photons and their accompanying hadrons in collisions of pions, kaons and protons
with a variety of nuclear targets.
