In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry
Program of the Chemistry Division, George Gokel of the University of Missouri-
St. Louis studies the chemical interactions that are involved in binding and
transport of negatively charged species called anions, especially the complex
and important anions DNA and RNA. A simple class of compounds called "tris-
arenes", was found to bind to DNA and to mediate its transport through
biological membranes into cells. The approach in this work is to address the
fundamental chemical questions concerning the strength and selectivity of
binding, the dynamics and energetics of binding, the structure(s) of the
complexes formed, and the mechanisms of transport.

A particularly important impact of this work is the availability of these
chemical tools to biological researchers involved in gene therapy research. The
broader impacts of this project also involve training undergraduate students,
graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers, disseminating research results
through publications and presentations at national conferences.
