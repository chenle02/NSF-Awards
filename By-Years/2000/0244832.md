PROJECT SUMMARY

This is an investigation of the effect of electric fields on self-propagating
high-temperature synthesis (SHS) reactions using experimental and modeling
studies. It has three general thrusts: (a) the role of the field in mass
transport enhancement through electromigration (electron wind effect) and point
defect (vacancy) generation, (b) the effect of the field on the structure and
properties of functional materials, and (c) the modeling of electrically ignited
SHS reactions. The research provides an assessment of the effect of the field on
such processes as mass transport, product evolution, and structural and
microstructural development during combustion synthesis reactions. It separates
the thermal (extrinsic) effects from the intrinsic effects (e.g.,
electromigration, vacancy generation) of the field on these reactions. The
technological implications of the work include (a) the ability to synthesize
many materials systems which could not be prepared by unactivated SHS, (b) the
modification of the nature and properties of SHS products by influencing
composition and crystallite size (including nanomaterials), (c) the modification
of interfacial interactions in such applications as (layered) functionally
graded materials (FGMs) and thermal and chemical barrier coatings (TBCs and
CBCs), and (d) the energy savings available from a one-step synthesis and
densification of materials. Another relevant example is the recent demonstration
that dense nanometric materials can be synthesized by field activation.

Broader impacts

This is an investigation of the role of an electric field (current) in
combustion synthesis reactions. The work has both scientific and practical
implications. From a fundamental point of view, it aims at understanding the
nature of both the thermal and non-thermal contributions of a field to self-
propagating and other types of combustion reactions. From a practical point of
view, the research can lead to the use of a field as a processing parameter in
the synthesis of monolithic, composite, and functionally-graded materials. That
the field has a marked influence on the synthesis reactions of such materials
has been amply demonstrated by past work The field has been shown to have a
significant influence on the dynamics of wave propagation and on the mechanism
of synthesis, dictating the nature of the product phases and their homogeneity
and microstructure. Through the use of combined mechanical and field activation,
it has been shown that the synthesis of dense nanostructured materials is
feasible.
