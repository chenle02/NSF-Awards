The major objectives of this proposal are concerned with the study of nonlinear
parabolic equations related to degenerate and singular diffusion, in connection
with more complex problems of differential geometry, including the Gauss
curvature flow and the Ricci flow and with physical applications such as
diffusion in porous media and thin liquid film dynamics. One specific area which
will be investigated concerns with the regularity and geometry of interfaces in
degenerate diffusion: this long term project which was initiated in 1997, has
the objective of determining the connection between the geometry and regularity
of the interfaces in degenerate diffusion. Another specific area of the main
objectives concerns the study fast and super-diffusive nonlinear parabolic
problems: this project has the objective of studying several new important
phenomena related to the well-posedness and vanishing profile of solutions to
singular diffusion equations arising in physical applications and differential
geometry. In particular, it involves the study of the vanishing profile of the
maximal solutions to the Ricci flow and the geometric implications of these
results.

The non-linear equations to be studied under this proposal form the basic
concepts of many applications which deem to be important to technology and the
society at large. The purification of materials, from chemicals to petroleum and
even water, is often achieved by diffusion through filters. The purification
filters are the porous media described in the proposal. Thin film dynamics and
the Van der Waals forces operating between thin layers are described by singular
quasilinear equations of super-fast diffusion. The dynamics of population
growth, polymer chain growth, including cross linking and high rate growth of
biomolecules, are also non-linear phenomena amiable to our basic studies. The
interesting problem of the expanding universe and other cosmological phenomena
seem to be governed by nonlinear dynamics, which in certain cases are
applications of the more complex problems described here.
